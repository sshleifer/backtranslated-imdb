There are many so-called anti-war / anti-govt. Politics movie about now, starting as a mea culpa and ending with 'our bad boys getting hell out there, let the world sympathize with them, it's not their fault' - kind of thing. I was half afraid that this would be another in that style, even though it dealt with another topic / aspect of the same subject. I hardly went and saw it; for that matter, I hardly write this review. What did we get here? An Egyptian is being taken to a secret offshore torture center on US orders, but another Egyptian is going to torture, not an American: "See, we Americans have clean hands," and the Egyptians are badly much anyway so let them hurt their own. Oh, and the good had to be an American with a conscience: in fact, many Americans have them, but here the concept was wrong. Yes, we all know it's called extraordinary transfer, and it began in Clinton's time, and it is now being used for reasons far beyond control. Otherwise, it was very choppy and nervous to really condemn the United States for being a party to torture; as if the creators were afraid to go all the way for fear of being slanged as unpatriotic or anything (see a look at the message card! Any excuse gets a face of heavily verbal artillery). Torture is a terrible thing whether one is guilty or not; In the 18th century, FrederickII, King of Prussia, dismissed it for convicted murderers - though I have to say, a death sentence for a child molester is far less than I want to see. Okay, what about torture? This movie did not really give its horror and hopelessness. When you are under torture (now the capitals come to emphasize, I don't scream) You will say something even if it is not true, even if you have not done what you are prevented from hoping that if YOU SOMETHING, IF THEY ARE PEDDING, IT STOPS. IT IS NOT, BUT YOU NEVER LEARN AND YOU NOTE THAT YOU DID, IF IT IS, YOU ARE DID, THEM. "YOU DON'T GET. Another thing that the movie didn't take off enough was that torture is at all, unlikely to inhibit, and that the feeling is staying with you all your life. It somehow changes people inside. How do I know everything Don't ask. <br /> <br /> Re-edit: Two things: The Arabic used in the movie was not the Egyptian dialect, it's a little worse than making a movie in New Zealand with the locals As the characters and everyone have American accents, the awful little preacher, who tense his ignorant audience for violence, also told the things that were unknown to the religion that should have been brought out. become a mullah / imam, he does not need any special skills, and it is a hiatus to be addressed: many are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views, and in the great allies of the United States, Saudi Arabia, many of them finance. Many thanks for this room.
