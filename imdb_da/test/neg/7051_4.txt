It's a case of taking an adventure too far. The Enchanted Cottage supplies Dorothy McGuire as a "terribly ugly" spinster and Robert Young as a disfigured pilot. Long story short: Scarface marries Spinster, after which their love transforms them miraculously (lighting, cosmetics and the removal of false scars) to beautiful people. A magical change that they attach to the enchantment of living in a cottage that has been the residence of generations of honeymooners. <br /> <br /> If the story stopped there, fine; It would be a fable with a proverbial message: beauty is in the eyes of the guards. But it lurks forward and reaches reality. When Mr. and Mrs. Scarface welcomes their audience, it comes as a painful shock to them that they are still domestic. You see, they just look beautiful to each other ?? a situation that the public is well prepared for because all secondary characters have predicted that disadvantaged people really need to lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy. You know. Get hobbies up. Spinster does, for example. Wood cutting. Scarface is considering collecting driftwood. <br /> <br /> The original playwright (Arthur Wing Pinero) and the filmmakers have no faith in human nature. Their message is: You are either ugly or discreet, and no beautiful person will ever love an ugly one. What's even worse, ugly people apparently need to imagine their love so beautiful. The reality just won't do. <br /> <br /> You wonder what Elaine Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband, Stephen Hawking.
