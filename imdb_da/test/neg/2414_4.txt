It starts with a couple of scary sex comedy gags, but soon it reveals its true colors: it will be a "Death Wish" clone. I say "want" because the script becomes so eye-catching at the moment that it ends up as an absurdist "Death Wish" spoof! From a love scene in a room inexplicably filled with candles to "heroes" who dress as commands and wave their machine guns, because they do not want to attract attention to themselves (!) To evil who drive around the city in a black Vans long after it has been recognized as their vehicle, this movie has too many ridiculous points to fit in a list. The second major problem is that you can't tell most of the characters apart; Of course, you know who Borgnine and Roundtree and even James Van Patten are, but all the other roles could have been played by different actors in different scenes, and you wouldn't know the difference.
