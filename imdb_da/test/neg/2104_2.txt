Oh. Well. Grief. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie title in the TV schedules and thought, "I must watch this movie and tear off Snakes On A Plane, it will be terrible, but hopefully also ridiculous." Sounds really bad. "Well, I was half right. <br /> <br /> This movie is melting badly and unfortunately not even inadvertently fun. It's just bad. Worse still, it takes nearly an hour to get to something that In the first half of the movie, we have to endure some muttered foreign languages ​​(Mexican or Spanish, excuse my ignorance) and act horribly as a woman throws up live snakes for reasons we only find out later. even more horrible actions, and we find out that those who mumble at the foreign languages ​​can still speak English when the snakes finally break loose on the train, and it goes from the calming to the ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Low budget does not always mean "bad", but in this case it does. What we have here is a film that is not thought, a terrible script, a bad cast and not even a sense of capitalizing on it are very few forces. I give two marks for some decent special effects and a whacky finish, but it still feels a little too generous. Avoid if you can. <br /> <br /> See this if you like: Stagknight, The Wicker Man remake, horrible CGI.
