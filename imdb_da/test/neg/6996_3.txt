You could see the final result from a mile away. All the signs were there ... prom, the liquid, the quick ride, the distraction of the women .... A good advertisement for seat belts and later model cars that sit passengers back from the windshield. Finally, the end is rather anti-climatic as Ford Econoline van hardly has a screw across its nose after hitting a high speed bridge (very unlikely). Much damage to the van has made it a bit more credible. And why do these movies always take place during / after a prom? Is it a case that when you survive prom, will you be good at life? More than anything else, it shows the lack of police prom for spirits and does not keep tabs on the MINORs who leave the dance to a joyride.
