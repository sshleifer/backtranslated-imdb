I also made a mistake thinking about seeing 2003 upstream with Geoffry Rush. This was worse than many student films I've seen. The script was forced, the play was subpar and editing was annoying. It was so slow that I just managed to force myself to stay. But I always give a movie a chance so I suffered until the end. Apparently there was a note about this movie because my friend and I were the only ones in the theater. Why didn't someone send me this note?!?! That's why I send as a warning to others who are thinking of shelling out good money to see this. I just hope that you actually came to this page and were not caught as I did by looking at the wrong "Swimming Upstream". P. S. Excuse the shooter and the crew if you read this. I know you've worked hard to do this. I know what is going on in making a movie ... keep trying!
