Firstly ... I have to say that acting is not very good. Miranda Cosgrove is the protagonist, but is not as good an actress honestly. Spencer, her brother is a way much better actor. Spencer is easily my favorite character because he is probably the only one who knows how to act. Carly on the other hand is trying to act out her heart but ... sorry, it's just not good. Sam doesn't even get credit, I mean to come ... Earl ... beautiful self centered eh? Freddy is not bad, I have no comment. I must add that Carly and her puppet Sam are changing their attitude every time they go to a webcast movie they go out of their lines. It's a kind of bad influence in a way because Carly has a web show and if the kids want to copy this, they can provide their own information and it's not quite safe. <br /> <br /> The only good thing is that it has some fun parts of the show that make it entertaining. At least this show is not boring, it has good plots, quite strong. Many children will like this because they are not looking for errors. <br /> All in all, this is a bad show, but it's not boring.
