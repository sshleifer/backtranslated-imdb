This is one of the strangest things on television. It is set in an exceptionally populated Midlands super-cold Leatherbridge, which seems to be the dumbest place in the country. It has a bar without visible staff or customers, a university without students, a police station without criminals, and a medical surgery with more doctors than patients. History's lines are gloomy - every episode revolves around a bizarre medical problem done by a number of humming extras that can never work, and for some reason the doctor always stops their house to solve their problem. Quite entertaining for its pure comedy value, but I can't believe that this thing was actually masquerading as a serious drama. Bonkers.
