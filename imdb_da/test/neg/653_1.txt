Renee Zellweger is brilliant, but the rest of this movie just doesn't work. It's like a hamburger jello mold salad - interesting idea, but who ever thought it would actually work on film? I like instructor LaBute's two previous films - they were mercilessly honest and chilling fun. This movie only manages to be relentless and chilling - with jumbo dolls of cutes. (As a high concept, think: Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie Sam Peckinpah could have made - now reduce your expectations to match the current mass-produced Hollywood state.) These actors as talented as Freeman, Kinnear, Eckhart, Vince, and Janney ALMOST gets their scenes to come alive, is a testament to their talents immensely that they rise above material that just isn't coherent. I would have found Freeman's corny, feel-good-about-yourself talk at the end of the movie fun (in a Lynchean way), if it wasn't for the sparkling suspicion that this compellingly stuck morality is supposed to be seriously accepted .
