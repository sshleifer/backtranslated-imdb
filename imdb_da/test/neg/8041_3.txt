I would think this was one of those films whose director hadn't read the book it was based on if it wasn't for the fact that they were just a little alike. It is certainly possible for a large movie to be "based" very loosely on a book, and it was certainly the latter, but not the former. There were a number of errors. One was that it tried to be too much like the railway children, probably because adults would expect it to be from the same author. Another is that it also tried to be like Harry Potter, down to the music and overemphasizing the setting. I have nothing against J K Rowling or the movies, but the book is just nothing like Harry Potter. I thought Psammead, although very well-spoken by Eddie Izzard and also in character, was almost free in a totally inappropriate environment. I may have missed something here, as the remarks about one of the book's own books may have been a reference to the inaccuracy of the adaptation. There was also no need for the extra characters, and today's special effects could easily have been used to tell the story as it was written, but they were not. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie with my two children, one of whom knows the book and the other doesn't have it. The one who knows it thought it was okay, but wasn't as enthusiastic as the one who doesn't. I'm not sure what that means.
