I absolutely love the stand-up comedy. I love to hear the healthy thoughts about stand-up on stage as they appeal to an audience of their peers different life experiences they've had or things they've thought up or seen that they just thought were so **** stupid that they had to share it with someone. <br /> <br /> There were stand-ups that took on a person that everyone could relate to (Rodney Dangerfield comes to mind) or was just so wild that you couldn't help but laugh with them as they laughed at others (Richard Pryor). And then there were the thoughtful comics like George Carlin, who despite being a wage, was the smartest guy in the room who appealed to people to think about things they saw as they walked around and realized how screwed Now it might not be something to do with "Mind Of Mencia", which I, as I agree with most commentators here, is Comedy Central's horrid solution to the loss of "Chappelle's Show", but it does. Carlos Mencia spends half of the show, making stand-up bits to his audience, sometimes on popular topics, most of the time on just racism and racial stereotypes. He tries to be all three of the above mentioned stand-ups. He makes a scene character, an everyday Mexican named Carlos, who, despite stereotypes, is just your run-of-the-mill normal guy. He then goes on trying to laugh at others, people he calls racist or just those who disagree with his opinion. And finally, he presents sketches for the study age and the viewer and tells them that it will help them see his point of view. Carlos Mencia always says that he shows a view that people do not see, but what he really does is not only to promote racist stereotypes that already exist and have been haunted to death, but he stupidly encourages people to hear them And do the only thing that helps keep them around: laugh. /> <br /> Promoting stereotypes is usually the lowest, yet simplest way to get laughter in stand-up. The best comedians I fear, Carlos Mencia thinks he is in good company, need not resort to them. They speak universally and ask you to laugh at absurdity, rather than what Mencia encourages. As he creates more sketches or "real" situations that require racism or bases by others using it, he tells us rather than ask us to laugh and actually present these absurdities as truth rather than just extremes of it. <br /> <br /> His show is an insult to the minds of those who see it. Mencia does not give us comedy and ask us to digest it and take it away from what we want (something that, as much as I hate to compare the two, was "Chappelels Show's" finest quality) he tells us exactly how we must see it and respond to it --- which according to him is to make a stupid face and say "Dee Dee Dee!" This show is appropriately named. It's really a show about "The Mind of Mencia." It is Mencia's mind through and through, and as such, nothing but stupid entertainment. The show is tailored to give life lessons to its core album, 14-24 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but racial bashing is okay for Carlos Mencia, and therefore it should be okay for you!
