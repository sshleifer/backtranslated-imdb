This series does not present the British view of the Revolutionary War, as much as an anti-American view of it. The underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of settlers enjoy British rule; that the founders were manipulative schemers whose sole aim was to draw Britain into a violent civil war; that the American supporters of the revolution and the militia were racist, violent louts, duped in the fight. It is clear that the author, Richard Holmes, intends to extrapolate these properties in a straight line from the American population from 1775 to today. <br /> <br /> In the episode "The Shot Heard Around the World" Holmes elaborates on an unclear print of the Boston Massacre, claiming that Crispus Attucks skin, a black man and the first man killed in the revolution , was deliberately "whited out". Holmes claims to portray Attucks as a black man would have been poor propaganda for the revolutionary cause. Holmes never reveals how he knows it. And there's more. Holmes goes to some length to work in a single, unfounded, cruelty: the extinction of a British soldier's body. He compares the American militia to Viet Cong and the mujahade - without mentioning any differences in the goals of these groups. The list goes on. <br /> <br /> Probably this series was made in response to Mel Gibson's "The Patriot". It says a lot when an academic feels the need to respond to Mel Gibson on any topic. Instead of presenting the British view, it seems that Holmes really wanted to give a sensationalist, anti-American point of view, and he's in the process of making Roger Corman of historians - strictly third-class schlock.
