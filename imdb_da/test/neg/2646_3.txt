Although this was a well-informed story, I found it too uncomfortable. The main topic is child abuse, which is never fun to see - a sordid topic. Add to that a lot of fate of drunker-addict man and a DG of a toddler, no less - and this movie struck me as much as ever to see it again. <br /> <br /> Also portrayed here were punches on the two little boys, another unpleasant experience. History's realism takes a swan dive when one of the boys flies away on a homemade flight! Give me a break! The only positive part of this movie is to see the lovely, loving and touching relationship between the two young brothers, played by Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazello. The latter became a well-known face in the next few years with major roles in Jurassic Park, Shadlowlands and The River Wild. Wood obviously did not hit it big until a decade later, but he did very much in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. These two kids, and the story of an unbilled Tom Hanks, are the only facets of this movie I liked.
