Having lived in Michigan's Upper Peninsula (30 miles from Escanaba) in the mid-1990s, I was eager to watch this movie. It starts promising enough, with a superficial understanding of the values ​​and quirks of U.P. life. But Jeff Daniels was apparently not satisfied with a turnkey approach that would have been appropriate for the place and the people. Instead, he introduces extremely raw humor and some wildly inappropriate mysterious / supernatural elements. Although there is a good movie to be made about this almost unknown region in the United States, this is not it.
