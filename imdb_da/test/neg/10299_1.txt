Without a doubt, the biggest waste of this year's film. This film is poorly structured, sadistic, cruel and full of unlikely signs. Beyond that, and perhaps the worst crime, it is uninteresting and very predictable. As soon as Bill Pullman's character killed in the picture that changed the word from "evidence" to "violence," I had the whole plot pronounced. There are no surprises, and there is no compelling reason to see this garbage can. The only redeeming feature for me is that I saw this thing for free on my HDNet cable and didn't waste money. I would really be sad if I had paid to see it in a theater. <br /> <br /> Anyone who feels this thing is a thriller really has to come out more. A horrible, horrible movie in every way that matters.
