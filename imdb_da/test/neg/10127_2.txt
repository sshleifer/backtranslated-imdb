You might think a show of regular teenagers with superpowers would be interesting, but it's far from it. Take e.g. The concept: The main characters have a great secret that they are hiding from their peers. It's like Hannah Montana and it's so amusing. Next, the play is just average. Selena Gomez seems to be half asleep through many scenes. Finally, the jokes are either clich√© or boring. If they do not use they are colorful, yet strange dialogue to make us "laugh", throwing the various props around the room. I really want this show to use more original and entertaining material. In conclusion, Wisards of Waverly Place is a disappointment.
