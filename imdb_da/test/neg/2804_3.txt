A young man who never knew his birth parents receives an old farm in an isolated part of West Virginia after his natural father. He visits his property with a cross section of potential victims, including the comic relief black guy and a trendy lesbian couple. (Hmm, will there be shining dipping? Take a guess.) Unfortunately, the party ends when the spirit of the drifters killed by its evil grandfather and used as scarecrows, comes back for revenge. This movie starts well. An artificial montage of depression eye photographs and fake newspapers put on a speech by FDR - I think this is his first appearance in a killer scarecrow movie - establishes the mood. I developed some hope for the film, which was partly realized. The story was useful enough. The setting was sufficiently bucolic. The photography was mostly in focus. The play, while there were no tremors, was a little over horror movies in this budget area. The film may actually have worked within the narrow demands of the genres, if the scarecrows were scary. But they weren't so cheap. They were not scary at all. The better the monster is, the better the movie. These scarecrowers wouldn't scare Dorothy, let alone Toto.
