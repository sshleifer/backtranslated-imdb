I got a copy of this. I had seen it several years ago. My only recent experience was the "Mystery Science Theater" where it was soundly spoofed. You never get a chance to get into these movies because of all the city play. I love the early 50's horror movie. They give us a pompous lecture on the defense systems near the Arctic. These were there to protect us from the expected Soviet invasion, but they should be useful as the threat was very great. <br /> <br /> This particular flyer. For some reason, despite its exoskeleton made of the things the grasshoppers are made of, they can still avert air to air missiles and deactivate fighter planes. <br /> <br /> Still, it's fun - first, the mandatory decay that saw the flying thing cools his heels in a hospital (it just teaches one - see an insect as big as a house-- hold your mouth closed). I wonder if the poor guy would go home after they found the bay. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, this is a fairly common effort. It follows the usual efforts to come up with a way to deter the stubborn bug - and let us open up to other opportunities - the Russians next time. I still get a kick out of these movies and this is useful.
