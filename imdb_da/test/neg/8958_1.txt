OK, what to say about Actium Maximus ... <br /> <br /> There are some bad movies that are so terribly horrible that they are circling for awesome. There are bad movies that just suck in themselves. There are good movies and so-so movies and movies that are just fun. Then there is Actium Maximus. You can't make a spoiler for this movie because you need to understand the action enough to comment. This particular movie is worse than Turkish star wars one and the successor too. These movies are so bad that they circle around for awesome, and they make you feel full, even if you are a stone cold guy. Actium circles round from bad to awesome, but then it doesn't stop there, it takes another trip to badville, so 'round again to great, so finally it creates a small feudal kingdom on the border with' Bad 'and' stock footage of paint drying while a harpy scream is incoherent. "If you're into self-punishment, this movie is for you. It will actually cause your brain to hurt.
