This movie is mildly entertaining if you neglect to acknowledge its numerous discrepancies of plot and sheer lack of credibility. Bruce Willis as "The Jackal" never seems to live up to his reputation as an underground mastermind in the underworld. Instead, he bumbles in the big daylight, and parades a mishmash of shoddy aprons. Why this man has never been caught before (or even identified) is beyond me. Not even the audience is impressed by his wisdom or boldness; Considering the price he requires for his services (an exorbitant $ 70 million), his methods are certainly low-budget and stupid. <br /> <br /> As for those seeking him, they are at least as ridiculous in their behavior. They show no expertise instead of relying on half-baked presumption that sends them across the country on their whim. Amazingly, these long-term guesses (maybe he bought a boat, maybe he's in Chicago, etc.). Always lead them to Jackal, who once again escapes their clutches. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere, whose Irish accent falls in and out as a remote radio station, plays an inexplicable role as a prison sentenced released from prison to work with the FBI. He actually makes a compatible partner if only because his means are as amateurish and scary as his professional friends. At one point, he actually confronts the infamous Jackal, but unfortunately the FBI, although trusting him enough to leave him out of sight, fails to equip him with a weapon or any communication. What kind of operation do they run here? <br /> <br /> The movie also looks too dependent on cruel violence, which is completely superfluous and gives no excitement at all. The seemingly smart Jackal seems more like a demented and pointless serial killer that eliminates people for sport and writes on a victim's cheek with blood. <br /> <br /> The movie's action scenes are both predictable and unrealistic, and many moments are destroyed by the melodrama. This film is poorly executed on many levels, one bright spot being the ever consistent Sidney Poitier. Avoid this movie if you are in the mood to think as you see it. <br /> <br />
