I agree that this movie is too pretentious and it is not easy to know where it goes. I've been teaching literature and movies for many years, and I find this movie to be one of the most rated, according to some of the previous reviews here. <br /> <br /> But let me remind you that this is the same director who has his honorary goods (Il sorriso di mia madre- Mors smile) at his credit - a gem of a movie! <br /> <br /> did he try to overcome Fellini's 81/2 here ???? The scene with the dogs, which has also been pointed out, is absurd and excessive ?? just an example. Others would take too much space and some reviewers have already noticed them. <br /> <br /> All in all, a most frustrating and annoying experience!
