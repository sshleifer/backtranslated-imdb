What makes this movie so horrible? Is it the lame sub-par juvenile humor? Could it be the awful "trendy" sigh ass music? Maybe the uninspired go anywhere? Or maybe even the fact that Traci Lords gives his worst appearance always and to add disgrace to injury, keeps all his clothes on the entire length of this steaming tooth sandwich. In fact, whatever the cause of this movie is, it really does. I never wanted me to see a movie with Dean Cameron in it instead of what I saw in my life, but "Ski School" is a masterpiece of comic genius compared to this travesty. <br /> <br /> My Grade: F <br /> Eye Candy: Nikol Nesbitt, Buffy Tyler and Suzanne Stokes all release their Tupperware breasts <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand
