When my 6-year-old fell asleep in the theater during this movie, it was all the confirmation I needed for this movie to be a stinker. It was boring. The scary parts were dull. The maudlin parts were dull. Even the fun parts - with two minor exceptions - were boring. And predictable. And do I mention predictably? Examples: 1) The cruel but loving father who pamperes her child with a child. 2) The gruff but loving father buys the farm (while you sing a song?!). 3) Abrupt by a child who decides to cut and run, but thanks to his friends, things stick out because they need him. 4) Brat of a child wins against incredible odds. 5) And a sassy character pronounced by an African American actress. Had to credit these filmmakers for that bit of originality and to maintain the stereotype. I mentioned two funny pieces. In both cases, minor characters contributed. The mouse jumped on the farmer's pulse was fun. The farm dog falls victim to his doggy weaknesses while strengthening leadership, was fun. But the rest? Painful. Someone tried to make a Hipness-Thru Committee movie and do it even more by making it a computer-animated movie, and that was the result. And why do the coyotes make Batman-villain stupid by monologizing with their victims instead of eating them? Oh yeah. No blood is required in this movie for children who are already focusing on mock alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and potty humor. And the fuzzy thing-in-a-box? What exactly was that? A lighthouse? Tasmanian devil? What besides a really stupid plot unit to help Otis queue win mother of all battles? Barnyard is a bomb. And I didn't even have to mention the otters.
