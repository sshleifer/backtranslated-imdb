The things I find annoying on the screen, the things I nitpick about and irritate the people who are trying to watch movies with me are the moments when the author, the director, the designer, the screen reader or the one who doesn't believe it through to the end, and by a single omission act - or commission - eradicates all the other work done by everyone else who has worked with the film. The moment of "Wait a bloody moment .... What just happened?" that stops the narrative death in its tracks. (Not that the film's story needed a lot of halt, for anyone who has ever seen it, know that Quintet's narrative drive is pretty well frozen solid before the end of the opening shot.) There are more of these moments in this movie. And you will be so long to think about them too. The movie is two hours long, and the scripted dialogue probably runs to five pages. There is a lot of time to consider its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The film is set in a frozen soil. Another ice age is set and the whole world is dying. It is cold. Very cold. It is actually very cold on the screen. The film was shot in Canada in the winter, and there are ice creams and real snow and people's breath loses from their mouths in every scene. We are repeatedly reminded of how cool it is. People wear big hats and layers and make clothes and waddle around like undressed Weeble people. Must have been a horrible shoot. My nitpick comes in an order when ours completely checks into a hotel room. The wake in the middle of the night with voices coming from the living room next door, he hears a vital vital conversation for the weak plot through a large grill in the wall that divides the two rooms. I am not asking why there is a convenient grill in the wall between the two rooms. What made me annoyed was that the grill had not been blocked by the long-term renter with the noisy visitor. If you try to keep warm, the last thing you need is a large, exciting, hollow hole in your wall that leads into an unheated unheated space. Trust me. I live like this, I saw this movie sitting on my living room sofa under a duvet with a hot water bottle. My breath was mistaken as much as the actors. If it were a big hole in my wall, I'd block it with something. Perhaps not the best choice of movie to see in an unheated room in the middle of winter, but boy made it aware of the miserable isolation in the movie.
