"Fate" leads Walter Sparrow to possess a mysterious novel that has horrific similarities and connections to its life, all based on number 23. When the story unfolds in reality and fiction, Sparrow must find out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end. <br /> <br /> Number 23 offers an exciting premise that is undone by a weak performance. The movie just failed at many different levels, which is quite disappointing because it had so much potential. The play was probably the worst part about it. It was filled with stupid sequences and ridiculous dialogue that just killed the mood of the movie. It seemed that the scriptwriter had a good idea, he did not know how to develop it to extend ninety minutes of running time. The other half of the film was low on ideas, the twist was pretty obvious, and the end was horrible. Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever, and he did a little with the Phone Box and a few other movies, but Number 23 reminds me that he is still able to make a stink. He has the movie drenched in style, but he just can't get a good focus. He moves the movie in a lumpy and slow pace. He changes from reality to what actually happens in the book, which quickly became annoying. The actual book in the movie called "The Number 23" is a horrible detective story, and the audience stuck and listens to Carrey telling what just bored me to tear. When Carrey finally finishes a book, we get stuck so he runs around trying to solve the mystery. At this point, the audience has lost interest and there is no real excitement. We are waiting impatiently for the film to reach its horrible ending and convincing explanation before the celebration of that film is finally finished. The action was mostly average and pretty forgettable. Jim Carrey was obviously just asleep through his performance and he didn't even seem to try. He was either completely over the top in some scenes or just a lot of wood. His story was a complete drill to listen to, and he put no life into his character. Virginia Madsen did the best she could with a limited role, but she must choose better scripts. Logan Lerman was pretty bland, as was Danny Huston. Overall, number 23 was a horrible thriller that offered more grin than excitement or excitement. Rating 3/10
