In the mid-1970s, my NYC apt. The building was finally connected to cable TV, and since Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only premium channel offered with newer movies, I wrote to it. Being a writer and naturopath in nature, I soon discovered that the channel showed movies at night and until the clear hours of the morning I had never heard of - most of them American independent films and foreign films that had never been given an American theatrical release. Many of them had recognizable sparklers and respectable instructors, and thanks to Showtime, I discovered that many first-class movies I (and other Showtime subscribers) would never have had the opportunity to watch. Most of these cinematic mongrels were actually "dogs", but often so bad they were accidentally funny. One night, Showtime revealed a small Italian-made gem called "Redneck" (filmed in 1972, given a limited European release in 1973). Although the film had never been released in the United States, the MPAA classification was listed as an 'R'. Since the director was a Sylvio Narizzano (the director named the glorious "Georgy Girl") and the three leaders were Mark ("Oliver") Lester, Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas, I decided to try. And found myself nailed to my TV screen in disbelief for 89 minutes. As I recall, Savalas and Testi played two criminals, the former a ravenous lunatic who randomly sent a German family to their deaths by nudging their trailer from a rock and thereby falling down to the desert depths below. So far, so bad. Then Testi (like the "fine" psycho) and Lester (all 14 when the film was made) is seen, both naked, in a man's room, Testi sneaking looking at the child's body while shaving and poor confused Lester fixed on close-ups of Testi's naked butt. As a non-jaded member of the film industry and a short-lived liberal (I was just as much against censorship as I am today), the whole movie made me sad (and it was the early 70's when I believed "I has seen everything - going movies from the liberated era - including the creepy version of Altman's "The Cold Day in the Park", a real jaw droplet until it was trimmed for an R rating and would have spelled the End to Altman's career had he not next come up with something called "M * A * S * H"), I still wonder if anyone else except me ever saw "Redneck" and was horrified as I was .. Trashing the actors and the film audience are happily misguided filmmakers have been pleasantly devoted since the beginning of time, but leeringly utilizes a highly respected and talented child actor (Mr. Lester) at a time when he began making the difficult transaction from child to adult actor (and I am sure his movie offerings had thereby diminished to meretricious junk like "Redneck") ... Mr. Narizzano, you must hang your head in shame. (By the way, I soon became friends with actors who had emerged in Narizzano's future, undisputed endeavors. They despised them both. Surprise?)
