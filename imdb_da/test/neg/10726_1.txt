Oh my master, what did they think about this. It is not only freakish unfunny, but worse, a very good original was the waste in the bargain. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, really turned to life's performance in one. Even better than where she plays the hearth of the other so-called achievements in her life. Perhaps she is just plain good as a villain. Any other time, wow what a waste of time. But she and Segal beat beautifully, so if you took a glimpse of something fun in this child, take the anvil from which it was wrapped in a pulp. Because very much very little of one remains for this horror. Nothing in this kid is extremely fun except maybe a few moments when Dick and Jane bend like lepers and can't kiss ..... and uh ........ Oh sir, that's it? Now it looks like. <br /> <br /> It's really such a bad movie.
