I only saw the first part of this and concluded that I wouldn't miss anything if I didn't see the second episode. The cinematography was ok, but besides this, the plot was as common and continuous as any other war story. The actors and actors play their characters without passion, and the makeup is really bad (Heiner Lauterbach with his white hair and Kai Wiesinger as if some colored white hair could give them more dignity and common sense). I mean, if you have seen more than two or three World War II films (like most of us), then you will only go into the hassle of seeing a third or fourth if it raises some new insights or phrases in the plot . But Roland Suso Richter seems to be scared to do it, you can almost smell his fear of not living up to the bourgeois and jejune expectations of the conservative ZDF television channel while watching this movie. Millions of euros were used to maintain dull and imaginative German filmmaking. These millions of dollars could have been used to make three or four independent films, but no, let's give to some instructors who want to make a movie telling people that the war can be explained by rational means. My advice: Read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut instead. They will tell you which war is like! Or give me a million euros and I make a better movie than this load of BS! And another thing: Why is it that German films are only nominated for the Oscar, when the film deals with World War II or the Holocaust? Probably because it is the only German film production good at. And it should make us think, shouldn't it?
