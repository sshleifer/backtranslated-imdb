I am a fan of good historical fiction and was thrilled with the idea that someone would take a well-written book series and film it. Writing files are not like writing ordinary fiction, but when you have a book you customize, it would be nice to actually follow the plot line. <br /> <br /> Vespasia's portrayals (the actual Emperor and his 2 sons Titus and Domitian) were terrible. They acted like a Caligula cake-cutters and were the 'bad' in this adaptation. There was a scene with Titus who delegated justice as if he were Caligula (from the movie of the same name.) The way Vespasianii is depicted in the books mostly follows the stories of the stories that write in that period - they were fair and sane , not defiled by the imperial claudian insanity. <br /> <br /> Helena (Marcus Didius Falco's love interest), as a reason for separating Pertinax (one of the traitors referred to in the title), gave him a traitor, but in the books it was because he ignored her, and she thought she would be better off marrying someone who appreciated her as a person. Marcus in the movie gets a slave named Justus, but in books he could hardly afford his apartment, let alone advise a slave. There was certainly no romantic interlude between the non-existent slave Justus and a female gladiator ... On the whole, if you want good cookie cutter, Roman stereotypes get Caligula if you want a good Roman from the classic history point of view, Get me, Claudius.
