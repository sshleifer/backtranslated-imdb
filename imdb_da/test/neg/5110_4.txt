Every once in a while I remember that I have actually seen this bizarre fiasco, there is a cross between "What ended with Baby Jane?", "Sunset Boulevard", Lana Turner the LSD movie "The Big Cube" and the Manson Murders which also took place in 1969, but perhaps before this so-called "movie" was made! There are some descriptions of the plot already here, so I won't go into it. But it is worth noting that Miriam Hopkins plays a parody of herself: a chattering, ego-maniacal, fading actress. Perhaps she thought she was making a movie that would be as successful as one of the Bette Davis horrors. The old mad Hopkins never stopped working, so give it to her. She shows a little too much meat in this movie, something that Davis and Crawford would never have done. And there's a scene with Miriam in the actual sticky Hollywood Boulevard Christmas parade that has to be filmed Xmas, 1968. <br /> <br /> Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It's just shocking how wrinkled and horrible she looks. John Garfield, Jr. looks like his father, but not so interesting. I think one of the three stooges is the tour guide at the beginning. If it's not one of Stooges, it's somebody. <br /> <br /> I was amazed to come across this thing in the form of a commercial video tape given me by a friend who knows all about junk like this. It is fantastic!!!
