It's the only movie I almost went out of and wanted if my friends hadn't been to the movie theater with me. Although I don't like a movie, I usually think it's still worth sitting through it to the end. That way, you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself. But with the Million Dollar Hotel it was so terrible that I just prayed that the experience should end as soon as possible. I think I probably wouldn't have been so disappointed if this movie was made by a smaller director, one I didn't usually like so much. But from Wenders it was the more shocking to see. I know Bono from U2, a good friend of Wenders, wrote the manuscript for this immense movie, and I wonder why Wenders let him as friend friend as the two have been. "Stick to the day job, Bono" is a phrase that easily throws in mind while you see this mess. Pretentious, heterogeneous, a mish-mash of every possible modern movie stereotype, a naive and transparent attempt to cross as boiled and bold, with the most annoying characters I've ever seen, especially the leaders, Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich and Mel Gibson, no one I don't like normally. The happiest end I could have wished would have been that a nuclear bomb was dropped on their collective heads to get it all done as quickly as possible. On the other hand, the first five minutes of the movie are extremely good, with an extremely stirring soundtrack from U2. But the movie's opening pictures make the rest of the film (which takes a spectacular nose-dive from then on) the more disappointing as they are a promise of movie quality that has never been delivered, not even close.
