If you think Hannah Montana or Suite Life is at the bottom of the gap, then of course you've never seen iCarly. iCarly is without a doubt the worst show I've ever seen. From the lifeless deal to the low budget, the show series of inexpensive sets of last week's Chinese takeout sets off to simmer in your overheated car. The show is about a beautiful, perky and "should be" fun girl named Carly when she and her friends make a live web show called iCarly. Carly lives alone with her older brother who seriously needs advice or something because he is a few cells that do not have a brain. <br /> <br /> The drawings of the shows are very ridiculous and unbearably annoying. But to see Carly and her friend, Sam, make their little iCarly show-in-a-show even worse. They basically show strange pictures and keep things up in their noses as the laughter is played over and over again. I mean seriously, every second second the laughter trail seems to come without reason. <br /> <br /> So what is the meaning of this review? you can ask. Just to ridicule iCarly? Well, but I also warn you to take care of this show. Seriously, if I had to choose to watch iCarly and Barney? No question about what I would choose Barney.
