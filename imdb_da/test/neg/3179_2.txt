I like Wes Studi & especially Adam Beach, but whoa this movie is a lot of pretentiousness. Stunningly slow. Too cryptic for obfuscation, not because the plot guarantees it, but because there is almost no plot. Even less in the way of characterization. This is almost like one of the creaking old Charlie Chan mysteries (the cheaper monogram studio versions) with lots of red herring and oddball characters (like the old ex-senator with the checkered past, now a recluse) and lots of People are killed over objets d'art that you would not see twice in the mall. Great scenery, though. Beautiful hair on redhead also, although I never found out what she was doing in this at all. I didn't know my wife either. Sheesh, at least the old B-movies had a decency to be short.
