The Mystery Science Theater 3000 would not have been able to bring any redeeming quality to a display of this "pearl". <br /> <br /> This is like a cheesy pirate copy of 80s porn you could have bought at VHS from an 42nd arcade. before Disney bought the whole smashed and closed them all. <br /> <br /> But wait - all sex scenes have been cut. I challenge someone to find a worse movie. This film could replace water-boarding as a human examination method. <br /> <br /> No, I'll take it back - I prefer water-boarding. <br /> <br /> The only credit this movie could make except being the worst movie ever made would be to threaten the Middle East to solve its troubles by having to watch this movie.
