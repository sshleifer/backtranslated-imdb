This was truly the most painful experience I've had for some time in a movie theater. I will leave such clear criticism as "maudlin" or "historically inaccurate" or "horse scoundrel shed" because simply our sympathy would immediately go out on those words. If an instructor is to make a sweeping greatness of glory epic, good for God's sake, MAKE A REAL LADY THAT GRANDIOS LOVE EPIC! Why do such ridiculously convincing second-level harlequin romances and such tedious exchanges of characters disturb us less when the most crucial battle for Canadian land takes place? And for the pompous people think 'oh, this story should center signs!' Well, you got it wrong, died wrong.
