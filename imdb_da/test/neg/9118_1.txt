American Graffiti is one of the best movies ever made. I have seen it at least 30 times and is emotionally affected by it every time I see it. (I graduated from high school in 1962.) <br /> But more American graffiti is one of the worst movies ever made. It is hard to believe than anyone associated with great original film was involved in this terrible sequel. That part of the movie in Vietnam was extremely inaccurate. (I earned 18 months in Vietnam with 101. Airborne Division.) <br /> <br /> The whole movie had no value in any part of it. <br /> <br /> If anyone ever wants to make a case of making big movie sequels, more American graffiti would be the prime example of what can go wrong.
