Oh yes, I agree with the others who describe this as terrible. The act of this four-hour move is uniformly bad, so bad that I find it impossible to believe that any of the actors in this production might serve as an actor. I still wonder who was throwing. Each delivers their lines without any involvement or emotional investment of any other nature. No one seems to have a real relationship, family or anything with another. The direction is also appalling and any action scene is ridiculous and convincing. Were the movie editors asleep? The costumes seem to be authentic to the Regency period, but the fabrics look 20th century and colors (especially the blue colors!) Are curly and I don't think was available at the beginning of 19. century fabric except perhaps in silk. <br /> <br /> Also, the hair: the men have obvious 1970s haircuts, and the women have "big hair" --- especially the woman playing Anne Elliot. <br /> <br /> All the female characters, young and old, are quite lovely, but it doesn't matter for the lack of acting. The actor who plays "Anne" looks like she's in her 40s, while Anne Elliot was 27 years old. I mean, where was the make-up and lighting crew if we were to find the woman who played Anne credibly? She spends much of her time and looks nice with the eyes on the horizon level, whether indoors or out. I still wonder what it was supposed to convey. Sorry maybe? Yes, this production is regrettable! <br /> <br /> The actress who played Louisa was really horrible. She screams, squeals, giggles and jumps around like a bad twelve year old (my excuse for any twelve year old who reads this) that I was eagerly waiting for the moment she settles out. How this behavior is supposed to attract an adult man is over me. Most would return when she first opened her mouth to giggle and scream. The actor who plays Captain Wentworth portrays someone who is so bland and colorless, wondering why every woman could be forty over him for eight years. <Br /> <br /> Rejoining the pair at the end is not convincingly done or explained. How did they get together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma that's for sure. No, there must be more than that, and that's not explained in the movie. <br /> <br /> I rate this production two stars: one because it's Austen's work and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were lovely. The only reason I could see the whole production is that I was sick with the flu and I got it from the library. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the book, see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this movie even if you haven't read the book.
