Don't worry - no spoilers here, just say there's a very predictable plot. A couple decides to live in his father's beloved so they can write a book / article / newsletter about his fling with a famous tragic Hollywood starlet. This entire production ran like a high school troupe who made an episode of "Murder She Wrote". The only play I was sold on was the old bailiff, they interviewed for sources in history. Apparently the directors thought the movie was too long, so at the end they stopped pointing the camera to some kind of scary picture of the starlet and brought in plot amps to pack this thing up. Don't waste your time - even the tried and true horror / intrigue classics fail in this movie.
