'Bloody Birthday' is a strange and sometimes humorous low-budget horror flick like 'Mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'The Good Son'. <br /> <br /> Seen in a small California town, three babies are born at the height of an eclipse, where planetary alignment means somehow born without emotion. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths take on a killing where they go away with parents, siblings, teachers, and others who annoy them. Only a teenage girl knows the truth to stop them. There is no explanation why babies worldwide born at the same time are not as twisted but where you go! <br /> <br /> For a slasher movie, it is very tame in terms of violence and gore, which I suppose to highlight the problem of casting child signs as the murderers, as only so much can you expose the young actors to. . Instead, it is entertaining and a little disturbing to see three ten-year planning murders and carry out their plans using weapons, knives and crosses. The main reason why it does not become completely ridiculous is because the child's actors are very convincing in their roles with the way they wear play the little innocent in front of innocent adults while showing their dark side to the girl who knows the truth. <br /> <br /> 'Bloody Birthday' is pretty mediocre as a scarecrow, with few scares and a little blood, but because it has the shocking factor of having children like the killings, it's a bit unique in that way. One to see if there is nothing else.
