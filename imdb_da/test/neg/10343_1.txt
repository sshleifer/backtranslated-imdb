Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen, seem to be getting away with it. I haven't even seen this movie, but I don't just know it's bad, but the fact that it steals the story of another movie or 2 movies for that matter is such a bad guy (and if IMDb would allow disgrace much more than just the bull) that I am filled with rage and feel like I just have to get out of the window and just finish it all. I think it's a bit much, but stealing is worse. <br /> <br /> Have you seen Pontypool? It was this amazing little zombie film that was made in 2008, this radio has gone to work, and then this zombieangre. We only see what's going on in the radio station, and the only guess we have on what's happening from the outside is the occasional call from their eye in heaven Ken Loney (the funniest moment in the movie in my mind) and the BBC calls for a update the situation. From all the reviews I've read, and from the conversation I had with my friend (who watched this movie and Pontypool), this movie was exactly like that in history, with less tweaks here and there. Then throw originality and creativity out of the window. As for the zombies, or they infected, whatever you want to call them. They are exactly the same thing, just because they were infected, do not change the fact that they go around thoughtlessly and have an infinite extinction of meat. They are zombies. ZOMBIES !! <br /> <br /> ZOMBIES !!! Okay one for many, but back to this crappy movie. The zombies from what I've heard are much like them for 28 days later, another better movie with their crazy anger and even more insane extinction of meat. This is where Zombie movies define themselves, the story doesn't matter in a zombie movie (as long as you don't take the idea of ​​another movie). Sure, a zombie movie can be improved by the story, as is the case with Pontypool, but the zombies must somehow be original. 28 days later, the crazy raging zombie started. Pontypool I can't even begin to explain these guys without destroying the movie. The evil death, I think all I have to do is just write the name again because it's The Evil Dead. Romero is the champion and he went through all kinds of zombies, from the painted face zombies in Dawn of the Dead to raging zombies in the dead, and he did each with his own unique style. <br /> <br /> So after talking about other big zombie movies, I think it's time I explain why I hate this movie without seeing it myself. This movie on the right steals the original storyline for Pontypool, which I think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country, and many people are kicked out of school to do this much, but in Hollywood it is allowed and apparently approved by. This is not the only movie based on another movie and just trying to tell it differently. The 90s are like the worst period for movies ever, sure it had some gems, but which decade doesn't, and that's because all the movies were the same. My favorite, the crime movie with a twist so big that you will never guess it to the very end. They force you to feel a suspicion, so it seems impossible that no one other than him, so bam, all the time this guy, you just had to look at the scenes where he was not there, and then he would mysteriously turn out of the blue, say "hello guys, what did I miss?" OH! Don't think it came YA! Well, I'll leave a cliché as my final statement. This is a movie you will definitely miss.
