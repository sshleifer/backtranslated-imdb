Why was this movie made? Are producers so easily fooled by sadists that they will give them money to create torture methods such as this so-called "movie"? I love a bad movie as much as the next masochist, but "Cave Dwellers" pushes it. It is seriously physically painful to see. The reason is about a man-named Ator - a buffed numeral that I will refer to as Private Snowball for the rest of this review - who will fight for invisible warriors and rescue a princess to beat the bad guy who will find one better hair stylist. I could have got the plot wrong since it has been a while since I saw this excrement, but really, do you really care? Oh yes, Private Snowball also has a dumb Asian sidekick (who doesn't?). Who is not fun. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Private Snowball fights invisible people, visits some caves, all in the name of a good king, so personalized he makes Al Gore look like Jim Carrey. Then Private Snowball builds a trailer (yes, I'm serious) and gets the girl. Yippie-kee-yay. It is cheap, unintentionally silly and persistently dull. Why am I not surprised that the director ended up making porn? <br /> <br /> Bottom line: AVOID. Ator will steal part of your life and you will have no fun "so bad-the-good" catchphrases to take with you from the experience. Bad Ator! BATH! Aak! * gags *
