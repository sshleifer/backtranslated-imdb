The Nune is a vengeance, whereby a very strict nun is killed by her rebellious trailer charges and comes back years later to come herself when now adults visit their old school. History line is predictable in spades and will not hold any surprises as it slowly wins its way to the end. It is a screamer of a movie with passable plays and a below average script and manuscript. Much of the special effects are low quality and there is almost no credibility in the last match. Still, if you look past these there are some excitement and spectacle jewels. If you like senseless cookie cutter screamers, you will like this, otherwise you have to pass.
