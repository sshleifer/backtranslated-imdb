I still wonder why I sat through this whole thing. It only had about 3 minutes of the actual entertainment, the rest of it was just a total bore. The action is not that great, and the action scenes are sooo cheeses, it's not even fun. I wish I could say something good about this movie, but I can't think of anything right now. There was probably something in it that some might enjoy, but the end of it must be the stupidest idea ever. What kind of person would get a small toy remote-controlled helicopter with a burnt machine gun in it to murder the president? This idea could never have been done in the first place let alone have anyone stupid enough to try it, I think the author must have been obsessed with the toy car scene in The Dead Pool, but actually attempted to make this look seriously.
