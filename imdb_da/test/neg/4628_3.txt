I had a very difficult time sitting through this movie. Unless you really are very pro-adultery and like to hear people FINALLY talking about their sexual exploits, I can't see how you could enjoy this movie. Geez - most of the protagonists behaved like rhythmic beings, and their bragging about their many adultery was widespread. About the only element of this I appreciated was the GIVING scene, where one character watered and blood spread everywhere because he had picked up a STD --- GREAT SUMMARY!?! Hmm. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie, see the sequel, Barbarian Invasions. Despite the many unlikely character of many characters, the sequel is very involved and more realistic - worth your time.
