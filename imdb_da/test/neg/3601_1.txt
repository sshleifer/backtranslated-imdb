This is the worst waste of time I have ever experienced. not even close to the first. The story is hard to follow - plot was weak - at best. It all looked like three stories trying to tie them together and make a movie. It had some good lines here and there - and the attempt at the message was admirable, but they went from Houston through New York to get to Dallas. It was really hard to tell in what time the current time went up. The movie was just over an hour, and it felt like we had been sitting there watching the movie all afternoon. Mayve points out to be honest - but a son shouldn't have to do everything Kronk thought he had to do. Do yourself a favor - See Kuzco again.
