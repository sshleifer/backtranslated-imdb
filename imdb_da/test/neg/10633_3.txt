I watched this movie because I thought it would be a classic Amy Adams movie. Wow, this movie is so bad at so many levels that it stacks up your imagination. It is poorly designed for one, also the script and the play are just awful. But hey, even Johnny Depp has a lot of bad movies under his belt. The upside of this movie would be Amy song, and even on that score, I think better songs could have been chosen. Amy is of course beautiful to see and if you are a deadly fan of her, you will probably see this title no matter what you just don't expect too much. I wish I could have found more to suffer, but it was just painful to see. I recommend Sunshine Cleaning or Doubt.
