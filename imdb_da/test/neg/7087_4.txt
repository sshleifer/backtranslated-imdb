I made sure to watch this movie because it is a 1950s sci-fi movie - one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, foreigners in this movie were a big disappointment while I was looking forward to bug-eyed foreigners or powerful victors! First, you first see a very short one in the beginning (and he looked quite ordinary) and you also got a little glimpse of a spaceship! Second, the alien was neither the evil conqueror nor the benevolent friend of mankind - but a really odd ball. And finally, the plot itself seemed so stupid, predictive, and heavy that it provoked more yawns than excitement. When the movie begins, five people from five different parts of the world (Germany, Britain, Russia, China and the United States) are kidnapped by a stranger. The alien gives each of them units whereby they can destroy all life on the planet if they choose - because the alien admits that his peoples would love to inhabit the Earth, but they themselves will not kill to get it. Then he returns them all. Although it is 100% clear that no one will use these devices, the alien on television broadcasts the identity of the five without telling them that weapons are so powerful! Then all the militarists in the world will find the five and force them to reveal how the weapons work. Much of the rest of the movie consists of some of the five who hide and one is tortured to make him reveal how the device works - as the Soviets will use it !!! This part of the movie just seemed pretty stupid. Sure, the USSR was a vicious and corrupt nation (sorry, but actually - especially during Stalin) - they would never have thought of using it as they did in the movie! Later, one of the five (the German scientist) somehow shows that the units can also be used to kill only all the evil people who hate freedom. Then he uses it to eradicate all the evil municipalities and probably others who were anti-freedom and the world becomes such a paradise !! Preachy, silly and full of plot gaps - this movie just isn't worth your time, even though it's an interesting relic simply for the way it addresses communism - especially the tensions between NATO and the Soviets.
