This film tried to make Stu Ungar's life interesting by being creative. What they forgot is that his life was very entertaining enough on his own without having to do things. <br /> <br /> A short list of inaccuracies: <br /> <br /> 1) Stuey was not sent straight to Las Vegas for a Gin tournament to pay out old debts, he spent a lot of time in Florida first and only went to Las Vegas when he ran out of East Coast Gin games. <br /> <br /> 2) Stuey never joined (or played Gin) with a casino manager (as Pat Morita played in the movie.) <br /> <br /> 3) There was no magic turnaround in the building to the 1997 WSOP. In fact, Stuey barely made it to the tournament as it was. He snore cocaine the week before himself. <br /> <br /> Either tell the story right, or don't tell it at all. 4 out of 10 stars for Michael Imperolli's credible performance (the only redeeming quality of this movie.)
