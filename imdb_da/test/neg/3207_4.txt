I haven't seen this movie this year, the last time I did I was really full after 5 pints tenants at my local Witherspoon, but even then I was quite awful. This movie is pretty horrible compared to the other critters movies, the first two were quite good, 3 were quite crap but miles better than this. The story takes place 53 years after critter's 3, Charlie, the bounty hunter from the previous films was found floating in a pod in the outer space of a herd of some kind of space mines, em, people and taken aboard. Once on board, the last ass egg left in the galaxy, which Charlie has brought with him from Earth, is bursting open, and we then have small spices aboard the spaceship, cue a blatant 'Alien' rip off and a lot of terrible FX and you pretty much Have this movie in a nutshell. Only good thing is when we are reintroduced to the UG (or we are led to believe), who is now a villain and wants to keep the criteria instead of destroying them
