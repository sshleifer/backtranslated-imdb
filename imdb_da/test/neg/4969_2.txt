I had finished watching Mandy Lane an hour ago, and felt the urge to get home and get up here to warn anyone spending money on the DVD - NOT. <br /> <br /> Supporting characters are low, lack of action is higher than that of Matthew McConaughey film, and until the end twist, the plot is anything but obvious. In nine out of ten you can see the next scene that comes 5 minutes before it starts. The whole movie is more or less without motive or message, and halfway the revelation of the "killer" just out kills what little interest you might have left at that time. What could have saved this thorough, boring movie is something decent splatter, or at least worthy of the genre "Slasher" - it also fails. <br /> <br /> If you need a background movie for a party that you can jump in and out without missing out on something I recommend buying All The Boys Love Mandy Lane. <br /> <br /> If you are looking to sit and actually concentrate your eyes on the screen for more than 15 seconds I don't.
