This movie is not that good at all. It's pretty stupid, pretty annoying and very badly done. I really only saw this movie because one of my friends said they hated this movie. Even though I didn't hate it as much as they did, I still found it a pretty bad movie. All that is extremely good with this was that it was a little entertaining at times, and I also feel that if it had been done a little better, it would have been just okay. What I mean by a little better is that if it had been completely reworked, it would not have been like it had been shot at a film festival, and if the manuscript had been improved, it would have been an okay movie. is not, but instead what it is now, a crazy movie. The play is terrible, I felt that if I saw a couple of teens acting as a Halloween show or Thrill ride or something. The kittens are pretty cheap (as it is movies in themselves), and pretty much everything else is low class. Overall, this movie is really bad and you wouldn't miss out on anything if you decided to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> 3.8 out of 10 stars
