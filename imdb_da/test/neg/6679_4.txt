STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> As a boy, Mark Goddard (C Thomas Howell ) powerless as his family, including his hero-copf (Jeff Fahey), were brutally murdered by evil criminals he had tried to bring down. With an inner desire to punish misdemeanors celebrating in him as he grew up as a result, Mark uses harsh means when he brings the suspects he chasing down and comes in many problems with his superiors because of this. But then he learns from 'Justice Incorporated' a secret group of men and women led by a mysterious man (Ed Lauter) who serves to maintain punishment appropriate to the crime outside the law. But then things go out of hand and get out alive can be harder than he thought. Sweeper gets into trouble from the offset because we've seen the same plot done before (and better) in movies like The Star Chamber with Michael Douglas and Magnum Force with Clint Eastwood. The title also makes no sense. But we also have to fight with the movie's complete ludicrousness, including a scene where a daughter's headphone manages to drown the sound of his family slaughtered, a finale with a chase with a bad guy starting on the highway and ending up in a Wright Brothers plane, as well as some of the most ridiculous plays ever put on the screen and a very clich√©, pretentious script. But there are some beautiful action sequences here and there, and the movie's unintentional laughter factor certainly keeps it alive with a pulse. **
