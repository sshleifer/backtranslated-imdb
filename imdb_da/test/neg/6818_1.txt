Absolutely ridiculous movie that makes fun of the college access process. Although it is true that the SATs are not all in the evaluation of a student for admission to college, what the film is talking about, is completely ridiculous and not worth repeating or seeing. <br /> <br /> The college footage officials are made to look like stupid people who have a very narrow view of the whole process. The film is an insult to hard-working high school students who work hard and then suffer from a long process until they receive the acceptance letter or refusal from the schools they have applied for. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves absolute rejection at all levels.
