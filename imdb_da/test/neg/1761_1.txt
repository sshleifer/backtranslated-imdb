Jude Law gives Keanu Reeves a run for his money as the most wood actor around, Renee Z's character is straight out of Beverly Hillbillies, and the two leads have almost as much chemistry as Darth Vader and Queen Amedala. "Bad guys" is the worst kind of clich√©, and there is no subtle moment in the movie. Amazingly, some critics really liked this movie.
