In yet another miserable attempt to make a quick Hollywood deposit of one of the television's greatest masterpieces, Peter Segal has created a monster. Taken out of context, if you didn't know Brooks' work before you see it, the movie would be a lame big budget movie that is not sure whether it will be bold joke and stupid comedy or just a regular action movie with nothing to move on. But as a young generation Y's who recently spent two months occupied in the five seasons of the Get Smart, 60s television show, this movie became painful to me from the moment I stepped in and saw Steve Carell dumbing down the part . Backgrounds, agent 99 got plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was previously morbid considering, is ashamed of the complexity of the original duo and paints a flat boring reassessment of them. It seems that the actors, who cannot be truthfully fun in both dialogue and situation, fell back on lame set-ups for Don Adam's famous lines, flash camps for bold camp, references to Carell's part in the office in interview style camera angles they have , and a female chauvinism that falls flat on the face. <br /> <br /> For those who have seen the original, the authors of this movie thought they would contain some memories. They mention Herbie, Fang (now a worthless little furry dog, Carell covets), the shoe phone, the style cone and his classic red car and the doors and the phone that introduced the show. The classic music is back, but now everything is updated, generally worse. The still life is now a strange, blue telekinetic force field, the control headquarters is just below a museum that retains Control's past. The film lacks any creative random technology, and replaces it with crossbow in Swiss army knives. Lots of "humor" in the movie, Carrel is hurting herself, or another character being hurt, whether it is a killer who spends two minutes accidentally shooting his arm or being hit by security guards or throwing in airplanes. In the original, Smart would offend a great enemy, attack him without success, and try to get along with him before being powdered. In this he attacks without success and gets pummeled. It seems that the screenwriters did not understand that humor was established with the dialogue and not the meaningless violence. It's as if they took the names from the show and cut out everything that did well in the first place. <br /> <br /> The poster hides Carell's face over Hathaway's. The movie also looks like something that could do well. They confuse classical music with the over-dramatic action and romantic music in large budget films. While the original is fed by a campy feel, this quality replaces with massive doses of cgi explosions and pow sound effects. I was really looking forward to this when I finished the original series just two months ago and it was ranked in my top five shows of all time. However, this was a huge disappointment. The credit says they collaborated with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I've read on the internet, they were largely excluded from the writing process. In conclusion, if you want to waste your money on a cash-in with little value and no respect for its namesake, go for it. But be prepared that the trip is not how you remembered it. <br /> <br /> PS: I almost forgot George Bush's humor. They mention "Nuculor" who falls asleep by art, the president's work for their vice president, and appreciates the tacklers to solve real problems. If you belong to the same jokes you have heard 3-4 years ago in big budget film form, you have to throw your money here.
