Had she not been married to the producer, Jennifer Jones would not have been the most obvious choice for the leading female role in this tragic narrative of an affair between an American soldier and an English nurse founded on World War I. Her British accent is not perfect, and in the fifties it was unusual that a great romantic leadership went to an actress in her late thirties, as attractive as Miss Jones, especially when she was several years older than her leading man. There were a number of beautiful young British actresses in Hollywood around this time, such as Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons and Joan Collins, some of whom might have been more convincing in the role, but Miss Jones had an important feature they all lacked, namely a marriage certificate with David O. Selznick's name on it. In that case, the film turned out to be such a turkey that they were undoubtedly grateful not to have it on their CVs. <br /> <br /> The film largely tells the story of the romance between Frederick, an American volunteer serving the Italian army as an ambulance driver and Catherine, a nurse with the British Red Cross. After the Italian defeat in the battle for Caporetto, Frederick is mistakenly accused of being a German spy and sentenced to death. (The film paints a very hard picture of Italian military justice; it seems that Italian courts had the power to pass the death penalty after a trial that lasted for all thirty seconds without hearing any evidence and without having the defendant legally represented or to speak in his defense). Frederick manages to escape and cross the border into neutral Switzerland, accompanied by the pregnant Catherine. <br /> <br /> Hemingway's novels have not always been a great success when filmed. Howard Hawks managed to make a good version of "Having and have not", a movie that is significantly better than the book it is nominally based on, but that is because he largely ignored Hemingway's plot and turned the movie into a remake of "Casablanca", located in Martinique instead of French Morocco. Like the 1943 version of "For whom the mountain taxis", "Goodbye to weapons" is overlong and poorly moving slowly. It's also miscast. Jennifer Jones never does Catherine's life. Regarding Rock Hudson, his adopted Christian name could unfortunately be appropriate. He could be as solid as a stone, but also as inappropriate as one, and in this movie his Frederik seems like an imitation of the Great Stone Face. Despite the passion and feeling associated with Hemingway's plot, the emotional temperature is always too cool. The picture has little to go for it except for some attractive picture-postcard views on Italian and Swiss scenery. It is hardly surprising that it was not a success and that its failure ended Selznick's career as a producer. 4/10 <br /> <br /> And goof. Shortly before the battle for Caporetto, an Italian officer states that Russia had already entered into a special peace with Germany. That battle began in October 1917, at a time when Kerensky's Russia was still struggling with the Allies. The Russian Revolution did not take place before November; it was only the "October Revolution" at the old Julian calendar. The new Bolshevik regime signed a porch with Germany in December 1917, but a separate peace was not signed before the Brest-Litovsk Treaty in March 1918
