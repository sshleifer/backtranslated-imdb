To be honest, the movie was so horrible that I loved it. Never in my life have you seen such a terrific film. I was in shock. I don't even mean what to say. The characters couldn't even keep their own weapons, one minute had a guy an M16, and his friend had an MP5, then in the next scene they switched weapons. (Don't ask, trust me, I know my weapons) And I never understand how they came from a place that looked like Vietnam, on an Arizona highway, to my backyard and then to a chemical plant in California, that's what I took it off. <br /> <br /> Why would you be afraid of a guy in a Halloween mask wearing a trash can of a robe and shooting plastic arrows on you? How is it scary? I wanted to swallow the arsenic halfway through the movie. I love how the "skeleton man" decided to go on a murder on that day. But hey, who made this movie must be shot in the knees and fed to a height of ants. Good day.
