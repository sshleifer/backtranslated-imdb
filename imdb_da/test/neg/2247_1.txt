I discussed between this movie and 2012, but chose Inglourious Basterds because of the amazingly fantastic IMDb rating. I must say now what a disappointment. I had expected some degree of free violence, but I also expected a lot of witty dialogue. I got a huge dose of the first, but not nearly enough of the latter. I felt short-lived. The relationship between violence and plot is very important, and I think this movie gets it completely wrong. And why? It's so trustworthy or really all that entertaining. Save time and money. I can't believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of modern masses.
