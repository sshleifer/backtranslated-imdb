Really looking forward to seeing a continuation of Lonesome Dove, but it was total waste. Cinematography was terrible. The shot too tight. Look almost at the Grand Canyon through a stationary telescope. Editing was cut, cut, cut. Not even smooth. More like a bad student editor. Don't know if McMurtry played the screen, but the dialogue was horrible. Really as Val Kilmer's portrayal of Doc Holiday in Wyatt Earp, but what about him in Comanche Moon ??? I have no idea. Even looked like it was shot at a solid stage using the old Bonanza sets. How can the director of the original Lonesome Dove go so wrong with this? Where was the head ............. Can't say much to the actor either. It is a shame to have messed up so beautiful westerns who could have been, but more as they hurried this just to get it in the can. Have read other reviews and see that others felt the same. Not even curious to see the next few nights because it would be just a waste of time as the first night was. <br /> <br /> (2nd post) ............. .... OK, since nothing else was on TV, I have to be honest and admit that I saw the last 2 nights at Comanche Moon. And I will be honest to tell you that I didn't make it to the end of one of the last 2 episodes because I fell asleep! I can only admit that I saw the two main characters very close, and I could pick out some ways Steve Zahn did while he portrayed the character Duval did such an excellent work. So I have to give Zahn credit for it. Regarding Karl Urban's portrayal .... simple dead meat. Can only say again that I was very disappointed because I was so much concerned about the original LD ​​and as others ....... have defended my feelings for a really great Western.
