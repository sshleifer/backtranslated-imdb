Great actors, good movie recording, a potentially interesting plot, and what should have been good dialogue. Nothing else is good with this movie. Perhaps the author or director thought they could make a thought-provoking movie out of annoying characters that are as deep as a cup of coffee. <br /> <br /> Within 10 minutes I didn't like Caroleen Feeney's decor of Kim so much that it became a distraction. While Kim should be an unsympathetic character, I'm not sure I would want to commit acts of physical violence on her. The first (of many) bizarre things happening is that Wes (David Strathairn) goes from "I miss $ 50.00" to "She stole $ 50" in about 3 seconds. It was incredible when she (Kim) never had access to her wallet, nor was she a master pocket - there was simply no rational reason to suspect her. Most people have lost / misplaced money and just assume it ... we lost it. The same goes for Kim later. All very unrealistic behavior in what should be (I believe) a look at real people. The character of Kim was at least suffering from a BiPolar disorder. Wes had major problems with inadequacy, Nancy was just boring, and Matt was deceptive (especially about music). I actually turned it on from approx. 2/3 of the way through. But to write a valid comment, I forced myself to turn it back on the hope that something would come together in this movie. No, sorry, it was still bad. Make it a point to miss this one.
