One of the worst things a movie studio can do is exploit other tragedies and market a "shock" or "gore" factor to sell tickets in order to buy their Birch a new diamond necklace. Another worst thing is to completely mislead the true facts of an incredible saga by presenting events, dialogue and images to the director's own taste. Finally, one of the worst things a movie studio can do is use bottom-of-the-bar actors and shoot it all at a sound stage rented for fifty cents a day. All three of these travesties creators of this movie are guilty of. This is, hands-down, the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen thousands. A score of '1' is too good for this celluloid waste. Not only should the filmmakers be ashamed to do what they should be ashamed of negatively exploiting the hero of this story, which is the people who experienced this tragedy firsthand, both the living and the dead.
