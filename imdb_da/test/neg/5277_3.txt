This movie is terribly bad. Kevin Spacey is a really good actor, he shines in LA Confidential, American Beauty, Usual Suspects, 7 etc. But this is really nonsense, he did not come near a decent Irish accent, maybe he should have practiced it with Kate Hudson as she did about Adam. To Irish people, this movie is ridiculous and even worse, it is very annoying for several scenes. I think the producers made this movie and hoped the target audience (non-European) would never have seen or heard of 'General' or Martin Cahill and be thrilled in an exciting and entertaining story. Total crud !!
