My best guess is that this work will come out on DVD sometime before Christmas. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible. The timeline jumps everywhere. It wouldn't be that bad if it left some excitement to the end. It was completely predictable. Bitch girls choose outcasts, outcasts want to know why they hate her so much, bitch girls die a terribly dead, outcast girl goes home and looks crazy. Outcast girl brought evil spirits with her, making neighbors crazy and killing each other. Terrible child understands what's going on. Oh, and the younger sister is not good enough for Mommie, sick mother sends younger daughter to bring the golden child home. <br /> <br /> To be fair, there were some good moments here and there. First of all, Sarah Michelle Geller's character dies in the first few minutes. Fast plus. So not the one who came. I don't expect the wife to pour bacon fat on her husband's head. If the movie had stopped that kind of excitement, I would have loved it. The beginning showed so much promise. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed because I enjoyed the first one. It made me jump, I don't expect most of what happened, and even though I asked some of the movie, it was still a fun watch. I didn't see any previews for this sequel because I would be surprised. I was, but in the wrong direction.
