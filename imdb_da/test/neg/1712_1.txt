Firstly, I would like to apologize for my assessment of "1" ... The only reason I give this movie such a high rating is that I cannot dive into negative integers. All "This is a spoof" mussel aside, and although I have certainly tried to give due consideration, I have left a certain concept, namely; "It's probably the worst movie ever made." At any level and in any probable quantification of qualitative measurement ... Seriously, I tried to be like an indie born-to-cult video distribution movie like the next buff, but seriously this movie sucked rhino bullets. .. Honestly, if I had directed this "movie" I would have seen it as a legitimate cause of suicide.
