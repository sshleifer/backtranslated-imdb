Sweet idea to have Dionne Warwick vocal for this movie adaptation of Jacqueline Susann's best-selling book (a "Valley of the Dolls") ... even though it's really bad, this smoker doesn't have Patty Duke's Neely O'Hara spike the story. "The Love Machine" is incredibly boring. Even the final brawl (with an Academy Award as a combat stop!) Can't save it. Dyan Cannon seems balm in her heavy pancake makeup and cumbersome falls (although her tiny tan figure is a beauty to see), John Phillip Law is a block of wood at the forefront, David Hemmings embarrassing in gay state as a flamboyant photographer. And where does Robin Stone go to the end? Is he pulling out to the waterfront to pick up some sailors? After Cannon killed his masculinity, it would be a safe game. In that case, "Love Machine - The Final Episode" may have been a more interesting flick. Definitely better than this gab-inducing snooze opera. * 1/2 from ****
