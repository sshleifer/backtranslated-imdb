Sorry for all the spoilers that this contains. But if you want to read about anyway: I really wonder why so many people are so high on Kevin Williamson. Let's just look at his work as a writer, should we? There are Scream 1 and 2 (plus the story of the next) which I think is quite fun but very overstated. In addition, ceasing to make Scream a franchise became a parody of horror movies and simply became another. Then I know what you did last summer, which is essentially the same movie again. He signed up for Halloween: H20, but himself had the sense of not honoring what he did on that monstrosity. Then the faculty, which I can only say was god-horrible. (Lots of fun to make fun of though). Don't even get me started on the ridiculous, soap operative Dawson's Creek, I could trace how bad it is for hours. Then we come to teach Mrs. Tingle. First of all, there are tons of small inconsistencies in this. For example: in most colleges I know of, valedictorian is NOT the only one to come to college! This idea that Katie Holme's character would never go anywhere unless she was valedictor was absurd. Haven't you ever heard of financial aid, damn it? Also, I don't think you're being expelled from high school or not coming into college because of cheating on a test. There are a lot of others, but I now jump to the big one. The ending really disturbed me: they committed a crime, but it was okay because the teacher was a bitch. Great. Do you know how many of my teachers I could kidnap from that logic? I'm sure the police never took any statements to figure out the whole story. That would certainly not be necessary. Helen Mirren was good, she added some nice flair to a character who (as a previous commentary noted) had no reason for anything she did. And have others noticed that Katie Holmes can absolutely not act? Her self-righteousness became incredibly annoying. "You wanted me to fail." Blah blah blah. "Her last two scenes with Mrs. Tingle were the worst. The only reason I didn't regret losing $ 8.25 on this disaster is because she was slightly upset. No, wait, I'm sorry to lose the money: it was not true and she survived Mr. Williamson, if you read this, you made the same movie (some violence and / or scary things offset by clever kids making sarcastic jokes and references to other movies) just a FEW for many times now (I count 6 so for, not including Scream 3 and whatever follows it), and I would really appreciate it if you wanted to stop, otherwise I might just have to kidnap you and threaten you with a armbue, okay? :-)
