Oh, what obscure, I'll reveal the secret: This movie stinks! Yes, there are some nifty dinosaur effects that for their time were probably really exciting to see. Now they don't cut it, but they're not terrible. They are just good enough to tolerate without being able to laugh at it. Then they just sit here and I sit and watch this, not laughing, not tense, just bored. It stinks! <br /> <br /> If I can practice my Jay Sherman for a moment, the movie really does. The box promises cowboys versus dinosaurs, and delivers in a very generic sense. Guys dressed as cowboys are struggling with a couple of big dinosaurs. But really these guys are a bunch of sissies, and the hero is a loser (more on this later) and the dinosaurs are hardly scary. The reason is a yawner, and there is not much technical wrong with what is there to laugh at. It's just crying and gently. After some terrific night chemographs (filmed in one and a half colors I called it), we get the plot that involves some people, doing things. That's what I caught. Oh, and they are at the turn of the century in Mexico, so they love at least like cowboys, even though they don't work like that. <br /> <br /> Then a bunch of these people I think were human, they go into the desert and they stumble upon these dinosaurs (after they find a miniature horse ... I don't know, just let us proceed). Then the film breaks down into a truly pathetic King Kong ripoff in the final act. At that time, I had lost the will to keep my eyes on the TV level myself, and I drifted in and out of consciousness. <br /> <br /> "The Deer" is played by the guy from under the Apesens Planet who played mostly Charlton Heston when Heston decided he would not be in the sequel. He was picked up by the plot, shock and shock, he looks exactly like Heston. It's all about everything he needs. I was really sorry when he was the movie's hero, because everything he does is glowing, snearing, bagging the chicken in the movie. (Who's called TJ. Unfortunately, she's not a prostitute or finally the name of the origin would have been revealed). Meanwhile, his friend kills all the dinosaurs, saves the day many times, and what does he get for it? Not recognition, nothing! And he dies and sacrifices for his friends! They don't even wait for him while they escape! Drilling, long, slow pace, with a little to enjoy until the movie decides to copy King Kong's scripts on its own, is best to avoid this movie unless you enjoy pain on the scale of dropping an anvil on your eye.
