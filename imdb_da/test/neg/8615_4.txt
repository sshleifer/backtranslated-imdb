I watched this movie tonight and I need to say it's horrible! I expected it to be great because you know we don't usually have many movies about Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture; but already in the beginning it started in a bad way: the introduction of the movie did not seem to have an end! The reason is so weak, and if you take the battles and soundtrack off, you really have nothing useful! The director of this movie does not seem to have any important notions of how much time to spend in introduction and flashbacks for example. (Not to mention any other things) <br /> <br /> For people like me, who wants to watch a big vampire movie, I really recommend watching '' Lost Boys '' or '' Interview with the vampire '' .
