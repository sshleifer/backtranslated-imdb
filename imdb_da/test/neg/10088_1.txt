It was terribly clean and simple. What was their message? Where did the movie go? It has all the ingredients in a sub-B movie. From the plotless storyline the bad play to cheesey slow-mo cinematography. I will soon see a movie I have already seen as Goodfellas, a Bronx Tale, even fat. There are no similar signs. In the end, you just want everyone to die already. Save 2 hours in your life and jump over it.
