I'm not surprised that this movie did well at the Hamptons Film Festival. It is a low film that would appeal well to superficial people. Two actors pretend to be actors in a relationship struggling and looking for a lost dog. The film is claimed to explore the dynamics of the relationship, but the relationship is far too small to deserve any such exploration. This couple has one dimension: they fight, they tease, so they love and struggle a little more. The brief moment of tenderness does not reveal any possible reason why these two would be involved in each other as they gave their toxic and fleeting conditions. Beautiful shot, excellent score, but without any profit in the script or the characters, this short is just that.
