Years ago, when DARLING LILI was playing on TV, it was always the pan and scan version that I hated and decided to wait and see the movie in its actual widescreen format. So when I saw a cheap DVD of this Julie Andrews / Blake Edwards opus, I decided to buy and watch it once and for all. <br /> <br /> Boy, what a horrible movie. It is so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to begin by describing where and when it goes so terribly wrong. Looking at it now, it is obvious to all fans of film that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had hit gold with Andrews in musicals (MARY POPPINS, SOUND OF MUSIC, THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE etc. .) But also because Andrews was stubborn from staring at projects that became famous on stage by Julie himself (CAMELOT, MY FAIR LADY, etc.) because Hollywood thought she was not sexy or glamorous enough. So Blake created this stillborn effort to show off his wife in a bizarre collection of spy story / war movie / romance / slapstick comedy / musical. DARLING LILI suffers from several personalities, without knowing who or what it is. Some specific scenes are good or effective, but overall, it just doesn't work at a point where it's very embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that the version on the DVD is "the director's cut" or in this case "let's save what we can" from this infamous box office flop. In the release of the DVD, Edwards cut 19 scenes (19 !!!!!!!!) from the original inflated theatrical version to this more streamlined and yet remarkably inefficient version. The film moves along with no idea what it is. We are 25 minutes in it and we still do not know what is happening or why we see what is going on. What kind of spy is Lili? How strong is she? Was she always responsible for a person's death? Instead, we see a boring looking look at Rock Hudson, who is trying to woo a thoroughly bored look at Julie Andrews. Things have not helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love. Why does Julie fall to Hudson? Why he and not other men she got involved in? There should have been one of her ex hanging around, trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret. This would have given us a much-needed contrast to the confused action. It would also have given us some impetuous to the wood case. There is no catalyst in this story. You only have to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the author just came up with ideas inspired by Andrew's (and Edwards) past successes. The best (or worst) example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follow a group of children singing in the middle of a forest. Edwards channels SOUND OF MUSIC. It's no wonder he removed it from the DVD. Back in 1970, the scene may have worked at a certain level, but today, the moment's series of desperation. There are other album elements inspired directly by Andrews / Edwards other films. The endless scenes of dogfights are inspired by the much better MODERN MILLION. The musical moment "I give you three guesses" was created to make fun of Julie's MARY POPPINS persona who becomes "raunchy" with Julie and does a striptease in the action. The endless bird's eye view of Julie running towards Hudson's plan is another "blink" on SOUND OF MUSIC. It's all confusing. Julie plays a singer, born of a German father and British mother who lives in England, but sings her (English) songs in Paris. You never know exactly where the story takes place. Some moments are only poorly edited. Like when Julie and her "uncle" are on horseback. They talk and talk, and then Julie suddenly splashes in the middle of the sentence. I'm like "what happened?" <br /> <br /> Comedy bits are scary and cringe-worthy. Every scene with the French police is pathetic. Where is Peter Sellers when you really need him. The act is stupid beyond belief. When Julie and her "uncle" are on their way to Germany on the train, Hudson squadron shoots rounds of bullets on the train and almost kills Lili in the process. Brilliant. What is also fun about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night, but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly out the next morning. It's a slow train down there. <br /> <br /> The musical moments. The beginning is the best part of the whole movie (and the reason I gave this movie 3 stars), but its effect is significantly reduced because it is repeated at the end. Speaking of superfluous, did we really need to see a can-can dance, Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too? "The girl in no man's land" is ok, even though it is bleeding obvious, but that moment just makes no sense because Lili sings it to a group of wounded soldiers in a French hospital, which makes me wonder: how many soldiers were wounded indirectly the result of her espionage? <br /> <br /> The whole project is effortless and without energy. The romance is 100% incredible. Rock Hudson is too old and tired looking (check out the museum scene). Julie looks confused as if she is on Valium. But what really kills this unimaginable project is Julie, who plays a German spy. Edwards desperately wanted to remove Mary Poppin's syndrome, which hit his wife and thought playing a traitor was a good career decision. As much as I like Julie, she is no Greta Garbo, who drew it so beautifully in MATA HARI. It's fun enough, although Julie plays a German spy, she still comes across as shattering and sweet. <br /> <br /> How bad is DARLING LILI? Even after 37 years since the release, Blake Edwards felt he still had to work on it for his DVD release.
