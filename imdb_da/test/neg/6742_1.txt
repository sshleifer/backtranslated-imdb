This movie is so bad, there are no words to describe it. If I got a camcorder from a monkey dancing for an hour and a half, it would be a lot more entertaining than this. The reason is so boring and unimaginitive it is not even worth mentioning. The best part of the movie was when the credits rolled and I got a chuckle knowing that the main actor's name was James Bond III. Just trust me and be far away from this trash!
