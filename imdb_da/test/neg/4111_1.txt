This movie reminds me of old B movies, but not in a good way. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first scene, I thought it was going to be a spear on one of the early SF movies. The horrific spectacle, the plastic recordings and the visible visual effects gave me the impression. <br /> <br /> But no, the movie is really that bad. The story is a complete nonsense, the effects are below the level of a television production; Although editing is a mess. The only thing that kept me in the theater was that I wanted to know the end of history, although I was pretty sure it would be stupid (and it was). <br /> <br /> There are better ways to spend your time and money.
