I recently went to the cinemas to see the new (2007) version of Bridge for Teribithia. Then I went to the library to rent the older version to see it again without paying again. I must say I was very disappointed! I found the older version to have horrible plays as well as corny lines including Jessie saying, "I know dad, but I've hurt so much inside" after Leslie dies. It was pretty awfully done and the casting wasn't much better in my opinion. I looked amazing and did not say strange that they reminded it. The story is good, but trust me to spend the money and see the new version, if you just see the old one, you can never experience Teribithia's true magic.
