The idea behind Dead Silence is amazing: Zombie eruptions take place during a parody radio talk show. There was so much going for this movie. Unfortunately, as soon as the zombies appeared, everything was lost. The movie is ridiculous and only those who have a passion for cheesy b-flick horror will enjoy it. The zombies were so stupid! They ran around and clapped their arms. They looked like a bunch of people putting a haunted house to primary school. <br /> <br /> I know this is a brief review, but I just don't see the need to invest a lot in this. It's a silly movie. You have been warned.
