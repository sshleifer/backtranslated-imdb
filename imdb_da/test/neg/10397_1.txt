Dante would have been mortified if he knew his masterpiece was about to be PUPPET !!! Also the actors who played the puppets are selling outs. Because of the fact that playing a puppet doesn't work, it's just about nothing to do. No one really wants to see who the doll was. people just care who played a big part in as a real movie. It's just annoying how you can suck such a wonderful man and his faith in this silly little movie. This should be a crime and .... I can't believe you would destroy a book like that. I thought the movie was quite ridiculous and had to be destroyed !!!! It completely destroys what you suppose to get from reading it. You just make it a big joke.
