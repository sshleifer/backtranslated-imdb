In terms of historical accuracy, this is the worst Roman movie I've ever seen. The list, not only of errors but of ideas that are flat impossible, would run longer than three hours of film, but just to give you an idea ... Julius Caesar and Augustus are presented as liberal Democrats, take the side "The people" against "the nobles". This is obviously absurd. The Caesars were as noble as you could get. Their interest was to consolidate power and stabilize a country that had been destroyed by 150 years of civil war. There were reformers, especially the Gracchi brothers, who lived about 100 years earlier, and to some extent told the rights of ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that are completely ridiculous if you know something about the period. "Cleopatra" with Richard Burton will give you a much better idea of ​​how events unfold, imaginative, even if it is. Historical accuracy is one thing. Action and dialogue is something else, and here this film is dangerously close to being a poor junior high school production. I blew out several times, especially when Julia, Augusto's daughter, meets a lover. They connect passionately as she breathes: "My father ..." "Oh, your father, your father .... your father would reject." Peter O'Toole is at his worst forced to gnaw himself through some very pompous and stupid lines. The actor who plays Augustus as a young man is such a nebbish --- and the character is written as such --- it is impossible to imagine him as the cunning, hip, machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here he is just a glow that has to tell what he should do most of the time. Charlotte Rampling manages to come out of a signed role as Livia, Augustus's wife, with dignity. If she had a more extensive role to play, she could have saved this production from absurdity. <br /> <br /> There are some good shooting and shooting shots, helped by lots of standard CGI issues. It was strange that this was made for British television (and seems to be a British-Italian co-production), but is marked with an "R" rating. <br /> <br /> The DVD image is excellent and the Dolby Digital soundtrack is very nice, even if you only notice it during the few action sequences, as the movie is mostly spoken. <br /> <br /> Almost every Roman movie, even "Cleopatra" or "The Roman Empire's Fall," has more historicity --- to say nothing of convincing drama --- than this bizarre classics Illustrated, Jr. customization. This gives new meaning to the very abused phrase, "Based on a true story." In this case, they could have said, "Proposed by real events."
