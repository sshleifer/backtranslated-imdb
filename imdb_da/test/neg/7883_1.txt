This movie is about two female killers on a trip to kill random men they meet. <br /> <br /> "Wow," Baise-moi "has become the worst movie of all time in my list. The ground is crazy, pointless and unnecessary. The whole movie is full of violence and sex, and I'm sure no sweet parent will show this movie to their children. I don't understand what people come up with by making this movie or watching this movie. Perhaps somebody somewhere has fulfilled their perverted desires. There is simply no excuse or justification for the existence of this perverted and missing part of the work. The only consolation I offer myself is that I quickly looked it up so I didn't waste much time.
