This is one of the most horrible movies I have had the accident collecting. Don't make me wrong, I love a good zombie flick, but it wasn't one of them. <br /> <br /> ... Can as well (from the open scenes, at least) be called 'Titty Zombies from outer space'. It had absolutely nothing to do with the other movie or video game (as far as I could tell.) <br /> <br /> The best aspect of the movie is how the two main characters can be covered by so much blood and remain so unlucky . I would definitely suggest giving this and miss and staying with a more secure zombie pleaser like '28 days later 'or' Dawn of the Living Dead '(remake, of course, unless you're in a serious fighting action.)
