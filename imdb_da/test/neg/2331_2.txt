I thrive at the cinema .... but there is a limit. A NAME is not enough to make A MOVIE! The beginning of the film puts us in a mood to expect the invisible yet. But we remain hungry (or angry) until the end. Things get so confused that I admit that I didn't understand the end or was there an end to this nonesense. The opportunity to make an excellent movie was there, but the goal was completely missed. Next...
