For those of you who have never heard of the movie so far (of which I assume there are many lucky people who do not have it), I will sum it up for you. Ryan Gosling plays Leland's title character, which also serves as the film's narrator (a la Kevin Spacey in American Beauty, but without the intelligent observations on life). Leland is in prison for killing a retarded child, and the film is trying to figure out why he did it. He seems to be a nice boy (if not mentally absent) and is portrayed by Gosling with a complete lack of violence, anger or agenda (and if you wait for him to reveal his eerie side later in the movie, don't waste your time - it's not that kind of movie). Once in juvenile prison, Leland is teaching teaching by Pearl Madison, depicted by Don Cheadle (who is not capable of anything but quality, even in bad movies). Pearl tries to unlock Leland's mystery in an attempt to find out how such a child could do such a thing, and then he could write a book about it later (along with being a juvenile teacher, Pearl is also an aspiring author). <br /> <br /> The relationship between Leland and Pearl is the driving story behind the movie as their conversations reveal Leland's past to the audience. But to call it the central focus would mean that this enchanting film had one. It does not. The United States of Leland boasts an impressive cast that seems to be detrimental to the movie. It seems as if author / director Matthew Ryan Hodge (don't worry you didn't hear about him, he never did anything) had to give each character a personal arch and personality error to get the actors to play them. Most of these features and stories are clichéd, and most are underdeveloped and unresolved. I will try to break them down here: Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson are the parents of the slaughtered delayed boy (I love how the movie stopped calling the child "retarded", never "mentally disabled". That part made me laugh inside ), they seem to have a cold relationship, because all suburban marriage in modern cinema must be cold. Their other two children are Michelle Williams, who apparently is an aspiring actress about going to college, and Jena Malone, who plays the same troubled teen archetype she always plays, this time with a heroine addiction. Malone was also Leland's girlfriend, who gives him his link to his victim. Williams' boyfriend who was orphaned to live with the family and is a baseball player looking to go to the same college as his girlfriend, is played by Chris Klein. He ends up doing more with his character than any other player who manages to steal the movie at times. Lena Olin is Leland's mother who seems to be persistently sad for some reason. Kevin Spacey (also the executive producer) is Leland's cold and absent father, a famous novelist. Eventually, Sherilyn Fenn will appear to put a wrinkle in Leland's history - if you just don't care at that time. Oh yes, and there is a drug-dealing ex-boyfriend, a couple of fellows and a Pearl's employee with whom he has an affair with his long-distance boyfriend (played by Kerry Washington). <br /> <br /> Sorry if all that synopsis and character breakdown took so long. If it seemed meaningless and boring, you just experienced a bit of what I did in the 108 minutes I used to watch the movie. But the monstrous bumps of exaggerated clichés are the smallest of the film's crimes. The biggest thing is that the whole exercise is completely meaningless. We don't get a fascinating look at an uneasy mind, we don't get an effective explanation, we don't get much of anything. Considering that it sucked so much, I will continue and pamper the end for you so you never have to see it: Leland stoked the retard because all Leland could see in the world was sadness and wanted to save Corky (or whatever the victim name was) eyesight. It's like the worst emo band in the world made an album called "The World Is Sad, So You Killed A Retard". Oh, and eventually Leland dies in a sequence so dependent on incredible coincidence that it would have ruined the movie if the movie didn't already suck. Of course he eventually dies because it made the film so deep. <br /> <br /> I give the movie 2 stars because the actors themselves all did a good job with the unwanted file they were given. The scenes with Cheadle and Gosling together were even interesting at some levels. But to rewrite the film itself, you have to think that movies are more than the sum of their parts, kiddo.
