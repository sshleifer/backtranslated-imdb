I was looking forward to seeing this movie and was therefore extremely disappointed when I found it completely and completely rubbish. Akerman's direction is both heavy and cliché (how much more cliché can you get than Paris at night?). The male caste seems to have been selected exclusively for their beginner to Egon Schile's anxiety ridden self-portraits. Nevertheless, the themes of jealousy and fraud that should have been the primary focus of a film of this type have been left almost unexplored. What is left is a turgid melodrama that takes an age to get started and even to finish. The only advantage of this kind of movie is that it makes you realize how good Goddard and Truffaut really are.
