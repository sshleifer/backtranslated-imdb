This movie coincides with Mike Allred's cartoon mini-series, "Red Rocket Seven", and tells the story of a foreigner who fled to Earth to wait for "Astroesque", which ties into the Book of Revelation and Apocrypha. This is only part of a larger story (if the movie confuses you, read also "RR7"). You can easily tell that Allred is used to telling stories with pictures. The direction is very good and the effects are not bad for a $ 500 budget. Unfortunately, Mike used many friends to play the roles and probably didn't have the heart to say they couldn't act. Also, Mike doesn't show his writing skills in this movie. His dialouge spoon feeds plotted to you and doesn't let you enjoy the characters. This was actually disappointing given his immense writing ability shown in his comics. 4 out of 10
