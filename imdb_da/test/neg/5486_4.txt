I have now seen a few of Pedro Almodóvar, but it must be the most disappointing so far. This movie seemed to lack zaniness which is usually everywhere in his movie, and history has never got me interested. Many Almodóvar regulars appear in this movie, so it's not as if there were any talents on the screen, but this movie just seemed more serious than his other movies. If there was a comical edge to this movie, I certainly couldn't find it and it made a surprisingly weak movie.
