I can see what this movie was about to do. Unfortunately, it just never completely ends the deal. The "reality crime" aspect works fine and the shots are all first rate. In fact, a couple of scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody kind of way. In particular, the silhouette of the detective speaks to the beat-up woman, the scene of the detective goes through the garbage, and the father binds flies. At times, a few scenes fall into too much dialogue. Instead of showing the viewer, the author treats it too much like a book. But the real problem lies in editing. The story does not flow. It fails to do much of the sum of the parts. In the end, you are confused with what actually happens. Those who like this kind of detective film like to follow along and fuse the puzzle while the protagonists do it. With such poor editing it is difficult if it is not nearly impossible to do this.
