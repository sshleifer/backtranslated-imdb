And then it started with "Shreik" a release of horror movies, so we had Scary Movie, a real good attempt on a new kind of genre that the famous send up. but .... now we have: Scary Movie * Scary Movie 2 Scary Movie 3 Scary Movie 4 * Date Movie Meet Spartans Not Another Team Movie * plus many more (really funny movies marked with *) <br /> <br / > and ..... Superhero movie .... it seems that the people who make these movies cannot yet understand what makes send-ups fun. Using rip-offs from other movies in a fun way is all good and good if done properly, but not many manufacturers seem to know how to do it. Scary movie (1) did well, the following successors were so horrible when trying to overplay the franchise, but it was redeemed by Scary Movie 4. Not another teen movie was good because it used the spoofer well ... and for her credit, i am sick of teen movies. However, this movie plays like a bad version of all these. it depends on the pimp, it would make even the 3 stooges cringes that break the image of Stephen Hawking, and so when people start boring (and the producers knew when this would be), we are treated with Pamela Anderson in a hard dress. To conclude should be to make a homage-like mock-up of an original movie with an original story, not plotting random start offs of legitimate movies on the storyline of a real movie. <br /> <br /> I shake the idea of ​​"SCI-FI MOVIE" and get my seppuku knife ready
