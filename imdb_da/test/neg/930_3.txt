It borrowed scenes from LOTR, Matrix, Star Wars, etc. The humor is so dry, constructed, and corny that you can't help but occasionally occasionally by its iniquity and the fact that you see it. Exactly what you would expect from a HK comedy. The average person would enter with an IQ of 100 and leave with less than 80. Stephen Chow is an obvious omission from this movie. The mood would have worked better with Stephen. The Mandarin version of this movie is not as good as the Cantonese original. The graphics are poor compared to its Hollywood counterparts. There is overdependence on low quality CG. My biggest complaint is its end. The origin of the white horse is so clearly described in "Journey to the West" (JW) that this alternative explanation does not work well with history. Despite its many flaws, this film has far more entertainment value than the other movie, Nicholas Tse, contributing in - The Promise.
