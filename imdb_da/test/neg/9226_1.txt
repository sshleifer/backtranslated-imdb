If the following sounds tempting, rush to your local Blockbuster and hire this movie after-speed: 1. Awful 60s hairstyles, from pathetic perms to risky ducktails. <br /> <br /> 2. The worst child actor in the world ever, who does nothing but cries and says DADDY in the most annoying voice that can be imagined. <br /> <br /> 3. Lots of stock footage of alligators and monkeys that aren't related to the movie. Not at all. <br /> <br /> 4. Stereotypical Indians who use blowing pipes and talking gobbles. Oh, and it goes without saying that they whoop around a bonfire. <br /> <br /> 5. Hilariously fake fly-crash mechanics where the throw actually throws itself into the corners of cardboard sets. <br /> <br /> 6. The exterior shots of 5 that look suspiciously like a toy jet on a string that is routed in a blue light study light. <br /> <br /> 7. Terrible special effects that make them used in the first Star Trek series look sharp when compared. (Special mention: The little boy's blonde hair glowing. Oh dear ..) <br /> <br /> 8. Tight editing and continuity where background objects move between scenes, the sound track completely changes without any warning, etc. <br /> <br /> 9. Don't you have enough money to hire a professional dancer? Get any lady from off the street to prance about as an idiot! No one will see the difference! Is .. <br /> <br /> 10. An "exciting" climax with quicksand, snakes (several items from the archives) and a ton of false blood. Don't forget to put in a stupid "tribal" sounding song either! The more sensible among you, however, will wait for it to be inevitable appearance of MST3K when this classic TV show resumes, and then you can see it in the spirit it was intended for. Any other kind of pleasure to be derived from this crap is unthinkable .. not to mention unworkable. So don't even try it. 0/10
