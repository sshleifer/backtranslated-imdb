Ghoulies IV starts in a museum storage room where PVC and leather-clad blonde Alexandra (Stacie Randall) are looking for an old jewel, after she has exhibited various guards, she calls the demon Faust, whom she worships and wants sex with. Unfortunately, she lost the jewel so he is not so happy and orders her to get the last remaining ... Which belongs to Jonathan Graves (returning from the original Ghoulies (1985) Peter Liapis) who has experience with demonic possession and things like that after the events of the original Ghoulies. Alexandra sets out to find the jewel so that she can permanently bring Faust to Earth from 'the other side' to, yes, I don't really know. Erm, it's really about it ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Jim Wynorski, whose very names name shakes my spine when attached to a movie I'm wasting 90 minutes of My life on Goulies IV is as expected complete, total & total crap from start to finish & it's as simple and straightforward as that. Ahem, "script", cough, by Mark Sevi has virtually nothing in common with the other Ghoulie's movie except in the title and they managed to convince Liapis to reproduce his role, which also has the added bonus of great ability to use footage from the original, even if it has no relevance at all. The story is almost nonexistent, the whole movie is a real chore to look at, it's incredibly boring and moronic, it's slow, it's predictable, it's creaking clean as far as blood or gore goes and it has two cartoon aids that I assume is supposed to fill the Ghoulies quota, even though they do not look like they did in the previous films and are actually just embarrassing to see, I actually think they are practicing to be ventriloquist during most of the movie as when they speak their mouths don't move ... You know I don't want to talk or think about Ghoulies IV anymore so please believe me when I say this is a big piece of shit of elephant-shaped proportions, don't waste your time or your money . br /> <br /> Dirctor Wynorski turns in a consistent rotten movie on virtually every level, special effects are horrible as is the whole movie. Apparently Ghoulies IV is supposed to be a kind of horror comedy, but it lacks both goals by the proverbial mile and it is neither fun nor scary. The best thing about this movie is the actress Randall in her PVC & leather outfit running around trying to find the jewel and it's hardly worth sitting through this rubbish to see. There is a half decent runaway car scene with a few crashes, but it looks like it was edited from a completely different movie & given Wynorski's track record I'm sure it was. Forget something to do as there is no one. Technical Ghoulies IV sucks, it's obvious that it had a low budget, but it's simply not an excuse that it's so bad, is it? Liapis is back in the cast, although he probably wants to be gone, PVC-covered treasure Randall is easily the best thing about this movie that says a lot. <br /> <br /> Ghoulies IV is bad, that's nothing else to really do. I honestly can't see anyone enjoying movies getting something out of this, I just can't. I can't believe I would recommend the original Ghoulies anywhere, but it is going to happen now, because even though it is crooked, it is a hell of a lot better than Ghoulies IV, one to avoid people and you can thank me later. The things I sit through, so you don't have to, honestly ...
