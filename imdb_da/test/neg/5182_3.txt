After a while I realized that it was just my IQ slowly falling. Frostbite is one of the pathetic films where no one and I mean no one even tries. I rooted the dorky heroes to die within this trash (how did they even manage to fit in anyway?) Traci Lords, the queen of B movies, was terribly unfunny and tore me and my friends off by not showing their breasts once. <br /> <br /> "The signs", although I use this term loosely, are so exaggerated and one-dimensional that they might as well have used cardboard cuts. The "knowledge" (I also use this term loosely) is simply fun. A freak's freak causes an earthquake. ROFLCOPTER! Our "hero" gets an ass acupuncture by Traci Lords. Oh God, I can't breathe! The blind guy uses the F word repeatedly! It is too much!!! <br /> <br /> Say what you want about the play, but I thought Adam Grimes did a pretty good job of playing a mentally challenged snowboarder. Apart from that, the only source of entertainment value is boobs. I think I counted three, maybe four pairs in the whole movie, spread over maybe five minutes on the screen. It is five minutes worth looking out of 83 minutes of unfunny waste. Don't look at this. See Barb Wire with Pamela Anderson - at least there was plenty of nudity and action in the trashy flick!
