Sorry, this movie was a badly made for TV movie. Is the rest of you on drugs when you saw it? I thought hair, make-up and characters were bad 2-dimensional types. The story is questionable, especially since all the protagonists are dead or almost dead. I think it's not well done either ... what was that with the hair on the main source of the turtles? It looked badly glued, and the side bars looked as if they were going to fall at any time. It did not feel like something new was revealed in the band's history and how members met other bands and people. I laughed all the way, Frank Zappa looked stupid, so did Mama Cass, and so did the Beatles. They were made to look stupid and ridiculous. Also the other band members like Jim Morrison, Donovan also took a big hit looking stupid as well. Kind of terrible, if that's how you remember these people. It's a bad history lesson on music, it's fictional as it was made.
