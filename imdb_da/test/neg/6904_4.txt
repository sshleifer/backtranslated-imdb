Let's see ... a few dozen Gary Larson gags as well as his illustration style, a possibly legally difficult wholesale gift of an Aardman character, a more than generous sprinkling of artistic direction from various Pixar movies, positively Lion King-esquire villains living in which volumes an elephant cemetery in the middle of farmland, oh, and a smelly 'riverdance joke' ten years after any possible relevance. The kids (three and five) liked it, but boy, it was a move for dad. Just another weak attempt by Nickelodean Films to connect to the animation explosion. I really want them to spend a little more money on character design, on the render, on a script, on a director.
