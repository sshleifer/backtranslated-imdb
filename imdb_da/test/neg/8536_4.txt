Having trouble in Chicago, the Salomon family moves to a remote North Dakota farmhouse to begin again, but their attempts at idyllic farming life are disturbed when their teenage daughter Jess (Kristen Stewart) and her 3-year-old brother Ben begin to see and are being attacked by supernatural beings who will not allow them to live in peace. The messengers start decent, even though it eventually becomes a generic horror movie that is much more humorous than scary. After reading the reason I thought it could have been a decent movie, as it sounded scary and it had potential. Unfortunately, the film did not live up to its potential, even though I should have expected it, as the trailer was horrible. The play was probably the worst part about it. It was full of silly sequences and bland dialogue. The signs were not developed at all, and most of them appeared as a bunch of idiots, so it was hard to feel sympathy for them. <br /> <br /> The executives did a terrible job building excitement. They were mainly dependent on cheap scares as loud noises and random jumps. The music was really over the top and it just made it easier for the viewer to telegraph the next "scary" moment. I also didn't like how they just used one place for the whole movie. The house was the centerpiece of history, and this is where the majority of the film took place, so it became a bit boring after a while to see the same area. I also didn't like the actors' close-ups. During a conversation, the camera will continuously move from character to second within five seconds, and it became very annoying. The managers created a decent atmosphere and they get some points to make their movie stylish. But since we've come a long way in style and effects, it's not that hard to make your movie look good, especially if you're working on a Hollywood movie. The play was horrible and if this movie had been released in December, I am sure it would have received several Razzie nominations. Kristen Stewart showed some talent in the Panic Room, but you wouldn't be able to tell that she has the talent to see her performance in The Messengers. She was okay in acting and that was it. The rest of the time she was dry and unconvincing. Penelope Anne Miller was just awful when it came to everything. It sounded like she was reading her lines, and she had some of the worst facial expressions I've ever seen. Dylan McDermott was just a lot of wood and he showed almost no feelings. John Corbett gave the best performance and he had a few good scenes. The twins who played Ben were also decent and managed to perform many of the adult actors. Overall, this lame horror movie is not worth seeing because of it's humor and lazy filmmaking. Rating 4/10
