This movie is TRASH from the word go. First, it gives an account of a season that took place 16 YEARS AGAIN! So what? This film had just as much depth as a bottle cap. It makes a complex person like Bob Knight a cartoon character. <br /> <br /> Swearing doesn't like me, but I'm still amazed that ESPN showed a more curse movie than a Kevin Smith movie on a basic cable channel. The F-word was dropped at least 20 times before the first commercial break. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible, and anyone connected with it had to be embarrassed. I rate this at the same level as Jaws IV - The Revenge, and everybody wins ... 2 movies that are in the Crapfest Hall of Fame.
