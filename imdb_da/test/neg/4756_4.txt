I love B-movies, but I can be aware from the start that I see one. I can't believe anyone could spoil a movie about foreigners and predators so badly. <br /> <br /> Aliens and Predator are AWESOME. This movie made a big joke out of them. The creators did not take the film seriously at all. I'm very disappointed with how Strauss Jerks handled this movie. They made a mockery of amazing characters. It was as if they were trying to be serious at the beginning when their writers were high and gave up. Almost nothing was persistent, the protagonists were terrible and were not foreigners or predators. I'm so ridiculously sad that no one takes Alien and Predators seriously anymore. These characters are icons of American pop culture, and the creators of this movie showed no respect for the original films. They should not be allowed to deposit the names of the previous films and they should be ashamed of themselves
