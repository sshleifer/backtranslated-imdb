If this was nominated for a screenwriting award by WGA, a professional screenwriter association, then it is time to hang the word processor. Amazing scary writing, direction, production, at all levels, even for a TV movie. No clich√© goes unused in this jerky bad movie. What did they think? Does anyone really think kids are stupid enough to see this?
