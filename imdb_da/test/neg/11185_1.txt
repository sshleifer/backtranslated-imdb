How do I describe horrors? !!! First, some points: First, this review must be taken with a grain of salt - I saw this 20 years ago when I was a boy at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I give away some scenes and plot points. But it doesn't have much of a plot. Finally, I do not enjoy this type of art film. <br /> <br /> This movie was directed by the proto-author Luis Bunuel. He was surreal and dadaist. These were modernist themes or movements popularly critical in the 1920s and early 1930s. Surealism was the art school that made things hyperreal, but often had Freudian symbolism. Dadaism is based on what is supposedly the first word made by an infant - Dada or Dad. <br /> <br /> Making it black and white, it was also made by a band of communists (or as they preferred term, socialists). Bunuel and his group of fellow artists and artists had worked on a number of symbolic ideas and questions in Spain and France between the world wars. Dadaism and surrealism have influenced many artists - The Police (Doo doo doo da), poet Arthur Rambaud, Edvard Munch (The Scream), Rene Magritte (floating hats in space), Salvador Dali (melting watches) and even Hitchcock (Psycho). No Norman Rockwell. <br /> <br /> Here's what I like most about this movie: a girl meets a cow; her eye is beaten by a razor; clownish men cavort in a meadow. There is not, as I said, much of a plot, but then again it must be the meaning. <br /> <br /> This was attacked as porn again then and would be again today. One of the surrealism's trademarks is a significant anti-feminism.
