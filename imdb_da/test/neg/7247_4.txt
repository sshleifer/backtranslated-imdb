Director Lesley Selander is thoroughly routine outdoor yarn "The Yellow Tomahawk" (1954) pits Cheyenne against US Cavalry with leathery hard Rory Calhoun in the middle as the spicy, buckskin-clad Indian scout to guide the survivors to safety. This United Artists Western was lentil in color, but the TV print that Turner Classic Movies aired was inexplicable in black and white. The action opens with Adam Reed (Rory Calhoun from "Black Spurs"), who excludes several Indians and rides to palaver with his old friend and Cheyenne boss, Four Knife (Lee Van Cleef of "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" ) who kills on his mind. Four Knife warns Adam that his Cheyenne mother is ready to annihilate a nearby cavalry quickly under construction because it violates a treaty that the Indians made with the government. Heading to Inform Commanding Commandant, Major Ives (Warner Anderson of "Objective, Burma!") About the impending Indian attack, Adam discovers a beautiful tree lymph that seductively enters water into a lake. Katherine 'Kate' The Ball (Peggy Castle of "I, Jury") is another of the stupid women in westerns who bathe naked in the middle of the Indian country without care in the world. The castle seems to be really nude in her bathing scenes, perhaps the most memorable scene for everyone in this otherwise predictable western. Of course, Major Ives's Adam rejects the Fire Knife warning until the command recognizes that someone has ripped his munitions dump far beyond the fort. This is one of the many questions left by Richard Alan Simmons' manuscript unanswered in this trim 82-minute oater. Why should the cavalry limit their ammunition in a secret place in the desert, rather than keeping them in place in the fort? In the past, they made this discovery than the Indians attack, knocking out of the hero and leaving him as the only survivor. Before this attack, a couple of white prospectors ride into the fort. Sawyer (Peter Graves from "Stalag 17") brings his partner with an arrow in his chest. While Adam gets hot water to help remove the arrow, the greedy Sawyer laughs in the deeper and kills his helpless partner. Later, we learn that Sawyer and his partner had hit gold. The question of the spread of gold is also unanswered after our heroes survive the ordeal. Adam and Fire Knife have a final pow-wow and Fire Knife requires Adam to survive Major Ives or everyone will die. Of course, Adam refuses, and the Indians begin to whittle down the whites. James Best in a supporting role as cavalry gets an arrow in the back of his efforts. Noah Beery, Jr., plays a targeted Mexican scout followed by a sexy Indian girl named Honey Bear (Oscar-winning actress Rita Moreno of "West Side Story") and Robert Bray of "Lassie" fame are at hand as the sick -fated cavalry officer, whom Kate had planned to marry. The biggest surprise in this eerie western shot on the spot in Kanab, Utah, is that the evil cavalry officer Ives, who slaughtered Indian men, women and children on the infamous Sand Creek Massacre, has kept a secret that he is an Indian too! Ironically, the tight bow that Fire Knife gives out of friendship to Adam at the start of hostilities is what our heroic scout uses to kill the stalwart Cheyenne warrior after he has run out of bullets. "The Yellow Tomahawk" concludes with an ambiguous note. The survivors reach another outpost, Fort Ellis, where Adam and Ives deliver their respective reports on the problem to an army general, but we never learn the outcome of that meeting. Is this artistic ambiguity or another unanswered question. Producer Howard W. Koch is no relation to "Casablanca" scenarios Howard Koch. In the end, "The Yellow Tomahawk" is one of many proindian westerns that appeared in the aftermath of "Broken Arrow" (1950), where native Americans are seen as a noble savage who is unfairly treated by some but not all white. Selander, who made dozens of westerns in the 1950s and 1960s, makes this less Western tolerant despite its thin characters and familiar problems. Calhoun stands out from an above-average cast as the ever-serviceable leading man, and the beautiful Castle is worth looking at her feminine charm. Peter Graves plays a skunk as usual in most of his early roles. In fact, Lesley Selander made a more satisfying dramatic version of this film the year before "War Paint" (1953) with Robert Stack. By the way, Noah Beery Jr. and Rita Moreno both got stuck on "The Rockford Files".
