Imagine the worst that could ever be conceived by the human intellect. Now imagine something infinitely darker - I mean worse than that. Then multiply it with the amount of suckiness that Star Wars Holiday Special holds. This movie is far worse than that. "Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkness", starring as famous and acclaimed actors as Coolio and Langley Kirkwood (as the movie's "horrible antagonist" Count ORLOCK) is similar to eating one's own bowel movements entirely for life, condensed to approx. An hour and twenty minutes. To be honest, there is no way to turn to a review of this cinematic tragedy - embarked on communist propaganda, the promotion of drug abuse, futuristic anachronism and possibly the worst special effects since the (original) "world war". <The Soviet Union's hammer and century can be seen proudly of the sniffy sets they dare to call a spaceship. Lenin can be seen on several posters throughout the movie. And of course, religion has been abolished for two centuries then. So they do not know who this "God" is, even though they have no reservations to use his name in vain. But of course, in the Socialist Republic of Rum (presided over by interstellar president Baker), death stick as drugs is legalized and quite common. Nevertheless, disability mobility seems even worse than it is today (they do not have a wheelchair ramp). Racial tension still maintains the entire galaxy in a familiar / predictable way. We get great comment on ethnic division through lines like "is Dracula a brotha?", "We brothas must stick together", and "when you go black, you don't go back." When talking about the token black characters, one is played by Coolio. Playing a stereotype stoner, Coolio may be the most annoying and ridiculous vampire ever. Oh wait, another most ridiculous vampire ever. The valued title goes to our friend COUNT ORLOCK, from PLANET TRANSYLVANIA, in CARPATHIAN SYSTEM. These two do quite a few, between Coolio's attempt to spoil a paraplegic, strange attempt to make high animal sounds, a hairstyle 1004 years and GIGANTIC stretches of utterly worthless dialogue; and Count Orlock's twenty dollar generic Halloween style vampire costume, exploding chests or confusing inane back story. One wonders if they not only give Coolio the opportunity to become "as tall as a dragon in space without gravity", let him interact with the other "actors" and walk away from there. Count Orlock's motivation is also something in the question. Does he want "infinite darkness" that the movie's subtitle would have you believe? Does he want to eat the crew? Or will he * Coolio * to "kill them all"? Or does he want to give the disabled a chance in such a horrible future? It's not really something because none of this movie's plot makes sense anyway. The highlight of this movie has to end. More for the fact that it means that the film is over, than at a merit of the clear train break of a climax they speak in before the credits. Instead of overcoming Count Orlock in some sort of duel (the closest we get is a shot of Orlock that flips around at breakneck speeds in front of our protagonist who dies shortly after), our heroes beat him by cutting off his arm. an ordinary door. Orlock then continues to collapse, screaming in pain by an everyday but understandably painful injury. This is by far the most fun thing you get from this movie. When you look at a vampire's distorted face as he cries in pain, he gets you on the edge of your seat - with laughter. Almost worth the four bucks for it alone. Of course, right after we are treated with one of the movie's worst one-liners, the obligatory connection to sex, and perhaps the most ABRUPT EXCUSE FOR AN ENDING * EVER *. They run into the sun, and their ship literally blows up before they even come far away from influence. I think they just flooded the Wachowski bridges. to the worst final ever. <br /> <br /> I can only sleep at night because we know a successor is impossible. Certainly in this fact, we can say with certainty that this is the WORST MOVIE, EVERYTHING CREATED, and one that is never exceeded in low quality, lower budget and lower talent.
