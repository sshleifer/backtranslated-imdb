This movie contains real animals killed as a monkey was eaten by a snake and a crocible was cut open. I find it horrified and sick and seriously question the mental health of the director of this bin. <br /> <br /> This movie is so stupid and bold that it has no logic at all. <br /> There are many boobs and sex in this movie, still don't bother to see this trash for it, if you want to see breasts and sex, then watch a porn instead. There are also rape scenes in this movie that I found disgusting, just as women were raped and cut up and eaten. This movie is for sadists and those who get their kicks when people have been cut and eaten. <br /> <br /> Many of the animals that the monkey that appeared in this movie has none in the jungles of New Guinea. The local characters most seemed to be Asian, and no one seems to come from New Guinea. It seems this movie was made around a resort that I knew it was. Stay away from this trash can, it's sick and scared.
