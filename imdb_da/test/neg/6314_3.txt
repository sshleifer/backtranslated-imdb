Spoilers abound. You have been warned. I was thoroughly disappointed, it was my first STREET FIGHTER movie I've seen (I dare not go near 1994 joke yet). Very little grabs your attention in the STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most Japanese animation. The fighting is hilariously done aboard (Shun versus Zangief was a weaker one) and the dramatization is far too moody especially towards the end when Ryu is to control everything in his fight against his brother. The main street fighter, Ryu, is weakened to a much darker version inside of itself. Frustrations in controlling this darkness are further complicated by a little brother's sudden arrival! A shady street tournament is held with more than just fighting on the promoter's mind. <br /> <br /> What's with the artist's drawing of feet? Any anime drawn over the stomach is impressive. The soft nature of history makes STREET FIGHTER the genre too intelligent, and places much more emphasis on a character (Shun), it's not even a fighter in the video game! A character study of more than just the core stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times did you catch Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the imagination of the video game.
