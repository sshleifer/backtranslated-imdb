The Robot Holocaust is about the paralyzed, most pathetic attempt to make a post-apocalyptic movie I've seen. And I thought the Italians were masters of miserable Mad Max wannabes. Some of these movies like Escape 2000 are positively brilliant in comparison to this piece of poo. The ground is invisible ?? even with a narrator setting up each scene. And the boy pulls it. Scene after scene with no interest whatsoever. The special effects (and I use the word "special" loosely) consist of socks. Yes it's true ?? sokdukker! The play is immense. Angelika Jager is doing the worst performance I have ever seen. Sure she's French or German or anything ?? but man she is bad. I can't think of a single positive thing to say about the movie. So I stop there because ten sentences on this junk are about ten for many. But and fortunately for me, I saw the MST3K version of the Robot Holocaust. Some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this MST3K episode a winner. For a season one episode, the riffs come quickly and furiously and hit their mark almost every time. On my MST3K rating scale I give this episode a 4/5 ?? find out.
