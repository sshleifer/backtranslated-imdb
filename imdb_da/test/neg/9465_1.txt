When a plastic surgeon's wife dies, he gets his hunchbacked assistant to help him bring her back to life with various parts of other nubile, young, girls. This movie wants to be a Hersel Gordon Lewis-type hull, but doesn't fail. The play is beyond bad, the gorring effects are terrible (no, not in the good way), the plot is almost non-existent and not fun to be had. Skip it over. Want to know how incompetent it is? At some point you can actually see a slate board quite clearly. <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Candy Furr becomes topless and again in a feedback <br /> <br /> My character: F <br /> DVD Extras: Comment with Jeffrey Hogue and Cynthia Soroka , Another feature "How to make a doll"; Alternative title sequence with Hershel Gordon Lewis intro; 2 shorts ("Quest of the Perfect Woman" and "Maniac Hospital"); Cover art gallery with music by Dead Elvi; Trailers for "Dr. Black Mr. Hyde", "Boots and the Preacher"; "The Doctor and the Playgirls", "The Gruesome Twosome"; "Wizard of Gore"; "Horrible Dr Vacation"; "Wacky world of Doctor Morgus"; "Professor Lust", "Monstrosity"; "Fanny Hill meets Dr. Erotico"; and "I, Marquis DeSade" <br /> <br /> Easter Eggs: Theatrical Trailer; a scene from "just for hell of it"; and a trailer for "Ax"
