I saw this as a child before it had been yanked from the rotation, and even then it went bad in my mouth. There were some competently drafted gags, but making slapstick villains out of US citizens who had been interned in camps strictly because of their race was incredibly tasteless. <br /> <br /> Moe himself might have wanted this buried. He was a liberal guy. In his autobiography he told about visiting a city in the South Korean south, where he saw a black man go off the sidewalk to avoid going too close. Moe stepped into the street to show that it was not a problem and the man came back on the edge. Then turn it off again. Finally, the man told Moe nervously that if Moe didn't stop trying to divide the pavement with him, he could both get lynched. <br /> <br /> Another thing: There are exploding ostriches, but no bulls in movies, so the title must actually be (if anyone cares) "The Yolk is on me."
