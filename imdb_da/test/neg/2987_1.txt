No idea how this is rated as high as it is (5.8 at the time of writing), but this movie was absolutely horrible. The action was not bad, but it really had no meaning at all, and the overall quality was poor. It is, of course, a B-movie (or a C if such a thing exists) and it seems that it was made during a weekend at a friend's house or something. I'm too low a budget movie, and I generally see that I come across, but this one is really really bad. I mean, "The Fanglys" bad. I don't know what's more to say but trust what I've really put through this horrible horrible movie and I can save you the effort ... Don't bother. Seriously ... Just don't.
