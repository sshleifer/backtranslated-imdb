There is no need to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Why? Many reasons. First, the play is terrible. There is hardly a line that is not erroneous - but it is hardly surprising given the banality, stupidity and repetition of the dialogue that the players are asked to mouth. It's terribly written. One of the most annoying things about the script is that the authors only seem to know a way to keep their characters talking after a certain point, and that is to get them to repeat the most important words in the previous character's line. <br /> <br /> "Repeat?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, they repeat it. For the whole movie." <br /> <br /> "The whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." <br /> <br /> Etc. <br /> <br /> In movies like this you generally know who the evil ones are and what they are after. (All the good guys usually do is stop the evil ones. Creating a good "Mwahahaha! With X in my understanding I will rule the universe!" Crook is the first stop in any cheapo SF plot) but in this turkey? - You tell me. <br /> <br /> As I understand, our "heros" is a bunch of mass murderers sent to the past on a Dirty Dozen-type mission. They are sent by a fascist totalitarian state to stop some other mass murderers from changing the course of history. The new story will not include the rise of totalitarianism and a war that kills 30 billion people and leaves the earth a dead planet (we know all this because this film has one of the practical, long-term screen reports just before the action starts telling who is who and what is what It is an indication of who the manufacturers think their target audience will be being told as well as on the screen - just to save the audience from taxing their brains too much by doing a lot of reading .) So just who should we rooting here? I suppose we are asked to believe that our hero performs some kind of journey from totalitarianism to love, peace and understanding while we shoot lots of people - but it does not seem like a bow because we are shown that He is a decent (ish) human being right from the start when he tries to save all civilians aboard the rebellion station. <br /> <br /> I think decision makers were targeting a deeper than normal complexity in this movie, but they ended up with an unholy mess with more plot holes and logical discrepancies than a dozen or so of your average crap SF film. <br /> <br /> Opening credits were weird.
