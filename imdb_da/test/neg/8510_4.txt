There is no doubt that Rampling is beautiful - a classic beauty, here very young. She manages to appear sophisticated and exciting at the same time. Her two male films also work well. But in 2003, many are <br /> <br /> American trying to be artistic and non-being-Hollywood-while-shooting-beautiful-sh ots-of-the-French-Riviera-and-three-beautiful -one-people-in-their-sweet-old-ca r. I enjoyed the view (both the actors and nature), but the film is boring and pretentious while trying to be the opposite.
