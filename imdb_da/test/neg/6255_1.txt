This movie was simply bad. I can forgive low budget movies for being low budget, but it wasn't fun, it wasn't smart, it had no redeeming qualities at all, unless you really like looking at fake breasts. I don't know what this genre is classified as possibly erotic horror, but in that case - it's neither sexy nor scary. Tying it into the Slummer Party Massacre movie was useless; I had never seen the previous films themselves, and with the exception of a scene that tried to tie it together, I had no way of knowing who the escaped psycho killer in 'Cheerleader' was, or why they were bothering to include him especially because and I don't think I reveal anything here), it was really obvious that the cheerleader killer in this movie was not him. As for the actual killer? All I can say is, lame. Really lamb. When you find out why the killer goes out on the cheerleading team (and the team's coach and two stoners who happened on the bus trip, they take them and the bus driver is just for the heel of the seemingly) you want to sit there and go - wtf? Worst excuse for a murdered spree ever. In general, the "actors" (two guesses why I added the quotes) looked like low-budget porn declines, as they probably were. The poor people who are trying to break into "legitimate" movies. One of my friends had this to say about the actor who played Buzzy, the bus driver: "He looks like the guy you know gets really into it, and his face turns red and stuff." We had a good deal on it. Half of the other actors had all the skill and subtlety of the actors in the sixth grade production of "Annie", I did. The other half seemed pretty much bored to death (especially in the deleted scene, one redhead ...), and with ten minutes in this movie I was too. A note: The DVD contains a deleted scene that would have put the movie from R-rated to NC-17 if it had been left behind. It was completely free, and as adult entertainment, no quality goes at all. The only reason to bother with it is to laugh a lot at the bad.
