The alien was excellent. Many authors tried to copy it. They all did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst Alien copy. Because of the bad actors, the bad special effects, the BAD scenario and other bad things (it would take about 3 pages to tell everything that's bad in this movie. The movie wasn't very long and it's a very good one things (the only one) You can't laugh because it's too serious ... it's a bad thing, because in almost every B series sci-fi movie you can laugh all the time, it can be fun sometimes, but Instead of seeing this stupidity, just watch the Alien or Event Horizon ... these are much better !!! I give it 1 out of 5.
