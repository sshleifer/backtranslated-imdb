I usually don't try the second time to guess a criminal, but Cleaner was just too predictable. Samuel L. Jackson, who played the character Tom Cutler, along with his profession created an interesting twist at the start of the movie, but it was about it. Without myself, I thought where the plot would be taken, and within 30 minutes I had already found out who the killer was. Instead of trusting myself and having seen several movies that make a turnabout, I looked at the completion. What a disappointment I was from the beginning. <br /> <br /> The casting of characters was a good one as well as the appearance of Jackson and Harris ... except for Eva Mendes. From the starting port, she did not play a credible sign in connection with the script, and it ruined the whole plot prematurely. Perhaps this was a direct accident or just weakness in the story itself. Her role as Ann Norcut should have shown more emotion and anxiety about the situation surrounding her. This would have made the construction a little more convincing and the end more dramatic. Nevertheless, Cleaner is watchable, not memorable. I've seen episodes of CSI that were more exciting then this.
