Okay, my question who is the idiot who wrote this movie, which gives the same name as Dean Koontz's amazing book? it is terrible, nothing like the book ... you have the dog and the guard, but it looks like the end ... maybe it's good if you haven't read the book, but ... but it really disappointed me. <br /> <br /> they should make a new one and let it write it ... now it would be a good movie ... I'll say it again, this movie disgusted me ... utterly disgusted me. It was terrible, it was absolutely nothing like the book. I would never see it again.
