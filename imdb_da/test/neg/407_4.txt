In a way, you must respect Arachnia. It is clearly referred to as a tribute to the big bug films from the fifties, and while the special effects seem to be awful; at least the film does not have CGI. But on the other hand; You can't respect the movie too much because it's a load of waste. The action is horrible, the special effects (as mentioned) are impossible to take seriously and when you have seen a huge spider blown up; You've seen them all so it gets boring quite fast. The reason follows a lot of people who are unlucky enough to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to the only house in the area; which just happens to be a house where a man has a great spider that he used to use as a circus attraction. Randomly around the same time, meteor shower has got several giant spiders to rise from underground. All the characters in this movie are bad caricatures; None of them has anything that even looks like a third dimension, and they will soon begin to drill you thoroughly. You have to feel for director Brett Piper when he clearly didn't have much to work with for this movie; but that does not make Arachnia worthwhile, and generally there are better gigantic bug movies than this, and therefore Arachnia does not get the approval mark from me.
