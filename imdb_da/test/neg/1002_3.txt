I was immediately involved in this movie, much to my surprise because I didn't intend to see it at all. Now I wish I didn't. The excitement begins well, with hit-and-run resulting in death and the question of whether the guilty character will confess or be found out, or (now done even if it is not somebody in the old movie days' days) get away with it. The plot has been done before - what plot does not have - but the tensions associated with it, with the additional complications and motivations arising from the illegal love affair, allow for an absorbent first half. Then, the movie leaves the hit-and-run to go on a foggy display of two pristine, universal love. The two traces of plot - hit-and-run and unreasonable love - just do not have enough to do with each other and that they involve the same characters, do not bind them sufficiently to justify the departure from the original story line. The printer author should have chosen a plot or the other. At the end of the film, in the middle of the second funeral of the film, I thought to myself, "Now, what has some of this to do with the hit-and-run?" The film authorities may think that the answer is obvious, but I think the movie was plotted and executed quickly.
