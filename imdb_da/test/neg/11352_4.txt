"You can survive something". Everything but a stupid horror flick. The director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a regular ol backwoods serial killer. You can't have both. It's like Michael Moore is trying to get his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes) by making his special charlatan brand of "docu-comedies". They must be sooo fun and much, and yet it was also meant to treat them as truth-based, earthquake, hard-hit documentary films. Some genres cannot be mixed. <br /> <br /> "Anything can happen to anyone, preferably, anywhere." (Translation: this is the horror genre, so we can do any kind of nonsense we want.) It doesn't sound as much as anything "wise" found on a paper from a Chinese fortune, but more like the belief in any bad horror film director. We get this baloney out of a statement served to us early as a preparation / justification for the absurd buffoonery that comes. <br /> <br /> "My phone doesn't work!" Well, of course it is not. There is a far greater chance that Sean Penn's brain starts to work (after decades of catatonic apathy) than a horror movie cell phone does. The most boring and predictable horrorcliché of the last decade. Why say it yourself? We know that help never comes through a phone call, so you can even mention that if you do horror-making dimwits. The last 50 horror movies I saw use this plot unit. It gets embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "Always expect the unexpected." The final twist was quite surprising, I give them so much ... But lots of nonsense on the way there. <br /> <br /> Check out the elaborate traps that the heroine sets up with a skilled speed-up lab rat - in the cold, wet, and almost completely dark conditions. I just love horror movie realism ... When a bloodthirsty demon starts trying to be fun (by "shshshing" his victims), you know that your scare joy is in doubt. The less said about the old geezer "cracking wise", the better ... Another stupid cliché served by a tired, lazy, uninspired instructor. What are the odds of being attacked by your husband and then by an eye-catching demon - on the same day? "Expect the Unexpected". They may as well have pushed into an incident where she survives a plane crash, and then another, where she meets aliens who have been trying to anal-probe her ... <br /> <br /> The forward-looking button has Need a temple or a holiday built in its image.
