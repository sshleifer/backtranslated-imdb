This movie is bad, so bad that my mother, who can barely be the "thrill" of Disney's Snow White, went through the whole movie. My first warning should have been that it was in the $ 5.50 bin at Wal-Mart. But I actually found some good movies in that bin, so I can't fault if for this debacle. The second warning should have been that when the cashier dialed the DVD, it was actually $ 3.88. Again I have never been one to ignore the fairies. This movie is definitely not for people looking for something good to see, and certainly not for everyone who enjoys the occasional bad movie. If you need background noise while doing something like playing cards with some friends, get it, but if you're looking for something to actually see, don't even bother. It was really disappointing because there were many good actors. I felt like I saw a chocolate version of Willard.
