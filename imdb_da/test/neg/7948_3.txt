Assault on Precinct 13: 3/10: Let's forget for a moment that Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. Taken entirely on its own assets Assault is a debacle. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the Rio Bravo style scenario. About a dozen people are trapped in a fake police station in Detroit (If the Detroit location gives you Robocop heat and fuzzies stop right now. It could easily have said Topeka in the opening credits and nothing would have changed. In fact, the last bit of the forest would have done More meaning.) Around them is our evil corrupt police. <br /> <br /> Now I know what your thinking is. Corrupt police? Were the Nazis and drug cartels busy that weekend? Of course, this is no ordinary police. These guys are right on the front of the latest Tom Clancy video game. Yup we have body arms; helicopters; laser sights; night vision glasses works. So we have thirty S.W.A.T. Members / Special Forces armed to the teeth verse 4 police (filled with you it's New Year's Eve), 2 girls in party dress and half a dozen criminals. <br /> <br /> So how do our heroes defend themselves? The truth is, they can't. They must all be dead within ten minutes of peaks. (Not to mention the signs inside have an annoying habit of passing past the windows.) Now, an illogical scenario is no reason to completely pan a movie esp. a B-style action movie. But with the exception of Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, all the other characters seemed to be comic relief. (In any case, I hope they were) <br /> <br /> While the Yes Rules and Leguizamo's characters are bad enough. It's the Aisha Hinds minstrel show that takes the cake. Rarely has a more stereotyped African American character appeared on the modern screen. Her performance resembles a frat boy in blackface and dragging ghetto. <br /> <br /> In the original assault, a gang member takes over an ice cream cart and drives around the neighborhood that shoots little girls in the head. I have since had an irrational fear of ice cream. After this assault, I have a perfect rational fear of restoration.
