"Problem Child 2" was a complete waste of my time. The original movie was not very good, but it is a classic compared to this movie. The first movie went over the top with its scenes of a devilish child who destroyed great chaos in the lives of everyone around him. Here it goes even further above the top. And a scene in this movie proves that theory. The carnival sequence was too much for me to stomach. It's terrible. This movie should not have been made. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (out of four)
