Another example of the subject of women in prison. This is not exactly a genre known for quality movies, but this is a notch below most. A bunch of women are taken from the brothel, where they work for a prison on a rocky island. Once there they are exposed to many ill-directed sex and terrible "dialogue". For a movie with an amazing amount of sex and nudity, there really is nothing erotic about any of it. The sex scenes are awkwardly acted, and some scenes, such as the shower scene, seem to be drawing on and again. That said, there are at least some minimum production values. On the W-i-P scale I wanted to put it over Frauen fur Zellenblock Neun, but under Chained Heat.
