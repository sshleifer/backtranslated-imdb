The prerequisite for the movie had a lot to do with it, but despite the news of models selling other people's furniture to live the high life, this film has nothing to do with it. The signs are cardboard. The dialogue is so painfully written, it's hard to sit through, and if there were any jokes in the movie, I missed them. Marilyn Monroe goes into walls because she doesn't want to wear glasses, is absolutely incredible and not fun. Grable's stupidity is also too skin-fisted to be believed. Bacall's gold graves are so forced, it's annoying to listen to. Why anyone would like to sit through this is beyond me.
