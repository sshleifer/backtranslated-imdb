Let me start by saying that I love Japanese films, literature and culture in general. I have seen many Japanese films and enjoyed them, but "Portrait of Hell" (aka Jigokuhen) makes himself ridiculous. The two characters that dominate the action - the "evil gentleman" in his privileged bubble and the "stubborn, crazy artist" are pure types with zero subtlety or nuance, and all their actions stem from cartoon-like extremes. The movie wants to show terrible scenes of violence and red emotions, but many of these scenes are so over the top that they actually become ridiculous, and the overall feeling is that of a television movie that went out of the rails. If this rarely screened movie falls into your hands or comes to your city, save yourself and give it a pass.
