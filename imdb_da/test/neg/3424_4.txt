The story of Macbeth was one of the most successful Shakespeare ever written. This may be due to some features that place it close to the slash genre, murder, murder, kill, kill, blood tones, a tense sexual relationship between the protagonists, etc. More than this, the original game is very appealing considering the length (it is only half of Hamlet) and focus on Macbeth, for whom we have to care despite his bloody nature. The game seems to be ideal for basing a movie. Not so long it allows the directors to explore it's many levels, a good actor can play the role of his lifetime, the film has profound significance in a historical period. Unfortunately, this has not been the case with Macbeth. Polanski's version comes pretty close, but it insists too much on the Middle Ages. Welles' film is too personal, with an interesting twist to totalitarianism, the 1990 TV version is too low. This movie from 2006 is no exception. It is very far from a Shakespeare movie, but it is interesting to see how the instructor understood the story and where he places it in today's life. No knights in shining armor but gangsters in shining cars. A lot of drugs and trippy music replace the fear of the night in the original game. The idea of ​​Macbeth is so simple that you should not use Shakespeare at all to take and implant it in modern life. The worst part of the movie is the lines. Most of the exciting scenes in the game, such as the dagger scene, are trimmed so much that they seem meaningless. Replacing knocks in the door with door bells and horses with cars seems fun. If they wanted to make a movie about power and its temptation, they could have done it easily without Shakespeare. This Macbeth seems to be a looser with a brain injury, not a brave warrior, brave and ambitious, who wants power so much that he is willing to kill, and who gets caught in a net of fear and despair. The film does not reveal what drives Lady Macbeth into madness, it gives no reason why some of the characters should fear Macbeth and his "terror" (since there is no hereditary ascent to the throne, what without throne and everything) and it sets Macbeth in an awkward position, as the leadership of a gang is so far from the royal family, as this whole movie is far from any Shakespeare. In conclusion, we have two superimposed ideas that never quite meet making this a movie that is ultimately meaningless .... Don't stand in the order but go!
