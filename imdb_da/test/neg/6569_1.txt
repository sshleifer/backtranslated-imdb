Leonard Nimoy instructed Star Trek III, who was not half bad. Perhaps William Shatner apparently thought how Nimoy did what he could. After watching this movie, he should have turned that decision. <br /> <br /> Star Trek V The last limit is the worst in the series. The action of all involved, including those that Shatner and Nimoy are bad and leached and make them seem as old as they look in real life, special effects are sticky, as when Spock has to save Kirk on a jet pack when he falls from a mountain. The attempts at humor were pitiful, and the story is so horrible that it doesn't bear thinking, which basically involves a volcano that steals the company to find God (seriously), I just don't worry about any of this movie and not to mention Uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards. She looked as if she was participating in a granny competition. If they were to make her look sexy. They were wrong. She looked grotesque. <br /> <br /> How it came to production or even written ... well it has nothing to think about. The only place that is good for this movie is in the garbage. The worst series.
