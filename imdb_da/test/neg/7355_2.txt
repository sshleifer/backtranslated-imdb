This movie is so bold that it doesn't try to hide its similarities with The Shining. It lacks the originality of doing so. And when it does, at the end, try to cover its story of "father going psycho under the influence of outlined haunted house in a strange place", doing so by bowing to many other already established conventions and ideas. In other words, it simply reduces to cliche. But hell, even though I enjoy a good predictable horror or thriller, as long as there is an interesting story, one filled with violence and doing, somewhere before the movie makes the terrible trip against the predictable and trite. Well, this movie doesn't have a good story and I was really disappointed with it. What 'darkness' is heading for is remarkable direction and filmography. It is a film that is well shot and carefully constructed full of fun, creepy angles and shots. What 'Darkness' does not go for is pretty much anything else. To begin with, a less quibble - editing in this movie is unpleasant. It jumps from one scene to the next, sometimes meaningless. For example, the old man in the film (who greatly bears the background story, later filled in by another character) underlined by hamster-running circles. I mean, it looks cool the first time, but why continue to use the same image? I think you'll have to see it for yourself to understand what I mean. Another problem with this movie is Anna Paquin's character, which essentially whines the whole movie, cries and cares too much about everything - she's the movie's failed attempt at a character-driven horror movie. The film has scenes of overwhelmed sentimentalism, and the family drama it portrays is simply not credible. In the end, 'Darkness' is a muddled melodrama, with a non-involved mystery bearing too much of an end. And it's hardly scary.
