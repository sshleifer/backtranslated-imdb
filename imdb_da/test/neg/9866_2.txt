Drifting around on bootlegs, sometimes thought of an urban cartoon legend, the first FF movie is pretty much as bad as everyone fears. I guess Marvel Comics is now pretending it doesn't exist, what about the 2005 version out in theaters earlier this year. But it is out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of poor low budget. Excellent Captain America, Punisher, most TV movies. 'Low budget' is too easy a description for this FF picture. Because of virtually no funds showing the superfour's powers, it was limited to very fast shots (Mr.Fantastic), quasi-animation (Torch) and fading (Invisible girl - the easiest thing to do). Thing's suit was not bad and probably half of the budget; The facial part was especially convincing. The play? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is pretty good; the other 3 are okay, tho Jay like Johnny seems like a spaz at times to show off his "burning" temperament. The dialogue is cartoon-style, and it is the support-end casting that ends up flowing, trying to make it work. Dr.Doom is far above melodramatic and unintentionally comical, and his two main minions are a case study on how to not act or write dialogue. <br /> <br /> The reason? Not so good. It was pretty believable on FF's history of origin (more than the later major budget version), and although the non-budget again limited to showing, for example, The actual breakdown kept it the most important ingredients in how they discovered their forces in an isolated area - that's the best part of the picture, so you have to wait half an hour for it. I also found the music strange in places; When they are bathed in these cosmic rays, a kind of church is heard as if it were a religious experience. The rest of it is, however, hopeless. Even without the budget, history could have done without the goldsmith character (which resembles the books in the Mole Man wave); It spends too much time with him and his underground gang, as well as the blind Alicia. These sections are waste of celluloid and very dull. The climate fight with Doom & his men begins fine, but degenerates into a terrible mess as the torch rages a laser beam (cool animation but belongs to the cartoon). Fans can have a laugh at the bad FF FX and unimaginable story if they don't get depressed and upset first.
