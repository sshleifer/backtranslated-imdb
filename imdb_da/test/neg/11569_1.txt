I was so "impressed" with Tim Kincaid's MUTANT HUNT that I gave this a try. It is the near future, after the apocalypse of course. A wandering giant named Neo (no, not that Neo!) Joins a group of similar fighters to challenge The Dark One and his underlying Valaria. Along the way, they encounter mutants, bile women, sewage, a large spiderbone and some lumpy robots. Oh my! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ROBOT HOLOCAUST is barely up (or down) to HUNT level. Clock on a painful 79 minutes (the box says 90), this is a cheap flick. The sets have all the elaborate designs of a carnival haunted house, and the costumes show that in the near future everyone will dress like John Travolta in the final dance number of STAYING ALIVE. The atomic wasteland is a combination of rubble-filled old buildings and Central Park. The Dark One's headquarters is ominously named The Power Station and looks like a power plant. The action is universally poor, with the exception of Angelika Jager as the evil Valaria. Hunting is a whole 'nother level of bad. White is sick Cherman acczent, she gives a performance so incredibly bad that it will be the only reason to recommend this movie. She also delivers the film's only nudity in the film's "Pleasure Chamber" section. Ed French again delivers the robot effects, but they are almost as slim as his work in MUTANT HUNT.
