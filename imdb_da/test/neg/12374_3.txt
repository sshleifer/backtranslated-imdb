Before we start, I have to say that I hope you have already eaten when you read this. Why? Because after watching this movie for the first time, the bird's appearance and sound made me want to eat chicken after the words 'The End' had appeared on the screen. Don't think you weren't warned. Fred Sears could have directed "Earth vs the Flying Saucers" (an ok movie and one of the larger examples of Tim Burton's "Mars Attacks"). , but "The Giant Claw" is not so much a movie. Yes, it is a prehistoric monster flying in the air, attacking planes and cities and occasionally treating a man in parachute. The animal is huge except in the scenes where it is significantly smaller, but who needs uniform proportions in a movie? Daunting? It could have been, but not if the plot is hopelessly silly and the monster resembles a puppet running away from Sesam Street.
