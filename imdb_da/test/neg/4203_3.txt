I bought this Chuck Norris DVD and knew it was one of his earliest movies, and it shows. We all know he will never win an Oscar for his acting, but that is not what we see him for. Although there have been a few earthquakes in California since this film was made, there was never any desert or hills between Hwy.99 and I 5. Billy apparently crossed from 99 to 5 along with 120, a distance of less than 15 miles . I want the authors, producers and directors of these films to at least look at a map. As a truck driver who spends a lot of time in California, from the start I could say that the geography was wrong. However, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half. So take your Doritos and an adult drink and enjoy a trip back in time.
