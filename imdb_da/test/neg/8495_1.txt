It is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. I say this without a hyperbolic, and believe me I've seen many bad movies. It is embarrassing and annoying that millions of dollars went into this movie and that hundreds of thousands of artisans spent so much time working as the authors and producers may have known would be a huge mistake. <br /> <br /> When a 90 minute movie feels it long, pulled out, boring and incomprehensible, you know something went wrong somewhere. Also Jamie Kennedy (whose work I've enjoyed elsewhere) is simply horrible in this role; he obviously never got a screen test because no manufacturer in their right mind would consider him entertaining in any way, especially in the deck of The Mask. Simply horrible. Personally, I can't wait to see reviews from the big film critics because I know they do a better job than me by tearing this train wreck into strips. <Br /> <br /> Producers of this movie should be embarrassed and, more importantly, NEVER allowed to make theater films again.
