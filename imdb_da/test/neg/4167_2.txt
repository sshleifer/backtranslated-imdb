I found code 46 very disappointing. I thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a movie, but found that it didn't deliver. Code 46 lacked thought and structure, and the bigline did not fly well. I thought Tim Robbin's character was not well-developed, for example. I thought there should have been more info and thought about putting in his family life and not having completely ignored it as I felt it was. When they first violated a code 46, it was suggested that they should not know that they could be genetically linked, but all technology was available to them, he took her fingerprints and thus genetic details when he investigated fraud. I constantly found myself waiting for something to happen and the story had to be developed, but it never did. I felt the film had great potential to be intellectually stimulating, but turned out to be the opposite. Code 46 tried to be too clever and eventually ended up without a lack of imagination. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, the only good thing about the movie was that it was relatively short.
