As if the world had not already had enough cheap Jaw imitations, the author Boaz Davidson decided to make the sequel to his ropey-but-reasonably-enjoyable creature feature Octopus a complete rip-off of Spielberg's classic right down to having a worried cop who No one believes and a mayor more concerned about his 4th of July celebration than people's lives. <br /> <br /> Even in the hands of a highly skilled leader, it is unlikely that this derived waste could have been anything but hokey B movie waste, but with Yossi Wein (yes Yossi Wein!) calling the shots behind the camera , a man with a fraction of Mr Spielberg's talent (I estimate about 1/1000), Octopus 2 is guaranteed to be as good as you could imagine! The predictable and extremely clich√© plot is not worth describing in detail (replacing Jaws' Amity Island with New York and Bruce the Shark with a huge rubber squid and you get the core), although several points about the movie are I definitely worth mentioning, simply because they are so funny: all the squid attacks involve the actors who are struggling to get incredibly fake-looking giant tentacles look real, which is fun to watch; Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, is convincingly in favor of New York, and excessive use of stock footage makes the illusion even less convincing; Best of all, a silly dream sequence that sees rubber patch attacking ours on top of the Statue of Liberty is not only gut-bustingly silly, but also contains some really terrible special effects. Davidson's script doesn't do it either. I don't know when to finish. There are several points in this movie where it could have (and probably should) be completed, but the action continues that the octopus survives several explosions and causes a tunnel to collapse (catching the film's love interest and a bunch of children) before finally being blown for the forge of the hero. <br /> <br /> Sometimes very stupid, always horrible technical, but never actually scary, this STV stinker can find fans among those who are actively seeking cinematic waste. However, most normal people will be advised to manage well.
