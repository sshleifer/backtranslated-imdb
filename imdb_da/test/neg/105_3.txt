The Forgotten (AKA: Look In The Basement) is a very cheap and very old-fashioned horror movie. <br /> <br /> The story is very slow and really doesn't reach anything worthy of excitement. <Br /> <br /> Patients in the asylum area are embarrassingly funny especially Sam and the old woman who always quote an old saying to everyone. (Take care when she comes close to the camera, tell me you can see without laughing!). <br /> <br /> Now things are very poor, with the blood looking pink in many scenes, so it doesn't really deserve its place on the video nasties list !. All in all if you are not looking for a fantastic horror movie and have some time to save, then it is worth seeing.
