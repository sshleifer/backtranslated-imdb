people, get a clue! I mean, the authors don't have one, so I expect you to ... this show is such a pale imitation of the '60 show that you can laugh at it! And the sixties show is the one with the cheap special effects, and is in B & W's Chrissakes! Still, the mood and writing of the old show is MILES prior to this drive. Get HiP kids! If 98 degrees or Brittany told you to see it, you would! You know it! Just bypass them and tell all your friends you were 'IN' with 'scene' BEFORE it was too cool!
