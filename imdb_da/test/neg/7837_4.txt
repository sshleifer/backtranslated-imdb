Maximum risk is quite surprising for a person who has seen more than his movie. Director Ringo Lam made an average action film comparable to most other mid-quality action films, which is a special prediction for a `Muscle from Brussels`movie. It has a fairly classic style, an interesting atmosphere and last but not least the beautiful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme does not make you cry at his play, he does a relatively good job. Of course, you can't compare the maximum risk (oh, what a creative title!) To `Ronin`, but after watching` Knock off` it is the hell of a good movie ... in special standards, of course.
