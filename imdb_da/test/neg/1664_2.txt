Linda Arvidson (like Jennie) and Harry Solter (like Frank) enjoy a romantic touch when she enters her father Charles Inslee; furious, he chokes Mr Solter out of the house. Rude, he goes to his balcony and asks her to run. Mrs. Arvidson is comfortable and goes to pack. Then the consumer George Gebhardt comes to rob the place. Although he does not get much in the way of the bully, the 20th Gebhardt manages to use Arvidson's suitcase to escape the police ?? <br /> <br /> A well thought out comedy. Note, during the sunset scene, Solter goes off camera so burglar Gebhardt can enter the house undiscovered. And Arvidson travels very easily, as nothing seems to matter in his heavy luggage; maybe she just wanted to buff beau solter? Director D.W. Griffith, Robert Harron, and Florence Lawrence are famous extras. <br /> <br /> ** A Calamitous Elopement (8/7/08) D.W. Griffith ~ George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Harry Solter
