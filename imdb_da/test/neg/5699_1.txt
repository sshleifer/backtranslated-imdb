I rented this movie because I love Kristanna Loken, and I have seen her on many TV shows and since she has her 15 minute fame today with her new T3 movie, I wanted to see what other movies she has been in . <Br /> <br /> She's just okay about acting. Not good nor bad. She makes up for everything by being very beautiful. YUMMMMM <br /> <br /> Rodney Rowland was quite a surprise as the hero. He gave the only solid good play in the movie. He is a very good actor and should probably be an action star. <br /> <br /> Besides that Kristanna is ok, and Rodney is really good, everything else about this movie is rubbish in its purest form. <br /> <br /> A computer hacker hacks into a plane from the ground and using a joystick he tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant ..... or something. And of course there are the heroes who stand in the way and destroy their game. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst scripts I've ever seen, and no wonder it was a low budget flick. <br /> <br /> What is shocking is that this movie was made in 2001 and it has far too many similarities to September 11 tragedies. Why do they make movies here as in the first place? <br /> <br /> Panic * - a star (waste of good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as Air Panic)
