I don't know what today's movie guests expect, but after 68 years of movie watching .. (Well, maybe I didn't watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years, so make sure it's 58 years of movies). I expect to be entertained, not bored with tears, attacked by continuous profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence presented for no other purpose, but to show that blood staining and body parts are lacking. Monitoring is one of the films made by people who have no imagination, little if any talent, a total inability to tie scenes together and an unreasonable move by letting a scene go on and on, long after the purpose of it has passed. That someone would ever think this was a worthy movie when it is nothing more that Hollywood waste is past me. As a combat veteran, I have seen violence, blood and gore in many forms, and movies like we were soldiers are as fierce as a movie can have, but it has a redeeming value. Monitoring must have been dreamed by people in a drug-induced stupor, without the ability to write, no director training, no experience with movie editing, and a total lack of real-life contact. Just a stupid movie of two serial killers making up FBI agents, setting a scenario for killing some stupid, foul mouths, etc. A high-priced piece of waste that only an idiot liked ...
