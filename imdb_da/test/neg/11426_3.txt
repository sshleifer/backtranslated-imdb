Because I would never have seen this movie through to the end. Although there are some but not many fun moments in this movie, I couldn't understand more than about 15% (the fancy English couple in the third story included) of what people were saying. Three short stories, no one with a real point, with just some of the most miserable and lifeless people I could have imagined and a lot of foul language. Didn't find it fun, didn't find it fun, didn't find any sense in it. 4.10
