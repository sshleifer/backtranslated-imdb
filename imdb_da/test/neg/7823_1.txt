Not just the money we paid to rent it or actually go to the cinema. I'm talking about how big productions companies waste so much money in things that are actually boring and not talking about ridiculous. With the millions they used to make a movie like this because I don't think the actors here would actually work for free or for a negligible sum. With this money, you can imagine how many good independent movies you could make, or maybe a good Hollywood movie. It's just tearing off, but not anyone, just most teenagers who are willing to go watch an Ashton Kutcher movie just because they're fans of him. I also don't really know how a person with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie. If you actually look at it in the future, the actors are the same quality of this movie. So I suppose I shouldn't be surprised I couldn't actually have expected more.
