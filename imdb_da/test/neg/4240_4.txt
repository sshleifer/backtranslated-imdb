This show can most accurately be described as TV Bubble-Gum: It chews, it has a good taste on it and it lasts a long time. But as Bubble-Gum, it can leave a bad taste in the mouth after a few too many chews. <br /> <br /> This show contains very simple questions that take the form of simply games like Hangman and guessing a simple sentence or guessing items on a short list. Callers are participants and anyone can play. <br /> <br /> The questions are, however, terribly easy. There is some techno music pumped into the background that is designed for a continuous loop. It never seems to be old, but it doesn't add much to the show anyway. The landlady, no matter which one is, is extremely personable, comfortable enough to see and can do some very entertaining facial expressions. I rather enjoy the British woman. <br /> <br /> But there's nothing to this show. It is simplified and uncomplicated, though it can be entertaining if absolutely nothing else is.
