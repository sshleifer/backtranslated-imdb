The latest documentary film "Errol Flynn's Adventure" is a profound look at Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart, Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue collar types in their screens, but Flynn was an aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son cutting his own fiction for a sword, thunder and romance analogy that ironically he found he was trapped in. If he hadn't been contracted to Warner Bros., he would have been perfect in the Cary Grant role in Suspicion: the smart charm whose 1000-watt smile blinds one to be a predator. And he could have played with his best leading ladies sister Joan Fontaine. It was Flyn's problem that he was the ultimate screen hero until his own habits and bad timing were hit by him. Grant and Flynn somehow are alike, but Flynn was the more macho of the two, it is possible to see Grant as Captain Blood, but Flynn in The Philadelphia Story Mr. Mixing builds your dream home or Monkey Business or Operation Petticoat you would have turned these roles on their collective ears because he is too confused on his feet and the sexual tension he would have brought naturally would have made history lines wobbly. But this wobbly biography is just a softened picture of Flynn and his era. There are times when I half expected a laugh or an audience to go "Ahhh" at some point. It does not go deep into Flynn's life just the screen magazine. Neither does it dive into its struggle to be considered more than a derring doer. Just as they clear biographies of Lon Chaney (the father, not Wolfman, or Lenny "Of Mice and Men) and Buster Keaton made in the 50s, it's just a time to kill a piece of fluff
