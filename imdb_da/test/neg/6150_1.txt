FANTASTIC WOT more can I say, I remember watching it in the cinema (see how it is painfully put into memory) like a 16 year old boy. Mark Hamill was the older generations of skywalker and was not great in what he was worse at this. Plus a dour soundtrack by Then Jericho AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH. There is a movie just as bad as what I saw in the cinema Arthur 2 on the rocks. Funny how it matters "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" is lighter than "what is the best movie?" which, incidentally, varies between the Italian job (original), untouchables, casino, things to do in Denver, goodfellas (get a sense of what I like ??? This will fool you!) Find Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean and Moulin Rouge! Please Never Watch This Movie Or It Will Also Stay In Your Memory!
