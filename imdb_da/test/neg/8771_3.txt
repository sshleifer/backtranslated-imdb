I'm a Christian and I've seen beautiful Christian movies, but this one is too bad. They are trying to do this well, but it is too difficult for those I believe. <br /> <br /> - You can see the movie is badly doubled in many places. - You can almost believe that the protagonists of this movie were the only ones left behind. I think there will be many more of them. <br /> <br /> - The quality is poor and the play could also have been better. The story is not that bad, but could have been better. The only plus I give is the story of this movie, but I can't judge it more than 3/10. See "Left behind" instead!
