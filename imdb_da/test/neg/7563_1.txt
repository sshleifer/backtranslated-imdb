How the LIFE DROROM managed to get into Laemmle 5 in West Hollywood is beyond me, as it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I should have known when the first scene opened in gasp, Eugene, Oregon - that this dud of a movie of characters that you would like and apologize for from their high school exclusion days but cannot, as they are such losers, is so wood and terrible with dialogue that is beyond bad. <br /> <br /> So, the clich√© ends the three high school graduates in LA, and here is where the film could have been realistic if it had shown them trying to find a career in acting. But no, one works as a used car dealer, the other is a true loser in a garage call center that sells magazines. Even the bastard who runs the place has more audience appeal than the terrible actor with the terrible foreign accent. And they get fraudulent money from an insurance company to set up an Executive Recruitment company with no experience and just show "the supposed good life" in LA night spots with a cast of actors who are so timid and bad, they don't have better SAG cards ... I could go on and on about this bad movie, but I ended up going out of the theater, which initially had six people, and when I left four men, they were the only ones in the audience. I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't find a profit in the story, the characters, the writing, the dialogue or the actors. Anyone who throws this movie should retire. Amen ... enough ...
