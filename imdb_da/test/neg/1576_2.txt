I watched this movie while surfing through infomercials and late night 80's sitcoms on television one night at 2 am. I have to say I don't expect much and I didn't get much. Although Rose McGowan is hot, her performance and performance of the rest of the player was not Oscar-worthy, at least. This movie has its upside down and has a nice twist at the end, but in honesty it was terrible. Not even a typical slasher movie. No one does, no sex, no nudity, no real violence. Just bad acting. I would give it a 3 out of 10.
