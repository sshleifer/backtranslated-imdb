Anyone who thinks that Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt and Corey Feldman consist of a list of good actors, should smoke something I would like to try once. Where to start: lousy soundtrack, hammy acting, "action" in places. This is the typical amateur-written chin feed that has rinsed up, and was never love to star in. I really felt embarrassed by the "stars" in this "movie". The only thespian missing on top of this turd was Gary Coleman, who, if he'd been in the movie, would have made it at least something howling badly, rather than simply bad. <br /> <br /> There was a part in the movie where Carol Everything Screamed: "DO YOU SPEAK THAT I AM AN idiot?!?" Yes, Carol, you do, your agent does, and PLEASE for the love of everything that is decent and sacred ... GO BACK, and stop breaking yourself like this! This movie is something that Anna Nicole Smith would participate in. <br /> <br /> I would tell you what the plot was, but it would be a more sentence fragment for this article plus my mind drifted many times over the film anyway, so I almost didn't pay attention.
