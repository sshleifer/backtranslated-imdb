This show is not, in my opinion, good, so again I have not enjoyed any comic book from the Disney Channel. Except for "The Proud Family" because it is a normal female teen. This show is very similar to the way I feel about Lilo and Stich the Series. It was a mistake to make the movie a comic book because the movie was excellent, the comic is horrible. Disney Channel did fine before adding all those stupid comics like Dave The Barbarian, Brandy and Mr. Whiskers, Lilo and Stich the Series, American Dragon Jake, and where it all started: Kim Possible. The performances would have been better if they came to PlayHouse Disney! With regard to this particular show, Kuzko will never get out of school, just as Dave The Barbarians parents never come home again, and like Brandy and Mr. Whiskers never get out of the jungle.
