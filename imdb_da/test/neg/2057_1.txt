This movie is probably one of the 3 worst movies made in history. I rented this by chance without reading the reviews, and wow, I regret it. Really has no plot, does not really follow the vampire genre. Just plain God awful. If you watch this movie, you will sense your enthusiasm for vampire movies. I felt that the author / director / producer went on this medicine binge and had hallucinations and tried to recreate it on film. All the time I wanted the movie ended .. but the end was even more whacked. <br /> <br /> If this review can only save a person from seeing this crap, I felt my time spent registering and writing this review was worth it.
