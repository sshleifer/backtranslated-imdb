SPOILERS <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is Tenchi? This is not Tenchi. <br /> <br /> Almost everyone is terribly written out of character ... When it comes to characterization, the only bright spot is the friendship between Ayeka and Ryoko. <br /> <br /> Also, the scourge is not punished for her actions, which is similar to the mind-control rape. If a male villain had made one of the women what Haruna did for Tenchi, he (rightly) would have painfully bought it at the end of the movie, dying terribly, and the audience would have cheered. But not only does Haruna pay no price for her crimes, Ryoko MAKES and UNDERSTAND her actions. None! The real Ryoko would have beaten her to what Haruna had done for her beloved Tenchi; The audience I saw this with, even included, all sounded audibly at this scene <br /> <br /> Anime fans, avoid this movie. Tenchi fans, avoid this movie even harder.
