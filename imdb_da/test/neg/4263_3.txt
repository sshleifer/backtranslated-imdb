Good attempt to tackle the unconventional issue in the May-December romances. However, the treatment is completely unrealistic. Sour, 60-year-old men may and may fall for younger women, but they are usually adult women with whom they share common interests and values ​​and views ... not neurotic, immature neighbors. Of course, there are exceptions, and they come close to being called pedophiles! Sorry RGV, but it is not credible that a sane and successful sex teacher would throw a comfortable family life and become a joke to his peers ... all for an 18 year old who does not have a practical thought in her head and behaves as an unstable escapee from a mental institution. You do not need to have a PhD in psychology to see that Amitabh's character is seduced by sex and that the young woman has unresolved remission and danger issues. <br /> <br /> With regard to Vijay's recurring scene lying on the edge of a rock contemplating suicide, is as close as he is going to have anything in common with Jiah by behaving like a beaten teen boy. <br /> <br /> On a positive note: the actors did a good job and movie good.
