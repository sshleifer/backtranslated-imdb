This movie is stupid. There is no one to get around it. But it's also Dumb and Dumber. Mind you, Dumb and Dumber are considerably more fun than this. But I love to watch silly movies (Tail Sting) and laugh with a group of good friends over how bad it is. Call me call but watch this movie and you will find that the only way you can laugh is if you laugh at it instead of with it.
