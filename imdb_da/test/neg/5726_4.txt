This, in my opinion, is a very bad movie, which announces Arnold Schwarzenegger as the lead role (despite being co-star) to only sell more copies. Of course, this influence from the same themed Conan movies does not make this movie appear so entertaining and ultimately fails to entertain at all. <br /> <br /> Bridgette Neilsen stars like Sonja, a beautiful woman who has gained incredible strength by a ghost figure after her village were robbed, her family was killed, and she was raped by the soldiers of Queen Gedran (Sandahl Bergman) . Gedran is a tyrant queen who wants control over the barbaric world and seeks a talisman protected by Sonja's sister to do so. After discovering what has happened, Sonja rates revenge and at the same time saves the world from Gedra's anger. Kalidor (Schwarzenegger), the talisman's master, sets out to protect her whether or not she wants him there. <br /> <br /> The first major problem with this movie is the start. The events leading up to the point where Sonja receives her powers could easily have made a good ten to fifteen minute enjoyable movie. The beginning is, however, rushed into what looks like a fast one-minute 'Earlier on'. 'segment from a TV show. Had they actually made these events as part of the story and cut some of the filler later, they might have been able to start cashing this movie, but unfortunately they didn't (I wonder why Richard Fleischer's director is currently has only directed two movies since Red Sonja). <br /> <br /> This movie also features some of the most annoying characters in the story like Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) who is a stupid character and just adds an abundance of camp to the movie, which sometimes works but in This case fails unsuccessfully. He was clearly written into the movie for some comic relief, but with the overall absurdity of the film, it was still another costly mistake for "Red Sonja". For everyone there are bugs there were a good fight scenes involving both Neilsen and Arnie, which are worth noting but these are not enough to save this turkey. The play is just as good as it gets for films of this quality, and even Arnie did not seem to be concerned about his performance. I do not recommend this movie at all; for me it is a waste of an hour and a half. My rating for ?? Red Sonja '?? 3.10
