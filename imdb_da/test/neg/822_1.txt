Don't tell me this movie was fun or a little fun. It was a complete disaster and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ali G is only fun at Channel 4's Ali G Show. After seeing his performance, all I can say is he is not made into movies. With a Daft script, or more like no story, there's nothing that keeps you entertained. Full of annoying, unrealistic character, this movie is a complete waste all the way. At the end of the film Ali G gives a speech. He mentions if you hated this movie, tell people that it was good. Not even the speech could save the movie. He probably knew it would be a stinker. I would give this a 0/10, but minimum start is 1. Overall, don't even waste your time on this rubbish.
