Terrible, boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than Uwe's horrible first movie. It consists of a group of soldiers entering a zombie-campus college campus to find a particular type of blood that can help find a cure for the infection. These soldiers are your typical lamb for slaughter, and none of them are pulled out (or at least not very interesting) so you don't feel a grief in your stomach's pit when they are disposed. The movie has the typical zombies that bite people and blood stains. It even has the same munching on the gut. It just doesn't matter to the zombie genre to give it memory. And history's climax is pretty anti-climactic and ridiculous. One wonders how two people can be immersed in an army of zombies and not get bitten (for they are the biggest stars that seem to always manage volatility), while others seem to get a little light. The film's only motivation is to show people to get a little .. nothing else. Just go and see a Romero movie for lasting effect.
