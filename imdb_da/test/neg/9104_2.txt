This movie was bad on so many levels. The script was horrible so even the best actors couldn't have made this movie visible. It's a shame because they had some good actors in this movie. I think if anyone saw any of the Police Academy movies, you would know Steve Guttenberg was good. His character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference from the characters I've seen him play before, so it was a plus. And I thought Steve Guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie. With or without the shirt you can't deny that he has a big body! Sexy face too. Loved the 5-hour shadow look, it made him look dangerous. On one side of the film, he lies in bed without his shirt, and I have to say I would have liked to jump in there and try to take him off with his problems! So honestly I would watch this movie again just to fantasize!
