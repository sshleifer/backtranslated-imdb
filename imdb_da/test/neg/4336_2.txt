Talk about a drill string. This 3-day biker movie put me in bed as soon as the opening credits came on the screen. The shame is that the player included many fine actors, including George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe. <br /> <br /> A departure from the Western classic, High Noon, this is basically the story of a former US Army Green Bucket (Henriksen) trying to get someone to help him escape a single city of a gang of Cruel motorcyclists. All samples, but the manuscript is at school level. Sad to see the academic award winner Kennedy in such a comedown from his outstanding performance at Cool Hand Luke. <br /> <br /> If you have trouble sleeping at night, it would be a perfect movie video rental .......... you sleep in no time!
