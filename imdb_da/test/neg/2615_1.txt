AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When does stop stop? That's what I said somewhere between the beginning and the other part of the movie that really sucked. This movie almost killed my whole life, and I've been through some really bad movies. Coming from a true puppet master, I would expect to hear myself say this, but that's true. The reason is inane, the special effects awful, the soundtrack the most poignant, infernal tootling I've ever heard. Oh! I almost forgot the action, it was so bad that I forgot it was at all, said nuff. The only redeeming factor in the movie is the puppets themselves, they are really the stars and can exclude anything but Guy Rolfe himself (he is the puppeteer) and although you can see their wires and strings, they carry me through the painful beginning to finish by Retro -marionetmester. Finally, PM7 is recommended for true fanatics, who happen to be masochists. <br /> <br /> Roach <br /> <br />
