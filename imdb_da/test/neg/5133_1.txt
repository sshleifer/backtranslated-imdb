I loved heavenly creatures and make it a point to catch it when it's on. So imagine my joy when I discovered Love and Suicide while looking at NetFlix. Echoing Heavenly Creatures, an easy choice to top off my queue it went. <br /> <br /> I saw the last one, made me comfortable and waited. What I thought was a scary example of a stoned high school student's prank film project (I sounded once or twice and thought "just dropped the line for video") turned out to be the movie. Terrible play, amateur direction, weak dialogue. I usually enjoy low budget movies, something tangible and right on them because they can't afford the superficial things to distract from "meat" ???? the act, the direction, the plot, the story. I would look like a student who has not studied for an exam, goes in and knows he will fail and just put his head on the desk and sleep. <br /> <br /> In the hands of others, the plot would have serious potential. Don't expect magic or even a cult classic such as. Divine's Polyester or Showgirls. At least, you learn to expect bad acting. <br /> <br /> Love & Suicide went from bad to worse, to the WORST movie I've ever seen.
