Hubie - like the Stanely troll from Bluth's Troll in Central Park - lacks the personality's spark to be the protagonist carrying a whole movie. We would like him because he is nice, but it is all about him. <br /> <br /> His cartoon design is unappealing. At the top of the head is a kind of dome that is narrower than the pudgy bottom half of the head. <br /> <br /> And penguins shouldn't have teeth. I know the Iago Parrot in Aladdin had teeth, but maybe it worked because it made him look like his voice actor Gilbert Gottfried. Hubie, with his small little voice (provided by Martin Short), looks funny with the big set of chompers in his beak. <br /> <br /> Tim Curry, who is usually nice to be wicked, makes a kind of dippy surfer dude accent as the villain (perhaps having been a good voice to a comic relief accomplice, not the allegedly threatening head villain). <br /> <br /> The whole plot is about the hero and villains' love of female penguin Marina, who is as boring as both her suitors. <br /> <br /> Worst of all is the pacing. We continue to cut back to the villain to see him threaten Marina even more - this time in dialogue, this time in song ... Barry Manilow can be a good songwriter, but in animated films like this and Thumbelina, his songs feel relaxed and noisy - especially the ballads. The only song I liked was the 1930s "Good Ship Misery" song. <br /> <br /> I read that the distributor made some cuts in this movie against the wishes of the filmmakers, and it could have caused some of the problems - although I suppose the real problem is that they don't cut the rest of it; ).
