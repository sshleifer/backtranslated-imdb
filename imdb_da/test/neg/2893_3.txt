This is a really really bad movie. But it is good to laugh at the terrible ideas and "special" effects. The site is centered around an EU space agency that discovers a 10th planet that orbits directly opposite the earth. They send a manned mission (they've been in Mars and haven't yet discovered this planet? Is anyone stupid enough to fall to this?) To the planet and can you believe it is the mirror image of the planet they came from. Most of it is predictable from that time. Honestly from the title of the movie you can guess almost everything. The only surprising thing here is a manic space program run by Eurpoeans :) There really can't be any excuse for plot concept or execution. So it's good for a laugh or maybe if you're in a changed state of consciousness.
