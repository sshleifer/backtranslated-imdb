To summarize this movie, it is LaBute who carries his sadism into the realm of the comic farce. The predictable result is that he constantly enters all the jokes by insisting on enclosing them with blood-fighting violence and extremely hateful characters. There are also signs of his continued efforts to insult and ridicule everything in sight, but then apologize for it with weak gestures to the PC. Basically, the film just doesn't work, its plot is beyond rooted, the characters are one-dimensional clich√©s, there is no consistency or development of anything, and the comedy (where it's not quite out of place) is the worst kind of High Concept drive. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are wasted on characters resembling parodies of the studio-driven audience pandering - whatever, making them sympathetic, neutral (and neutered) and full of moral attitudes. Crispin Glover is here as long enough to convince you that he doesn't belong in movies anymore. Chris Rock actually has negative chemistry with fellow hitman Freeman - it's as if they appear in different spaces even when they are two inches apart. In fact, Chris Rock looks like a digital bet. At least he is not as annoying as Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> LaBute's 15 minutes may well be up now. It already looks as though he's overstayed his welcome.
