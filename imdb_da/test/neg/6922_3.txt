When this got a theater release nowhere around the globe, it only serves as a reminder of where the careers of the talented ladies Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich went. It is also a certain lattice kind of movie, the kind that seems to be smart, fun and original, while they are poor in all aspects. Full guilt can go to Brian Burns, who wrote and directed this pot boiler. His script takes a rather unoriginal situation and goes exactly with it. The situations develop completely without any internal logic, in addition to a desperate scriptwriter. Characters are thinner than cardboard cuts, behave stupidly and without any real motivation. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the inclusion of Mrs Richards. We do not believe in her relationship with David Krumholtz's character for a minute, and the way she is brought into play after an hour's trademark is particularly pitiful. Why should anyone fall for an egocentric, self-obsessed, arrogant b ** ch like this initially, much less another time? Especially after finding his ... true love? And if any of these things are not enough to completely sink this movie than the central couple is. Krumholtz and Jovovit's coupling are only slightly more credible or developed than the Richards, but it is of no use. There is no chemistry, no spark, nothing that we may loosely accept as a credible couple. Worse, these two key characters are particularly annoying and annoying, making annoying and annoying things that the viewer finally has no interest in. Overall, a very poor view. Even die-hard rom-com fans might want to pass this on, as there are dozens of movies made with more skill or more charm.
