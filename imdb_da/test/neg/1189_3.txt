If you saw the series and love the league like me, get ready to be disappointed. I went to the cinema with a group of die-hard league fans and we all agreed that this movie wasn't as fun or dark as the three series before. In my personal opinion, it was a money spinner. The script was constructed and the plot confused - not confusingly just confused with what it was trying to do. It was complacency of the worst kind of writers who are far more talented than my graceful criticism. I hope the league can at least be honest enough with itself and recognize this movie as being worse than the amazing three series. I will not buy it despite the fact that you own most of the league memorabilia.
