It's hard to believe that a movie this bad was not produced once, but four times! Most movies require some "suspension of reality" to enjoy, but this one just takes it too far. The basic scenario is an air force pilot shot down over a 'Middle Eastern' country. The US government is pulling its feet to reclaim the pilot of the pilot's son (Doug Masters) to attempt a rescue mission. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with the movie is that it portrays the US Air Force as a colossal joke. In the film, you find that Doug and his friends on the airbase manage to secure two F-16s, all the ammunition, the fuel, Intel for the mission and so on. Security at this base seems to be a joke. No one seems to have a problem that a sixteen-year-old child is fully qualified to lead an F-16! <br /> <br /> If that wasn't enough, you'd think the producers would at least try to get the Ammunition right, as people like to see things blow up. Not so! Several times in the film, Doug burns off AIM-9 Missiles on ground targets. AIM stands for `Air Intercept Missile ', which means a weapon used to hit targets in AIR. He also burns out 15-20 missiles where the maximum one F-16 can hold is 6 AIM-9s. The film also lacks continuity. You can see the plane configured with a set of ammunition, and in the next scene it has a completely different ammunition package. 20MM not only destroys what it touches! An F-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20MM, and it is mostly used for self-defense. <br /> <br /> I could go on forever with plot holes, bugs, and completely wrong information from the movie, but I won I didn't carry you. If you're in the mood to watch a good Air Force movie, your choices are pretty slim. Most military films act either with the army, navy or navy. Until Hollywood can make an Air Force movie on the lines "Save Private Ryan" or "A Little Good Men", we are forced to watch movies like the Iron Eagle series. <br /> <br />
