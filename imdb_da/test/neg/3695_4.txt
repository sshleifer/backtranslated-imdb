A woman as rich as she is uncertain has a history of alcoholism and nervous breakdown, undoubtedly helped a happy talking gigolo man who openly cheats on her. Of course, no one believes her when she claims to have been attracted to a huge man who stepped out of a huge satellite. Much to the delight of her husband, it may be the event that finally puts her away for good. <br /> <br /> From the very open scenes, with the ridiculous news broadcast and ridiculous satellite coincidence, you'll probably be convinced that the only redeeming value of this movie is that it's so bad it's fun. Although it's not too far away from the brand, it's certainly not true. Unlike most movies in this genre, this is not really a sci-fi or a horror movie, but actually a serious drama that intelligently incorporates a sci-fi scenario into the plot. It is not a good or even mediocre drama, but it will exceed your expectations if you do not expect any legitimate drama at all. The play is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort, and most importantly, it is well edited and excellent. It's never boring and manages to generate more than a little interest in seeing what's coming next. Nevertheless, this is still a movie strictly for those who cannot pass the chance to watch a 1950's movie entitled "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"!
