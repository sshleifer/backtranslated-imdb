The messengers are a bad, generic and boring '' horror '' movie. The movie has a big problem: it doesn't scare. The performances and the manuscript are quite stupid. It uses old tricks to scare and all supernatural events make fun. I wouldn't call the Messengers like a bad movie ... I would call it an accidental comedy because it's so bad that makes fun. The only good thing about this movie is that it is short, so this shit won't stay with us for so long. There are many masterpieces of horror genre that count with a low budget (such as Subject Two, Lucky or May), which unfortunately are ignored while this step is a success in the box office. So I do not recommend this weak and pathetic horror movie called The Messengers.
