The incomparable Paul Naschy, the thrill movie icon for Spain, gives his talents to this entertaining, if not scattershot, movie. What begins as an action girl ends with a horror story. All I can say is just sit back and enjoy the trip. Paul Naschy plays a cold-hearted healer hired by some shady Japanese diamond hunters (one of whom is his flame carrying his child) to push a cache of diamonds from a Belgian businessman. When the deed is complete, the attraction of the diamond is tempting to dismiss Paul, killing his Japanese cohorts. His girlfriend, whose brother Paul killed, raises revenge and chases Paul through the woods, shoots him up and leaves him for death. Paul, however, was found by a head of the head with two horned daughters and brought to his estate to recover. <br /> <br /> In the yard, the two daughters, Silvia Aguilar and Azucena Hernandez, are fighting for Paul in his weakened state, with the busy Silvia Aguilar determined not to lose weight to the sweet and primary Azucena. But things get tough for Mr Naschy, who begins to see the ghost of his daughter's long dead mother in the real estate. Couple this with the Japanese lass trying to finish the job of killing Paul and he is being pulled from two sides. <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (The story goes in a number of ways and doesn't fully meet. Script builds a struggle for Paul between daughters, but Silvia, whose character seems assertive and fleeting, only makes Azucena possible to win in the Paul Naschy competitions without putting a fight in. Personally, I would have preferred the ghostly story to revenge the Japanese woman) <br /> <br /> BOLD: $ $$$ $$$ $$$$ $$$ $$$ $$$ & & Games accounters & $$$ \ t $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $> $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $> < br /> FOLLOWING: $$$ (Paul Naschy is always fun to watch, but he spends a little too much time in the bed getting back from his wounds. With his again, the delicious Silvia Aguilar and the beautiful Azucena Hernandez, who made with Mr Naschy in the little gem "The Craving." Both girls do a good job. <br /> <br /> NUDITY: $$$ (You f years very short glimpse of both Aguilar and Hernandez, but they are strategically placed and keep the exact bits covered. Full nudity is provided by the two less appealing actresses: The Japanese woman chases Paul and the African girl working for Silvia and Azucena.
