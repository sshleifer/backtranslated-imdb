Just watched this movie at Fantasy Filmfest BERLIN. I'm not impressed. <br /> <br /> As far as history goes. For girlfriends returning from their vacation in Mexico. While waiting for their luggage, they learn a few boys, who then takes the last and of course the wrong bus to the city. On board is also another elderly man, so strangely stated that you immediately guess that he is one of the evil ones. The other is the driver. Sagittarius takes them to industrial wasteland and then after the other gets finished, a small blood, part of the extremities, some violence that mostly plays with fear of girls in the end after some up and down, heres and there are some Not for new scary moments, everyone is dead, but the driver and the girls. the girls end up in a garage where one of them is killed after admitting she had slept with the other girlfriend. The other girl, which is the conclusion, is sold by the left over the kidnapper (yep, weirdo was killed) in a freight box to Asia (a freight port is the final image.) First. History. Lots of loopholes, questions you ask yourself, loose ends and a conclusion that is not a good revelation but a total disappointment. I can't see how such an unprofessional loser is supposed to have abducted dozens of women (as shown by a drawer full of driver's license ... aha) Other. Acting. Mediocre at best. <br /> <br /> Third. Scare Factor. OKAY. but I am sorry torture as a means to anything but oneself. Trading with people can be a good reason for a terrible flip, but it is not used as one, like a background. Fourth, music and sound. Some great experiments, but the sound capabilities of industrial landscape, warehouse and truck sounds have not been explored. Music? Would have been worse without it, but apart from that. Some pseudo-moving synth string theme for emotionality when the girls reach their final destination. OK, I think. <br /> <br /> Rating: AVOID IT!
