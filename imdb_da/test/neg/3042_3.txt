While sleeping in an isolated Colorado house, a teenage girl is being terrorized by an elusive killer on the phone. <br /> <br /> Remake of the 1979 classic horror movie basically takes the opening 20 minutes of the original movie and stretches it to fit an 87 minute time period! So it is rather unnecessary to say that the plot of this remake is pretty thin. There is little in the way of originality or interest in this movie. There are many Camilla Belle who marvel at a dark house and wonder who is calling her and encountering all sorts of false horror. It all becomes repetitive and routine after the first 30 minutes and never manages to muster much in the way of excitement or chills. It certainly never reaches the intensity of the original movie, especially as it teems out and changes an important plot point from the original. I think we have the PG-13 thanks for that. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, there is an impressive set of designs and a dark atmosphere, unfortunately not much is happening to save this remake from being a sub-pair. Belle's performance is also quite mediocre. <br /> <br /> It's just another impressive remake. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 out of ****
