Steven Seagal played in many action films. Most of them were bad, but not bad as Patriot. This is a Z series action low budget movie. After Operation Delta Force, War Law, Substitute 2, Plato's Run, Base, Drive, Sabotage, etc. Comes Patriot. Now Steven Seagal is sure to be considered a bad actor like Mark Dacascos, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Treat Williams, Jack Scalia, Gary Busey, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others. The scenario was full of gaps and the characters were not realistic (perhaps because of the very bad actors) and the 4.25 bucks you use to rent the Patriot are called Lost Money !!! I give it 0 and a half (for laughs) out of 5.
