absolutely nothing about this movie is fun, interesting or relevant. In addition to two characters that come together at the end, there is never anything loose and there is no plot. and by the way, what is it about the DVD cover? it has a female ass in daisy cloth shorts ... where was that scene in the movie? No one has ever used thousands of dukes in this movie! Surprisingly, almost all the actors in this movie are good and jack black plays a full song (could be a steady d track ... don't know for yourself) ... it's the only redeeming values. Generally, it's just a waste of time.
