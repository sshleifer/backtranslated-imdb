"Destroy All Planets" wins by settling down to "destroy all Tokyo" at the end of the movie, as a space monster reminiscent of a huge squid falls to the reptile oven known as Gamera. In fact, Gamera hides from the prisoner go and knocks out Varian Space Ship # 1 even before the first set of movie credits. The scene changes to a Japanese scout camp, where we meet a couple of uninhibited young heroes, Jim and Masao, who participate in Gama's exploitation after being kidnapped by foreigners and the jet aboard their ship in an electrified bubble guard. <br /> <It is quite striking to see the boys convince a scientist to let them run a newly invented submarine that may be defective. Former boy genius Masao had wired the device to run in the reverse direction of its controls, but Dr. Dobie was not thinking of controlling it as an option. At least, the boys prepared to disturb the spacecraft's controls by playing the switcheroo with a bunch of triangular blocks. <br /> <br /> When managerial adventures Viras says' Enable the videotron, you need to sit on your seats to rehash recordings from previous Gamera movies where he fights Barugon and Gyaos. These take up quite a bit of screen time, but are no match for the fast-forward button if you want to continue with it. Viras long ago referred to an invisible crew member, and when they were finally admitted, the Orientals could fly - imagine it! <br /> <br /> When we saw how these movies were made for a youth audience, it is surprising to see how cruel some of the scenes are. Gamera's drawing blood is going to think and how the couple of crew members are beheaded. When octopus tentacles began to come out of the headless organs, I made a connection to the 'Alien' films; Having the individual units merge to form the giant Viras was a neat entity. I suppose the appeal for young children might be in identifying with the two young heroes who make friends with a giant monster, moving beautifully freely on an alien spaceship and getting what they want, using alien telepathy technology. Seeing how the movie was probably made by adults could have been a simple case of wish list.
