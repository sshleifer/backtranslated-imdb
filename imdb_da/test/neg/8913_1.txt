I do not like to see the steven seagull movie because of the actions of the big plot holes, but just because it makes me laugh oh it makes me laugh so hard that this movie has no meaning and is ridiculous about this movie pearl harbor rocks !!! and Ben affleck does not need any plays just to give an impression of how bad it is. First of all, there are so many goofs and bad plays, it just gets worse when the steven tries to get out of jail a helicopter lands in the first place the security announcement, and they brought them countries when they fly away suddenly a guard starts shooting < br /> <br /> or when he killed the guy in the car, he and traitor both times away you can see no oil on the ground behind him. Steven notes that there is oil without even seeing traitors, tipping a lighter, and the car is blowing up <br /> <br /> and there are plenty of more goofs. Steven uses his basic action when someone points to a gun at him, he tackles it and shoots him completely choking !!! as a gangster would let it ever happen. <br /> <br /> The play is also much worse on the battle scene in the prison outdoor place you can see the steven clearly waiting to get into action just flush it a few time and you feel the bad action <br /> <br / > it just makes me laugh, i hope someday come to the cinema here in Holland, then i will go there with as many friends as possible just to laugh myself to death
