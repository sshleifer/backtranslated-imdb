Anupam Kher is an outstanding actor, he debuted at 28 plays a 50-year-old in Sarayans <br /> <br /> Now he becomes director with OJJ <br /> <br /> The movie has a good plot but it's regressive The theme has been put to death and Urmila's character also looks, while Anil-Mahima and the Abhi- Tara tracks are too sudden and so forgotten. <br /> <br /> The movie moves in a snail and begins to pull, but there are several good scenes like the whole conflict between Anil-Fardeen and Abhishek, where Fardeen says to sell the house. <br /> <br /> Abhishek gets caught for a crime and Anil shouts at him <br /> <br /> The climate is too much, but <br /> <br /> The directive Anupam shows potential but has a some way to go. Music is okay. Anil Kapoor excels in his part as always Fardeen tries hard and is okay but needs improvement Abhishek is excellent, this was a turn at present, people realized he can trade Urmila is okay Mahima and Tara are wasted Waheeda is good
