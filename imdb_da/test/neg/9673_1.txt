I wanted to say this, since I first saw the movie, I still won't allow any of my children or grandchildren to see this. At least not until I tell them, and they understand it's totally fiction. The only thing I saw was correct was that animals went on the sheet, everything else was fake. Lot and Noah fight on the sea like a pirate movie. Be sure to tell your children the right story before allowing them to see it, but really, until they are old enough to understand that it is not right, they may have a confused vision of the Bible. This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Bruce and Evan Almighty were much better and had more to teach. Let your children see them
