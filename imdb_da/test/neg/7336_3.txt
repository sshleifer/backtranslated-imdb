Let me first mention the fact that, despite the title ("Stories" in plural), there is only one kitchen story. Regarding whether Isaac died or not at the end, I am not so sure since he sees HYGEN PIPE lying on the table next to the two cups in one of the very first scenes. On the DVD deck there is a reference to Tati. It claims that the movie is "très drôle: rappelle Tati!" ("Very Fun: Reminiscent of Tati!". The great Jacques Tati relied mostly on mime and silent death positions to achieve his comic effects and offer his critical satirical views of His 1950s French "modern" community. Of course, "kitchen" is going on during the 1950s, and it gives some (rather weak) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy, and there are some long moments where there is no word - but They are not really fun. Are all these little details enough to make "Kitchen" a "Tatiesque" movie? That said, I have to admit that "Kitchen" is about the sometimes false objectivity of scientific research over "The truth" of human subjective emotions In general, the film was agonizingly slow, with nothing much happening - with almost no "dramatic impulse": the parts involved were created during the first 15 minutes or d by the way, and over the last few hours or so. The last segment was actually - FINALLY !!! - interesting and moving. It may appear that it was a short topic in less than an hour, stretched for about 90 minutes. Now about the setup (a "scientific" observation about single men's behavior in their kitchen): it was initially very promising - with the mapping of the bachelors' coming and ending in their kitchen as a means of determining which new inventions would be most useful to come by. But very quickly, this prize proved to be just a prologue, an excuse to introduce the real topic, which was only fully developed to the end, and which was about loneliness and the invaluable bond of friendship. Shame! I honestly wanted to like that movie. Yes, it seemed so promising when I heard about some of its unusual little "anecdotes" - which actually were there and which I needed - as the burning of a man's nasal hair (instead of using scissors to cut it off) "The investment "In having a large amount of valuable" black pepper stacked away in a barn, the role of the role (the observed being observed), a man's mouth emits sounds from a radio program. And there is also a sick horse that becomes the catalyst for half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of right or left driving in Sweden and Norway (a reflection of the importance of each of these very close neighboring states to confirm their individuality?). Am I the only person who does not fully enjoy that movie? Does that necessarily mean I'm wrong? Perhaps it is almost commonly praised "fine points", was actually "too subtle" for me? Perhaps ... Can my individual views on this film ironically reflect the very core of the movie - which would be the crucial necessity of having the right to deviate, affirm one's individuality, and not blindly follow the trends and opinions of society? Every one of us has the right to have different personal views and not to be a slave to the demands of their bread-winning "dictatorial" demands: often we have other alternatives that allow us all to be useful to our society while respecting one's inner principles. In short, to be true to itself - the way Folke (Isaac's scientific observer) ends up giving up his job while he prefers to stay in his new friend Isaac's house and help him out with his farm's tasks ... And then, "Vive la différence," as the French say!
