That's what this movie is. Good God, the special effects suck in this movie. It's hard for anything to suck more than this movie's plot, but the special effects manage to pull it out. Let me try to explain how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> First, there is the plot. There are four punk-ass teenage dirt cyclists running around in a forest in Duluth, MN. One of them is a stupid ass and tries a ridiculous leap and breaks his leg. A paramedic will help him, but will be stranded with them when the helicopter breaks. Then all five realize that there is a forest fire that we see is started by a guy who dumps lots of gas over the forest. All they show us are his boots and they show the scene after the scene of these guys boots going around dumping gas and starting fires. Meanwhile, teens are trying to escape the fire, only to find out that the bootman has somehow managed to get ahead of them (while they were moving through the forest on dirt bikes!), Dump the gas all over the area they ride through and start several fires. He does it several times, and the paramedic finally catches him and starts him on fire. I don't want to spoil the end, but this guy's resilience will make you shout "WHAT BLOODY HELL?!?!" on screen. In any case, they are now surrounded by fire, and their only escape is through a mine filled with methane gas. Yes, methane gas. I will not even try to describe the end because it is too ridiculous and you will enjoy it more if you do not see it coming. As you don't want, because you can't expect what happens. This is because of the second major problem with this film: consistency. Is there any kind of consistency too much to ask for? Apparently so. I can't even count the number of broken limbs in this movie (they keep breaking arms and legs as they crash their bikes). I think every character breaks at least one limb and more than one. Then they glued around until the stage ended and then forget that they should have broken limbs. There is a scene where three of those who should have broken legs start dancing. But then their injuries suddenly come back when the plot needs them. <br /> <br /> Finally, CGI. If there's a hell of it, it's about watching the fire in this movie. All they did for forest fires is the line gravel roads with CGI fire. You can clearly see that the only CGI fire is along the paths and all the trees more than two meters from the path are untouched. And then they zoom out and show that the whole forest is absorbed in flames. It's hard to describe in words how ridiculous it looks, but I assure you that ridicule is quite impressive. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the so-bad-good types. There are some occasions where it falls into the painful bad category, but mostly remains over the line and is ridiculously unlucky. I can't wait to check out the other Nature Unleashed movies that came in four-pack with this one.
