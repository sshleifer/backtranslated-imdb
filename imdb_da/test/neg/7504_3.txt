Seen in the near future, a dark stranger walks in some South American cities plagued by zombies. To settle with a group of friendly face residents teaches our alien harsh reality. There are two groups of people; The upper classes that live safely behind the city's concrete walls are supplied at the right price by the state police. Then there are our friendly face residents. These lower class people live alongside the zombies. There are only means to survive trading goods they grow during the day with the police in exchange for food. Our strangers discover why his world is plagued by zombies. A new diet pill that suppressed the urge for carbohydrates was the foundation. People's desire to shed fat caused the fall of society as we know it. These pills increased the desire for protein, ie. meat, even the pet poodle. However, there was a more serious side effect. After death, people were revived with an even stronger requirement for protein, namely human flesh. <br /> <br /> With what I feel is an imaginative introduction, I felt that this movie many realize some inventive material. What better way could explain the cause of the zombie race than with a modern idea of ​​people's desire to do something to change their body without the hard work of the gym? However, the imagination of this movie soon stopped after this show. This movie falls into the old trap of 'I can't imagine how the world will be when society breaks'. When you watch this movie, you do not avoid another world as you do when you see the Apes planet (original), Alien, Mad Max or Texas Chain Saw (original). In this film, the alternative society is defined by people with hair dyed orange and green. Face painting and charity shop leather jackets. There is no hardness about life in this alternative society, just healthy faces and over finished zombies. Films should allow you to escape the fact that you need to clear your wardrobe and take your old clothes to the charity shop. Forget some of the pitiful plays or the crowded zombies. This movie fails because it is too polished, too sympathetic and too predictable. I've seen movies like this since the early eighties. If you are going to make a movie of this kind, I suggest you see again movies like Dawn of the Dead (original and remake), Threads or Fulci's Zombie to see and experience the sense of desperation in a destroyed society.
