I am surprised that so many people find this movie even close to good. Let me make it clear that I am a great Hitchcock fan and went out of my way to own as many of his films on video as I could, but the one I felt was so under par, not just for Hitch's movie - ok heck, In 'I'm too good here. This picture really sucked. I don't care that Hitch did a favor for the very talented Carole Lombard, but I've seen 50s sitcoms with more wisdom and style than this boring turkey. Chemistry between Lombard and Robert Montgomery? List I love mashed potatoes and ice cream, but I don't want to taste them together. I've seen better chemistry in chemical emissions on the main road than here. <br /> <br /> If you really love Hitchcock, avoid this movie and see any of his better. To cry aloud, the bits Hitch made the old TV show more fun than anything that this movie mistakenly delivers.
