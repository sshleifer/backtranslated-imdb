This documentary has many problems. <br /> <br /> How arrogant is to make a documentary about your own family? I understand that the subject is interesting. I was sad. This is not a fascinating story for me, and I do not know why you would think it was. <br /> <br /> I don't want to come out as a means, but I have to say: Most of the people in this movie are just not attractive. And it's ok, not everyone is beautiful. But your camera technique, keeping the lens in their face so you can't help but be overwhelmed by their unpleasant appearance because it fills your 47 "TV is not fun. I had to put my hand up half of Time to protect myself from warts, wrinkles, bags under the eyes and yellow teeth. I'm really not trying to sound inhumane, but pull the camera back so it's not like alien strangers breathe in my face. > <br /> The camera's work in this "movie" is rank amateur level.This is the kind of camera work you see from everyone with a camcorder in a family picnic. That is, if you want to make this a living. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't see what the big deal is about this thing.
