This show makes absolutely no sense. Every week, two ladies go on a property to do some gardening, and each week they stumble upon a murder in some way without error. Because everyone who owns a large house with a large garden is involved in a murder, doesn't it? But even if they somehow happened to stumble upon murder after murder, wouldn't it be wise to tell the police? You know the people who can actually do something about it ... But every week these two fools go around, polluting evidence, commit self-crimes and in some cases cause more murders. When they miraculously solve the murders, there is no way the killer could ever be judged. All evidence has been sabotaged. And you would think that people covering murder would think not to hire these two, wouldn't you? Yay! We've solved the murder! Just like every other week, let's go and confront the killer ourselves and tell them we don't know it without security. There is no way we could get into any danger, is there? Rosemary and Thyme are one of the worst shows on television, and certainly the most ridiculous.
