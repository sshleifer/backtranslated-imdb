Even after the standards of most B movies, this movie is by far the worst thing I have ever seen. The graphics are so bad that a man in a monster suit looks more realistic. The water effects of the sea are particularly ridiculous, including one scene where they control the mini-sub and the "water" resembles its frozen in place. The problems with this movie are so many that I just want to stop here with the details. Needless to say, I do not like you when I say that even Uwe Toilet Boll itself could do a better job. Avoid this movie at all costs, there are other B-grade movies out there that, despite being horrible, are at least a good way to pass the time.
