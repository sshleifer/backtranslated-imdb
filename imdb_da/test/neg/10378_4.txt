Is the Cannes controversy remarkably esoteric, or is it that we Americans are so cynical and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines anymore? Join, as it can, with great careful analysis, "Falscher Confessions" at no time seems to live up to the hypnotized controversy that it allegedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a creepy blunt and pointless movie that rather lives up to it glum American titles ("Low Profile"). <br /> <br /> Based on well-known themes of Bourgeoise's anxiety and subsequent sexual liberation (kind), it is a film that is not surface interest. It starts with a grabber as a haunting shot of a deserted off-the-highway road focuses on a teenage drive that ultimately goes into a total car, where it seems a brutal hit-and-run that has left the driver dead in a gory mess. Stunned, he does nothing but picks up a scrap of the remaining engine. <br /> <br /> Out of school, the drives are apparently Armin Steebe, a product of the German suburbs with minimal ambition. Persistently pressured by his caring, but slightly creeping parents to find a good job, he interviews every interview with every polite interviewer along with it, all with the same fruitless outcome. By becoming severely ill, his aforementioned motorway community soon encourages his first rebel act: asserts responsibility for the crime he did not commit. <br /> <br /> Trying to fill in more applications and go to more and more bizarre job interviews at sunrise, he participates in road side sexual fantasies and petty vandalism long after sunset. As the days become shorter and the nights get much warmer, he still lives in his suburbs, as if he is not doing anything beyond normal. <br /> <br /> If you feel confused about what's happening right now, don't worry about being the only one: It's about as far and coherent as the story gets. The reason seems to be simple enough, and perhaps because of the apparent direct purpose, why "Falscher acquaintances" become meaningless confused and become enchanted by endless false conclusions, dreamy situations, and graphic sex scenes to try to disclose a missing story. clear logic to an already vague argument (presumably the rare emotional effects of the modern suburbs, or something about the youth's fascination with crime. Hey, it could even be a forthcoming movie.). It takes a lot of time to create many symbols, both tangible and surreal allegorical, but they do not seem to really symbolize anything of interest. <br /> <br /> However, the most fatal error is how the filmmakers paint all their characters in a rough shadow of vanilla. There are hardly any distinctive features that help to understand their purpose, and how secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between Armin and his fairly normal - perhaps for normal family) catalyze the already underdeveloped main character's "plight" never comes into focus. How should we identify with this young, almost adult rebellion, with the small sense of the world he lives in or the prominent figures around him that help embrace it? <br /> <br /> Many people go in and out of the movie (including Armin's kind girlfriend Katja and a strange, wealthy visitor who for some reason finds pleasure in seeing the protagonist eating brownies) and seems to exist for no one reason at all. They ultimately look like a long-lasting cushion for an already thin story with meaningless subplots that continue to prove that the film is a total shine about where to go. <br /> <br /> And even a movie that apparently plays with reality (especially with Armin's nocturnal exploits), it ends with a literally, almost moralizing scraper, who seems to stop questioning a "story" that does little , but puts the viewer in a state of meaningless exhaustion. <br /> <br /> Without color it is impossible to shadow anything important.
