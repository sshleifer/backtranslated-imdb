Why was this movie ever made? They have tarnished the original Caddyshack with this crap. I could only see half of it and I didn't even laugh. At least I didn't pay to see it because it was at t.v. But I will not come back the hour of my life that I used to see this terrible mess. There wasn't an original star from the first except for Chevy Chase and he probably regrets making this movie. Jackie Mason was supposed to be the scandalous, fun buffoon that Rodney Dangerfield was at first, but Jackie Mason was not at all funny. Jackie Mason is no Rodney Dangerfield. If you want to laugh then see the first Caddyshack. If you like horrible movies, then you are here movie. This movie stinks like a barnyard in July. Outside at all costs.
