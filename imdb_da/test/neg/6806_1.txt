To enjoy 'Fur - an imaginary portrait of Diane Arbus', Stephen Shainberg has the viewer suspending all reality and prior knowledge of the American photographer Diane Arbus. Paradoxically, there is much use of Diane Arbus's name and knowledge for her life and work that puts this movie to great success. <br /> <br /> It is becoming clear early on the cast of beautiful WASPish and glamorous Nicole Kidman as the anti-glamorous Jewish Diane Arbus is that Shainberg did not get Arbus or what her work was about (unentimental realism) and seems only attracted to Arbus on a shallow plane through his photographs of circus freaks. <br /> <br /> What follows is a kind of beautiful and trivial beauty and beast fantasy biopic with Robert Downey JR as Kidman's hairy fictional love interest. However, it is not the banality of history that is the biggest mistake in this film, but the director's misogynistic attitude that Diane Arbus, one of the world's most unique and original female photographers, was unable to form his own ideas about her work. While his former film 'secretary' was a study of female masochism, his continuing portrayal of the woman as entertaining this film completely destroys - and real life flies Diane Arbus' courage, persistence and fearlessness in single-stage exploration of often shady world outsiders. <br /> <br /> Imagine an imaginary biopic on the pop star Madonna's life with Guy Richie as her Svengali, the man behind her career, and you get a sense of how serious errors and imaginary this movie is: It can only work if You do not completely know the subject, or just choose to ignore all the facts. It's a shame because when you remove all reference to Diane Arbus, this movie could have stood out as an interesting study of fetishism and a good companion to the secretary. 4.10
