Man, I went to this movie because of the great example. It looked like it had a fantastic story and fine special effects. <br /> <br /> I was wrong. I wanted to go out of the theater because of these terrible special effects. A comic book dino, of a cart card would do even better work than this. The story was fine if it had been taken by a big film producer. Who would hesitate in some more money to make the effect more lifetime. The only thing I liked about this movie is where the plants show up everywhere. <br /> <br /> Even worse, cars in a scene 2 characters walk along the street. If you see these cars, you see the following: Taxi, car, motorcycle, tri-pod, big bus. And about 4x in a row! <br /> <br /> And then there is the "death of the butterfly" that would bring the whole "evolution of change" into progress. If that guy didn't go on the butterfly, the next dino would have eaten it anyway! So it's absolute bull. So if you change something in the past, the future will be different at the same time. Not in the "time waves" they made. But hey, if the future changed in a split second, the movie would be even worse, but more realistic. This is just one of the movies you should see when you want a good laugh. I spend way too much money on this movie in the theater. And then they tell me that this movie had a $ 80 million budget. Where has all the money gone ????
