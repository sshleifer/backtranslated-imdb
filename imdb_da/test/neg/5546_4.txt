This sequel to "In the Heat of the Night" will suffer inevitable comparisons with its infinitely better predecessor. Instead of looking like a theater movie edited for television, Mister Tibbs looks suspiciously like a television movie edited for theatrical releases, featuring grainy photography, osteoporotic titles, and sets that look as though made of plywood. The murder sequence has a sharp continuity error: the camera shows two hands that choke the girl, so a shot of a hand reaches for a statuette, then a shot of the girl is cattle with two hands again and finally the statuette must come down for fatal blow. The solution of the case must be easy: Find the only guy with three hands! But the foamed production values ​​cannot completely conceal this film's significant benefits: namely, Sidney Poitier's performance as the cool detective decides to follow the evidence, wherever it may lead, even if it involves a friend. Martin Landau is also convincing as the do-gooder preacher activist suspected of brutally murdering his prostitute girlfriend. Besides being haunted by the case, Tibb's conflict with his home life is, but the issues of race and Tibbs' barely hidden sense of social exclusion are absent here. Then the complex murder mystery that made "in the heat of the night" so convincing.
