This movie is a hodge-podge of various idiotic clich√©s. For example, boy-meeting-spoiled-rich girl and making her fall in love with him by harassing her in college (an overused background in recent Indian commercials). A male chauvinistic glorification of sexual conquest. The climax is predictable (has been used ad nauseum in several other films). As with many other recent commercial Hindi movies, the movie is immense with the incongruous insertion of songs that probably contributed to the movie's success more than anything else.
