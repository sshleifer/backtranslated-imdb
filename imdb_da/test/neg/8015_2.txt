I rented this because I couldn't pass the chance to see pre-Hollywood fame Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones together, but it certainly wasn't worth it. The only reason I give it two stars instead of one is for the news to see them before they made it big across the pond. <br /> <br /> Zeta Jones, who is usually fun to see though she is not the biggest thesp in the world, is horrible. Owen seems really uncomfortable to be in such a turkey, plus he carries a ridiculous, immensely poor fit on chin length (at least I hope it is a wig and not his real hair). And the scene where he dances a country jig with Zeta Jones just makes you embarrassed by him. Joan Plowright walks around in a drowsy movie - she probably speculates how she got to such a mess. The actress who plays Clive Owen's wife is not horrible, but almost everyone else is. Oh, and the writing also stinks.
