I do not understand why some of you (or many) have given this movie up 8 stars out of 10. Do you understand that there are lower ratings for a reason? Sure, this can be a zombie flick with some splatter, but that's it. I'm not a hater of zombie movie, but it was terrible. Really, actually I should call it more like a zombie soap, because that's how the action is. The production is ... okay. Barely an attempt to develop plot, horrible acting, stupid effects, clich√©s and a sudden end. Go ahead and look like zombie film, but never give it over a 5.0. Frankly, but the only reason you want to watch the movie is to laugh. Seriously.
