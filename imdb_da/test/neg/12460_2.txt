SPOILERS! <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 out of 10 to 2 scenes that I will never forget ..... incidentally, my husband rented this surprisingly, non-blowing up almost chick looking flick ... but i guessed why when i saw the cover .... girls in school uniforms .... duh .... lol .... ah good men if you can't beat them with them. .... ;-) <br /> <br /> <br /> Bijou Philips, one of my favorites on the indie screen ... too sweet ...... doesn't just go into bestiality (her toy dog ​​is the best lesbians in town according to her bubbly scandalous character) .. it would be the first worthy scene .. <br /> <br /> Then she enters a toilet in a lovely dress and enters a stall .... after a while she has got up and goes out to the party she and the pathetically boring 'cat' personality are and hands a shiny silver ice bucket to the host of the party ... the host sees in his precious silver ice bucket and say "oh my god it's poo." <br /> <br /> I love Bijou Phillips herself for her creativity and unusual movie choices, this would definitely be one of them .... and um, I would rent it to the poo scene if i were you ..... i am not a big poo jokes fan but it definitely puts the party people in their place (they didnt look as though they were good in every fall ..... lol) ... You will never forget these two scenes ... Hmm, but is that what we want in our databases? .... Maybe you shouldn't follow my advice at all .... lol <br /> <br /> Dominique Swain is a kind of squirrel and sad in his confusing, incomparable role in 'Tart'. I don't know, I can't tell if I like her because she's so indie movie? Indie movies are amazing and everyone, but could she not choose some good ones? I have to check out a few of her films and reserve them .... but one was (sorry for animal reference) a dog .....
