I saw this remastered on DVD. It had a big picture of Sandra on it and said "Starring Sandra ...." and made it seem like she had a big part in it. Not so. She's right in it. She does what she can with the script, but it's not much. <br /> <br /> The sound was horrible. Thus, I mean, things didn't go together. Shots would be fired and the number of shots did not correspond to the sound. People talk in a car as it moves, and the shot is outside the windshield, but there is no engine noise, road noise or any other sound. Kind of strange. Score was terrible. It sounded like the same few notes over and over again. Dialogue really awful. <br /> <br /> It was terrible I couldn't believe any of it. Fighting scenes were like a Batman cartoon without "BIFF" and "BAM". They were really paralyzed. The shooting scenes I mean by firearms were ridiculous, literally. I quickly accelerated through a lot of this movie. Even then it was too long.
