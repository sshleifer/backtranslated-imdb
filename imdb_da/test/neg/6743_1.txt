Absolutely nothing is redeeming on this total piece of waste, and the only thing worse than watching this movie is to watch it in English class. This is literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It completely ignores and contradicts all themes it can present, so the story is really really boring. Thank goodness the 80s are over, and God saves what man was actually born as "James Bond III".
