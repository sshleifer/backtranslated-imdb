As a massive fan of DM, it goes without saying that I have seen this movie many times. However, I see it purely for the concert films ... the rest of the movie is pretty awful, sad to say. <br /> <br /> Famed rock music director DA Pennebaker followed Fashion around on their late 80s Music For The Masses tour, which promotes the amazing album of the same name. The title 101 stems mainly from the fact that the concert material is included from the 101th and final concert of the Pasadena Bowl tour, but is also a reference to the movie being a beginner's course on the band and how it ticks ie Depeche Mode 101. In the middle of photographs The Quartet, who plays live and explores America, is another story thread covering a group of DM fans who have won a contest to meet the band, go on their own bus bus and attend the finals. <br /> <br /> Now, as I said above, the concert film is great. Fashion is here on top of their form as stadium rock gods, which was a somewhat unusual achievement for an electrorock band back in the late 80s. Although the film captures the band before they recorded their 1990 masterpiece "Violator", there are still many incredible tracks seen and heard here, for example. The rear wheel, the majestic Let me never down again, everything counts, just can't get enough of Vince Clarke years, shake the disease and many more. <br /> <br /> When fashion is on stage, they are brilliant. When they are not, they are very boring. Nothing even of interest is the case with the boys as they check out the United States in the dead days of the Reagan administration. As an example, the likely "highlight" of the material is a visit to a country music store to buy cartridges. Not just exciting things. I know that all the bands don't have to be wild and ruthless idiots, but these guys make the Mormon's tabernacle chorus look like Rammstein. The only real excitement comes from various clips that center on the band's lead singer Dave Gahan. Gahan comes across in 101 as mildly psychotic, talking about a violent force within himself, he can't control, reminiscent of a bizarre racial attack involving a taxi driver, and so on. There's a point in the movie where he throws a fine donna tantrum on a bad bad backstage - really embarrassing. The man obviously had problems again then, which fortunately has been resolved. Songwriter Martin Gore and keyboardist Andy Fletcher are presented as highly articulated, clearly massively talented, but also completely colorless men; while the somewhat enigmatic fourth member Alan Wilder is the only quartet who pulls out the rock star with any kind of aplomb. And as for the "fan tour" thread, it is inflexible dross. Let's not break ourselves. Maybe it's just because it's all so * very * late 80s, but the young devotees' gaggle does a little for me, but gives a sense of irritation. They are, for a person, uniquely superficial and stupid people whose antics are banal when they are not hidden-your-face cringeworthy. Let me repeat ... * Nothing * happens in the footage that is not on the scene of any interest. Nothing. Infinite scenes of children are spraying their hair, arguing inappropriately, changing their clothes, getting lost in cities heading for recordings, and finding their partners in bed with another contest winner making me wonder only one thing - if Cure fans were this mind pliantly boring back in '88 / 89. The love the youth has for the band is something I can certainly relate to, and is sometimes infectively pleasing, but if what we see were the most interesting things out of what was filmed of them, then I would hate to see outta. <br /> <br /> But the music is all that matters and in this respect excels 101. The Pasadena concert, one of their very best footage, makes the movie worth seeing. The latest DVD version of the film comes with a bonus disc containing remnants of the unformed concert film (a good 80% of the performance), making the DVD an absolute must for fans. The audio commentary from the band (minus Wilder, who left fashion in the mid-90s) on the first disc is also strangely more interesting than the film itself. As a document of the boys from Basildon during their amphitheater idol period, Depeche Mode 101 is priceless. But if you are looking for excitement, you have a better chance of getting the included double live album (now available in Super Audio CD format).
