This was the stupidest movie I've ever seen in my life. It's a complete waste of money and time. I went to watch this movie with my friends and since the movie was not a single person in the cinema - not that there were many people there to watch this horrible movie - said "wow what a good movie." Someone actually went out! It was horrible! It was disgusting and I hated every minute of it. My friend put my head in my shoulder towards the end, because she had gotten enough after the scene with Rick in the ceiling. It was not fun at all. Believe me, I went with 11 other girls and not one of my friends liked it. That was ridiculous! I've seen many movies, but it was definitely the worst! I think a scene in the movie is with an old man making a death in a coffin. I just can't do these things.
