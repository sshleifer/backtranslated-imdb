Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is a kind of international criminal mastermind who is wanted in countries across Europe, and to be free he runs up into Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers, where even the police are reluctant to go until a senior officer is sent from Paris to catch le Moko once and for all. For Le Moko, although Casbah allows him to stay out of the custody of the police, it also becomes a kind of prison at the same time - a place he cannot leave because the moment he does, he knows he is being arrested. <br /> <br /> Boyer's performance was good and I can understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. He captures the essence of such a character - a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very nice at the same time. Unfortunately, the movie itself was quite letdown. A number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent as I would mention two. First, the idea was that the police would not enter Casbah. It was said quite clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the film indicate that the police actually entered the Casbah quite regularly. So neither did Commissioner Janvier's suggestion that the police would not enter, nor the opinion of Inspector Slimane (also a decent performance of Joseph Calleia), that they could enter the Casbah, but did not seem to make much sense. I also had difficulty believing that laughing Moko-hardened criminal mastermind that he was - could be so quickly swept by his feet by Gaby (Hedy Lamarr) to the point where he entertained the locals by singing love songs and then leaving The Casbah to find her, essentially give up. I understand the irony of the last few scenes, of course, when Pepe leaves his prison freedom (Casbahen) to find only genuine freedom in his catch (because he's shot and killed by the police.) I just found it impossible to believe that someone like Le Moko would fall into such a trap. This is worth looking at Boyer, and to a lesser extent Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3.10
