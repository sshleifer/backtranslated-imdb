Spoilers !! <br /> <br /> I hate this, but it's better than the others after that, they just get worse. I hope Gibson has smarts to stay out of the next. Much of the same with humor, ie. the toilet, the kids, etc. How much longer can we see their relationship developing. Drugs, evil guys why South Africa! I found it incredible, maybe South American, any country in the golden triangle would have made the script better. It seems that the late 80's 90's had the blonde wicked, ie Die Hard, the mighty Ducks playing Ice Land Gary Busey in the last weapon, etc. Hollywood repeats itself. This one with a similar story must go over the top. The attack on the police, the beach apartment scene and the fight at the end and over Gibson's best girlfriend, who was killed by the copper attack, was too much. Like many part 2's, they get worse, and 3 or 4 in this series lift speed downhill. 3.10
