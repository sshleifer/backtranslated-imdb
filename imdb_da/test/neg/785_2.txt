"Don't be greedy" summarizes the depth of this movie. The rest of the baloney is huge budget window dressing. The movie rotates through hiding the ball annoyingly and revealing too much. None of the potentially interesting plot keys have been developed, but the trite is icy and rehashed for excess. <br /> <br /> The charm of DD, as others have pointed out, was in the schizophrenia unit, humor woven into the movie in the movie, and most importantly all that play. There is enough wood business in the box to attract a huge height of martian termites. The biggest problem with suspending disbelief during this mess is the clear question, "Why would a technologically superior power take over the government needs to do any testing at all?" Terrible failure in a movie.
