I was looking forward to seeing Bruce Willis in this, especially as I remember being fascinated by the original when I was young. <br /> <br /> This movie is a perfect example of how movie companies can take a very good story and stupid it until it's just another formal ride of the ravaged US law enforcement system / army VS (the Russians. ... no excuse the cold war is over, do it with the Russians) VS TERRORISTER, similar to probably 50 other movies. <br /> <br /> It also treats the audience as a bunch of idiots. The choice of weapons is good, quite ridiculous, are we expected to seriously think that the world's most feared and experienced hitman / terrorist would choose it for an assasination? <br /> <br /> The whole point of the original story was the tense dual of intellect between the ordinary detective who gets the responsibility and the professional who handles a ruthless but elegant plan to reach his goal and then get away. None of it survived. All we have is the tired old American CIA / FBI / army against the evil terrorist plot, we have all seen 1000 times before. <br /> <br /> But of course, the film company's MBA realized that a new intellectual angle here would lose their revenue from the brief attention span gang, so the answer is ..... Bruce Willis, big explosions and a crumpled plot. They assume that the American audience will not be able to relate to a threat to a foreign statesman (where is France on the map subsequently), so it is American! <br /> <br /> Another example of a movie contaminated by the board.
