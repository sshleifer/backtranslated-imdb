The film is a gross misrepresentation of orthodox lifestyle and practice. NEVER will a Jewish court enforce a divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too many for it to actually take place. Childless couples make it difficult to cope with their infertility in a society where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they "rejected" by their community as depicted in the movie. They are treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great rabbis have lived their entire lives without children and never considered divorce. The exhibition of Yosef, a terrible man, is supposed to - perhaps unconsciously - show the behavior of a typical orthodox male. In fact, it is as typical as a violent drunkard rapist typical of secular society. Both exist in their own worlds, and both are despicable. It is surprising that so many people form their opinions on a society based on a film (by a person personally biased towards a community). I have always believed that it is only the Orthodox because of their narrow and desolate lifestyle that judges all secular people based on violence and immoral behavior they read about in newspapers or in the movies.
