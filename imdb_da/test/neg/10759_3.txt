Although this series and mini-films in particular were very important at the time of release, I feel that the series as a whole was actually quite poorly written with a weak cast. The problem in the heart is very well portrayed, but it is difficult to relate and understand the problems in the movie when the play and script are not convincing enough (especially when looking at the mini-movie). <br /> <br /> I also do not believe that this mini movie or series has been the time test which is now many of the scenes quite ridiculous. The issues are still crucial, but Boys From The Blackstuff cannot fully help understand the problems of Britain in the 1980s.
