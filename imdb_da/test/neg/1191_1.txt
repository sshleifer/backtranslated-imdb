I'm right in thinking, I went to see the same movie as everyone else. This movie was horrible. I am a fan of all 3 series of the gentelmen league and have always respected the originality of the authors, although the format changed in series 3. However, this film was an obvious half-effort, the plot was extremely poor with the characters entering the real world making this movie more like the last action hero. There were about 5 moments in the movie that got a mild chuckle, but the rest of the time I wanted it to end. This would have been better as a 10 minute card on the DVD. It was more an explanation of what they were planning to do, and looked as if some of the authors disagreed on the fate of the characters, and they did a joke of this by killing him during the first 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> If you are a true fan of the league for men's ability to stay fresh, then you will hate this movie. If you only see it because there was nothing better on TV then you will love it. <br /> <br /> anyone back me !!
