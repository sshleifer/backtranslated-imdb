What did I think when I rented this? What did the distributor think when he copied the tape and sent it all the way to Holland? That someone really wanted to see this ***?!? <br /> <br /> It's about some astronauts getting into trouble in outer space (Apollo 13 flashback, but never even in the shadow of this fine movie) and they want to return to home. If you are in such a movie, be glad that you will fly off the ground as far as possible! <br /> <br /> This one wants to surf the little wave of space films in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and one fails everywhere. Deep Impact and Armageddon were also not perfect (far from it), but at least they were worth seeing once (and perhaps once, since we are all old). They gave it fun. Max Q does not. It causes irritation. Okay okay. It's a TV movie, but does that mean you're allowed to come up with such a mess? <br /> <br /> If you have not cattle your own vomit at the end (of all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue) you must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time. It gets worst at the end when the shuttle lands on ... No, I can't destroy this one (IMDb guidelines forbid it). So you have to see for yourself. NONE! DO NOT SEE IT (sorry) but rent a movie that is worth renting (like Battlefield Earth ... just kidding!) <br /> <br /> Probably the worst I've ever seen.
