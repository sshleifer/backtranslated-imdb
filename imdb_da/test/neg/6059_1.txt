Eh. I see this movie in the class because someone taped it and brought it in. I was expecting a half-hearted attempt to portray the Hercules myths, and because the advertisements for it were so serious, I expected something half-decent. <br /> <br /> Ten minutes in the film, I realized it was completely CRAP. The only thing in the movie that is half true to the myth is the harsh (and I mean only) minimum. Parents, half-brother and work seemed to be named correctly. Apart from that, the rest of the movie seemed to be a huge inaccuracy. <br /> <br /> I would say that this was not much better than the Disney version of the movie. The Disney version was made for young children, so it wasn't too serious. This movie, with all sex, violence and nudity, was clearly intended for an older audience, but the story presented here was almost inaccurate as a Disney movie.
