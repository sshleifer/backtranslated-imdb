When you watch a Seagal movie, you expect good action. You expect to fight, not just a lot of shooting as in this flick. And: You expect a pretty simple story. OK, I can live with a more complex story, even though it's a Seagal movie. But this one, that is, I don't know what to say. It is very, very confusing indeed. At the end of the movie, I had a lot of trouble finding out what had happened. And I know I'm not the only one. The story lacks so much information and is so full of plot holes that it is almost impossible to keep an eye on what is happening in the movie. There are many people in the movie, people change pages all the time, and places change too often. Terrible. I just don't understand why it seems that Seagal is making a sort of sequel to this.
