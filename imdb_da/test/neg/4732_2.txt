Whole shed, the beginning picked up where the first one went off (good start). Then it goes downhill from there. You looked like you were on television, and you continue to switch between this teenager soap opera, a Predator movie, and some crappy detective programs. The characters introduced in the first ten minutes have nothing to do with each other until the last 45 minutes or so (the signs of the teen soap opera and the actual Alien story). <br /> <br /> In the end, the producers quickly went out of money and decided to end the movie, so they decided to release a key on the city. <br /> <br /> PS - What is it about the cameras are so zoomed in you can't tell what's going on? Seriously, filmmakers, do a good job of fighting scenes and make it where we can see the fight.
