I love the Jurassic Park movies, they are three of my favorite movies all the time. <br /> <br /> And I hate this game if there was a game I wish I never own Super Nintendo was this one. <br /> <br /> How can a classic movie game be too terrible? And to do the worst, I was scared of this game when I was a kid. <br /> <br /> How stupid it was, but then I was a child again when this game was out. <br /> <br /> The game in this game is just strange. One minute it's an action game, and then it's a shooting game. What in the world is wrong with making your mind when making a video game. <br /> <br /> The sound of the game is just awful to hear. <br /> <br /> The music is just too sick to listen to. <br /> <br /> The game controllers don't work most of the time. The Jurassic Park game is just a waste of time and money and will not be a classic. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs
