This movie has been rewarded for the ridiculous. "American Movie" is a boring documentary about a boring person, so you will find equivalents on almost every corner of America. It takes a long hard look at a guy who has failed almost everything to make an independent film. Or two. Was his mistake for anything other than his own selfish intentions or were they in fact, the film could have had a chance. America has an abundance of better stories to be told. This one has to be rinsed and many critics have good reason to be ashamed. Two thumbs indeed!
