Tycus is one of the worst movies directly to videos that I ever see. <br /> <br /> I'm not amazing that this product doesn't appear in the cinema. Both visual effects (the start is terrible) Bad actors (I don't understand why in this movie the great Dennis Hopper) and bad screen are shown without meaning. My alternative: Armaggedon or Twister. SENTNESS FOR TYCUS: Don't watch this movie.
