Although a well-produced made for television films, Dying to Love You reeks with low degree of melodramatic splendor. The movie opens up to Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson, who looks much older than I remember him being), who is a struggling businessman who leads an empty, lonely life after his wife Ruthie (who looks suspiciously like Roseanne Arnold) him the speed. Now everyone has Roger's cats .... and his ad in the newspaper. <br /> <br /> When his ad is answered, he calls Johnnie-Elaine-Lisa-oh it doesn't matter, I'm the one you want me to be-Lawrence. So ... they have a phone call. I'm not sure where you are from, or when you were born, but I remember that the phone queue was played out in the late 80's. I'm sorry, but it was invisible. <br /> <br /> Soon Roger and the wide hook up and have a whirlwind romance. They fall in love, visit the zoo to see gorillas, and then have some kinky sex with Roger's son in the other room. She attaches him to the bed and seduces him. <br /> <br /> Roger is just so stupid that he doesn't realize that Johnnie-Eliane is just a bimbo who loves to sleep. God forbid women only sleeping with a man. Soon, strange phone calls begin to occur, Johnny Girl wants Roger to marry her with absolute speed, and she ranting and raving over her ex-husband who used to beat her. It's fun to see Roger believe in her through all these things. It is until a frumpy employee tells him to go snooping through her belongings as a curious housewife. He takes her advice and looks and finds a suitcase imbued with fake ID cards and wigs and pistols and an armbue. He immediately took the suitcase to the police and arrested her. Even though this jazz still loves him, he is still stupid. She tells so much lies, it seems that her tongue will be fire if she tells the truth once. Roger continues his life and meets a nasty woman named Angela who looks like something out of Gremlin's 2. She also has a child and Roger takes a good taste for her. But something inside Roger's subconscious keeps him connected with Lisa Rohn (if it's even her real name), and he's holding back to see her. <br /> <br /> Now Lisa is "ex who doesn't go away" as she "earns" herself out of prison-free cards and shows up at Roger's doorstep, and his son Matt is so busy trying to check her Out, he gets the juice all over the floor. IL 'Rog is so stupid, he throws Lisa out and doesn't even change the locks. Boy, if all people were so stupid, I wouldn't even write this review. The end of this movie is so corny, you won't believe. <br /> <br /> Tim Matheson is a Made-for-TV movie king. he just looks like such a dawm mummy in this movie. He is a little wood and stiff. The dazzling Tracy Pollan works well with her role and her trampiness rings true. She is extremely beautiful and I can see what Michael J. Fox sees in her. <br /> <br /> This movie is great to see when you are on that night's night tip, but then again, you can fall asleep, considering how boring and bland it is.
