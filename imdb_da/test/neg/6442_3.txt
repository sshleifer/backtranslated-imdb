I spent three months in the East End of London in the last half of 1987, when the show had been in the air for almost two years. It was considered an ongoing joke there. <br /> <br /> Why? Because it had an all-white cast. Each cast member and extra in the first few years was white. The street where I lived was long, with over 800 houses, and after my knowledge I was one of only three or four white faces living on that street. We were on the corner of the Indian and Turkish "quarters", and even though you excluded these two races, the Asians and the Afro-Caribbean exceeded the white people twenty-one. And of course, of the very few white people who * live * in the area, the vast majority were Scots like me - a "Cockney" accent was never heard. <br /> <br /> It wasn't a racist rant, just a simple sentence. The BBC also could not be disturbed by crossing London to do their research before writing this soap, otherwise they had only white actors available and decided to bluff it. Whatever the case, the Eastern end of time, we considered it a comedy show. :-)
