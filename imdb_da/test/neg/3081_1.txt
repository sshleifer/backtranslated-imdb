From what I remember seeing this movie, it wasn't good. I always say that if a movie is good and can keep you aware of all the hardest moments (example: a Tylenol Cold & Sinus war) than it's a movie that has done its job. The fact that I slept for most of this movie shows only that it could not keep my attention and it was not possible to complete the job. Why did I become a victim of Tylenol Cold & Sinus when I had a movie in my arsenal? <br /> <br /> To begin, Committed didn't make any sense. The action was poor and the overall story left several doors opened that just couldn't be closed. I am thinking of the moment when I swear I saw Affleck and Graham (brother and sister in this movie) kissing. It made no sense. Then there was a scene with Affleck and his roommates, indicating that he was sleeping with one of them, almost breaking up a perfect lesbian couple. I suppose this was to show that most people are not as engaged in a relationship as Graham is, but for me it was just a filler. I have this suspicious feeling that the director of this movie slept with Affleck. His performance in this movie was horrible. I mean, I've never seen him do any "good" acting, but this was by far the worst. Oh, I just had a moment during the game, came through my mind, and I confirmed it with IMDb.com ... what did John Stewart do in this movie? It was once again a moment when my eyes were opened just a moment in one of the battles that seemed to last forever. And honestly, it is Heather Graham - we could care less about her after a while. She is just not interesting - she is just bland, boring and basically stops after a while. As they desperately start throwing ghostly characters into the mix to revive the movie, it just doesn't work and instead of just calling it a day - they start throwing more characters into the mix, so now it's just weird, boring, boring and really, really long. Luke Wilson's slow-pulling style slows down an already-scanned movie for dead-ends - why were these two married? Committed is a really horrible movie - the kind of "hip comedy" that leaves you staggeringly depressed and bored. <br /> <br /> Degree: * out of *****
