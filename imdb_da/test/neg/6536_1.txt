So then ... that's what passes like high art for the SXSW Film Festival and Sundance, eh? I suppose I can relate as long as history, script, dialogue, actor (spades for Mrs Aselton), filmography and editing are completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I remember telling other movie-making friends some years ago the biggest problem with digital video was that we now had to wade through a future sailing to come to something worth seeing now that someone and his brother ( or brothers in the case of the Duplass) could run dry and make a movie. "The Puffy Chair." Should I say more? <br /> <br /> This feature length video is another chapter in the gloomy, ever-growing world of "dudeology" films; young weapons armed with a DVX100A, a few thousand dollars, a fast-paced, low-key script and some friends call the actors who decide an afternoon to make a movie and voil√†!, instant feature video makers. Don't make me wrong - I'm about independent cinema (ie Hollywierd sucking). But once you have said that, you cannot argue for some of the realities of this system. <br /> <br /> If Duplass Brothers would have had to go out and raise a real budget and bring in real producers, it would be clear that a script like this had never been green! And there lies the problem. There is no longer such a thing as a wetting process for getting movies (sorry ... videos) ready for production. Just take a DV / P2 camera and get away! And what makes it worse is that high-profile festivals like the ones above actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense. And why? Just because it is not the budget. <br /> <br /> I think it's important, especially in today's climate of indie films, to stop giving video recorders the opportunity to raise the language by labeling themselves "filmmakers". There is quite a difference in my book. When you have to go out and actually put your script on the line, ask friends and family or business people for real money to make a "movie" movie, knowing the potential games at stake, then you will know what It means being a "filmmaker." But dropping a few hundred at Sam's Club for some DV tapes, some sodas and chips didn't cut it. <br /> <br /> Oh ... and by the way ... I must mention how utterly annoying it was to listen to a woman who was treated as "guy" throughout the movie. Even Mark Borchardt reserves the intensely over-exploited moniker only to his male friends, where at least it stretches where his buddy Mike is concerned! I think it was high time that the indie film community started calling up these shoddy, no budget videos for what they are, and at the same time portraying prestigious festivals to give such informal efforts, high praise. Either that or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy to add a new category to their festival line ups ... "Dude Films."
