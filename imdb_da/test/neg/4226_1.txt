L'Humanité is a murder mystery. These films tend to be popular, and the 6.9 rating it has currently proposed has also been. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this film has no redeeming features at all. <Br /> <br /> A few non-spoilers, for example, include a 5-minute scene <br /> <br /> where the protagonist eats an apple. And another 3 minutes <br /> <br /> where he breathes. <br /> <br /> If you're wondering about it, it's actually not art. Nor is it a <br /> <br /> comment on humanity, as from the title it seems it is trying to be. It's actually boring. There are many attempts in this <br /> <br /> movie to say something about humanity. You can think for yourself, "How will I comment on humanity?" And the most obvious and boring answers will of course be sex, love and death. <br /> <br /> Not that these options are unattractive when done well - just that <br /> <br /> They are the canonical options. For sex, this movie is best for <br /> <br /> making it uninteresting and disgusting. For the first five minutes - that's not a spoiler - you'll see the bloody vagina of a <br /> murdered 11-year-old girl; It's a murder mystery, remember? Later <br /> <br /> some people throw themselves at each other and have what <br /> <br /> the instructor wants us to believe is "raw" sex, but in reality it is <br /> < br /> constructed and too symbolic - but worse yet, uninteresting then. <br /> <br /> I enjoy being disturbed by movies. This movie showed me why: <br /> <br /> Disturbing movies usually show something inside someone, <br /> <br /> their humanity that they didn't know existed and is a bit <br /> <br / > afraid. L'Humanité tried to do just that and failed, and I went out of the theater <br /> <br />, but disgusted and thought I had wasted my time in the theater, despite watching the movie for <br /> <br /> free.
