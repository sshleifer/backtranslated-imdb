This is the worst movie I've ever seen. At first I thought it would be good because I am interested in the bermuda triangle, but instead it was terrible. All it did was offer a bunch of lame explorations that didn't make sense (if the time moves differently there, how did the woman not come, and her son was aged quickly) and has a horrible juicy ending. The next time the boys did this to Bermuda, they had to take all the copies of this movie with them. Please vote for this movie so it can be on the worst movie list.
