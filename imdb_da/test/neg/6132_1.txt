Here's a great concept for a movie - a number of meteors collide in a small town, and the alien alien infection is trapped on a proxy's single camera dash cam when the city is slowly being taken over. Let it be for Albert Pyun to screw it up! Don't get within 100 feet of this flick! Holy shit, what a bomb ... it might be Pyun's worst yet! The crazy thing is that there is a germ of a creative idea in here - quite a lot of an outbreak told from the POV of a dashcam. When I heard it for a while, I imagined that the car crashed into things, people were driven over and infected types were breaking the windshield and surrounding the car in chaos. It would be cool right? Instead, we drive around circles all the time in a wooded area that occasionally runs into the three infected types that just stand there. The last bit is literally a 15 minute shot, where nothing happens in front of the camera, but sounds only sounds offscreen. Stay away!!! On a somewhat soothing note, I officially believe that I stop seeing my Pyun ... just took me 20 crappy movies to realize I have better things to do.
