This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people, two of whom participate in the Naxalite movement and blah blah. It's really just another movie about some beautiful, rich people trying to decide who to sleep next; the peasants and the naxalites and the political struggles of the era serve only as a picturesque background. Literally, as we do not hear the villagers say a word, you should never learn a name so they take up the same 'role' as 'native' in old Hollywood movies. The movie is also boring, and the story doesn't get us anywhere - except for different bedrooms. We must apparently admire the artistry of it all, which simply means no good song and dance venture that would not have saved the film of course, but perhaps at least alleviated the boredom. <br /> <br /> My friend Japna was annoyed by the immorality of history, not the bedroom, but the utter obscenity of history. The message seems to be that ideals are not worth pursuing.
