The first half of the movie is not that bad actually. Although there isn't really too much depth in the characters, history is somehow fun and generally OK with the potential to get better, which it doesn't. <br /> <br /> In the second half things get worse, not just for the characters in the movie, but also for the viewer who is basically waiting for the story to come to its obvious end. The former user commented: "It's a love story, a road movie, a thriller, a comedy of error, an 80's movie and most of all it's a Jonathan Demme movie." <br /> <br /> Now , let me rephrase it: "It is a boy who gets girl history, they happen to be driving around in cars, the excitement is gone, as it is all too obvious how things will evolve, there was no scene in this movie that one could laugh out loud, it has some small 80s feeling and yes, Jonathan Demme was really director.
