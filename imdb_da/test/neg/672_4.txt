CinemaScope color scheme by Leon Shamroy is quite remarkable here, including his use of colored filters for <br /> <br /> different scenes. Alfred Newmann Score must be the most sensual and seductive score ever produced by Hollywood. It's a shame it's no longer available on CD. However, the actors never rise to the apartment. The centers are so varied, from the subdued British of Ustinov and Purdom to the Hollywood of Baxter and Mature, that it seems like a true headgear without central vision. Tommy Rettig is jarringly American. Active styles range from zombies to style. Only Ustinov as a lurking one-eyed servant steals the show - what is there to steal. The pastor - the story of a young Egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich - and the parallel theme of the cult of the only god, Ra-persecuted by the authorities, has his interesting points. But when the movie's plot falls, it's the scary music and visuals that remain.
