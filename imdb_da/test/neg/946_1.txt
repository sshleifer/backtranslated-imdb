Synopsis: Kid is not accepted to any high schools. He creates a "college" where he and his friends can party by using their parents' teaching money. <br /> <br /> Wow. A Paean for ignorance. <br /> <br /> If you think we're all OK, man, then this movie is for you. In addition, you need to understand: <br /> <br /> 1. Children have everything inside them - they just have to let it out. <br /> <br /> 2. The teaching really disrupts the innate creativity that everyone is born with. <br /> <br /> 3. Someone else should pay for you to follow your passion. <br /> <br /> 4. 300 teenagers can live together in harmony as long as you remove these restrictive rules. <br /> <br /> 5. Extraordinary speeches are often far more convincing than a prepared presentation. <br /> <br /> 6. If the Education Committee allows you to open a "charter school" with "non-traditional teaching techniques", it is because they have your highest interests. (Not that they are willing to let go of malfunctioning students who will eventually work fast food.) <br /> <br /> This movie is a college comedy genre, that is, Animal House. It follows the pattern rather closely. The new here, however, is a complete attack on higher education, not a parody of the bad elements. It lacks the sympathetic insider, a professor who embodies the valuable part of the university's life. <br /> <br /> This lack of balance will dampen this movie to the back of Blockbuster. It's so one-sided that I wondered if it was an ironic self-reflecting, taking on the whole genre - for about a minute. The film has no deep meaning, no team, introspection. It is as if they let some children who never went to class do what comes naturally. And what is natural is what the school's name is: S ***. <br /> <br /> (Never thought I would say this: Go see something with Will Farrell instead. His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)
