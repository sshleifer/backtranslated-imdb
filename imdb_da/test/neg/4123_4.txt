I just finished watching this movie, and I have to say it was a good movie, I loved some of the good guys, and I loved the killer robot, but the movie had a hole in it. <br /> <br /> The name of the people in it was kind ... stupid .. I mean people should be sued the maker's movie in this movie for how paralyzed it was at the end .. the first half hour was good but then it just went on and then I was happy ... it was over ... but still loved the killer robot and some of the movie's good guy in it. I think it was the best two bucks I have ever used because I do as stupid b-movies are like this and come again .. it's a b-movie all.
