Every time I have seen this movie, I get the same impression: some parts of it are so incredibly stupid / bad that they break me up, they are not intentional, and there are many of them; The rest is just plain, stupid and / or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead gets credit for being poor at its own expense because it is the intended result - it's stupid and cheesy because Sam Raimi succeeded in what he was trying to do. This movie doesn't have the excuse, it's stupid and cheesy, because the filmmakers failed so much. The crap result is raised on crap plays and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest rating a movie can give is one too 'horrible'. Seeing this movie has the same effect as listening to a Billy Madison essay - "Everyone in this room is now stupid for listening to it." I should be able to give this movie something around a -5.
