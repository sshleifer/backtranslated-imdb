Hulk Hogan stars as a masterpiece ...) called Rip, who is forced to defend his honor, his title and his girlfriend from a greedy company who wanted him to sign their network (Because wrestling sells!) But When Rip falls, the network gets a circuit championship called (and I'm absolutely serious). "The Battle of the Hard Boys", who is Master Zeus (The Game of Tiny Lister Jr), perhaps the deadliest man alive. Rip refuses to fight until his brother is attacked and hospitalized. No Holds Barred is basically what I expected from Vince McMahon's lead starring in the smallest versatile actress in the action genre (Hogan). It's pretty much a lot of unintentional humor, tons of awkward sequences, a few okay action sequences and tons of stupidity. In other words, it is not contrary to breaking oneself, so I give it a fair assessment, mainly because everyone who rents this knows what they are getting. The movie is inexpensive but well made enough for what it is and really breaks fans will probably enjoy this. I found myself to be ultimately fun. They are moments of such absurdity that you only laugh at yourself. (Like the way Hogan jumps 20 feet in the air when he's stuck in a limo, how he forces a guy to scare himself and of course the way Hogan recites from his cuecard. (IE: "I'm not going to be around when this check clears! ") No Holds Barred is very fun, true, even though it's mainly because of how ridiculous it is. Fans of the camp should really enjoy this clever clinker. <br /> <br /> * * out of 4- (Fair)
