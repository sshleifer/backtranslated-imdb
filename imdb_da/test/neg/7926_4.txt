My first impression of the Saikano: The Live Action movie trailer (can be seen on YouTube) was "Wow, this might be one of the few better live-action anime adaptations." <br /> <br /> This time I was just wrong! Simply put, the live action Saikano movie was a puzzle missing a number of pieces; Put together just enough to get that vague picture of it all. <br /> <br /> * STORY * <br /> <br /> The movie's history follows vagrant anime and manga, but movie history is just the frame of a car, rather than a complete car. It seems that many parts of the story were originally anime omitted, changed or completely changed. In fact, the ending is quite different from the manga or anime ending. <br /> <br /> Draw special; many went out or had another feeling. The connection between Fuyumi and Shuji is reduced to that of Shuji who knows her because she is a video store lady. Chise's character felt too strong already and only stated the infamous. I'm sorry a few times in the movie. The same can be said with Shuji. We lost the shy uptight yet high male lead, the song he hums, and his frequent act of calling Chise silly. Other characters like Tetsu and Akemi had another, toned down feel to them. Perhaps falling and toning down other characters was focusing much more on Chise and Shuji, as it did. Too much. Expect many cute action scenes like those in the trailer? Now not! Those in the trailer plus a few minutes are the only action you get. So much of the movie speaks while I watched the movie before I saw it all, I thought I had a regular Asian romance drama. <br /> <br /> Pacing was too fast. In the film we see the famous scene of Chise armed with small wings and a gun gun arm in just under nine minutes to launch it. There is very little time to get to know the signs and connect with them. What they should have done was divided into two films or even a trilogy. If it hadn't been so many things would have to be changed or dropped. <br /> <br /> But again, the movie seems like a frame. Anime was more of a complete car, because even though all these little details and such are smaller, they can really add up. <br /> <br /> * PRODUCTION * <br /> <br /> Visuals were disappointing. So much of the special effects turned out to be quite cheesy, especially CGI. Unfortunately, they were like those found on Sci-Fi channel films. They are tolerable and this movie is not for the effects. <br /> <br /> - Music-Music was average. Much of it was orchestral background music, except there were really no themes. The movie has dropped the addicting song that Shuji in anime was always humming. However, a noticeable piece of music is the final song that is heard in the trailer. Not a bad and somewhat beautiful song. It is a shame that it was not integrated into the movie as itself or an orchestrated version of the song. <br /> <br /> Casting-Saikano's casting was also uneven. The main star was Chises actress Aki Maeda, who is most famous for her role in the Battle Royale films. The actor who played Shuji was pretty good, but they took the glasses from the original character. Oh yeah and Tetsuo look like Lupine on the 3rd. Unlike what I heard from a couple of others, it was not so bad to act on live action Saikano. I feel pretty wrong is the way the story was put on and stuffed the series into just a two-hour movie. <br /> <br /> * What can be learned from the live action Saikano: * <br /> - CGI- I really want the CGI in Saikano not to have been so bad. But even with just that we could have got some more battle scenes! Probably the most anticipated live-action anime adaptation Neon Genesis Evangelion is unlikely to suffer, as they currently have the WETA Studios awarded the effect. <br /> <br /> -Modernism-Fuyumi owns and video store. Chise used an audio cassette player to listen to music and gave Shuji a mix tape for her birthday. Why? This movie is made in 2006! Not only in the reality of the film, they can create such a thing as Chise, so it cannot take place in the 90s! The future is the age of CDs, DVDs and MP3 players. Hopefully in the Evangelion, Shinji will have a Sony Walkman MP3 player. NOT one who plays cassette tapes. <br /> <br /> -Story & Pacing- As mentioned earlier, the Saikano movie moved too fast and forced the story to get out of many details. It was a smart move on ADV Films and the other, to make the Evangelion a solid trilogy, so there was more time to tell the story as true to the original as possible. -Characters-Leave most of the character designs alone and let these classic quotes be said! What if the living action Evangelion did not have Asuka's "What are you, stupid?" or Shinji's "I must not run away!" Sometimes as small as they look, they add frequent quotes and are who the characters are. <br /> <br /> * CONCLUSION: * <br /> <br /> All in all, the live-action Saikano movie had the potential. It really did. Those you who are not fans and see this movie: You will be reluctant to start anime or manga (so do not watch the movie first!) People who saw and liked anime / manga did not get your hopes up on this one. Studies show you will most likely be disappointed. It was still fun to see that anime came alive in the adaptation of live action, but it could have been so much more. <br /> <br /> Reluctantly, I give live action Saishu Heiki Kanojo (Saikano) a 2 out of 5. <br /> <br /> As Chise says, "I'm sorry" <br /> < br /> ~ NekoTakuto
