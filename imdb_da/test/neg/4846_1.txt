I had never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw it at the DVD store a few weeks ago, and I thought I had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem as it had Val Kilmer in it in a totally unique role. Unfortunately, it was no more than ten or fifteen minutes in the movie that I realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions. The first clue you want to see how terribly horrible this movie is, comes close to the beginning when you have a lot of dirtbags in an old salon that laughs like a lot of hyenas in a scene that goes about five times too long. It's amazing how bad it is. And unfortunately it doesn't get any better. Val Kilmer is highlighted prominently on the film's co-box, perhaps to trick you into thinking he has a role in the movie, but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of halftone villains and the most eerie conceptualization by a unique city sheriff that I have ever seen in a movie. He is played by Boguslaw Linda, who cannot or is not interested in covering his Polish accent, which makes it impossible for the film to take place in the American Old West. <br /> <br /> Does Poland have this type of border crossing? I do not know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point, but I can tell you this, the sheriff, as he is known in the film, is the worst representation of law enforcement that I can ever remember watching in a movie. He is introduced to a really ridiculous scene where he has a kind of blindfold and a spacious man changes his face. Before they start beating him, he explains that each one hits him once, and then after the first round, they will each beat him again, and if he can identify who throws the battles, they lose. What the hell is this? I'm completely lost to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie. <br /> <br /> Throughout the movie, the sheriff continues to become more and more beaten and shattered and thumped and battered until eventually he does nothing but occasionally, stumbles on the screen and mumbles "not" without ... the law ?? "You see, there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging whose details are as meaningless as the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> Incidentally, it happens in a city that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings against each other across a flat dirt that is more than a road than a road. My understanding is that it is part of Poland that must look acceptable enough as the US southwest where none of The characters, except perhaps the dead guy, might have come from. <br /> <br /> I've heard that Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was fascinated by his unique role and also by the director's uncle's minimal use of dialogue in favor of a dependence on wise timed imaging of images in unique v isual assembly. <br /> <br /> No matter what. <br /> <br /> I think Kilimer could not overcome what must have been the really satisfying feeling he must have been given when he was offered the role. Personally, I would really feel that I had reached some level of success if someone approached me and probably offered me a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lie down for a while. I like to think that he didn't even read the manuscript for this mess, because if he did, I was having a total loss to understand why he accepted the role. In any case, the film opens with a man who introduces a man's play played by Kilmer, seeking the reward. Soon, he finds himself in a ridiculous love story involving the city prostitute, the alcoholic Sheriff, and lots of chaos involving a series of stupid, stupid characters. <br /> <br /> There is also a comprehensive and sensational lack of understanding of American rituals. In one scene, a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into Kilmer's eyes (for what reason I can't imagine), and later a man writes a short talk about Kilmer's play, where he explains he was "one of The finest men we've ever had, and then he continues to push his head off with a shovel. What the heck?? <br /> <br /> Not yet convinced? Here are some more reasons not to see it. On a scene, the Sheriff seems to be covered with ashes, except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only be described as bright red lipstick. A man gets a head wound that drains his head and body into the blood. In a drowsiness he cauterizes it with reptiles. Smart. At the end of the end, the sheriff seems to have a broken arm. Sitting in the bar he puts a rope around his neck and connects it with his damaged arm and uses his good arm to pull on the rope and lifts his shaking beer glass in his poor arm to his mouth instead of using his good arm to drink. Also smart. <br /> <br /> Why doesn't he just use his good arm? I have no idea. That, like anything else in the film, makes no sense whatsoever, like the title. Summer Love? Are you kidding me? Avoid this mess at all costs. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, something has happened to IMDb Goofs since ?? <br /> <br /> Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors from the filmmakers): This movie was made. HA!
