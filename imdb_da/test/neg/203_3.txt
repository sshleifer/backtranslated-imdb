Armored <br /> <br /> The best thing about driving an armored vehicle is that if any pimple is approaching in a red light asking for money, you can shoot them in the face. <br /> <br /> And while the armored guards in this thriller don't use their protective capabilities to clean the drive population, they use their position to fly their employer. When the new arrival Ty (Columbus Short) lands a job with a hooded trunk firm, he feels he has found his party in life. Unfortunately, when he discovers that his colleagues (Matt Dillon, Jean Reno and Laurence Fishburne) are planning to take the $ 42M shipment for themselves, Ty must obviously consolidate himself? and the funds ?? inside the armored truck. <br /> <br /> A boring hijacker with a plodding plot and inviting performances, Armored is a completely forgettable movie. <br /> <br /> Also, if you really want to jack millions, it's much easier to just pamper yourself as an ATM.
