OK, I have to admit that I did indeed enjoy The Dead of the Dead despite its well documented mistakes. However, this was the worst movie I've seen since the demons at the door. Compared to DATD, the effects are much better. However, the plot is weak, the play reminiscent of everyone's favorite, the porn movie and the decisions and actions of the "characters" are consistently moronic. I want to try out Uwe Boll's latest movie excursions just to get some sense of the perspective of HOTD2. I do not suggest that he is really healed, more a case with another disease, but when your senses have been offended in such a disgusting way, the only way is up. OK there. I have managed my ten-line minimum and no longer have to waste our time on the waste of celluloid, which is the House of the Dead 2.
