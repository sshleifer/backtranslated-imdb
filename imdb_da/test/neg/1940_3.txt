Bam Margera from Jackass's fame is back with his own reality show, and it's not just fun like Jackass, but it's also incredibly stupid! This should be one of the stupid shows ever seen. Sure there are worse reality shows, but no one is as mediocre or stupid. <br /> <br /> Bam Margera has made it big and his parents decided to piggy bank out of his fame. Bam and his parents, his uncle, his crew of idiotic friends all live together, and while Bam and his friends are out to break things and get into evil, his parents are generally stupid. When Bam's parents are not at home, they are tortured by Bam, especially his father. To add to the humor, we are treated with his fat uncle Don Vitto, who is constantly out of it and never takes into account. <br /> <br /> This show is really like a tinted version of Jackass ... toned down in there are no stunts, instead Bam and his friends just pause things and do lame stunts and meanwhile play loud music to make it even more amazing. This is not fun at least. I can't imagine a stupid show than this because there's no ounce of intelligence here. <br /> <br /> If you're a big fan of Bam Margera and want to see one of the many follow-up / cash-in sequels for the Jackass series. <br /> <br /> My rating: * Out of ****. 30 minutes.
