I will never see this movie again! <br /> <br /> Not only is it terribly bad, but I can't stand watching my hero Stan Laurel look so old and sick. I can't stand watching this horrible movie! <br /> <br /> Frankly, there is no reason to see this horrible movie. The reason is simply stupid. The actors surrounding Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really really bad, and Laurel and Hardy have been more fun in any of their previous movies! <br /> <br /> I warn you not to see it, the pictures will haunt you for a long time to come!
