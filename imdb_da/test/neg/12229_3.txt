A comedy that spoofs the inspirational movies, The Comebacks tells the story of an out-of-luck coach, Lambeau Fields, who takes a rag-tag pile of college misfits and drives them to football championships. In this process, this lifeless loser discovers that he is a winner after all by redeeming himself, saving his relationship with his family and friends, and finding out that there is actually nothing in the "team"! <br /> <br /> I decided to watch the untitled version for this movie. It was thirty minutes longer, and of course I can be better than the theatrical release and hear that people hated this movie. After all, thirty minutes of extra recording can add a lot to a movie. Well, I was definitely wrong. It was just as bad as the recent "Meet the Spartans", but it was thirty minutes more of torture! <br /> <br /> Seriously, who's close to two hours of ghost film? A spoof film is short, because if it goes further, it would be overkill! Honestly, I love stupid comedies. Heck, I liked "Date Movie", "White Chicks", "Epic Movie" and "Little Man"! I assume, when it comes to ghost film, it's either a hit or a miss, and one is definitely missed. <br /> <br /> On the lighter side, from the many jokes in this movie, I would say about six or seven made me laugh, even some that made me laugh out loud. But that doesn't say much. Following these jokes were several scenes of torture and insecurity. <br /> <br /> I can't see how people would say this is not a horrible movie. In fact, there is so much product placement here like Meet the Spartans, there are so many dance sequences, and unfunny jokes. I would say another thing I like about this movie is the songs. They are some very good songs in here. Overall, see it if you like the movie. Skip it if you like funny movies.
