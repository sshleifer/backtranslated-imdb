This movie sucks. The play is worse than in the movies we made when we were 10 years old with a video camera, the effects look like around 80s computer games, and the plot is worse than terrible. Even the worst Van Damme movies make this look crazy. Accent and the rhythm of the 'evil guys' is so bad, it's fun. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend seeing this unless you are a big time fan of one of the actors. 1 out of 10
