As sweet and sweet as they are, the story of three song coins just doesn't seem to have enough meat for it to maintain it for an hour and a half. I thought the first half hour of this movie was worth seeing. It was fun, it had a few laughs in it, it was full of energy. Then it somehow lost it. I wouldn't even say it faded away because it seemed quite steep to me. The pavement was gone; laughter disappeared. My daughter also noticed it. She is 4 - she laughed several times in the first part of the movie, then stopped her laughter. Perhaps it took too seriously a tone - the evil film producer working with chipmunks to death. Something happened, anyway, and it wasn't for the better. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is trying to tell the story of how the chipmunks (Alvin, Simon and Theodore) began. Everyone knows the Christmas song. Here we discover how they met Dave and got their start. The film has been updated to the present, although their real origin is noted by Dave's street address from 1958, which was the year when animated song rodents were first created. Jason Lee did a good job as Dave and the chipmunk voices were also pretty good. David Cross as the evil Ian irritated me to be blunt, and I couldn't figure out the point where Claire's character, played by Cameron Richardson. She added a little to the movie. It's a movie you can see with the kids - it's probably a movie you just want to see with the kids. It gets a 4/10 from me.
