1 Bolo Yeung is in the movie ten minutes in total, including when serving ice-cream drinks to his boss. 2 many inflatables look like junkyard users are instantly overwhelmed by the Asian superhero who speak like an illegal alien just outside a manure truck. 3 (thug) let it be for me - hidden, gay model like muscles - heee-haaw! hee-heeew! bite bite! - he's dead on the floor with his neck, elbow, notch or bullets broken - 4 cheap semi-sex scenes where the white broad comes out of nowhere digging the Asian superhero. 5 Norton (formerly C action movie star) does nothing but an eccentrically trendy weapon smuggler who drives white dulled girls with a handpick in a nightclub where they intentionally follow some idiot bags as a millionaire snatching them (you reap what you yes, the local police captain is involved, and yes, the first slaughtered policeman is the former patrol team of the superhero (yaawn!). 7 Action scenes are fake, just like A) hee-haw! Chinese trying some spinning kicks B) Skinny legs of Chinese to the neck of Negro thug C) finishing death moves to the head too much as Walker Texas ranks false action 8 join titles finally <br /> <br /> complete rubbish. These people are only good enough to be stand-ins or body doubles in other C-movies and are at least collectively credited as "stunt herds from the county prison".
