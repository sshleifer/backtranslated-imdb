It's been a long time since I saw this movie and still it is one of the worst I've ever seen. I like lots of kind of movies; sci-fi, action, drama, thrillers and sometimes even horror. Not a combination of two. This could have been a wonderful movie, but they all ran together. I didn't want to watch this movie, but my friends insisted on seeing it. I didn't know it was such a crap. I loved the first part, where Clooney and Tarantino drove through Texas and killed everyone on the road (especially the stage of liquid photography was excellent), but at its turning point everything was changed to titty Twister. Stupid Vampires took over the place, and what could have been a perfect gangster movie became a stupid horror movie like 'Nightmare on Elmsteet'. If you like horror, watch a real horror movie. And when you love blood clot thrillers don't see it at all, you'll be very disappointed in the end.
