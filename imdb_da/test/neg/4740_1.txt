this movie made me see Paul W.S. Anderson's AvP1 and enjoy it! I don't even dream of comparing Requiem with any of the strangers or Predator comics, it's a horrible evening B-HORROR FOOTAGE SET in an American little town by NO ONE CARES ABOUT. <br /> <br /> At least AvP1 had a lot of crafts carved into the movie sets, it had eye-light bags that had not previously been seen in any of the original films - but was destroyed by compelling characters / plays. <br /> <br /> Requiem poorly trades at the lowest possible level, and it also lacks in all other departments just as much ... it is a holiday to include strangers and predators in this type of waste.
