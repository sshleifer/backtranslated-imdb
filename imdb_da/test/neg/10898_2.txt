I never made one of these before, but this movie was literally so bad that I had to say something about it. <br /> <br /> I am all too independent film production that last year has seen of The worst (in my opinion) of Hollywood showings, mainstream seems to have just lost touch with what makes good movies are about. Saying movies like this really gives independent movies a bad reputation. The characters are boring and too stupid to empathize with. The direction is horrible, the plot is terrible, the plot itself is terrible, stay away, far away. Only a short scene with a woman's naked breasts and even it wasn't worth seeing another look. <br /> <br /> The scary thing about this movie is the idea of ​​having to watch it again. I gave it a 2 and not a 1 simply because the actors were visible and the sound was audible - it serves one point for each of these moves.
