Terribly disappointed with the City of Man after being swept away by the city of God. Lost is the exciting and unpredictable story, and instead there is nothing but predictability with the obvious attempts to manipulate the audience at a superficial pretentious production and distribution team. This story ended up feeling like a juicy soap opera rather than a gritty indie feature, which is what should have been. This is what happens when distributors try to seek a wider audience (ridiculous sweeping shots from the Rio coast, etc.) At the expense of a poignant story and characters. I really didn't like what happened to any of the characters in this movie - they were all so 2-dimensional. In short, boring waste of potential that should have been a slam-dunk after the exceptionally inspired GODPAGE. Boo!
