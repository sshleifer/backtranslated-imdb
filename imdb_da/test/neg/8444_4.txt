Obviously, this is not "Piranha" directed by Joe Dante and produced by Roger Corman. It was not so obvious when I bought the DVD for only $ 2.95, when DVD-cover art matched the Corman-produced comedy / horror "Piranha", then the DVD menu (of course, no features) matched with the cover. Halfway through watching this odd movie, my girlfriend and I began to think where is PIRANHAS? When the movie reached the climax, we realized that we must have watched the wrong movie as we had seen the trailer, which had completely different footage, backgrounds on the back of the DVD do not match the story we saw and the credits ( Actors, producer, director) were also quite different. Instead, we got some jungle melodramas about a girl and two guys who go for diamonds and end up confronting a vicious animal hunter. This tame, exploitation thriller is boring and meaningless and is only mildly fun for old-school, camp value. Strange that a DVD can be produced with the wrong movie in tact, but I suppose it is an easy mistake to see as if they are both B-class movies of the same name made in the 70s. Reading other posts made on this movie, I noticed that I'm not the only one with the wrong movie on the DVD. How could this be an INTERNATIONAL error? Are there any kind of DVD phenomena where failed movies are trying to gain recognition by being put on the wrong DVDs? WHAT HAPPENS???
