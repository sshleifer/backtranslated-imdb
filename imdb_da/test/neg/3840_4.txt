Like most people watching this movie, I did it for the stars Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper. The two are extremely undervalued and unfortunately, because of the overlook, it must have a lot of crap. In this movie, Hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills an extortionist and is offered help from the mysterious Madsen. <br /> <br /> In fact, the movie is not as horrible as it could have been. I have seen both in much worse, both independently and in collaboration (LAPD, horrible film). The direction was rather poor, and the manuscript needed a few rewrites, but both provided the best performance possible with the material being offered. The end is also quite strong so you can tell the story had potential. But when a glowing review of a movie is, "It could have been much worse," it doesn't say much for the movie itself. All in all, one can easily be skipped if none of these actors pull you in. But if you are a fan of either or both, you must give it a watch. They both give strong performances that shine the obvious errors in the film. Trust me, there are much worse opportunities out there.
