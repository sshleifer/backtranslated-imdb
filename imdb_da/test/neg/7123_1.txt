Grudge 2 is one of the movies that makes me want more synonyms for "terrible" in English. With a plot replenished with more holes than a trawl net, this movie fails to make forced viewing a fan of even the most inane movies that I am. I felt compelled to stay in the cinema until I had gained Â£ 5.70p worth of entertainment from it, though I was afraid I would be there for some years. A better movie could be made from the first edition of The Grudge, although I'm not entirely sure that this is not the result of such an exercise. As expected, what goes for a plot in this gloomy example of the celluloid waste, ends without any decision whatsoever, thereby allowing manufacturers to inflict the public "The Grudge 3" when time comes to feel another bang for true hate civilization.
