another eli roth in the production. self-promoting, bad script writing excuse for a horror director. Victor is so far from the new horror icon that Mary Poppins (referring to the Disney score). What happens here? you have marilyn manson opening and closing this piece of crap and chitty chitty bang bang all that. Can this even be called horror? terrible, yes, but horror is a stretch. David Lynch should sue them to steal the elephant man prostheses. Please stop this fan boy wanting to be directors now. The video controllers already have enough competition in the film industry. Getting online and talking about how big your movie is, doesn't make it true. stop insane. I work in the industry and yes these movies are fun to work on, but rarely ever entertaining to actually watch.
