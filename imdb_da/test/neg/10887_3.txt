SPOILER Wolfcreek meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre .... if you've seen them, don't waste your time with this one. Typically, slasher movies, nothing new here except SPOILER "visions" that just add fluff to an already weak plot. I would recommend this movie if you have absolutely nothing to see and it is either watching this movie or staring at a mere wall for 1.5 hours. The only half-interesting part of SPOILER is when the chicken starts to drink in the empty sheriff's office, I say it's interesting because she has at least made good use of this fluid instead of using it stereotypically to start a fire for to kill the bad guy, even though she went the route towards the end. All in all, lame, bad and not worth working.
