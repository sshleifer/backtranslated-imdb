I see a pattern here. If you watch a movie at the Mystery Science Theater 3000, chances are if you go to IMDb.com that will be hordes of lovers of the movie, but it was chosen to be on the TV program because it was so bad. I'm sorry, but I read a lot about the Rocketship X-M as being some milestone movies that emphasized realism. Well, if that's the case, I could write for several sections on how even with 1950's knowledge, this movie is completely flawless. Gravity can be the first obvious observation, or as MST3K did as a shit "selective gravity", even when they fall over to their death and they just stand there and look out of the window, the ship would not be upside down the scene ? I would like to think that they started with good intentions and that it ran over budget or something, but I think this movie was just plain cheese as in the sub-type. Just compare it to "When Worlds Collide", which was released in 1951 to see the true place where this movie ranks, there is no comparison. The movie gets a 2 or maybe 3 alone, it's not even fun to watch on your own. It's about a 5 or 6 as an MST3K episode, since there's no action or much to make fun of, just bad, bad, bad, oh, I've mentioned it's bad.
