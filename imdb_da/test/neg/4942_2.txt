In order for a thriller to evoke fear, excitement or any feeling, the story must be credible. There is nothing credible or realistic about this movie. The main characters have several options to escape or turn the tables, but manage to screw it up each time. The antagonists, who presumably plan this and adapted their shuttle specifically to trap people, ensured that many improvisation weapons were lying around. There is actually a scene where the "clever" girl has a gun in the head of the big bad guy and decides to scold him instead of pulling the trigger. This was a thoroughly predictable brainless "thriller". Each character was one-dimensional. The "victims" were the usual godless, brain-free sheep who deserved to be slaughtered. Is anyone on this planet able to write an intelligent thriller?
