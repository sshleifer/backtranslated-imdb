I didn't like the Underdog! I think it was really unnecessary and needed a big facelift, and it would have been perhaps acceptable, but for the most part I didn't like it. It wasn't like any other kid's movie one of the movies that wanted parents (who grew up to see the comic) to bring the kids to see this, I'm neither of them, so the movie didn't appeal to me at least. I had some problems with it as I don't think Jason Lee was the right voice for Underdog, it made it blatantly sloppy and really unintelligible. Then it was very predictable, making you feel tired and angry. The humor was really that made me angry, it was just to unfunny and something pathetic. The only thing that bothered me most was how almost everything out of Underdog's mouth was sarcastic or rude. The action was acceptable but needed a little improvement. If you have children, they like it, but if you are not a child by all means see it maybe you like it unlike me. 3.4 stars out of 10
