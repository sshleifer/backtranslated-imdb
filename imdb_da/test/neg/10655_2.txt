The characterization of this movie is among the worst I have ever encountered. The dialogue is trite and clich√© to the point of extreme distraction. None of the problems faced by the characters are being developed at all - they are only surface details designed to get a point across without actually having to come up with a credible dialogue to support that point. In addition, the portrayal of the Chinese characters leaves a little to be desired. I find it hard to believe that the Chinese father teaches flawless English from a book (or it is implied in a scene) so he can teach it to his daughter. Etc. Smile Train is a good organization and it is a good idea to make a heart-draw film about the effect a program like this can have on children's lives, but overall I found this movie to be more frustrating than anything.
