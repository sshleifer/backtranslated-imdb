Considering the film's reputation as really worst of the worst, I look forward to seeing Wood's Crappus Opus (my word); it is not necessarily more incomplete than the other Woods I have seen - but from the movie actors REEFER MADNESS (1938), GLEN OR GLENDA does not portray as "pleasurable" as its genre effort. <br /> <br /> This also emerges as Horror legend Bela Lugosi's nadir (his first of three "collaborations" with the director): you wonder if he really knew what kind of movie it was (considering the actors' history of heavy medicine and the sheer numbness of his cameo). In addition, Lugosis's idiosyncratic delivery is perhaps the most unpleasant here ... although Wood's scripts are mostly due to this - given the impossible dialogue (with repeated obscene heads of "dog tails" and "big fat snails") he gave the grief star! By the way, Wood himself plays the central role (under the pseudonym Daniel Davis) - and being as worthless in this area, turns out to have been a versatile dog! Dolores Fuller - his wife and co-star - was also unlikely (she should also appear in JAIL BAIT [1954]) ... but at least gave the picture, where the latter finally lets Glen wear his angora shirt, Tim Burton's loving biopic ED WOOD ( 1994) its famous poster! <br /> <br /> By the way, the latter represents a presumably fictitious meeting between Wood and Orson Welles - well, for all purposes and purposes, GLEN OR GLENDA Ed Wood's CURRENT CANE (1941) presents its joyous propensity to gimmicky narrative techniques: In fact, the rough wire of the plot is padded with stock footage galore (many of the irrelevant, such as the confusing occurrences of S&M) and inan dream sequences (highlighted by the presence of a confusing demon sporting outrageous bushy eyebrows that would make Martin Scorsese cry with envy)! However, the film's sincere attempt at a claim of tolerance and psychological examination in the transvestism's congestion / phenomenon is sabotaged each time by the pure amateurity of the approach. <br /> <br /> For what it's worth, the edition I watched was the "Extended Re-issue Version" that included six minutes of 'depraved' footage (directed by W. Merle Connell) censored in original release! In addition, my copy went out of sync every single time (which forced me to rewind it a little to get the sound back on track) - but fortunately this was the source of source conversion to DivX as opposed to the movie itself.
