From the late teens to the 1920s, Stan Laurel was a solo act in film. During this time, Laurel was definitely not among the top talents of talent, and his humor is not as good as contemporary as Lloyd or Keaton. But for other ten short comedies, he created a decent niche. As far as the quality of the films goes, they varied wildly. Some, such as DR. PYCKLE AND MR. CUT, was great, while most were average to below average in quality. FROZEN HEARTS is an odd film. Like many of the films he made for Hal Roach and distributed by Path√© during this period, the costumes were absolutely top notch, and the movie looked very nice. But despite this and with the support of likes like James Finlayson, one thing they forgot to include in this movie was humor. None of the jokes seems to work, and the movie looks almost like a drama, not a comedy. Only the really stupid intertitle cards betray the type of movie it should be. <br /> <br /> My advice is to try to watch all his Laurel and Hardy movies and then watch the solo films. In addition to DR. PICK, try to see THE SOILERS and MUD and SAND - two of his more tolerable solo shorts.
