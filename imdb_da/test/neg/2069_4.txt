For those who expect cover art and history to indicate another entertaining Bollywood Indian production, beware: There are no musical dance tracks or songs of production value to illuminate the mood of this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the British Indian culture - with some few variations thrown in. As written by Roopesh Parekh, the script leaps around topics worthy of discussion to cover only those with routine avoidance tactics. Harmage Singh Kalirai reckons as a traffic policeman trying to hold the various subplots together with the Keystone Cop tactics. <br /> <br /> Jimi (Chris Bisson) is a medical school student who is gay and has a boyfriend Jack (Peter Ash) and they live with Jack's fat, alcoholic, loose morale Aunt Vanessa (Sally Bankes) and Sally's hot daughter Hannah (Katy Clayton). Jimi's family is visited by the Patel family from Delhi, bringing their beautiful daughter Simran (Jinder Mahal) to England to find a man. Jimi's parents (Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey) and his grandmother (Zohra Sehgal) decide Simran is the girl for Jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in Native American ways - without hearing Jimi. Jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless for not joining it, a decision that scares Jack and confuses Vanessa. Hannah tells a little lie to Simran (that she is Jimi's daughter) and the wedding is off. When Jimi's parents visit Jimi's house, they discover the enchanted Vanessa, rejected by her, but ultimately decide for Jimi's happiness that they will go along with Vanessa giving them a "grandson" and deciding to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for Jimi and Vanessa. Jimi convinces the very reluctant Vanessa to join the idea, and before long Vanessa is dressed in a sari, prepared for a wedding, and Jimi, scared of what he does just to please the parents, includes Jack as his best man. At the wedding, the truth comes out, and to Jimi's surprise, his family adapts to Jimi's true self, and the day is saved just by being truthful. The caste manages this stupid bit of nonsense quite well and there are some good performances: Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well, albeit without any indication of a loving relationship (the director seems scared to show the slightest suggestion of intimacy between the two men); Sally Banks gives most of the laughs like Vanessa; The rest of the cast repeats the stereotypical roles they have played countless times in Indian movies. This is not a bad movie - it has its moments - but it is just too superficial and tired to draw attention to any of the characters.
