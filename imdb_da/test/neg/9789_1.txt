It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I would think you could get it from the title. There is also a special love scene that could be the strangest thing in the film's history. I can't even remember why I saw this movie or when. Only it is an absolutely horrible movie viewing experience. On the other hand, if you are looking for the absolute weird movie to waste two hours of your time, then actually rent it. Good luck finding it at your local store. I doubt that this film is in a very broad distribution. And please do not show it to children in any way as it can pamper their impressive minds forever.
