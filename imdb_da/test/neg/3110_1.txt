This is the worst movie I've ever seen. And I've seen lots of movies. Me and my friends rented this one for an evening evening. The man we had a lot of fun. This movie is the worst most boring crap ive ever seen. But it makes you laugh! You will lay on the floor that rolls around the tryin to get some air. You wonder why? Just rent it and check for the keyboard game girl at the winding Russian bar. My mom would make a 1000 times better movie about her feedin in cats.
