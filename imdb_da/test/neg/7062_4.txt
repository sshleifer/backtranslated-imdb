Some of the early talkies survived to become classics. 1929's "The Squall" is a classic okay, but not the way it was designed. Melodramatic in history and action, today it seems ridiculous, especially the cast of Myrna Loy as Nubi, a seductive gypsy. Imagine Nora Charles breaking up with a young couple and running a young man to steal. Outrageous! But as many know when Loy first came to Hollywood, she did very few of these exotic traitor roles. <br /> <br /> Based on a game, "The Squall" refers to the aforementioned Gypsy, which in the movie is now in Hungary (Spain in the game), running away from its cruel gentleman and inviting you into the Lajos family (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce), basically appearing at the door. One by one seduces the Nubi family members and the farm, who speaks his pidgin English ("Nubi not bad! Nubi does not do anything wrong!") And drops tips on great gifts. The family's son, Paul (Carroll Nye), is engaged to the beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and cannot wait to marry her. He loses interest when he meets Nubi. <br /> <br /> With the exception of the lovely Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts as a woman living in the household and the astonishingly beautiful Loretta Young, the play is uniformly horrible. Loy is stuck with the characteristics of her character - poor English, swirling and hysteria. With her dark makeup, peasant handles and curly hair, she is not only beautiful but straight out of the 1980s - quite modern, though Richard Tucker lowers the back of his hand on the forehead, reminding us that we just come out of the sound. Robert Osborne at TCM commented that this film is one of his secret pleasures. While it is nice bad, it is not nice bad enough to sit through again. It's just bad - but a good example of how far we've come, and had someone not picked up Myrna Loy's sense of humor, how limited her wonderful career could have been.
