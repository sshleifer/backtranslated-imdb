Having sat through this god-horrible 82-minute excuse for a movie, and having previously wanted to shed my eyes after seeing another James Toback-directed mess called "When Will I Be Loved", I have come to the conclusion that he has the best agent in the world. How else can these horribly written, painfully directed pieces of waste be made in the first place. <br /> <br /> I like Robert Downey Jr., but maybe in this movie he drove to drug abuse. <Br /> <br /> Heather Graham needs to be embarrassed by his zombie performance. Half of the time the camera is on her, she just looks into a drowsiness. Such a crappy script. Prepare for Hollywood name-falling masses (example: five-minute bending discussions about Denzel Washington's performance .... etc.) <br /> <br /> There is a great character in Joseph Heller's novel Catch-22 called Dunbar. He spends most of the time in the novel that portrays. When asked why he shoots skeet all the time, if he hates it so much, he answers that it does the time CREEP knows and he wants a longer life. Well .... if you really want to feel the time creep by, watch this movie! I swear ... the 82 minutes will feel longer than a 4 hour David Lean epic. It continues and again and again ... I hope I never see another James Toback movie again. If I could give this no stars, I would.
