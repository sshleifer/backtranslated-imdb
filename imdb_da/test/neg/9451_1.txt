This is seriously the worst movie I have ever seen, right from the start the movie goes straight down the hill with its cheesy music score, bad action and total lack or real story or plot. Even for a B-movie, it's horrible. After reading some of the good reviews I thought I would keep an open mind and see it. But all the bad reviews were so right. I can't quite understand how anyone could have had it. I'm a big sci-fi fan and it was far more than I could swallow. Definlty does yourself a favor, then move on to another movie. They are many other better movies dealing with this topic. YOU ARE WARNED.
