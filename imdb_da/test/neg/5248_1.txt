Renting this direct-to-movie movie, I didn't expect a great movie. (Not to say just because a movie is in the cinema it will.) Only very loose after the story re-recorded in the epic poem, this movie gives a unique experience of monsters and super people. The general photograph can be summarized as contradictory, with its blend of medieval and post-apocalyptic (reminiscent of Mad Max). With a rock and techno soundtrack to start, you get away and feel a bit away. The combat scenes, although incredible, are entertaining, and Christopher Lambert has some of the most interesting weapon combinations I have ever seen in movies, but often a bit unimaginative. The special effects used for monster grendel are surprisingly effective and are one of the few highlights. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert delivers an average performance like Beowulf. It will not be as close as memorable as Highlander, but it was at least not as poor as the fortress. The support molding is fairly neutral. <br /> <br /> Looking for a good action adventure story with a complex and engaging plot, I would not suggest this movie. But if you want a flick that is of small substance, full of fighting battle scenes, and a slightly predictable plot, find a copy of this.
