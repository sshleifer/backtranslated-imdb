Putting in simple words or rather a word would be best suited by PATHETIC !!!!!! The movie starts by attracting a little interest in the plot, but BUT as few minutes after the audience becomes restless for toilets and getting snacks or to get a fresh air outside the closed dark hall .... <br /> <br /> looks like watching a 1960s movie where the colors were boring, directed by a debutant and acted by high school students! Movie is about an American high-minded actress trying to make a comeback in movies by appearing in one of the not-so-big Indian films. Her plays are really sad complimented by the worse dial-up performance. Overall: I would not recommend anyone to watch this movie Still want to see: Then try to watch it at home when some TV channels fly it, believe me it would be fun as this movie would not get a single ad and no sponsors. <br /> <br /> And better wear an aspirin, you may need it if you can't find a remote to change the channel! P.S. I have no idea the other reviewers even saw the movie? I did and wasted my $ 10 on the ticket!
