"Season at Brinken" is one of my favorite books all the time - an insight into the scary look of Bob Knight and his Indiana Hoosiers. And Dennehy is one of my favorite supporting actors all the time. So I drew attention to this adaptation. <br /> <br /> All levels were disappointed. Dennehy's performance was less than inspired, and he seemed unprepared to play Knight - just as he had accepted the role just before the movie. The rest of the casting is not much better. <br /> <br /> And it was clear that this was ESPN's first movie. It was badly directed, poorly filmed, and the lack of budget was obvious, whenever games were simulated (smaller sports centers, empty spaces, etc.) Skip this adjustment and read the book - it keeps it well today!
