This successor is quite awful to be honest. I'm a fan of kung-fu movies and this is by far the worst thing I've seen. The bride with white hair 1 was actually pretty good and it is a huge disappointment. BWWH 1 was brilliant in some ways with a unique illegal bullet vicious guy. The couple from the first movie played a small role in this movie. Instead, the film revolves around a lot of uninteresting characters trying to seek revenge on their fallen clans. But there is no antagonist in this movie, so revenge is dumb. <br /> <br /> The worst part of this movie is kung-fu or lack thereof. They literally had a street style knife fight. The character at the end refused to fight because choreography was missing.
