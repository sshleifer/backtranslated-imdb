With Matthias Hues on the cover and only $ 3.00, I had to buy it. I enjoyed some moments, such as Hawk's annoyance with the joys of joy, but I was just looking at seeing Matthias Hue's scenes. I especially enjoyed the showdown at the end. It was a cross between Clint Eastwood's "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" and "For A Little Dollars More" (a 3-man quick drawdown, with a musical pocket watch used as the countdown timer). Apart from that, there's really nothing more I can add. The actors gave good performances (all except "Assassin Droid", whose performance was nothing outside comic), but the film lacked real depth and purpose; simply not enough to fill 1 hour and a half standard movie time, so we stuck with the protagonists effortlessly wondering around from place to place for an hour or so until the ball rolls. For example, the main character returns to the same strip club approx. 4 times and records two fifths of the film. <br /> <br /> Nature lacked real depth and creativity, probably because of the film's budget. I don't think we ever saw this "perfect city" of New Angeles that was always spoken of as the protagonists finally reached New Angeles, its set in a factory or warehouse filled with pipes and walkways; Almost "the kingdom" would be the owner / creator of a whole city. Matthias' approximation of "at least a hundred men out there". <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of any of the actors / actresses in this movie then you might see it simply "adding it to the list". But if you appreciate 1 and a half hours of your time, or $ 3.00 of your money, you might give this a lady.
