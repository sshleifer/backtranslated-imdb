I wish I had something more positive to say about Devil Fish, but I honestly can't seem to come up with much. I can't even make many of them "so bad, that's good" kind of moments. Devil fish is just plain old. The reason is completely derived (Jaws, anyone?), The play is wood, the characters are uninteresting, special effects are bad, and the score is annoying. Add the seemingly inappropriate direction of Lamberto Bava and you have a stink of a movie. However, I think the movie's biggest sin is the lack of a budget. It doesn't seem that Bava had much to work with. In 1984, the Italian film industry was in full decline ?? especially as the genre films go. The funding available to Bava was probably very poor. Movies are like Devil Fish, who rely on special effects, have never had a chance to be good. It's not the only Italian movie that suffers from this fate. There are a number of Italian films made in the mid 80's whose ideas and concepts far exceeded what anyone could have realistically expected given their budgetary constraints. <br /> <br /> But when I have said all that and note the many weaknesses of the movie, I can't judge Devil Fish lower than a 3/10. I've even considered evaluating it higher, but can't because I'm aware of how bad a movie is. Why am I not considering the lower? Well that's hard to explain. Despite the many problems found in the movie, there is something about Devil Fish that I inexplicably enjoy. It could be as simple as my love for low-budget, cheesy Italian film. Maybe my taste in movies is skewed, but I enjoy what I enjoy. <br /> <br /> The Mystery Science Theater 3000 treatment of Devil Fish is actually very fun. I consider Devil Fish a 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale. The boys do a good job of fooling the fun on the film's many mistakes. A very sparse observation comes very early in the comment when Tom Servo notes: "Just because you can edit, doesn't mean you should" ?? highlight one more of the many weaknesses found in devil fish.
