National Lampoon's Dorm Daze is easily the worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen the movie Kazaam. Anyone reading this who thinks this movie was good in any way, shape or form has no idea what a good movie is and should never see another movie again because they are so stupid. to mention everything wrong with this movie. First of all, the plot is everywhere and may not adhere to all the many "misunderstandings" very well. The action is terrible to say the least, and everything was badly made. Anyone and everyone who worked on this movie shouldn't be in another movie of any child ever! <br /> <br /> It is too difficult to summarize this movie in just a paragraph or two because it is so bad, but for anyone out there reading this please do not see this movie !! If you want a good movie to watch, turn on something else on TV. Even the United States has better movies than this. <br /> <br /> _friend.
