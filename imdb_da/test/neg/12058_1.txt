It's a puzzle for me how this turd in a movie has ever been distributed. <br /> <br /> Of course there is horror and there is a fair share of nudity, but by God the production value is the lowest I have ever seen, the equipment used is worse than ordinary home equipment, everything is overflowing And giving everything an amateur look that brings your thought to America's worst home video or whatever was called. <br /> <br /> Please people, is it too much to ask that you actually make an effort when you expect to waste 90 minutes of people, live life here? You really should have made some short projects first because it is obvious that you are a lot of amateurs! 1.10
