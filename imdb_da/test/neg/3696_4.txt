I had been interested to see this ever since it was quoted as the worst movie ever on a post dedicated to the 1950s sci-fi cinema in a British periodical from the early 1980s titled "The Movie" (for Moreover, Leonard Maltin Film Guide also awarded this the inevitable BOMB rating). When it came out on DVD last year, I became interested in buying "Cult Camp Classics" Box Set, where it was included (along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [1958] and THE GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]); But since I recently acquired QUEEN on DVD-R, I had paid the idea. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, I just stumbled upon the movie on DivX - but the print was not deleted from Warner's DVD (which is said to boast a surprisingly cozy look), but rather a muddy TV print ... but not so much that the details are lost (in other words, it was like watching the movie in sepia as opposed to black and white!). At least to get to the point at hand: I must admit that I was somehow disappointed that the movie did not turn out to be the ridiculous feast I had been expecting all the time (Maltin calls it "fun terrible"); In fact, I found it quite engaging - and fortunately short of just over an hour in length. However, some undeniably entertaining bits remain - as when the old nurse begins to scream her head away at the sight of the 50-foot woman, and when the sheriff's deputy almost runs over her boss and the leading lady's butler in his enthusiasm to help in a so unusual case. The special effects didn't hit me either being "among the funniest" (Maltin again) on film - though they are certainly embarrassingly bad! <br /> <br /> So, the idea that a foreigner (in gigantic human form, dressed in cave man stairs and radioactive start!) comes to Earth in a large spherical (!) spacecraft and apparently after the heroine's prized necklace is completely obscene - and his quasi-transparent appearance does not matter at all ... but it is truly the human history that holds our attention (relatively speaking). The character of the philandering man is not very interesting, but his two women are: wealthy, but violent alcoholic wife Allison Hayes and the ambitious, Uzbek girlfriend Yvette Vickers. Also involved in the story is Hayes' faithful servant (already mentioned), a few cops (one of whom, as mentioned elsewhere, is very stupid) and so many doctors (one of whom is called Dr. Cushing [!] And another a specialist called when Hayes begins to grow in size after being exposed to radiation). <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie can be seen as the reverse female version of THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957) would not be fair to compare the two further as the Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson classic is far more psychological / intellectual in approach ; In fact, Hayes doesn't seem to be bothered by his condition and actually utilizes it to teach her husband a lesson! But her rampage - exaggerated in movie posters of the era - is quite picturesque (especially when considering that it only happens in the last ten minutes or so); when it is not shown the damage caused by her enormous but very convincing hand (especially when lifting the puppet, which was to be her husband!), she is mostly seen in long shots and almost from behind (with her size even inconsistent with the buildings she walks by) !! Still, Hayes' death through electrocution (when she encounters an electric cable) is completed. <br /> <br /> Finally, I followed this with his 1993 television remake with Daryl Hannah as the titular creature - which I rented specifically for this purpose.
