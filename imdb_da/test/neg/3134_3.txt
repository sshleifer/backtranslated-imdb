Bardem is fantastic. Actresses are great. But Amenabar didn't have to do that. It's OK that he defends his position on euthanasia, an extremely delicate issue. But doing so makes him lose his point: The movie is a false, offensive to the intelligence, full of tricks and even sometimes extremely boring. Some scenes are promotional material, more than a movie. Women are incredibly attracted to this insane man who wants to kill someone without understanding the consequences. He does not seem to like anyone and thank them for their care, love and attention. I think Amenabar might have people think about this problem in a different way, but the way he chose to do what I believe is not correct. He could have made his point more powerful and expose the other side of the coin without sucking it.
