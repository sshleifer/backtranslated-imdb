Of all Alistair MacLean's book adaptations, I think this qualifies as the worst, but don't blame MacLean! It seems that everything this movie shares with the novel is the same title. We have no excitement, no sense of obstruction of mystery, no chance of really empathizing with the protagonists. We spend the entire duration (or at least I did) waiting for Charlotte Rampling to throw her clothes (for Charlotte this seems to take a remarkably long time!). Still, a glimpse of Charlotte Rampling's breasts can't really save this disastrous movie. MacLean has once again been kicked into the gutter to endure the incision of the bitter hacks and nit-pickers who seem to blame him for all the evil ones who have been trying to film his books. The bad old Alistair must have searched in a corner and whined when this one came out. At least "Bear Island" - which also uses Maclean's name but apparently none of his novel - was a little exciting. The excitement here is pending the final credits.
