One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among the others was in the wake of Sole's place. An air shot is used to show that Sole is blooming with kisses by a sea of ​​women. I thought it was a comment on the closeness that women had for each other of this culture 拷 斤 拷 those stuck in the generations, separations and misunderstandings and still able to tie and trust each other. Also, the film seemed to glorify women as almost flawless individuals. What I mean by flawless is that they do not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections. An example of this is shortly after Paula accidentally killed her father. Her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for that act, while Paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she has done. Again, another example is when each daughter (or grandchild) has had the opportunity to reunite with their supposed "dead" mother (grandmother). Knowing the stresses this has most likely caused in their family still covers each of them without caring for what she has done, that is, killing her husband and her lover. In this light, women are portrayed as those who not only love each other independently of character acts, but also those who do not seem to be bothered by the actions of their friends / family members. <br /> <br /> Another idea that I thought was exciting about this culture was their idea of ​​the supernatural. With Raimunda and Sole's death and her inexplicable return, the instructor builds the audience's feelings to believe that this film should embody the supernatural. The people depicted in this culture seem very supernatural, that is, very eager to believe that life exists beyond the grave. Their aunt, long-time friend Augustina, prostitute and other people living in La Mancha, all believe that the dead rumors come back to family members to finish the "unfinished business". I thought this was a mixed reflection of the religious beliefs of culture (predominantly Catholic) as well as their need to make peasants with those who had no chance of being forgiven during mortality. The belief they had with regard to the dead being "alive" was also to give hope of the distressing circumstances, those of mortality. When the viewer is exposed that this movie is not supernatural at all, it is interesting to observe the role the mother continues to play. She is treated as though she is still a ghost (ie hiding in small crevices (under the bed or inside a car strain)). I think the director portrayed the mother in this way to increase the already existing supernatural conviction the city had adopted. The mother's character seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long-standing belief in life after death.
