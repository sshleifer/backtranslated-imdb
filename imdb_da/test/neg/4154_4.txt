An epic story of hope limited by budget and limited artistic ambition. When Terrence Malick produced this, I was expecting something joking and lyrical. Instead, we get a typical Norwegian co-production ("Revolution" with Al Pacino, someone?), Where - possibly - good intentions are scuppered by a terrible manuscript and how many of the characters are reduced to stereotypes. The English dialogue between me and Tarzan-du-Jane between the non-English speaking protagonists is extremely unfortunate ?? One could wonder whether Nick Nolte and Tim Roth ad-libbed their own as they almost sound like real people. The story is filled with impossibility: we are expected to believe that Binh can speak English after spending all his life as a peasant slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately not grammatical command, boosts the Malaysian refugee camp without the benefits of night classes). Coincidence is abundance; I wonder if an hour or two has been edited from the first third: he almost jumps into his mother in Ho Chi Minh City almost after hitting his thirty-year-old half-brother, who unclearly acknowledges him! Mom gives him a gold cap (or something similar of great value) as they share, but it is never discussed again. His relationship with "Me Dead Inside" Ling will provide the mandatory "love interest", but feels as artificial as Leonardo and Cameron in "Gangs of New York". <br /> <br /> The journey in a boat's rust forest gives a sense of the terrible conditions that human trafficking entails. In fact, the only time the movie is extremely exciting and unpredictable is the jerky handheld shooting shot shot from the bridge under choppy weather conditions. (Boat cruises from Malaysia to New York via the Cape of Good Hope and the African coast without stopping for fuel or supplies are definitely an epic journey). The beautiful shot on New York's skyline echoes Malick's use of magic hour, but I would like to know why the Coast Guard didn't show up. Maybe they looked at the Super Bowl or something. Of course, Binh manages to track his blind old father at a Texas courtyard, with the same navigational flag he showed in Ho Chi Minh City. I was impressed by how Nick Nolte could wander around the excavation fields and feed horses on a large ranch without the help of a guide dog or white stick. To demonstrate how a story about the travelers who hit refugees could be structured and shot on a small budget, Michael Winterbottoms check out the far better "In This World".
