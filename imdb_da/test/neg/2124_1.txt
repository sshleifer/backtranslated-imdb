There really isn't much to say about this. It's just really, really bad. The action is bad, the script is bad, and editing is probably one of the worst jobs ever. It is so sloppy and crooked that it only serves to confuse the audience. There is no one really to talk about, for the most part it is a really fake-looking monster fish that attacks Europeans trying to pass as Americans. Pass this on.
