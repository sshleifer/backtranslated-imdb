Well, here it is - for the movie to work, you must accept the following: A woman who is murdered lives again at the end of the movie. A lawyer stops interrogating the dead woman's fianc√© because a newspaper reporter did not ask him, and the same reporter who is thrown by a beautiful blonde pulled into the court of law for suspicious behavior is getting married her in exchange for the judge to let her off the hook. Do you follow me on this? I can't tell you how many times I stopped and redeveloped the image to repeat scenes that just didn't make sense. In the end, the blonde (Claudia Dell) and the reporter (Richard Hemingway) remained married, but I have no idea how they came to that decision. In fact, I can't figure out how the filmmaker came to the decision to make this flick. Oh, I suppose there is some entertainment value here for just the sheer nonsense of it all, but it would have been nice if even a few fit. I'm still not ready to add this to my top ten worst list. I think the nightclub scene with the feathered ladies might have saved it. But why was it in the movie? I just don't know.
