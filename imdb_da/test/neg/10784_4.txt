The tenants of Western style feminism on the various subcultures of India have so far remained largely non-existent, the two entities belonging to alien kingdoms and threatening (in the name of tradition) must never collapse. Art imitates life (or so the claim goes) and popular Hindi cinema is no exception, reflecting an underlying misogyny, which unfortunately forms the basis of much of the collective Indian culture. But why? What is it about the female sex that has made it so hated for culture that women are routinely exposed to the most unthinkable cruel, including rape, murder, child murder, impersonation, adultery, and suppression of spirit, called "dowry" ? Rajkumar Santoshi's latest offer, "Lajja", asks the same clever question linking the acts of violence committed against women through three separate chapters / episodes involving the shame of the protagonist, Vaidehi (Manisha Koirala). <br /> <br /> Direction on the Santoshi part is not up to the level the story requires. He fails to achieve the necessary sensitivity by portraying the saga of grief and confronting the issue of misogyny from the side, rather than embarking on it. Santoshi has recently said he did not make the film for an international film festival, but rather for the masses in his country. Unfortunately, the stickiness, and the film is all too often deep in the action-blooded genre that Santoshi specializes in. The film suffers from the jerky episodic pace, and its ending is right for constructed. <br /> <br /> The female cast is given much nicer and more rounded characterizations than their male counterparts. The protagonist is carefully played by the luminescently beautiful Manisha Koirala, who turns out in Lajja, that she is one of our most competent leading ladies, and gets a proper role and created a truly commendable achievement. One wonders how wonderful she might have shined if the movie is made by a director with the right creative intent and understanding of the current problem. Mahima Choudhary puts a commendable achievement and continues to show that she is an untapped talent. Cast like Janki, Madhuri Dixit does with a never before seen fervor and happiness for what really deserves the name 'acting'. The role of a street smart performer who finds consolation in alcohol and the promise of an unborn child stands as the greatest risk in her canon of song-n-dance roles that have maintained her marquee status over the last decade. Which leaves the final and most disturbing achievement in this wild feminist saga, the incessant talented Rekha. Lajja is Manisha Koirala's movie, there is no doubt about it, but it is Rekha who dominates the case in a performance that digs into your bones and sends echoes of terror through the heart's vestibules. Rekha dazzles as Ramdulari, previous vanity and complacency to deliver a performance so full of authenticity and ingenuity that emotional nudity becomes the mantra of this part of the film. Comparisons are actually vicious, especially when reproduced opposite one of the world's great leading ladies, but in the gracious presence of this ruling screen legend, the others fall into their shadow. <br /> <br /> "Lajja" has none of the sophistication of proto-feminist dramas such as "Zubeidaa", "Pinjar" or even Hell-Queen celebration "Laadla": it fulfills its feminist goals in two early moments : the high tirade in which Mahima tells her in-laws for their abuse of her father who has not committed any other crime than born to a girl. She breaks out, leaving the wedding in shambles. When she saw her father destroyed, she began to cry and blame herself for the chaotic destruction in front of her. She says, "Why have I said anything? I've destroyed everything! It's my fault!" Her grandmother clearly knew the abuse she was carrying, comforting her by saying, "Why are you crying? There is no reason for you to cry. You are not guilty of anything. The error is mine. The error is of every woman who came for you, because if we had the courage to say in our day what you have said today, you would not have needed to say anything today. "In this scene, the meaning of the feminist heritage is clearly seen through words . The second more subtle moment comes very early in the film when Vaidehi (Manisha) has fled from his fierce man to the retreat of her parents' home in India. For viewers of Western societies it may seem perfectly reasonable (in fact, natural) that any abused woman will seek parental protection guardianship; However, this is a social taboo in many Eastern cultures, India among them. When a woman is married, the identity she assumes is that of her husband and his personal belongings (family, business, children, etc.). For her to turn her back on these responsibilities is a serious social sin, one that really has nothing like the Western woman. She is then regarded as contaminated and as "damaged goods", one whose value has been completely abolished by her own actions and her refusal to submit to the role she has been given. She is not so much a person as she is an emblem of family honor. Her father regrets her for her actions, worried that his family honor will be irretrievably tainted by the daughter he had already transferred to another man. His primary concern is that Vaidehi's younger sister's upcoming marriage is exposed to a far greater likelihood with a divorced eldest daughter in the same household. He undoubtedly tells her that she must return to the man she belongs to legally, though violent and sadistic. He charges the old marriage, which states that "The honor of each home is in the hands of his daughter." Stylishly and neatly, she replied, "Yes, honor for every home is in her daughter's hands. But there is no honor for her daughter."
