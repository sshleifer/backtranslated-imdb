I'm a pretty acceptable guy when it comes to movies, even B movies. I routinely look at some B movies for fun, and they can vary from surprisingly good to just scary. I usually put my expectations really low before I looked at these types of movies, and even after that, Descent was just awful. I really didn't mind that they scratched the kernel to some extent, but they did absolutely nothing interesting with the material. Some scientists are worried about the earth's seismic activity and must enter the depths of the earth to stabilize the mantle. So what we get is a monotonous long line-up where two duel scientists played by Luke Perry and Rick Roberts will work together on a top secret mission called Project DEEP. The man in charge, General Fielding, played by Michael Dorn, secretly holds important information from assistant Marsha Crawford, played by Mimi Kuzyk. Rounding the cast is Natalie Brown, who plays Jen, a mission specialist who created "Mole" an exercise used to jump into the depths of the earth. <br /> <br /> Other than some pretty good special effects and set designs, nothing about descent is worthwhile. The movie starts pretty entertaining, but it goes down quickly into a tedious story of uncontrollable seismic activity that has been put to death in other movies like Core. Descent also has a bad script, with useless, forgettable dialogue between the characters. To make matters worse, there is literally no action, no real threat or danger. The attempts at comic relief are painfully unfunny. The reason has gaping holes, and some of the sub-plates remain unbound at the end and leave a bad taste in the mouth. <br /> Finally, this movie was just an inexpensive way for everyone involved to get a paycheck. There was no thought behind this movie, no innovation, it's just there. Apart from some great looking effects and set designs, this movie fails at all other levels. The story is from Hollywood's trash cans and the characters are uninteresting to start. Descent will simply come down to boredom and frustration. Avoid at all costs.
