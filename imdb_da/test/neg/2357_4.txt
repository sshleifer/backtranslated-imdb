Human Traffic is solely a `who made that 'experience ?? only this time it is pretty dull. <br /> <br /> Large themes explored are paranoia, male impotence and jealousy ?? but only mildly and badly. Much of the movie seems to mimic Trainspotting (drug / clubbing culture)? but it fails to include the low times / fallout that Trainspotting deals with (eg: problems with death / dependence, etc.). It even tries to make a similar monologue to Ewan McGreggor's classic "Choose Life" speech ?? but `The Milky Bars are on me! Yes!' ?? What the fudge is about! <br /> <br /> The characters try to analyze their lifestyle but when their lifestyle is so low? their analysis becomes boring and repetitive. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack (for a movie trying to be cool) is pathetic. It also includes Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland ?? came on people ?? good dance music is better than this! People get lattice and annoying (especially halfway through the movie) and the lack of care for the de-signs begins soon. <br /> There are a few fun scenes ?? but they are few and far between. The mother who caught the son in the bedroom was very funny. <br /> <br /> But PLEASE ?? I'm sick of the death of Star Wars analogue scenes. I thought it was much sharper in a couple of Kevin Smith's films (ie: Clerks and Chasing Amy). According to the characters ?? Yoda is a drug addict, so why is he short and bald? huh?! <br /> <br /> My score ?? 4 out of 10 ?? Do yourself a favor and see Trainspotting or Go instead!
