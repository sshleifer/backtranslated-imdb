Very strange. But is meant to be. This director is his own man. Even through there are tribes, if Polanski, Bergman and Kafka at least in episode 6, throw it empty. What made it all so strange, and reminiscent of the three above mentioned artists, was that it went everywhere, you never knew where it was going and could be completed anywhere, and finally when it ended, it could have been at walking. The end is hardly a final, no one could tell you what these two characters would do in even the next frame. Another thing to say about the director: No wonder Kubrick found him fascinating. There are a lot of Eyes Wide Shut in this episode somehow in the direct approach to character, the realistic fantasy elements of both. A Kubrick placement of the camera without any of the powerful effects, much more washed out and hurried, did not fussed over. That said, back to the start, this guy still has his own thing to say and says good. But for some reason there is not a single scene I will ever see again. But certainly did not feel ripped at least to see it once around. But I continued to blur all three or four other director ghosts moving through the parade. The warning was that it was only episode six: the others you could give me completely different take. But since this episode was about viewing, I look at the absolute domain of movies, I want to say what he took none of the usual routes, certainly went his own way while he brought the luggage of many good instructors behind him.
