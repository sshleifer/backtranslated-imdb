During an eight year period in the 1980s, when Charles Bronson made nine films, only one was released by a company other than the Cannon Group: "The Evil That Men Do," a TriStar Film Pickup from Sir Lew Grade ITC Entertainment Company . Bronson was already in the thick of his collaborations with director J. Lee Thompson, who ran through a series of actions until 'Kinjite: Forbidden Subjects' in 1989. <br /> <br /> Expectations should run quite high with Bronson and Thompson working for a better-funded outfit like ITC, but 'The Evil That Man Do' is a huge disappointment at many levels. While still from the low budget, B-movie mold from the 1980s, 'Evil' tantalizing has the potential for a great movie. However, everyone in the production department took an easy way out and sold hackwork that was not in possession of Bronson's footprints. 'The Evil That Men Do' had a concept and technical resources that could have been used to make one of Bronson's and Thompson's best movies, but instead will go down as one of their most average. <br /> <br /> This 1984 political thriller / actioner brutally opens with Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), a British physician holding his special training class for Surinam political leaders. The gray-haired, passive Molloch is an expert on torture methods employed by many political regimes. In the opening seven minutes, we witness Molloch using electrical power to cause unbearable pain on Jorge Hidalgo (Jorge Humberto Robles), a dissident journalist. As you might expect, the scene is horrible to see and cut from the original VHS release. <br /> <br /> Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), a retired assassin who enjoys life in the Cayman Islands. The Netherlands was contacted by the journalist years before to liberate Molloch's humanity, but struck down the offer. A Mexican professor named Hector Lomelin (José Ferrer) visits shortly after Hidalgo's death to speak the Netherlands to finish the job and bring videotapes of testimony from the Doctor's victims. Although the Netherlands initially agreed on the dirty work, he targeted Molloch and his dying sister Claire (Antoinette Bower) in Guatemala. The Netherlands enters Guatemala City with the help of a consultant, Max Ortiz (René Enríquez); he is a tourist with Hidalgo's widow Rhiana (Theresa Saldana) and the young daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas) in tow. As with most of Bronson's late exit, his character of Molloch's henchmen, one by one, crosses paths with a sleazy American diplomat (John Glover) and his supportive hitman (Roger Cudney) along the way. A brutal ending takes place in the crevices of an opal group, where Doctor just gets deserts from several of his victims. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil That Men Do' is based on a forgotten novel by R. Lance Hill and jumps on American political contacts in Latin America in the 1980s. In fact, "malice" is boiled in all forms of the concept, as it uses sensationalism and brutality to cover tremendous plot and character weaknesses. For every plus this movie has, there are three or four minutes that are the result of shod craft. <br /> <br /> While 'The Evil That Men Do' has a good concept, the movie is never more than an excuse for Bronson to eradicate extraterrestrial foam. In the style of poor pulp fiction, "Evil" is filled with cardboard characters that we never get to know or understand. The Netherlands, although played strongly by Bronson, never speaks of its inner feelings or explains what motivated him to become a murderer for hire. Rhiana, a terribly weak part for Theresa Saldana, is disgusted by Holland too much of the way, but later feels a love for him. Where does her love come from, especially after seeing the Netherlands kill more people and want to go home just a few scenes before? <br /> <br /> The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire, because so many questions can be asked for them. Of course, we can never figure out what has brought them so close together, how and where their torture relationships started, what Claire's exact role in their business is? These plot holes can continue forever, especially with the history-for-figure story that seems to make things up as it goes along. Why is Hidalgo's daughter brought in such a dangerous situation, except that she was comfortably taken hostage by Molloch? If Molloch's bodyguards Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques) clearly saw Holland and Rhiana in the cockfight arena, why is he so friendly with them in a bar afterwords? Is his memory so short? And what was the real purpose, with the exception of cheap theater, that Holland threw Molloch's driver Cillero (Jorge Luke) out of a pane, as the murder could have been handled more discreetly in Claire's apartment? <br /> <br /> The overall play is decent and somehow Bronson gives one of his strongest performances. J. Lee Thompson's direction lacks points but may have been compromised by limited time on the spot. Besides Evil's film in Mexico, the presence of ITC is clear through better production values, movies and music. Rural sites are well-suited for conveying the warm and dusty atmosphere of Latin America and cinematographer Xavier Cruz provides rich color and clarity. Orchestral scores of Ken Thorne ('Murphy's War') are refreshing in an era of synthesized junk. Strangely, these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie screaming to get out. Peter Lee Thompson's editing is better than normal, but with more ridiculous continuity errors. <br /> <br /> 'The Evil Than Men Do' was perfect grindhouse material in the early 80's and I find it hard to recommend to 21st century action fans. The DVD from Columbia TriStar Entertainment is a good presentation that offers widescreen and standard format with four-language subtitles. While the video quality is far above average, "Evil" was originally recorded in regular mono sound. The theatrical trailers are offered and actually have a grindhouse feel, with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality. <br /> <br /> ** out of 4
