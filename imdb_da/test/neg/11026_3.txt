Extremely formula with cosmic-dimensional logical holes and a notion of comedy. Aw, poor NYC lawyer! He just scrapes by, and when he gets a salary reduction, he doesn't go out to find another job, even though he's one of the most respected lawyers in the area. We see him arguing in court, so others come up and congratulate him on his burning, winning delivery, but he can't stand up for anyone in his company. In the home, problems are ignored until people storm out of the house. The only sign you want to calm down is the final girl who acts as an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world. How ridiculous the girl should bring the lawyer and his wife a chicken and wine on New Year's Eve because she feels sorry for them! (The bit is not played for grin.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, just too incredible and with a ** SPOILER ** pat, all-turns-180 degrees ending. How did they get top-notch stars for this? If I had been in the studio I would have sent it back to a complete rewrite.
