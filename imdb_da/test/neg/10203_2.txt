Hulk Hogan and Zeus are horrible wrestlers and horrible actors. Hogan for some reason was popular enough to get a file deal, I never know why. If not for Vince Mcmahon's money, this silly movie would never have been made. Maybe someday someone will make a good movie about pro wrestling. No Holds Barred is not that movie.
