Ed Wood rides again. The fact that this film was made should give any youngster hope for hope of film hope. Any manuscript you might want to use to <br /> <br /> a cat litter box or a bird cake shouldn't seem so bad now. Don't watch the movie unless you have a healthy stash of Tylenol or Rolaids. Seeing this <br /> <br /> movie made me realize that Boa vs Python wasn't that bad. It would probably have been better to make this movie in Claymation as such that no actor should have taken the credit for being in this movie. It is understandable why this director has so many aliases. There is a bright page to watch this movie in, if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips then you can eat your way out of the cheesecake that surrounds you so you can <br /> <br / > Do your to your television set's cheesecake that surrounds it.
