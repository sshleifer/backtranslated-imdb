The story is short of the faith-missing businessman priest, Daniel Clemens (Christian Slater), who looks closely at a case where another priest is suspected of murder. The pastor denies that he is guilty, but at the same time he cannot discuss the case because of confidentiality. Enter Daniel Clemens, who starts playing the policeman ... <br /> <br /> While the plot is not ridiculous, everything else is. Let's start with the visual side, the cinematography is boring, it looks more like a television series than a movie. The camera angles are dull, in fact, there is not a single memorable camera angle throughout the movie. There are no interesting close-ups that reveal details. And the stage transitions, yes, there is not much to say about them, they are not smooth at all, there seems to be no connection between the scenes than the plot itself. Okay, they used a transition with music between two scenes, but there are no interesting visual transitions throughout the movie. The times dissolved were used, there was no visual connection between the scenes. The boring visual part could be forgiven if the film would offer something else. Unfortunately, the film only offers forced wood-acting and clumsy dialogue without shock. In addition, the film suffers from sound problems, the volume is lowered several times in the movie as if the microphones were too long. I didn't predict the resolution of the movie. It could be because the movie never gave me the opportunity, or it could be due to the presentation, which was so boring that I never tried to figure it out myself. <br /> <br /> Put two plus two together and it corresponds to a B movie where 'B' stands for boring.
