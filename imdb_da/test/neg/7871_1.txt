This is 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom! <br /> <br /> In this 'Action' movie, even the gun sucks Baldwin (HK G3A3). It was sent to the recycling of armed forces around the world in the mid-eighties, and is now used only by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums. <br /> <br /> If I had known this movie, it was bad, I'd rather see 10 episodes of MacGyver saving the planet. <br /> <br /> No trace, no drive and no feeling. Watch the Tupperware channel ?? It's more exciting than this sorry excuse for a movie. This movie does not deserve a '0' on the scale. Better luck next time, Baldwin. Until then, will I sit here and see my toenails grow? It's far more exciting than 'Target' ??.
