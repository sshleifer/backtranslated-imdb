This movie is a laugh and a half. From the first scene where we look like Mel Torme as a big, bad Jaguar drivein 'stud muffin gang leader (and it's a giggle party in itself) to the final picture of Mamie Van Doren, now a rehabilitated English teen strolling out of the prison (mistakenly the girl home driven by the iron fist nuns), you can't stop shaking your head. The cast of this movie is a cheesy list from Mel and Mamie to the talented Paul Duck (all I wanted through most of this movie was for him to just stop SINGING!) And King of Forty Year Old Teens, Dick Contino. Gloria Talbot, playing a humorous teen girl with more than a few chops (judo, not acting) I last saw in the terrible misogynist 50's body Leech Woman, with a hairstyle so bad, it looked like a dead woodchuck who had been squashed by a Mac truck. <br /> <br /> Mamie is a poor, poor girl - she smokes, swears, runs wild, hits teachers, and runs around with gang leaders. She dumps her idiot Jaguar driving boyfriend Chip (as we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde girl before falling off a rock-fine guy), and continues to pick up with Dick Contino instead. Whether this is a step for her, someone guesses. Mel shows up at a party she's with her new beau and accuses her of pushing the unpleasant Chip off the cliff. While I'm sure she would have liked, she wasn't there. A stupid battle scene between Contino and his gang and Mel and his jazz freaks follows with some hilarious bad moves on both sides. Mamie ends up being sent to girls' town, a reform school. .. at home to miss girls..the fight of sister iron pants and her sister's sister of correction. She annoys the nuns (and us) by scatting, throwing off the one-liners, and just generally showing how bad she is. She runs quickly into Gloria Talbot, plays one of the misleading girls who gives her a crooked sock so she knows her place. She meets a soft noodle of a girl obsessed with Paul Anka's character (why?). This little dripping becomes her 'henchman'. <br /> <br /> There is a long film where there is not much, except St. Paul of Anka stops showing himself and proves how saint he is. He sings too much in this interval until you want to hit him in his big snozz just to make him quiet! And Mamie's little sister, who is played by princess of her father's best fame, calls her to tell her she's having trouble. It turns out that it was SIS who went out with the Chipster, and now Mel's deterrent because he found out. The girls all break together to save her, with a hysterical battle scene between the girls and Mel and his boys. This is after a race between Mel and Dick, which is just as stupid that it boggles the mind. Overage teens in this corny movie have a fabulous good time throwing through what is basically a silly, poorly written and moral sermon that fails anyone if its goal - unless its goal was to make you laugh aloud.
