"Caligula" shares many of the same attributes as the 1970 "Fellini Satyricon" with bizarre sights, freakishness, and depictions of sexual profits, all of which are set in ancient times in ancient Rome. But Fellini it's not ... First of all, it's not so entertaining. Too much screen time is devoted to bug-eyed, rubber-faced McDowell in the titular role. His performance is far too cowardly and campy to be convincing. The portraits of Jay Robinson in "The Robe" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are far more convincing and credible, the latter being the most nuanced. Relief could have been poorly provided by developing the surrounding signs more fully. Like they are a little more than cyphere. One example is the role of the macro, played by Guido Mannari, who has a huge screen presence in an important role, but is mostly back in the background. The only positive features of credit are the useful use of some Prokofiev and Stravinsky themes in the music score and the inclusion of some of the disastrous, yet accurate, actions of the despotia. However, these two factors are far less than what is needed to alleviate the current state of affairs.
