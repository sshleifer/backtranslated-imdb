This is the epitome of poor 80's film making unless you are a pre-pubescent girl. Riding on a big name like Madonna, a story line that physically attacks one's intelligence and humor that best suits a nursery. If ever there was any doubt, I think this movie in a movie clearly shows Madon's absolute lack of actor talent and made me feel very embarrassed about her. The only thing I can't believe is that they ever let the director approach another movie again. Madonna spends most of the film adorning herself as a baby doll and talking like a baby. It is painfully obvious that the only reason this film was ever made was because Madonna was a big name in pop music at that time. DON'T GET DUPED TO SEE THIS AWFUL ATTEMPT TO PAY AT THE POP STARDOM. Stay away at all costs!
