Pretty lame and horrible slasher about someone killing the members of a high school team after their star runner dies during a meeting society. <br /> <br /> Christopher George provides a hilarious over-the-top performance as a team coach. I don't think anyone has ever tracked and felt as serious as Chris does here - not even in the Olympics. It's a typical divine CG performance, and if you're a fan of the man / legend, you have to run straight and take a copy. <br /> <br /> But we're looking at slashers for the murders (you know it's true), not the performances, and Graduation Day fails to deliver as much as possible (there's a really good killer). Real horror comes only during a performance by the band "Felony". Never heard of them? Look at Graduation Day and find out why.
