I look at this horror movie that we are talking about. It may be one of the worst movies ever aired in my house. I sit here with 3 friends and they agree. It's not scary. it is not fun. It's not dramatic. It contains nothing appealing at all. we are 49 minutes in the movie. we have only seen 2 critters. only one person is dead. This movie is a great letdown. nothing about this terrible, horrible movie has made me see the rest. I get a movie. I hope everyone who has something to do with this movie dies. I mean not just the actors. I mean the director, the producers, the presidents of the studio who funded this movie. It is in its entirety the worst movie ever. It must make IMDb the worst 100 movies all the time. at number 1
