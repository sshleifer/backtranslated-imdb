This movie has a prerequisite that is good enough to get someone talking and a safe-fire conversation starts. "Do you want to sleep with someone you don't like or don't know for a million dollars?" While the film had lots of potential, the poor performance becomes a b-class soap opera. The film has a good management, and after the proposal is made, we are really in the movie, but then it falls dramatically. The last three quarters of the movie are used by whinging characters, complaining and sorry what they have done! The ending was so clich√© that it had me in tears! This has a very similar premise for 'honeymoon in vegas', which is far better. See it instead.
