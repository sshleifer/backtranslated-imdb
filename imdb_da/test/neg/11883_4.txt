This is a person's voice that has just finished watching Rome's second season, almost all at once, and seized the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this movie goes out comfortably where Rome ends. If you find Rome an abomination, an erroneous screw party with a little historical accuracy, then you can enjoy Empire: Augustus. But if you feel that Rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the intricate intrigue, the mood of the decade and the actors' work, then Empire will obviously work for you as an overly thin, superfluous and boring soap opera with not many redeeming factors. <br /> <br /> There are some actors who, in my opinion, look something better than these in Rome. I especially did not like Rome's image of Cleopatra as a drug-soaked sex addict. There must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman, and the actor in Empire fits the part much better. O'Toole and Rampling are good and there are also some others. But then ... If you've come to know - and love - Atia like the super-cold bitch, you can find her depiction in Empire - like a tear-sparkling mother walking in an apron - quite ridiculous. There must be some bitchy characters in Empire, but these actresses rely heavily on staring at the men and not much more. You will find no interesting female characters in this epic. There are also the painfully comical Maecenas, which we see as a screaming drag queen, although there is little historical evidence that he was such (he is once referred to as "being in his pleasures" in the annals). <br /> <br /> The interior is rather lean and rely on clichés on clichés. Cleopatra's large hall looks like something out of a computer game or a playground in an Egyptian theme park. There is a looooooooot of really bad 3D graphics, not up to 2003 standards. The plot is presented as a series of flashbacks, the old August revives. So we get a quick look at some historical events, some of which are well presented while some are not. A disproportionate amount of time is wasted to show Livia as Augustus' eternal flame. This affair does not even sizzle for a moment, the dialogue is superlative and everything is spiced with sticky tearing musical scores. Regardless of the reality the show aims to capture, every piece of it is destroyed by the dry, synchronized copying (most of the actors are not English speakers). Everything is lukewarm in this epic. True, there are more historical accuracy than in Rome, but dramatically it is simply boring. The characters lack depth and the sharpness of the dialogue. Camera work is often reduced to static shots, and lighting does nothing to please your eye. There really is no one to love and no one to hate in Empire. Whether you liked or disliked Rome, there are much better movies and miniseries around. Old Rome: The rise and fall of a kingdom would be one thing I recommend.
