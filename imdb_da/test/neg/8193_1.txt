^ ^ contains spoilers ^^ <br /> <br /> This movie is completely crap. Don't watch. <br /> <br /> There is no one in this movie to root for or even like, except the wife, and she wins by default. Everyone is selfish and many things do not make sense. <br /> <br /> At best, the action is mediocre, and everyone pulls in too much. No one can even cry credibly. <br /> <br /> If you leave the room for another second, something will happen completely out of the left field and it will make no sense. <br /> <br /> For example, I left the space for a second while Jennie Garth's character slept with his manager. I'll be back, seriously about 4 minutes later (also I'm pretty sure there was a commercial place in there) and she sleeps with the Berko guy. <br /> <br /> I gave up on this movie about the time Berko was an ass to his fiance in the car because she didn't want to interrupt the wedding. <br /> <br /> I wasted 2 hours in my life. You shouldn't.
