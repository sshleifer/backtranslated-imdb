Making a movie below 1 million can be a triumph for a line producer or an accountant, but doesn't matter to the audience. The balance could have been beautiful, but the viewing experience was poor. <br /> <br /> What becomes a triumph for Irish cinema is when people realize that the production values ​​and script cannot be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why people are using the energy required to make a movie together when production quality is worse than a low-grade television show. <br /> <br /> The shortcomings of the plot have been mentioned in another review on this site and I fully agree with what was written. What I would add is that the film skimmed the surface of several genres without ever settling in one of them. The film would have benefited from either going towards a straight out comedy or social / political commentary. My overall impression was that the film was speedy, thematically under developed and visually not up to standard. On the other hand, the performance and music were very good.
