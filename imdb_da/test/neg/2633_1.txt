This movie scared hell out of me for no good reason. the creepy music was well-written, but apart from that, it's a complete waste of time, and it really disturbs me .... I'm not really sure why either .... if you just want to see a bad 'B' horror movies, I think you could give it a shot, but only as a last resort
