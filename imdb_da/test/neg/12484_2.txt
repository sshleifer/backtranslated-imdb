Yes, what did I expect? I thought it would be a movie about young adults at their turning point in life, something like "Sonnenallee" or "American Pie" that I liked a lot. I wanted to watch a funny movie, perhaps with an ironic look at idyllic Wuerzburg. And what did I get? <br /> <br /> Pay attention to front spoilers! <br /> <br /> This movie begins with a long dialogue that gives you a good hint of what inevitably follows: more long dialogues. Sometimes I thought Moritz Bleibtreu might have forgotten his text and try to hide it by improvising and just repeating what he said earlier. But when I think of Bleibtreu as one of the better German actors, I think this effect was really calculated. I think the author wanted to show how boring talking to close friends can be - especially when they are stoned. But really, I don't need the cinema to be bored with stoned friends' talk. Boring dialogues make up most of this movie. <br /> <br /> But okay, that's one thing. I can do what I've seen good movies with abominable dialogues, just think of Schwarzenegger's life's work. But the next thing is that characters are cheap and flat, and that story is as predictable as anything. Just an example (SPOILER !!): Why do you think somebody is taking a garden hose to his ham plants deep in the forest? To water them? Of course, you don't usually find water pipes deep in the forests, do you? The only reason this water hose is there is that a hunter who happens to pass by while the two protagonists harvest their dope can be killed, mistreated and finally filled up with three bottles of hunter masters. I really hated this scene because it's really violent. Usually I don't mind violence in movies - slapstick comedies are full of it. But in that kind of comedy there is a silent agreement between the film and you that people do not get hurt if they fall on their faces or are beaten with chairs or the like. But if it happens in a movie that is otherwise realistic enough, slapstick scenes also seem right. In this particular scene in "Lammbock" I really thought that this hunter should be badly wounded, if not dead - the final scene really invoked me the impression that he is back to die there, full of more spirits, like someone could manage. And the protagonists just go away. It would have been otherwise if the author consistently followed a style; The scene could have been quite fun. <br /> <br /> Talked about being consistent - that's what I missed most about this movie. The whole movie appears to be a list of small episodes that came to the author's mind. Things just happen without a clear reason - yes, I know, it's life, but it's not a cinema, because the cinema is meant to tell a story, not to show boring episodes without any significance. I found myself asking "Where's the point?" continually. Signs beyond the two main ones are not elaborated, you never know why the protagonist's sister will sleep with her best friend Kai, she actually tells you, but I couldn't buy it, not at all. I think she was just there to give Kai an opportunity to deal with this childish AIDS test sketch that you've probably seen a thousand times before, and mostly better. The protagonist's boyfriend meets you once, then leaves Germany (what you don't even see and the guy doesn't seem to break) and finally it is mentioned in a sentence that she's met someone else in America and split up with the protagonist. It seemed to me that the author wanted to tie a few final goals. He didn't actually work, you never really know what is so bad about studying the law, being his father's son (Father fixes everything in the end and serves coffee in the middle of the night, which in my opinion made him one of The nicer characters throughout the film) and live in beautiful Wuerzburg. Even the dinner with his father's friends, who might have to show how terrible it is to live up to his father's expectations, seemed to be flat, just another good dinner with family friends (except for the trip the guy is on later, but I think that show that eating dope before eating with parents, is not healthy, was not the meaning of this scene if there was any). I have experienced far worse dinners in my life than this one and still finished my exams. I couldn't understand a single character throughout the movie, they just seemed flat and unreliable. All of this made it a not so good movie, but not one that I didn't want to watch again on television. It really had some good scenes (most of them were not new, but like those with the nice and understanding policemen), some were really funny, some dialogues were good, and I like Bleibtreu's games, though he repeated his well-known stereotypes again this time. Not good, not abominable, that's what I thought after the movie was half over. <br /> <br /> But then this incest scene came, and I found that really repulsive. The incest is simply not fun. I don't even know if it was supposed to be fun, some of the audience laughed so it could have been meant this way. This scene spoiled the whole movie for me, I could no longer feel sympathy for the protagonist - I cannot feel sympathy for anyone who is a helpless person, for me it is rape and rape not fun. So it could have been a hint of drama or so, but the incest is never mentioned again (although we thought it might have been a reason for the protagonist to leave Germany at last, but as it is never mentioned again, t.) is even completely unnecessary. I almost expected the sister to become pregnant in the end, which would just have added the last smile to this tasteless story, but not even this final clich√© is fulfilled, just as nothing really is solved or thought through at the end of this movie . It's not really fun, it's not really a drama, it's not a road movie at all to leave Tarantino despite desperate attempts at violence, it's certainly not fun. <br /> <br /> Skip this movie. See "Final Fantasy", it's also bad, but at least with beautiful pictures and not so tasteful.
