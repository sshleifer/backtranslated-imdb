The original Road House is by no means an award winning film. But it is one of the great culprits at all times. It should not have been so difficult to make a successor. There is no need for a large budget, big names stars and spectacular visual effects. Even the story didn't have to be original. All it needed was a good time vibe and some great fist matches. I don't mean Matrix-style "wire-fu", just some well-choreographed barroom brawls. Many of them. There are a few decent games in the movie, but none of them are memorable and the focus is more on the gun. Plus, the way it binds into the original movie is ridiculous and adjoins insult. Johnathon Schaech plays Shane Tanner, an undercover DEA agent who is good with his hands and feet. But here's the kicker ... he's the son of Patrick Swayze's character Dalton !!!! What do you say????? Let's see, the original Road House was made in 1989. So for Dalton to have a son in his late 20s (maybe even 30) in 2006 ... you get the idea. They give it a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) while his father "traveled a lot around". Oh thank you. It even justified turning off this movie. But I go down. Schaech is completely out of his element. Sure he can throw a few kicks, but he has nothing as an actor. Plus, he is featured in the movie of the Bad Guys as "Beautiful Boy". I have never examined the men so closely, but I do not think this guy is too nice. He looks sick. His face is too thin, and his fallen eyes make it look like he's going to pass at any time. I had never heard of him before, but I think he should stop acting and go back to his day job. Jake Busey plays the local drug runner Wild Bill. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good at Starship Troopers, and even made a threatening villain in Hitcher 2. But here he just chews the landscape in standard bad guy fashion. Even his "thriving" dialogue is yawning worthy. We must buy him as the man who has the whole city in his pocket. But why? What is he doing? Because he wants to buy a Patton bar "with any means necessary"? Ellen Hollman has the role of token girlfriend. A woman with a secret. Too bad is the secret just as hard to figure out as 2 + 2. She is the local primary school teacher who happens to be a former army soldier. Guess what that means? This means that even though she may choke with fear of the majority of the movie, she will be ready to smash heads when the coat begins to fly. Well, at least she's hot. In fact, the battle between her and Wild Bill's girl is the best in the movie. It's fast, brutal and entertaining. Which leads me to my next problem with the movie ... the fighting. As I said, Schaech knows how to throw a blow. The same cannot be said for anyone he is facing in the movie. It is clear that the film comes down to Schaech versus Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He does not have the ability to draw on a movie fight. Swayze may have been a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the means to pull out well-choreographed battles. He also faced a few worthy opponents, and had a killer (literally) moving. None of this. With a few exceptions, the fighting is forced, poorly staged and routine. The punch sounds like someone tastes a 2X4 on the concrete, and there are even a few parts where the sound does not even match the punch. It is embarrassing. There is not even the good southern / redneck music of the original. Road House had Jeff Healy Band, which was a popular band at the time. This movie contains a singer named John Otto whose music is weak and his action seems even worse. He has got a line in the film, which was probably used to appease whatever fans he might have out there. Either that or someone owes him a favor. My final complaint about the movie is one that comes out just to be fussy ... the continuity. Film is shot out of order, and then it is the editor's job to control it all together. Now someone has to give the editor of this movie a little shot. The problems range from small things like people who don't look in the same direction when a shot switches to RE-USED footage at the end of the movie. Initially, we are introduced to the bar, The Black Pellican. As the camera moves through the bar, you see the band, bouncers and people dancing. At the end of the movie, when the wicked have been defeated, we get a new shot of the same bar, with bets of our hero sitting in the bar with his girl. The problem is that people's footage in the bar is the same recording from the beginning of the movie !!! I'm not asking you. It's the same people who stand (or dance) in the same places wearing the same clothes. Want to know the funniest part? You see bouncers in the shot that were killed earlier in the movie. Do yourself a favor, don't watch this movie unless you feel you have to go out and beat someone. This movie will make you angry enough to do it.
