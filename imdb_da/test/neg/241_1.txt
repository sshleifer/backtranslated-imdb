Mexican 'classic' was the third item in the Aztec Mummy series. As you soon find out, this movie is anything but a classic, instead it is more like a movie deliberately trying to drill you. <br /> <br /> Some scientists will steal Aztec's treasure from a grave, but guarding the grave is going to toilet paper commercial: Aztec Mummy. When he knew he couldn't beat the mummy, he then built a robot and a very bad one. We will only see Mr. Robot in the last wheel as he lumps around and battles with Aztec Mummy. I've seen many miserable Sci-Fi movies, hell most Sci-Fi movies I see are miserable, but one, for the whole duration of 64 minitums, is the worst movie I've seen, with Fubar coming in a close Second .... Conclusion: Don't waste your time.
