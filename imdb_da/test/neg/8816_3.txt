The main issues with 'Saw' are related to the huge script errors that only an uncritical spectator will just avoid. The most important question is, what is the purpose of the killer in his lying in the middle of the floor? The film tries to show that the killer aims to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with other people's lives and to feel control over their fears and weaknesses. So why does he just be dead between the two main characters? A Huge Impossibility: Can a man pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even breathing to not be detected by two men in the same room? It has no meaning whatsoever, except to be the final (d) effect of the movie. The killer seems to always have the control along the plot, and if it lies like a dead body, it can't be done. Finally, it doesn't work. The right place for the killer should have been a darker and opaque shadow behind the false shadow (the male nurse), but not the white room floor. The director should not have shown the killer face and maybe the place where he is hidden. Then the movie would be a pretty good thriller. But 'Saw' is just a failure. Hitchcock, please, come back.
