This movie is a gay love story spoiled as a story of graffiti and friendship. Not a review described this movie as a gay romance movie, and that is the weight of the plot. I do not know if it was fooling people who would otherwise be uninterested to sit through it and expect the movie to be as it was marketed. The film is out of touch with graffiti culture, abuse and failing graffiti culture and the play is immense. Oh yes, the graffiti sucks too. This movie was a smart way to hide the agenda of portraying young boys who become gay. Just look at the rest of the movies that the director has been involved in, all containing the same topic. Drilling like hell, not what I expected.
