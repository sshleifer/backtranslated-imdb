I'd like to say something else about this movie. I saw remarks on how beautiful Russia is, and the views from Russia have been great. Hey guys this is not Russia, it is Bulgaria more specifically the capital Sofia. So it's not Russia, it's my country. About the movie - good in Bulgaria, maybe except Gray Zone - all movies from US directors in one word are terrible like this of course. It's a shame that Patrick Swayze has to play in such a low budget movie. Most of the actors are Bulgarians, but really this movie has no plot twist has no energy what can I say-weak and boring movie a clich√© no more. Hey people remember it's not Russia in fact it is Bulgaria.
