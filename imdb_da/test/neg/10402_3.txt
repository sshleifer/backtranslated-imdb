Fear and Desire are especially interested in Kubrick obsessors who can plummet this pretentious trap for signs of his ever-present greatness. Kubrick was right in trying to make sure the movie was not screened or available on legitimate video. He found it embarrassing and amateurish, and he was correct in his evaluation. This is a weak and boring movie - in 68 minutes it still seems longer than "Barry Lyndon"! - It is nevertheless of historical interest and has its real absorbing moments. It is a difficult movie to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), although it may change if Kubrick's property is parenting and has it released on video. Recommended only for Kubrick enthusiasts.
