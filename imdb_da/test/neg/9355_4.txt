Go up to any movie fan and ask them about the title of the movie, which was controlled by Robert Wise, with the second direction of Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone, designed by Ken Adam and scored by Max Steiner, star champion Sir Stanley Baker, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot was filmed in color, scope and stereo at Cinecitta in 1955 with a thousand extras - and they will tell you to go away and stop stupid. <br /> <br /> They will tell you that no such movie EXISTS. That the names you have quoted NEVER worked together - they weren't even contemporaries. And that you've just picked the names out of a movie release randomly and are trying to immerse them. <br /> <br /> At this point you can lead them to IMDb and show them the cast and crew of "Helen Of Troy". They will be amazed! This lesser-known sword-and-sandal epic has all these names and more - Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott and good old Harry Andrews. And that is certainly an oddity. After the war, 1,000 Italian extras cost about $ 25 a day, and toga dramas were a staple of Italian cinema. Orgy scenes were shot twice - one with peaks, the other outside (you can guess which version Britain and America got). I think even La Sophia is an extra in this. <br /> <br /> Whatever, names name the mind. But that's really just a case. All names were just about to reach their career (Canutt, Steiner) or began them (everyone else). Only Robert Wise and Niall MacGinnis were in the middle of their career. <Br For the record was Leone uncredited and taught its trade - Adam still had to invent the downward circle in the ceiling on the set (a trademark he would continue to put into all the early bonds) - Baker had yet to steal and help Produce as "Zulu" and "Robbery" - and continue to control a Welsh television company called Harlech - so die tragically young. While Harry Andrews would continue to be one of Britain's favorite character actors - Janette Scott (daughter of Thora Hird) would never make the big time, but who can forget her in "Trip Day" (although she was added later - for upholstery and a happy end) or "Crack In The World"? <br /> <br /> Sir Cedric was a theater, but knew how to curl up in movies - and Bardot ... was BARDOT to gawdsake! <br /> But what made these star people in this camp old nonsense? Do not ask me. The two main stars were non-names Italians - Helen had a mustache and Paris was beautiful - while the British were only there for support. <br /> <br /> To sum up, I think you can just mark this one as a big FLUKE. In stereo. To be honest, if I hadn't seen it - I wouldn't believe it!
