My reason for watching this movie (despite being free) was more or less out of curiosity ... little, little curiosity ... I wasn't all familiar with this straight-to-video "biographical "statement by Mr. Gein and discovered during the opening credits that it featured horror icon Kane Hodder starring. My feelings turned not just from curiosity, but now a flash of mild expectation of how his portrayal of Gein would turn out. Also in the credits (among some pictures of Ed's crimes) were Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns. "Okay," I thought of myself ... "It can be mildly fun." When the movie started and evolved (slowly), my microscopic self-confidence (or as I call it "micro-heap") for this movie faded completely and I stood firm with an overwhelming sense of humility as I died a little from inside to see this dung pile. Hodder, who is known and respected for his previous work as an unstoppable serial killer, puts it unnecessarily in play here - making Eddie Gein from a gentle way to a hollow, full blown killer. He delicacies at night and kills cemetery staff, his burial girl and teenage girls, leaving Plainfield in panic, as the local Sheriff's department apparently does nothing to adjust the dangerous situation at least. The substitute and his mother have a warm little relationship that gave me a fuzzy feeling inside (or it might just have been the cyanide pill, I took halfway through this turkey). I'm not sure what the meaning of this movie was, and of course the director didn't know anything about the subject he was working on. There is already such an abundance of films relating to Gein's story that unless "Ed Gein Snuff Footage" is discovered, I will not see more of these on the shelves. If you want a more authentic film of this kind than check out 2001's "Ed Gein (aka the moon light)".
