I survived the first hour of this and came back in the last ten minutes just to say I saw the end. If you want * real * mythology, flawlessly done, look for Armand Assants "The Odyssey". Great storytelling doesn't have to be tweaked - the stories are amazing alone. I just hope Sean Astin needs the money. And Sophocles and Ovid have to swirl in their graves - anywhere. <br /> <br /> At least with Sorbo's version, the tongue was plastered relentlessly in the cheek - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but perhaps the interest was generated in the backstory to send someone to the library. I'm surprised that Halmi could show something so entertaining (the TV series) and follow it with something that lacks quality.
