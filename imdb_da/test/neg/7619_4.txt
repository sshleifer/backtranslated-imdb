I watched this movie for the first time on NBC Friday 11-29-02. It was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it would be the kind of Muppet movie Jim Henson would make. I mean, first of all, that Pepe uses the word "sexy" every now and then, and Pepe says "it would suck?" And I know clearly that Jim Henson would not allow Kermit to shout: "I wish I would never be born!" thirteen times a minute. This movie is just not like a classic Muppet movie. Sure I can understand Nicky Holiday, who steals the baseball diamond from "The Great Muppet Caper", but a business lady who cheats Muppets in a contract for their theater to make it a smoker nightclub. If Jim Henson was here today, he would HATE this movie!
