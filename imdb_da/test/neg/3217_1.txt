It is amazing that this no-talent actor Chapa made all these familiar stars appear in this gloomy, pathetic, cheesy, and obsessive movie about a low-rise gangster who looks white, but is half Mexican, much of the play is bad and many of the well-known stars in this blurry movie gets a script that seems to be made by a 16-year-old, I'm sure this movie is the career's low point for actors like Dunaway, Wagner, Keach, Tilly and Busey as I am sure very embarrassed that they ever appeared in this turkey of a movie. I doubt many people have ever heard of Chapa, and after this horrible movie I am sure he will disappear into oblivion where he belongs.
