I was invited to watch this film at a small art museum's screening. I had no idea what to expect. I was initially optimistic about opening credits to see Judd Nelson, Bill Paxton, Wayne Newton, James Cann, Rob Lowe and Lara-Flynn-Boyle listed. But after some very disturbing burnt-out scenes (which didn't add much to the story's progress), this movie quickly became a torture weapon. The giant of vestigial growing arm history has never been really developed. I kept patient and waited for this movie to cash in. There was a small down payment in the end, but it was necessary to invest and sit through the endless gross, raw, sexually perverted, screaming, scary grim for me (even for a free show). What were these established actors in this horrible movie? The art direction was very convincing and scary. At least it should only be a 75-minute movie. This is a movie that Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld would embrace.
