Something of a disappointment. Lee J. Cobb is the anti-union head of Roxton's clothing in New York. His partner in the company is killed when an elevator loosens and steals twenty-two floors to the bottom of the shaft, in the craziest scene in the film. <br /> <br /> Cobb doesn't know it or doesn't let him understand it, but the man behind the killing is Richard Boone, who protects the business from unions. <br /> <br /> Then comes Cobb's son, Kerwin Mathews, back from Europe, determined to teach the company and join his father in running a clean store. He's shocked - shocked! - To learn that Boone has climbed federal members and killed a couple who have become annoyingly annoying. <br /> <br /> Robert Loggia is one of the organizers killed by a pair of Boone's goons led by Wesley Addy. Loggia leaves a widow, Gia Scala, with whom Mathews makes understandable and decorative. <br /> <br /> Finally, Cobb pays for his self-deception, Addy and Boone get their just desserts, and Mathews wind up with the succulent Scala, after which an opera house is called. <br /> <br /> There is no spark in any dialog. A few lines are stolen verbatim from "On the Waterfront" - "pistoleros", "you will talk right into the grave." The reason is schematic and holds absolutely no surprises. Vincent Sherman's direction is pedestrian. The photography is flat and uninspired, although there are a few great shots from the New York streets. <br /> <br /> Lee J. Cobb can act. In this case, it must have been easy for him because he repeats Johnny Friendly from "On the Waterfront" only this time with a soft heart. Richard Boone can also act. Joseph Wiseman, in a small part, does a good job. Gia Scala hits her brands, says what the script requires, and does what the instructor tells her. An amazing woman, she was sour early. The director and the photographer are doing a good job at Wesley Addy. He has white hair, a blanched face, eyes the color of a glacial lake, and he is sometimes shot through a wide-angle lens than he turns his surprisingly fleshy lips into a kind of parasitic fish. However, I cannot see him as a low-level muscle man. He and Boone should have changed roles. Harold J. Stone is his reliable self, even though he is forced to be more "Italian", like Tony, than comes naturally to him. No one else in something that looks like a lot is more than mediocre, and some performing artists do not even have that bar. Kerwin Mathews can be a great guy in real life, but he is softly sterile and belongs to home dramas in afternoon TV. Great title that suggests intrigues and shadows. Some good people in the cast. A potentially explosive exposure of a company that no one knows much about but dealing with megabucks. <br /> <br /> And it all comes out like this.
