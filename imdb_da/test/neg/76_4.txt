An unclear horror show filmed in the Everglades. Two couples stay in a cabin after being a little uneasy about the unfriendlyness of the locals. Who, or what are the bloodshed? After a while they find out. Look for the character of the village idiot who complains like a chicken, he is certainly weird.
