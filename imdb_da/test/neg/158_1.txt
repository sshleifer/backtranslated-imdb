I tried to see this adaptation, but it was just so terrible that I couldn't torture myself like that. The performances were quite sub-par, with the exception of Ariel. Fonda was way above the top in a role to be dealt with with some subtlety. I have studied Shakespeare and seen many adjustments, and that is by far the worst I have ever seen. I have to wonder why anyone on earth made this movie. Shakespeare can and has been beautifully adapted in many cases. This is not one of them. To watch this movie, do I have to suggest a drinking game? Take a drink each time they leave the book from the original idea and two drinks each time Fonda overcomes. You must be quite full in a very short time.
