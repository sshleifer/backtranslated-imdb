La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, or Terror Express! As it was called on the version I saw, starts as different passengers control a long distance train. Three thuggish idiots, Dave, Phil & Ernie (Carlo De Mejo) board and it is clear that they are there to cause problems as they scare and verbal abuse the other passengers and employees. When the train runs past things, it becomes uncomfortable when a prostitute named Juliette (Silvia Dionisio) refuses to have sex with Dave, he and his friends decide to keep the whole train in the hostages so they can have an orgy with Juliette & Not much else actually happens except for some hero policeman and his prisoner who set about saving the day. Erm, it really is ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was directed by Ferdinando Baldi & is complete total & total crap from start to finish. The manuscript of George Eastman as Luigi Montefiori could just as easily be described as a really boring porn as much as a horror / thriller. It is slowly slow, it is 35 minutes before something happens that is even remote, and on the whole, the film lacks the kind of utilization elements that Italian sleaze & horror delivered at the time. The film compares to another Italian production, the infinitely better The House on the Edge of the Park (1980) made the same year, it is a very broad comparison, but like everything that made House on the Edge of the Park the infamous movie absent from La Ragazza del Vagone Letto, there is no blood, no gore, almost no violence, there are only a few really rug rape, the story has no twists or turns, and it is incredibly boring to see. Italian sleaze & horror from the late 70s and early 80s is not known for its strong stories or amazing scripts, but this movie really scrapes the bottom of the barrel on all counts. The character is horrible, movies use the first 30 plus minutes to build them up and give a background for why they are on the train, but this is all quickly forgotten and comes to absolutely nothing. I also hated the lame ending and I don't know if I missed something but was some kind of reasonable explanation why these three lambs would hijack a train? I don't think there was, was there? I am sorry, but because your anger at a prostitute is not enough for a reason, the filmmakers could certainly have got something more comprehensive and interesting if it wasn't more plausible. In my opinion, this movie stinks, it's as simple and straightforward as what I'm afraid of. Director Baldi does an OK job, to be fair he only has a corridor and a few train chambers to work with so I will cut him a little limp, having said that the film will be very repetitive. There is no style & he films sex scenes as a bad soft core porn complete with horrible romantic sounding piano music. There is not one single drop of blood in the whole movie, it is not a single drop. Forget about doing or doing violence, as you will be very disappointed if you do as I did. There are a few rapes, but they are amateurishly staged and have no impact, the unpleasant exploitation and sleaze of I spitting on your grave (1978) or The Last House on the left (1972) is not here. <br /> <br /> Technically, La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is ok, and it's pretty well done on what should have been a low budget, but the setting has obviously helped keep the price down to a minimum. The action is poor as usual, even though it was baptized, the original notions have been lost. Fans of Italian scary will recognize many voices here. <br /> <br /> La Ragazza del Vagone Letto is a horrible movie, it's just my opinion, but I was sorry that tears are waiting for something to happen and when it finally I never felt cheated, I want have the 80 minutes of my life back. This piece of shit is not even suited to grace the 99p VHS dealer tray in your local Blockbuster, one to avoid.
