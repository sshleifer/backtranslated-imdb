Some Plot Spoilers Ahead. The Nashville Network's so-called rebirth as "The First Network for Men" is a complete disappointment, as is its block of adult cartoons. The new Ren and Stimpy were simply horrible, at best "Gary the Rat" mediocre and "stripping" beautifully relentless. This cartoon is mostly boring; If "Clean and Stimpy" suffered from gross overkill, "Strippery" lacked any decent chokgags, fun-minded gags, clever gags or gags, period. The concept is bad at first: Pamela Anderson, a stripper-cum superheroine, rescues "The City" from a selection of superficial supervillains. This cartoon seems like a tribute to superior wacky superhero spoofs, like "Darkwing Duck" and "The Tick", but without these cartoons' white and good writing --- or even good storyboarding. "Agent 0069" tries to vacillate between being goofy and sexy, but neither is she and this cartoon fails to make her one or the other bring this series down. See your taped episodes of "The Tick," and see what a true superhero spoof cartoon is like.
