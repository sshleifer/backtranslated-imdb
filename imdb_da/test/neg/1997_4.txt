My guess is that the producers of this low-budget space / horror movie wanted a serious movie, but the director had his heart set on a parody. So ... that's what we get. Seen in an abandoned spaceship for 1000 years in the future, along with signs and props right out of the 90s. The set is somewhat industrial complex, perhaps an oil tanker, regardless. They use as such, so the controls consist of racks of old TV equipment. One place is of course the employees lunch room and sports an old TV and video as well as a water cooler with plastic demijohn. Tiny Lister and Coolio get the best lines and argue throughout history. The dialogue is full of conditions that are quite dated even now ("A-OK, Daddy-O"), but perhaps the 30th century is very retro? When the captain declares the ship's cargo, a lot of coffins are from "Transylvania Station", you know, it's all a put-on. It's a bit alien, part JasonX, shameless rip-off of all the best sci-fi and horror titles. At one point, Casper VanDien himself tells his pilot to "make it so" with a straight face. This movie would have been better if they had just let everyone run with the satire, but they are trying to make the story serious .... maybe backers were on the set that day. Anyway, not a bad boredom killer if you're not too picky. FX is as good as the sets are bad.
