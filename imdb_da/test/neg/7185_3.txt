I wouldn't give away too much of the movie to tell you that there are many, many, many, many scenes from Lucas (the young protagonist) who go and look at things! Yep. And you'll be glad to know that the first third of the movie is pointless, meaningless, and largely ignored for the rest of the movie! <br /> <br /> This movie is populated by boring people who do boring things, and the stupid person of them all is young Lucas who goes blind and needs an operation. You see, he has delusions, horrible delusions! He thinks a killer is preaching on blind women! He walks a lot around and seems like an unbearable jerk! <br /> <br /> Patience DOES NOT pay for this movie. In the end, the plot and events are just as confusing and lethargic, and it is very difficult to look at one side or another about what some of the nightmarish images meant. Nothing is clear, the film moves at the snail's pace, and it left me with the same effect as a hangover. <br /> <br /> "Afraid of the Darkness" does not bring the British to stupid thrillers as the Americans do they do boring.
