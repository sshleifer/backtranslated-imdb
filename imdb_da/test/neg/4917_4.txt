As these films plow through the artifacts of the Amityville House, it won't be long before we come down to the floorboards, but at the moment it's a mirror that causes problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth entry in the series. A homeless man survives it to the artist father Ross Partridge who then has strange visions and discovers some unpleasant revelations about his past. This earthly horror rolls together at a dull pace and leaves us waiting for a structure that never comes as the various "spooky" goings-on leads to a stupid finale. Mix and lifeless, with ropey acting and Partridge's huge hair doesn't help.
