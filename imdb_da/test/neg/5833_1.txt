This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story was about a woman prisoner sent to space to try to save mankind, but what it actually turned out to be was that the prisoner actually was aboard a spaceship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander. The whole story was about having sex again and again. There was no need for this whole recording - only to create a soft porn movie. Of course, we had to see the film's heroin, which had sex for approx. 2 minutes. I don't know what all this had to do with the movie's real plot except I suppose men get to see it. I gave it only 1 out of 10 because there was no other rating lower. Don't waste your money or time - it has nothing to do with science fiction, but rather a movie for young young boys to watch to see t & a. The creature was only shown more than halfway through the movie and resembled the alien in the movie with Signorney Weaver . Bad excuse for entertainment.
