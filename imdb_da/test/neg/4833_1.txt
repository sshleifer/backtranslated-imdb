In fact, I do not tell the main spot in this comment, but with only 2-3 sentences I can turn it into a spoiler. OK here are these - <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is only an 85% conversion of Hollywood Flick Cellular to Bollywood using the software Vikram Bhatt. Title has no match with the story, only it goes in the thriller direction. Just that!! It doesn't even deserve a star for its imitation, imperfect casting, poor standard, and predictable history. Undoubtedly now, I can say that Viram Bhatt is slowly disappearing from his director's status as no matured audience will appreciate his latest works, including this one. Besides him, Aftab Shivdasani also makes his view as a cartoon comic. Who knows how long will he be in the movie industry more? Sometimes the standard in performances and movies looks like a lower than a C-grade movie. But the most supportive role was played by Zayed Khan, who was somewhat identical to Chris Evan's role as Ryan in Cellular. With innocent face, Sanjay Suri has no contribution in the movie as he has nothing to impress. Therefore, those who have already seen Cellular I can afford to never waste your time with this imitation bag.
