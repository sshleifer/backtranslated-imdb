I recently went to a free screen of soap maid where the filmmakers were present. before the movie they stroked around, laughing and taking pictures. I was thrilled to see them dressed in real life and couldn't wait to watch the movie on the big screen. <br /> <br /> During the film, the audience was disturbed by laughter. It was clear to me that they did not laugh at the picture, but on the picture. this is just a class B movie without logic behind it. throw in some nudity, a little blood and whala! you have a movie! <br /> <br /> After the movie, I nurtured a bunch of filmmakers and asked them why they wanted to make this movie. they acted as seriously as they were serious filmmakers. they told me something else: to make a controversial movie, a funny movie, an uplifting movie, a socially responsible movie. everyone mentioned something else. It was clear to me that none of the filmmakers knew what kind of movie they were making and they were now trying to recover their money by publishing this movie as they could to get people to see it. <br /> <br /> Let me warn you: don't buy in the hype! Unless you have nothing else to do, it may be worth the time of the film student to study how a movie should not be made. otherwise you better save two hours in your life.
