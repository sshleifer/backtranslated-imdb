I never understand why when a studio like Universal buys a musical, it strikes it when it comes to the screen. My first thought when we saw Ava Gardner and Robert Walker was the lead, I would see something from MGM that made musicals best at that time. Boy I was wrong and disappointed. <br /> <br /> One Touch Of Venus, who played Mary Martin, Kenny Baker and John Boles on Broadway, ran for 567 performances in the 1943-1945 season and Gardner, Walker and Tom Conway played the roles of Martin, Baker and Boles did on stage. Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash Musically with Book by Nash and S.J. Perelman was a comeback vehicle for Mary Martin, who recovered as Queen of Broadway after a disappointing venture in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Look at the names that went into this show. Considering who was responsible for the book, I expected to see some sparkling humor in this production. Instead, I got a pretty pedestrian script, it was as if all white was drained out of it. Eve Arden does her best to make it play her usual girl Friday role with Tom Conway, but it's even too much for Eva. The story relates to the department store dresser Robert Walker, who kisses a very valuable statue of Venus, jumping to the life of the person of Ava Gardner. Of course, when the statue disappears, Conway shouts for the law and is suspicious of Walker, the last person with the statue. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is Walker, who deals with Gardner, and what will happen to both of them. For reasons I do not understand, Ava was obviously baptized by Eileen Wilson, and Walker only sings a few lines. The song is worn by Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan, who play Walker's friends and colleagues. Of course on Broadway, the songs were made by singers Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. You would think Haymes would play Walker's role at least. It was unfortunate to say the least. Only three songs survived from the score, Don't see now, but my heart shows it is him and the incomparable speaker low. Hayme's silk baritone is most beneficial in Speak Low, which was sold as a duet by Martin and Baker on Broadway. For some reason, the texts of one of the greatest men of the last century verse, Ogden Nash, were transferred by Ann Ronnell. I think the infamous code was at work here. <br /> <br /> In Lee Server's biography of Ava Gardner, he mentions a brief whistle Ava had with Robert Walker when she had spit with her current husband, Howard Duff. When Duff and Gardner reunited, Walker took it badly and didn't even talk to the Gardner off camera. I am sure the fact that both were not in their best work, does not matter either. <br /> <br /> Hopefully, some repertoire companies will make One Touch Of Venus and you'll see the way Weill, Nash and Perelman wrote it.
