I saw the first thing when it came to the theater. Although only 13 at that time, I was an avid reader of "hard science" science fiction stories. The technical gaffes of the movie are burned in my memory. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may have significant spoilers. <br /> <br /> Even as a young, I knew the premise is stupid. The rocket sets off for a moon's mission, in a cosmos, where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (although loose objects flow as in gravity) and because of it, the "cabin" (area of ​​controls, whatever they called it) was gyrostabalized to maintain the "correct" orientation (so that they landed, why did they land on their heads?) and where at least in the nearby room rocket engines were running continuously - with propellant burning away without an oxidizer. When the engine ended, the rocket stopped _dead_ in the room and could not start walking until a PhD chemist determined it needed a small oxidizer. This time, the rocket reminded that it was speeding, and the next thing our heroes know they are near Mars (even a 13-year-old geek knew that such energy would take over 200 days). <br /> <They landed, found the air breathable (although scientific data showed that the pressure, although the atmosphere was pure oxygen, would be too low to do anything good). They decide to camp outside the ship and even build a campfire. They come armed even though they apparently went to the Moon where firearms would not be needed. <br /> <br /> They get a view of a collapsed civilization, encounter stray martians that resemble humans, develop an anti-nuclear war philosophy, and those who survive try to get back to the home plane and die in the attempt of go down to earth! To do so would require such a long cycle period, they would have died of hunger long before they approached their destination. The film prior to that, Destination Moon, used reality most effectively (though their "rescue" with the oxygen tank forgot the moment's arm from the center of gravity of the tank to the exit nozzle). This film showed profound ignorance of even the most basic science. Only the most technologically illiterate should think of it as a science fiction movie: It is on a par with the old Flash Gordon series, where their rockets sailed out of their belly and climbed in spirals and whose engines were always on. <br /> <br /> The story of this one I considered banal, and I can only recommend this as a movie to be shown to the students to be able to choose technical gaffes.
