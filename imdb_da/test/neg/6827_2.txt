I couldn't believe how horrible and boring this Hollywood remake was. It's so terrible. It's landing easily in my top 10 worst movies in 1998. About the only thing it was at stake was Bruce Willis, who was supposed to stick to action movies as a completely emotional killer who would kill his own mother at the right price . But I'd rather listen to Robbie Coltraine speaking American for a week than listening to Richard Geres nauseating Irish accent again. But this movie is also impossible, unconvincing, uneven, unexciting, unimpressive and landing Sidney Poiter in a rubbish to make a possible career comeback.One for film-role-footie purposes altogether.
