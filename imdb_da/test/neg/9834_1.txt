Okay ... for the most part, and all his cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for a MST3K flick ... but then they decided to destroy what little goodness it had about fifteen minutes before the end. * SPOILER ALERT * The film is very basic ... A real mother's mother named Danny meets a bam named Bix, and the two travel to a small town where Bix meets a beautiful girl named Carrie (who is so much. ) Now, the basic premise of this movie seems promising enough. All they had to do was follow the simple chemistry of any romantic movie ... Carrie loves Bix ... Bix loves Carrie ... a creepy guy in town lusts to Carrie ... Now I know what you're thinking. .. Bix fights creeps and ultimately decides to settle with Carrie, and Danny returns home and they all happily ever after ... right? WRONG!! Because Carrie is murdered by the city, creeps because Bix is ​​too gay to commit. (There are so many gay undertones between Danny and Bix.) And then the whole city decides to lynch Bix, even though the city is creeping, it would have easily been the main addict. Then the city manger admits to killing Carrie without much hesitation ... (must have been bad, the bad dope.) Danny brings Bix home with him ... it's the movie's "happily ever after." Sad, huh? All I can say is thank God for Joel and Bots. Because they made this horse hockey one of my favorite MST3K episodes.
