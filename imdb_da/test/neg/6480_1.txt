I hardly know where to start. Big continuity problems, bad plays, etc. For example, Sam must be far from anyone, but you can see the ski slopes cut into the mountain next to his head. <br /> <br /> But the most fundamental problem is that the essence of the book, Sam's adventurous, paves the way to improving his entire family, not even touched. Instead, in the film, he becomes the cross of his family and leaves his wealthy parents alone, and when he gets tired of it, he goes home. Where is his development? Where's the bow? <br /> <br /> If you've never read the book and can get through hokey 60isms (double / triple / quadruple visions of the falcon) and horrible production quality (crackling, ahem, fire, winter winds stop their howling for the dialog and restart, etc.) I think it * can * be OK for an 8 year old. <br /> <br /> But compared to the sophisticated book, it's a terrible disappointment. <br /> <br /> Read the book instead.
