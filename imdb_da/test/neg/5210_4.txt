Director Nico Mastorakis has made a cynical cash grabber (by his own admission) who is too cynical to impress anyone, but a sophomore genre fan. <br /> <br /> The most extreme, confrontational genre pics, to rewrite a character in VIDEODROME, "has a philosophy"; That's what makes them dangerous. <br /> <br /> The DEAD'S DEAD philosophy is to throw many "shocking" elements into a cinematic mix and stir slowly. The result is a dish without taste but a nasty appearance. <br /> <br /> Not to be confused with Serrador's brilliant WHO CAN CAN DO A CHILDREN? Mastoraki's efforts put themselves on a Greek island, which is a stage for various forms of slaughter, a small bestiality and some wholesale conservation. Everything goes at a sneaky pace and violent sets of pieces are badly aligned. <br /> <br /> Exclaimed as "The movie the censors didn't want you to see," I would risk the censors never saw it, they simply read the press box until the knees moved up.
