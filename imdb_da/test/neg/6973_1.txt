Whew! What can you say about this bizarre, stupefying mock-u mentory about Ed Woods cross-dressing fantasies ?? Well, a word that comes to mind is incoherent! Wood uses raw plates of innocent, random stock footage and then builds a "story" around them - and what a story !! Thread even stars like Glen, an ordinary Joe who just happens to enjoy lounging around in his fiancee lingerie and sweaters. I think what Wood wanted was a claim of tolerance for all the world's glens by showing that Glen is just like all of us below, only in Angora. Ummm ... ok. But then we get this very bizarre montage of some horny devils, a chicken in cramped, some rude, pointing to people, some moore stock footage and finally an exhausted Bela Lugusi, who plays a kind of twisted, invalid doll forces. Lugosi is a shelf that plays such nonsense as "Beeevaaare ... Beeeg Greeeen Dragon" that looks at your door: Han eeeets leeetle boys, puppy and tail and beeeeeg snails! "Um, ok, Bela ...: = 8 / There is a strange, twisted type of logic going on here. Then he reminds us that" 7 out of 10 men carry hats and 7 out of 10 men are bald ". Hmmm, must be the foreign / cross-dressing / habidashery cowspiracy thang !! Glen or Glenda stars are an abundance (what it is ...) of reliable Wood Schlock actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller and Timothy Farrell, and Wood manages to coax every miserable, amateurish non-talent out of everybody, now everyone knows Bela's sad story: when Wood used him for this tab, he was probably jonesing for another fix and needed the moolah, but even for him one of MooCow's favorite wood mooments comes with stock footage charging buffalo scene - it's sooo loopily demented !! MooCow says "Puuuull de schtriiiiings" and git yer hooves on a copy of Glen or Glenda - you won't believe it !: ??
