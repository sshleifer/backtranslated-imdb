I really enjoyed the "Candid Camera" with Dom DeLuise and I was surprised to see that after the years Suzanne Somers has been co-starred by the show. But it was the only positive side of the show - the whole studio, the intro, the hosts - all that gives the new meaning to the word "pompous". It would be ok if materials were not so cr * ppy - I mean, come on, the best thing you can do is show a few men who have trouble getting ketchup out of the bottle, Suzanne Somers goes with Halloween basket in July , ice cream that only sells vanilla ...? I've seen few episodes and each time it was terrible. They made it the biggest show ever, and then the time with scenes fills so boring that I really felt embarrassed to see. Even the people in them so bored and it just can't be good.
