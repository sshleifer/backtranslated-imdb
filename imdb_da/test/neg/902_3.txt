Some movies are off-beat but fun, but many movies are just fun numbingly weird. "Motorama" does not fit so well in the latter category. Many seem to like it because of endless guest conditions and a total lack of meaning, but these two things can only take a movie so far, and "Motorama" simply has no other benefits on its credit. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" attaches great importance to plot unlikely. Its main character, Gus, is a 10-year-old cussing on a road trip across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces to win $ 500 million. When interacting with adult figures, none of them seems to be concerned or worried that he is 10 years old. In the beginning it is incredibly fun, but it quickly gets too incredible, especially considering the people he runs into and the fact that he seems so untouched by many of the disturbing (to age) imagery going on around him. Gus has no depth, and as an anti-hero who has no problem causing misery to others to get his game pieces, it is hard to be sad when he encounters problems. <br /> <br /> There are problems with a killing of guest appearance, each mistreating Gus in more and more strange ways. Besides making the already worn plot even more incredible and less fun, the characters share Gus's lack of depth and are just as immense. The character's actions may be a little interesting, but the actors themselves do not add anything to them, thus negating the whole point of getting big names (they could have been played by someone and the sign would have been the same). These guest appearances seem to have been signed more for markup than anything else. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" should be interesting - it's a unique idea, but there's little point in the script for it to work. Events that should have a lasting impact on anti-hero and viewer do not go as the film quickly moves from incident to event, hoping that something will make the audience feel sad or understanding of Gus. It never happens because there is nothing that can connect, it just goes back and forth as on a conveyor belt, an event after another. With a story that is so unmanageable, it ceases to be fun, and a protagonist who never develops to look after himself or anyone at a higher level does not have much to offer "Motorama" except that one abruptly sneaks around and tries to get rich. Why should we worry about it?
