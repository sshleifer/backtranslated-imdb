This so-called movie is horrible! The actors can't act. There is no plot. I think they should start from scratch and film again. I hope they can correct the malfunctioning of this movie. I want to see the trailer when they shoot it again. Maybe there is hope for it. I'm not out to hurt emotions, but I think high school kids can do a better job. The wardrobe could have been much better. Sorry, but it just didn't make me. I usually enjoy the trailers from this site, but ... I can't find this entertaining. I hope they take criticism well because I think they will get much more from others with regard to this movie.
