The final framework of the original "American Graffiti" provides a line-up of the fate of the movie's four key men. While it was somewhat sexist to omit the female characters, the end of the original movie provided all the information about the people who even the most fiery fan of the movie would have. However, someone felt that mega-bucks could be made by detailing the sad lives of these characters after the original movie ended. Bad movement. Making an insurance salesman and his wife, a nerdy private in Vietnam, a wooden sled driver and an overgrown hippie for interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this almost unmatched movie. While most of the original cast is back, with only Richard Dreyfuss having the good sense of staying away, "More American Graffiti" is a mess of stupid situations involving protests, car racing, country singers and the Vietnam War. The use of split screens, which once thought innovative and bold, was used here for the distraction point, adding confusion to the already confused goings one. This is a sequel that shows almost everything that can go wrong with a successor. Perhaps it should be screened in film schools as a lesson. Even the use of period music, which was a joy in the original, is poorly done here. If you want more "American Graffiti", see the original twice.
