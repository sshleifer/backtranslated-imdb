I will be honest and say I gave up seeing it somewhere midway and so fast forward with a few breaks. then I came back here and read many of the reviews already made .... maybe I'm just and I can't help it, but this cartoon for North American society seems to have a purpose with "Let's save them from themselves ", and Iraq comes to mind immediately. It seems to me that this is a reason for or part of another "good intent" invasion. <br /> <br /> The lady for me seems like a self-falsified person, and I was frankly annoyed at her portrait trying to pity and "feel" for her. Well in this case, it can never happen because, like a history teacher has already mentioned here, I need to know how her family was so above average, manage to keep it (if they play both sides maybe?) and send her to Paris !? Now, if it would have been done after a poor girl's biography, I could see myself with certain feelings. but as it stands + its release time, it's just plain propaganda film; Even worse, since the cartoon, it leaves the "soft" side of things too good for itself to be taken seriously. In addition, there are these clich√©s about homosexuals. Well, a woman struggling to win her rights shouldn't have at least some compassion for underdogs in society like her ??? the message is, of course, indulgent of a ruling class member's view. <br /> <br /> I give it only 2 stars because its production and related stuff. a propaganda film has, of course, interests in convincing manipulate my thoughts and is therefore generally well-pleasing to certain visual feelings that I cannot deny, I may have.
