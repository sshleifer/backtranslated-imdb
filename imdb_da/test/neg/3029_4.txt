Someone remembers docudrama THREADS? It's a drama documentary that shocked Britain in September 1984. While I wasn't exactly entertained by Mick Jackson's nuclear holocaust horror movie, I could respect it. Unfortunately, I cannot respect this docudrama broadcast 20 years later, dealing with terrorists who release a radioactive dirty bomb in the center of London. <br /> <br /> The problem I have with it is that director Daniel Percival's production values ​​are far too good as it would actually have benefited quite cheap production values. The cinematography is fantastic, but in this type of speculative drama do we need excellent and well-informed Oscars standard filmography? What we certainly do not need is a musical score as the survivors of the wind slowly stumble out of the smoke. We also do not need vaguely familiar cast members. Does anyone sit there asking himself "Hey what was he in? I know that face" several times? I know I did, and it is very distracting. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest production error with DIRTY WAR is that someone decided to turn it into a docudrama with too much stylistic emphasis on the drama. In THREADS, the action cuts away from action in Sheffield umpteen times and becomes a version of HORIZON about the effects of nuclear war before being put back to the fictitious protagonists again, and THREADS is very effective because of this. Here, the presented information tightens the drama that drowns in exponential and completely convincing dialogue. The signs in the teleplay are not really signs, they are just cyphere there to inform the audience what happens when radioactive material explodes. It would have been better for the action to cut captions to convey this type of information ala THREADS. The worse is that the director Daniel Percival used the same technique as seen in THREADS a few years ago with his docudrama on cups. He should have used the same style with DIRTY WAR <br /> <br /> I should also put my cards on the table and say that while I don't consider most Muslims, they are terrorists, I get a little tired of television productions like HAMBURG CELL, GRID and DIRTY WAR must point out this fact to me by brushing my head with what is typical for the shutdown of PC attitudes in television companies today <br /> <br /> I managed to miss studio debate, as Bob mentions here, but I've also heard it discussed elsewhere, and I can't help believing it does better viewing than DIRTY WAR itself with its elated arguments between different factions of the political spectrum. If DIRTY WAR is remembered twenty years from now (It is very unlikely that I know it) it may well be remembered for the discussion, it caused more than anything else
