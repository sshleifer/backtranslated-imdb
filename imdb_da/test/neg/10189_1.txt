After a good start, it turned out to be the worst part of rather than you propaganda I've ever seen. This movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad about not reading the "holy bible". <br /> <br /> To resume ... OK let's call it a plot ... Basically do not emit abduct people (as we already know ..). No, in fact its demonic forces are abducted by people who are in new age or witchcraft, or are reading porn magazines (as a protagonist does). It is complete with the little emotional piano music when the protagonist realizes he must blindly follow Christ to be saved. <br /> <br /> A quote sums it all up, imagine a subtle piano music in the background: "You can't let others, even those you love, stop you from following Lord .." <br /> < br /> and we must live in an enlightened age ... still work to do. Boycott this piece of crap
