John Travolta represents his role as Chili Palmer, Hollywood gangster who is now turning to the music industry. He tries to run an independent record label with the wife of a murdered friend played by Uma Thurman, and tries to get his young singer (Christina Milian) a hit record. <br /> <br /> Before I saw this sequel, I had heard it was a horrible movie. But Be Cool is still an enjoyable comedy, although it is not as good as the original. The film focuses on the music industry this time instead of the film industry. The music industry is exhibited very poorly in the film and they use a bunch of lame stereotypes. I can't tell if it was the intention or not since Get Shorty did a good job of forging the film industry. The same cannot be said for the successor, and the trials just come as lazy. <br /> <br /> An impressive cast is what saves the movie from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock, and it's nice to see him in another form of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a fun performance, though he started to get annoying before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives an average performance and I expected more from her. John Travolta returns as Chili, and he does an okay job. However, his performance is a bit boring. Christina Milian gives a terrible performance, and she is not so good at a singer either. Cedric the Entertainer gives a good performance even though he is not in the movie for a very long time. There are also a bunch of comos, including Steven Tyler and James Wood. <br /> <br /> F. Gary Gray leads and he does a bad job. He doesn't handle the movie really well, and the movie is a bit messy. There was also a ton of product placement and it became annoying after a while. Also in 118 minutes, the film is too long and there are many slow spots. The movie had to be edited badly and it was clearly not. Fortunately for the movie, the actors are able to rise over weak directions and script and they deliver some fun scenes. Sometimes the movie tried too hard while other times it was actually quite fun. Compared to the original, the successor does not measure up well. But being Cool is a rather harmless and forgetful comedy. In the end, Be Cool is worth renting and that's it. Rating 6/10
