Short marital infidelity comes back to haunt loving wife Grace Needham (depicted by the ever-sexy Nastasia Kinski). <br /> <br /> She had left the city and her depressing husband to go on a trip to sunny Miami, where she was persecuted and ultimately seduced by Julian Grant, a beautifully evil and manipulative manager who is prominent very good by William Baldwin (why do all the Baldwin brothers play bad people so badly?) <br /> <br /> Grace's seduction took place as the two drank champagne on a deserted beach, they reached privately by sailboat. Grace admitted that she drank too much for her own good and revealed the many problems in her marriage. Julian got his trust by claiming that he would never allow such problems to arise if he had a relationship with Grace. Julian's manipulation continued as he described a "lost at sea" fantasy that involved the now unimpeded grace that sat near and listened to every word and became increasingly engaged with its romantic dream. His manipulation was paid off as a few subtle nudges led to Grace's soft kiss, stopped immediately by her pulling back as if suddenly thinking of herself "What am I doing? I'm a wife. I'm a mother. I have a real life. True responsibility. Sure, the two of us have talked about being together, lost at sea, but it's just a fantasy. Look at what we're doing here. The consequences are real. We're really alone on a secluded beach. let this imagination really happen? '<br /> <br /> She dreams of the dream when her kiss became more passionate, the once guarded Grace, who used to respond to men's bills by saying "I'm married" enjoyed on when Julian snapped on her shirt, resulting in more kisses, body pain and her climbing on Julian's lap! She smiles, kisses, groans, laughs and often looks up to the sun all over, unfortunately, a short love scene where everyone seemed to have most of their clothes on. <br /> <br / > While I thoroughly enjoyed the appearance of illegal passion on Grace's face as the once devoted wife was thoroughly satisfied with having sex with a man who clearly enjoys manipulating others, I would say that it was not at all the case with the film's "R" rating. /> <br /> Julian came home to find her husband rejuvenated by his securing a high paying job, and she is excited to return to a normal life where she can again be a loving wife and caring mother. br /> <br /> But the evil Julian Grant reinvents the image and is not willing to give up so easily on Grace. Grace has a plan to clear his life in Julian, but will it work? <br /> <br /> Of course, I won't ruin the remaining story line for you. However, I would say that I always enjoy movies involving sexual affection of a wife (especially when she exhibits unobstructed attraction and behavior normally reserved for her husband), but in fact seeks revenge against the opponent. This movie would have been much, much better if the movie had included more of it in history. My feelings are if the movie brings it up, then the movie must finish it. And this movie certainly brought it up. Unfortunately, some limitations in the narrative line prevented this from being significantly persecuted. There are many other movies available that succeed at that very point and I will include their titles in the "recommendations" section of this section. I am also open to receiving email suggestions from other films that include a good storyline that involves sexual appreciation from an apparently affectionate wife. All in all, Nastassja Kinski and William Baldwin are both very good. The movie is not.
