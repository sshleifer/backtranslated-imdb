Is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating? Because this one deserves it. While I'm not a big fan of Jane Austen's books, I sat here with two women who are. Well, at least we had a big laugh about how bad this movie is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with any charisma on the whole, even though he overdone what he usually does (almost as bad as William Shatner). But it was not enough to save this stink from total mind. It is often difficult to separate the girl's dream sequences from what really "happens" and so many gaps remain in history that one can hardly figure out what's going on. Too many loose ends and the end feel like a "tune in again next week" climax. The leading actress is too ditsy and weird to be a heroine, the leading man is too stubborn and seems to be a compelling hero, and the music sounds like a kind of cheap, innovative pet project by the director's hippy daughter ??? mixed in with some kind of spacey operational women's war?). So at last I suggest you blow the budget and order a DVD from it as soon as possible. Especially if you like disappointment.
