I thought the movie was underpair. The action was good, but not great, the story was fun, but didn't come that way. The director dropped the ball on this movie. It wasn't James (jim) or tea. IMHO it was the music that killed it. There is a scene where things go down the hill and Jonny Cash music plays - man was that depressing (not fun) killed my mood. Then the film could not recover. The expulsion scene had a potentially fun situation, good play, well-created - I tasted myself, but the music was again unsuitable for the stage. The music prevented me from being drawn into the movie. <br /> <br /> I say it had potential but was poorly finished, I would even say rushed into the final production. Kind of reminiscent of the sermon of the exorcist: the beginning. The theater release was good, but after seeing it, but I watched the movie release exorcist: I saw a helluva much better. Same story just second director. The same must happen here.
