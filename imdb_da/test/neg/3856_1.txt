One of my friends who has a mysterious talent for finding and - horror! - I think bad movies are recommended that I see 'The Pest'. At that time, unaware of how truly pathetic his taste in film was, I decided to try it. <br /> <br /> A bad mistake. The story, though clearly ripped straight out of every sixth grade English textbook as far as the manhunter theme goes, would be entertaining under the right conditions - good actors, writer, instructor, wardrobe, etc. and so on to almost no end. Obviously, these factors are absent. <br /> <br /> "The pest must be fun, I think. I say "think" because I don't let more than a little smile break across the movie. Not a guffaw, not a laugh, not a chuckle, not even a laugh. A smile at best. And it rarely happened while I watched this movie, I remember how often I smiled - maybe 3 or 4 times at best. So do yourself a huge favor. Never watch this movie. Avoid at all costs.
