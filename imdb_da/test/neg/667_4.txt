Eight teenage prisoners are brought to the abandoned Blackwell Hotel to clean it out as community service. They soon discover that it is the home of a cavernopathy (Kane) who has a thing to pull out and collect eyeballs. It does not help that the guard looks over them (Steven Vidler) has had an earlier entry with the animal four years earlier. <br /> <br /> A guilty pleasure of mine is slasherfilm. Most of them are poorly directed and acted, but they still have some appeal and entertainment value. See No Evil is a good example of this. It has scary writing and acting, but death scenes are pretty good, and the movie turns out to be entertaining. The premise sounds like a mix between Friday 13th, Case 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea, but it didn't work too well. It was really just a bunch of clich√©s, and everything was predictable. Screenwriter Dan Madigan just focused on death scenes and nothing else apparently. The death scene itself is pretty good and cruel. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and he came up with some creative killings. <br /> <br /> The action is rather bland and unremarkable. That's because all the characters are one-dimensional, and we don't know much about them. It was hard to feel for these people because they were pretty unlikely. Kane is surprisingly mediocre. I was expecting his on-screen presence to be scary, but he didn't do a job well. Another rate Jason Voorhees if you want. The rest of the actors are relatively unknown, and this movie is unlikely to help or hurt their career. <br /> <br /> While death scenes are gory, they are not necessary scary. There really is no excitement just some gory death scenes. Because of this, the film does not hold much of a repeat value. Also, if you don't like slasher movies then don't waste your time with this one. It will do little to change your mind. Finally, See No Evil is a decent slasher movie, but it's generic and forgettable, so it's not exactly worth seeing. Rating 6/10
