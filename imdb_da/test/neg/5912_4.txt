1989 was already a year when Eddie Murphy was not so hot and started making movies that would soon be forgotten. It was also the year that Murphy made his first film, but it would also be the first and last experiment. "Harlem nights" was not exactly what you can call a success, even though it was great to see the two best black comedians together, Murphy and Richard Pryor. Don't blame the actors as they all played their roles as you expected them to do, even if you have to face (again) the typical Murphy grin. The worst thing about "Harlem nights" is both the scenario and its horrible decors. Everything is set in the roaring twenties and everyone has their profits from the forbidden clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adopted son Quickie (Murphy) easily collect $ 10,000 a day, but of course, the mob and the corrupt police come around the corner to claim their portion of the cake. Sugar and Quickie are not guys who give their money for free and have their own plans. You can see "Harlem Nights", that's for sure, but if you snooze from the moment you hear the name Murphy, you better avoid it since after all this movie is nothing but a bad excuse to see some good jokes.
