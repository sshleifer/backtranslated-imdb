It is unfortunate that many of the other critics of this movie seem to be influenced by prior disturbances. (ie anger on gay characters, thinking French thrillers are bad, etc.) I will admit that I am not familiar with the novel, but as a movie, after approx. 45 minutes, I rolled my eyes. hopefully I can explain my complaints in writing well enough in writing before I get sick to spend more time on this movie over 2 hours of running. (2 hours that felt like 3) do not understand me, I can sit for an hour and a half silent movie, 3 hour epics, I do not have a short attention span, nor am I so affected by mtv generation that I do not can appreciate a subtle and slow-building movie. go here, my grocery list of complaints. First off, the end. yes, it had a scooby-doo-esquire, the sign explains everything at the end. now I actually think of this movie, it was necessary .. the film had so many plot twists, emotional revelations, new facts surface and was discovered. A reviewer said it well: "... it's a very logical story, but without the very important back story (their childhood stories, the relationship between the 3 parents, the relationship between the two lovebirds and Big Man's son), it just doesn't feel right. felt cheated "i won" i threw in too many spoilers here, i could mention specific revelations which i thought were unnecessary, but according to the reviews here there are many people who seem to love this really so i will not give anything away "I personally can't stand soap operas. The complexity, and the twists, for me, snuffed out any effect the final revelations could possibly deliver. At the end it didn't matter to me! There were no gaping plot holes necessarily; it looked like it could make a big book, in WRITING it is quite logical, but if I believe this is REALITY, something is not right with the pieces that are randomly inserted, too often I felt important characters we could never get to know were thrown in to further complicate the plot, increase the feeling and develop the mystery. The actor I had no complaints about, steering, eh, not bad, but the reason, and especially its development, is largely lacking. Excuse those who felt this was a perfect thriller, but I couldn't get into it. I gave this a 3 simply because I didn't want to seem completely unfair and it had moments of little intrigue and excitement. <br /> <br /> * MAJOR SPOILER * and I have to mention it ... but when Dad makes his revelation to Alexander and just when you think the plot could not fit into another twist .. "Your father didn't I die in a hunting accident. "I almost died ... when did the father ever develop or even really mention much in the back story? !! are you serious!! as the already complex plot involving characters from all families and their relationship with each other, was it not enough !!? Does the protagonist need another emotional puppy more than he has already fed? sorry i had to throw in such a spoiler, but it disturbed me just as much as I have ever been bothered by any movie.
