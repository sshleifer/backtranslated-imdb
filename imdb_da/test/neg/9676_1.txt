NBC was ashamed. I wouldn't allow my kids to see this. I would definitely tell my church to stay away. This movie is proof of why NBC has always been a 3rd rate network. Producers, actors and writers should kneel down and pray for God's forgiveness to do this work of fiction. There were no pirates. Noah's wife did not parade on the deck of the sheet. The sheets had no deck. Much was not even born when this event took place. Does anyone associated with this project try to read the Bible? More than two animals of each type were taken. Read the story in Genesis. How can anyone bring this to any screen, small or big!
