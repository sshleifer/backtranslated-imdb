This short topic is a remake of the Three Stooges '1942 movie "What is Matador?", About the boys' trip to Mexico and their bullfighting adventure. Although the original card was made during Stooges' peak period, it's not that memorable, and I think it's one of the more mediocre movies with Curly Howard. <br /> <br /> After finding out, I think "Sappy Bullfighters" is just pathetically horrible, just like any other shorts with Joe Besser. Moe and Larry should never have hired Besser because his whiny, almost feminine character was completely wrong for Stooges violent comedy. His 16 films with Moe and Larry marked nadir for the team and those shorts are embarrassing to see. This short was released in 1959 and was the team's swan song with Columbia. Maybe Besser was a good guy, but he was all wrong as the third stooge. I will not review several Besser shorts, for I would just give the same scathingly negative review again and again. Make yourself a great service and not see it here. Instead, try to catch "In the Sweet Pie and Pie" or "Hoi Polloi".
