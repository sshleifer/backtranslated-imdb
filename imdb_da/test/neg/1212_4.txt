I loved this movie 10 years ago when I was about 16 years old. My biggest mistake was to see it again, 10 years later. It's not the worst "I-wanna-be-a-pilot" movie ever, but it has so many flaws in it that you almost can't see them. <br /> <br /> The Queen's "One Vision" (along with the rest of the soundtrack) makes this movie better than the average patriotic nonsense you normally see;) <br /> <br /> [*** * ------]
