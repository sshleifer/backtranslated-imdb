Much praise has become lavish on Farscape, but I don't think it's so good. It certainly has a distinctive character, but it lacks everything else: history, purpose, direction, excitement; you name it. I'm a big sci-fi fan, and I make it a point to see all the sci-fi shows I can. I have almost completed Farscape's four seasons, and at this point I'm not very happy. The show has some good things - especially Claudia Black (who unfortunately lacks from the first episodes in season four) - but they are very few and very far between. On the whole, the show is confused by many very stupid things (such as fantasy items rather than SF ditto), and many many episodes, esp. in season four is indescribably cluttered and very poorly structured. And you just feel that it doesn't go anywhere. It's mostly just non-directional experiences with thin, long-running plot lines that develop carefully slowly. Well, sometimes it's a little tighter, but it only lasts a few episodes at a time. <br /> <br /> Effectively, there are a few impressive things here and there (especially in space, occasionally), but the show sticks in the same style with effects that honestly grow old quickly. Outlandish and unconvincing puppet aliens mar the show quite a bit and I have come to prefer (at all) the episodes where regular human characters are the focus. I think the peacekeepers are by far the most stylish and exciting and interesting characters on the show; they succeed in being a convincing foreign culture, in spite of their very human appearance. There are a few really cool episodes with them, esp. in the first season (IIRC), where Crichton masks as a peacekeeping captain, invading and eventually destroying one of their secret bases. Such episodes can reach a rating of 8 out of 10, but I cannot assign the show as a whole more than a "4" rating. <br /> <br /> Apart from peacekeepers (who themselves are for single-mindedly totalitarian and militaristic to become truly nuanced), the exhibit simply does not show anything important or important to know or want to see. OTOH, it contains some good ideas and is not a total loss. <br /> <br /> This is just my opinion, of course, but as an experienced sci-fi fan I think it counts and can help others. There aren't many good sci-fi shows out there; but Star Trek (any series) and especially the new Battlestar Galactica is definitely better than Farscape. But if you're a big fan of mediocre sci-fi shows, you also like Farscape. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4 out of 10.
