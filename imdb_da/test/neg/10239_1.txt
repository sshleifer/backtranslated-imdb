I've seen several scene and movie adaptations of Alice in Wonderland, and this one has to take the cake as the absolute worst. My family bought the DVD unsuspectingly and couldn't even do it through the first half. I went back later and forced myself to see the whole thing (it had been a Christmas gift to me) and was just shaken. <br /> <br /> The only redeeming factor (and it's hardly redeeming enough to save the whole show) is Mark Lin-Baker playing Mock Turtle with a Yiddish accent. It is one of the few moments in the play that has some real charm and can be taken seriously. Apart from that, the songs are half songs, the melodies are half melodies, and even Meryl Streep can't make this direction look good.
