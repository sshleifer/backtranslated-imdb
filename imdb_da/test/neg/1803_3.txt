The movie's adaptation of the Heart of Darkness is disappointing, both as a movie and as a representation of Joseph Conrad's classic story. <br /> <br /> There are several small differences between the book and the movie, but it is expected in every book for film transition. Kurtz dies at another place; The manager is not following Marlow on his journey; Kurtz's mistress spends much more time with him than in history. The real problem is the amount of footage recorded in the movie, but has no basis in the current story. For some reason, the instructor finds the need to "spice up" some of the scenes, add drama or actions that rarely make sense and are always insignificant to the story. Some examples that come to mind are Kurtz's "mistress" who beats Marlow's head and knocks him out. Nothing happens while he's unconscious, and Marlow didn't even trigger the attack. A couple of hours pass and he wakes up: a total waste of time. Kurtz has a jawbea who, for some random reason, kills on a whim. Also, when Marlow leaves Kurtz station, he makes the "noble" decision to leave all the priceless ivory he had achieved without any real reason. Another mistake is Kurtz's character. John Malkovich is a terrible choice to play the man described as high and inspiring: a man with an upcoming presence. He whispers almost all his lines, which in a more accomplished actor's hands could have been very thoughtful. I can't remove the picture of John Malkovich, who plays a mentally handicapped farmhand in Of Mus and Men, when I look at him, crushes Kurtz's role. Over all I would rate the movie in 3 out of 10 stars. It's a great movie if you've read the book and want to watch it in film, maybe to help you show the scenes, but as a source of entertainment, I'd never recommend it.
