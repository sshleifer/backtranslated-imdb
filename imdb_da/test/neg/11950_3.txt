Go to the video store and download the original. I don't understand why Hollywood needs to take a perfect foreign movie and re-insert it. "Most Martha" or "Bella Martha" has a much better cast. Beginning with heroine Martina Gedeck, who convinced me much more in the role of the work-based perfectionist than the more famous Catherine Zeta Jones, the Italian chef and niece suddenly deprived his mother and forced to live with an aunt, not suitable for child rearing. <br /> <br /> In many ways, the American version of the movie is a copy of the German original. They just exchanged the actors. But they also changed the story because it would have been difficult and not very credible to realize a father of the little girl in an American context. <br /> <br /> I was thinking about it. Maybe the father could have been Puerto Rican, or Cuban or Mexican. Well, there are so many "guest workers" in the United States. Choose your choice. But I doubt any of them would have been liable for the responsibility the Italian father made in the original. That is why the American film leaves that part, but keeps the Italian chef. And by doing this, the whole story changes. In the original "Martha" is so removed from the reality that she thinks it's okay to send off her niece with a very foreign in a foreign country. <br /> <br /> The American "Martha" is softer and therefore the movie is sweeter and does not have the edge of the German movie. <br /> <br /> In the original, the "Italian" chef is not that nice but much more charming, the little girl is more of a steep but much more credible and "Martha" is more representative of a career woman of today world than the dimmed version we are presented in the American version. And the whole opera music in the American version was very annoying. I loved the Italian songs in the original and bought the CD. <br /> <br /> Hollywood acknowledged that "Mostly Martha" was a great movie. Perhaps the distribution companies should have put it in several theaters, or it should have been shown in English without subtitles. In any case, the original is so much better. That way, it reminds me of another remake. "Should we dance" is one of my favorites in the original Japanese version and completely forgettable in the American version.
