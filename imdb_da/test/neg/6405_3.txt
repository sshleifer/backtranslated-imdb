One would make you think that this game is about a man obsessed with a number. It's probably an interesting topic - can a person become so obsessed with something marginal as a simple figure that he totally loses in touch with reality and becomes hopelessly wild and paranoid? <br /> <br /> Well, maybe someone will make a movie about it sometime. Unfortunately, this one has nothing to do with the above, never mind what trailers (or even the movie itself) want you to believe in. I would like to say that this number is only a MacGuffin, but it's not even that. It's meaningless. A gimmick. A tavern to the unsuspecting audience. <br /> <br /> What is the movie about? A dog catcher (Carrey) who is obsessed with a cheesy noir crime book because he feels somehow reflects his own life. There. Certainly, the character of book detective fingerling (sigh) - is (for some reason) obsessed with number 23, and Carrey himself becomes obsessed and begins to see the number everywhere .. but it is just padding and completely irrelevant to the story. In fact, you can cut out all 23 references and have the main character (s) occupied about cheese or something and you get the same story. It is painfully obvious that all "23" things written in the waay after the story was already finished, rejected and sent to "rewrite". <br /> <br /> Which would be OK .. I guess .. if the movie wasn't boring, boring and boring. Half of the movie is told, to chrissakes. You don't see the movie you're listening to Jim Carrey, who tells the movie. Ca. a quarter in Carrey begins reading the book, and from then on to the terrible clich√© ends, we are forced to see "real" scenes from the dog catcher's life (where nothing happens) mixed with told artsy film noir-ish " Book "scenes that will either leave you snickering or just depressed. It's like a poor man's "Sin City" with all the violence cut out, told by Carrey and shown in slow motion. Ugh. <br /> <br /> This is a simple case of a C movie script that somehow gets filmed with an A movie cast .. probably because of the "number 23" hook that I Assume sounding exciting enough on paper to guarantee premium Hollywood treatment. But since - as I have already said - the film is about number 23 as much as cheese production in Switzerland, one cannot feel anything but cheated. <br /> <br /> I give the "Fingerling movie" 3 out of 10 because I assumed it did not offend my intelligence as much as "Forsaken" did or made me purely suicidal as "Battlefield Earth" did and bottom of the scale must be reserved for abominations like them. But don't fear, it's still a beautiful miserable flick.
