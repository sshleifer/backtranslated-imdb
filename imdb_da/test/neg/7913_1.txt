This movie is very scary with scenes where the devil uses Gabriel's horn to open the sky and pull out the good angel dogs and regret them at Alkatraz. The devil sings and dances to a few songs about the joy of being bad, and at one time eats a live rat. <br /> <br /> We got this movie free with a pizza. You get what you pay for.
