I have to say I found this movie very disappointing. Yes, I know Maltin gave it 3 1/2 and others think very much about it. But, the opera sequences were god-horrible. I take it Jeannete MacDonald is an acquired taste. Yes, in the short sequences I've seen her with Nelson Eddy, she's immensely preferable to him. But on your own ... God, I don't like opera and despise operetta, and she's pretty much unacceptable. At one point I had to cover my ears. Gable is just OK, and Tracy is thrown away. The reason is annoying in JM never just tells Gable, she loves him and the opera and why can't she both? Instead, she suffers silently (or not) with the compromises she makes. The support molding is clearly unmemorable. Besides the star three and Jack Holt (and I assume his mother), they are all just background and forgettable. The EQ sequence is the only thing that stores the movie. And just. Yes, it's pretty spectacular and moving. But "Oh God is great" seems very constructed. I prefer immensely "In Old Chicago" as far as ancient disaster goggles go. Save yourself on this one.
