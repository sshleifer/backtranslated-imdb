This film is a completely inaccurate depiction of Noah's Ark's real story. The producers have probably not even read the Bible. This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Noah's wife was never mentioned by name in the Bible, but the film's authors "gave" her name to Naama. This film shows the destruction of Sodom a good 1000 years before it happened and what about Gamorrah? It was also destroyed while Sodom was. (Perhaps the producers thought that they did not include Gamorrah in history and show the city "Sodom" as in you-what-what would increase more eyebrows.) This film is totally skewed and mocks God and the Bible. It is strange that every true Christian wants to participate in the production of this eerie, hideous, forged blasphemy of the Bible.
