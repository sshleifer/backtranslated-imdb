... if only Disney had stayed away from it. Look, I think this movie has some potential. Well, the main character's situation does at least. Get out of the whole Jordan Cahill thing and you have the beginning of a decent movie! Of course you also lose more than half of the movie, but oh yes. Not so much loss. <br /> <br /> So here it goes: You take a typical preppy, suburban teenage girl (Danielle Panabaker, who is actually a decent actress) whose best friends screech a lot, mostly over a "pop sensation" (I Assume that it is a direct quote from the movie, as film almost always involves the phrase in question, named Jordan Cahill. Except, of course, TPSTG wants more out of life. Enter Brenda Song's character, a sophisticated person who is just what TPSTG needs (honestly, I don't care about the real name of the character, I like the acronym better). The two new friends go to see Jordan Cahill (one to drive, one to make fun of the fun ones) and they come out of it with his mobile phone. Hijinks are followed, and everything turns out in order in the end. <br /> <br /> If only Disney or a major movie studio for that matter didn't have such a low opinion from 8 to 14 years old. Or maybe if 8 to 14 year olds expected a little more out of the movies targeted at them. It is sugar-coated crap like this that makes me more than a little unsure of who should be more disgusted (a small movie called "High School Musical" comes to mind ...)
