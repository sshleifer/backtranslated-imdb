Just to save $ 3 or what it costs to rent movies on your local video store, and the on-going time-and-though-long-this-movie is here a simple plan. Go over to a friend's house, tell them to rent The Pest for you, see the first 30 seconds or so, and then make a little excuse to leave. The opening sequence is really fun, definitely worth seeing. Unfortunately, the other 99% of the movie is horrible. Without the shower stage in the beginning, this is one of the worst movies all the time.
