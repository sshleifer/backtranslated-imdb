I have experienced some horrors of cinema. For the past few years, it seems that manufacturers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity. Hannibal was not an exception. I didn't expect much when I went in to see the movie. The book was ridiculous, and the pun "The Book is always better than the movie" did not assure me that this movie would be anything but garbage. But what I came to see was a movie that made every other bad movie better for comparison. <br /> <br /> Normally, when I see a horrible movie, I find myself more entertained than anything else. Unfortunately, I couldn't even laugh at the sad excuse for a movie that Hannibal is. The film was filmed with promise, I think. It had Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman. And for management there was Ridley Scott. There have been films with considerably less talent that have been hugely better. There was so much I would have cut from this movie that I doubt anything would have been. It was pathetic. The story was so ridiculous that it looked like a complete idiot had written it. What's worse is that the book was even more crazy and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included, which is boring in the case of a movie where <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD * ** The Ray Liotta brain was broken down. That scene more than anyone else made me cry because it hardened its predecessor to such a monumental level. The sound of the lamb was one of my favorite movies all the time. But Hannibal was a two hour plus joke. This movie should only be seen if people want to learn how not to write a good movie.
