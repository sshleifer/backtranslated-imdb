. . . And it is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with lovely jugs running around the so-called African jungle. So no problems there for most men out there. I saw it as one of the bundled packages. Forget about the plot that is basically just a flimsy story to get our heroine flashing her jugs on the screen at every opportunity possible. Just to give you an opinion, our heroine swings from wines to vines and climbs on the best animals whenever possible without any good reason, only to let you see his jars at all angles. Again, no complaints. <br /> <br /> The "battle scenes" are ridiculous and border on pornography. Our heroine was captured by the evils at least five times in the film. In some cases, when she has to fight, "fighting" involves the dirt and basically invades and struggles basically as kittens. I'm surprised there is no hair that pulls. It gets so bad that the top baddie had to remind the "fighters" that "I said the one who draws the first blood wins!" to avoid seeing stupid battles. <br /> <br /> Witch doctor Kuku was a bloody blast. From being a great, cozy bear in the beginning, he became manically depressed when he was caught and then, completely psycho. He spent the whole movie muttering lines without irrelevance. <br /> <br /> In addition to Liana (our heroine) jumping into topless, you also see lots of other Amazonas and a woman who decided to jump naked into the lake to take a swim for no good reason. Yes, it's that kind of movie. <br /> <br /> See the beautiful Liane in her jumping glory. Despite the fact that the film is more than 20 years old, it is fun to see blonde women flashing on their cozy pitchers on the screen.
