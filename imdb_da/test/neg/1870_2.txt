I don't know why IMDb lists all the Ghoulies movies as theatrical releases. They were all for video. Same with the puppet master series. Why hasn't anyone noticed it yet? Somehow you've stumbled across Ghoulies IV, probably raiding through an old abandoned video rental store from 1993. You looked in the discount section and found this ... Look at the back and front covers. What do you expect, The Shawshank Redemption? There is no need to review this film so critically. It's the fourth GHOULIES movie! I bought it on DVD for 6.50 because ... it was ?? 6.50 .. I knew it wasn't Kubrick material. And I was right. An unremastered DVD with no enhancement, not even a trailer, boasts an unfortunate movie. <br /> <br /> It actually features the star of the first Ghoulies movie, Peter Liapis ... who really didn't get many 'big' roles except the two movies. And I can't see why ... He's not so bad an actor and is pretty funny. But I think if you want to play a leading role in the Ghoulies movies, Scorsese and Tarantino will lose interest. Also present is his idiot sidekick Bobby Di Cocco, who, despite having a very similar resemblance to Al Pacino (very small), retains none of his acting ability ... A complete idiot that is just awkward to see. Then there's Stacie Randall - of course a porn star, I don't have to look it up. She looks pretty sexy, even though her costume, her character and everything she does pull down the film's credibility, which is no easy task for such a movie. <br /> <br /> There is Ghoulies themselves! Who also manages to let us down. Ghoulies III made them start talking, error # 1, but Ghoulies IV takes it one step further. Instead of being dolls, this time is Ghoulies in fact KIDS in COSTUMES !!!! The filmmakers decided to go the extra mile to insult the film's viewers. There are also only two of them, and they are not the main highlight of the movie, as they do not appear in much of it. But at times they are MILDLY fun ... And they are not evil this time either. <br /> <br /> These are really hilarious bad things, it's great that I could actually enjoy it. I dunno why ... Some of the black humor is actually fun, even though the script is mostly effortless. Imagine Satan's only threat to you that he will "kill you slowly ... painfully ...". <br /> <br /> At least, however, Full Moon had not been involved this time. Did they? Yes, a very poor and cheaply made movie with 0 production value, but not so bad to be in the line of Puppet Master 1/2, Lawnmower Man 2, Surviving Christmas or even Ghoulies III.
