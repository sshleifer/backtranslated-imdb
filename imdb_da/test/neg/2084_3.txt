I did not see this movie when it was originally released, but there have been a few songs that share the title and the concept is still being used from time to time and I figured there should be something for the girl so I dug it up and gave a view. Now I would like to have the approximate hour and forty five minutes of my life back (it seemed much longer). There was nothing particularly bad about the movie, the play was good, no big plot holes, of course there wasn't much plot to have holes in. There just wasn't much for the movie. There was some chemistry between the two, but nothing convincing about their relationship; Nothing interesting about their story. Near the end, when he tries to hunt down the train to catch his fleeting romance, neither my wife nor I would have him catch her. Honestly we figured they were better off with each other, and if they came back together, we didn't really get rid of it. So what does it say about this love story when even a 25-year-old sappy romantic like my wife had no emotional investment in the relationship. I should have left this in the "missed" category. <br /> <br /> Logan Lamech www.eloquentbooks.com/LingeringPoets.html
