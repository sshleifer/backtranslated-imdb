There are bad movies and then there are movies that are just the worst. The thing is just that. <br /> <br /> The movie is simply bad at all points. The reason, the play, the camera's work, the music and everything else is terrible, and I can't begin to understand how such a trash made it to the big screen. The simple fact is that Saw is riddled with plot holes. The beginning is tempting and leaves much to be expected, but it does not stop and the plot becomes ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and will not leave you with a single bit of credibility. People who claim that this movie is gory, violent, sadistic and scary are sissy girls who have nightmares after seeing CSI because it is far away from it. So I warn you not to try to see this if you have any kind of intellect because you are disappointed. A real drill and a mediocre movie like it can be.
