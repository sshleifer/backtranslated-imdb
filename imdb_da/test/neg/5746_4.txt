Man, stinked this movie! It is obvious that this movie helped spurn Hollywood's need to churn out tired followers to appeal to the masses. First of all, it came out too quickly, and secondly, it just didn't have the same hype that made the original movie so successful. No new land was broken and it became a rather everyday effort.
