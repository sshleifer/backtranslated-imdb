Play Macbeth is written by William Shakespeare between the years 1604 and 1606. Since then, many other versions of the play have been produced, including remakes completed in 1948, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa even directed a Japanese version of Macbeth in 1957 entitled "Kumonosu j√¥. " The game begins with King Duncan, who hears about the success of two of his generals, Macbeth and Banquo, in a recent battle with the Irish and the Norwegians. After a quick promotion from Duncan, Macbeth instantly gets an eerie sense of desire, greed, and power, and does everything possible to access the crown: even though it includes murder. <br /> <br /> Geoffrey Wright tried to create his own version of the famous game in 2006 by putting it in the modern Melbourne underworld. Imagine a little Macbeth beating hundreds of soldiers with an AK-47 and rapping his own version of "Low" at the same time. Just kidding about the latter, but one thing he does is pronounce the traditional Shakespeare. And he keeps it through the whole movie. It is true! Shakespeare meets the ghetto. That's all you could ever hope for! Does not?? The latest Macbeth is hard and violent enough to match any other modern action movie, but it lacks decent acting, the right lingo and a good technique for camera work. <br /> <br /> The modernized movie starts with Macbeth (Sam Worthington) working as a hitman / drug dealer for Duncan (Gary Sweet), a drug master from Melbourne, Australia. After being promoted to Thane of Glamis by Duncan (as the three witches had predicted), aspiration began to take over Macbeth as he put his eyes on the throne. After promoting Macbeth, Duncan invites to Macbeth's house for a night of drugs and alcohol. Before the celebrations, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) speaks Macbeth to kill Duncan for taking power over the throne. After the bodyguards are drunk and everyone sleeps, Macbeth throws into Duncan's room and stings him to death. After his murder, Macbeth takes all Duncan's possessions, including hidden title and crown. As soon as he thinks he has what he wants, he finds out that it will take more than bribes and run away to solve his problems. <br /> <br /> A big mistake in the movie was the actor. Once apparently flamboyant and authorized Macbeth suddenly becomes a sissy. And he looks like a sad whale animal in the whole movie. I don't really know if it was Worthington or Wright's fault, but somehow one of them had to understand Macbeth was a king, not a knot on a timber that took all his wife to say literally. As I said earlier, Macbeth should have been rude, arrogant, and sad. But when his character changes to a fabric master, he changes personalities as well as I assume. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth really knew how to sip it in the knob when it came to recognizing and personalizing its character. She did not seem as defiant as she was in the play or in the 1971 version, but she reminds Macbeth that, in relation to murder, anything else he might do, it would not fully answer. <br /> <br /> Another thing I found unpleasant was the whole nudity. This fluke HAD is Wright's fault. The witches didn't do anything unless you call parading around in your birthday gown play. At some point in the film I began to wonder if I saw Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol. 2. <br /> <br /> Do not make me wrong when I say I find the Shakespeare dialogue out of place. It is spoken flawlessly, but when it is spoken by an Australian gangster, it's just really weird. When Macbeth starts killing people, he first lets them know by talking to them in Ye Olde English. Macbeth contains lots of action, blood, gore and nudity to be someone in life. You forget all the positive facts, but when you start thinking about yourself, "Okay, what did he say just in the last sentence?" At some points in the movie, I don't even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new age of the movie could easily have been pulled off, it was not for "You are" and "Your". <br /> <br /> Camera work was simply fair to me. One thing I couldn't stand was the constant pacing back and forth between characters. The camera technology used gave the Blair Witch kind of vibe and made me throw a little in my mouth. Matt Reeves tried to try the same concept for camera work in the Clover field, but it just doesn't work. It makes me get out of my chair and look for the small barf bags they have conveniently planted on each seat of the planes. <br /> <br /> Looking back at everything, the gangsta Macbeth has a positive: lots of action. Aside from that, the film contains no more than uninspired plays, proper English use, and belly-swinging camera work. The audio track holds one or two of the same songs, but each song is edited or remixed differently for each scene. There is never a variety of interesting or captivating media used. From now on, directors should leave Al Pacino and Robert Deniro the dangerous substance underworld. Future reproductions of Macbeth should be created as Shakespeare intended to play 400 years ago. I would recommend using medieval clothes, Ye Olde English, swords and shields and a soundtrack compiled by Enya. But on the one hand, the modern Macbeth makes you yearn for some good 'ole folk music, a camp fire and a bustier.
