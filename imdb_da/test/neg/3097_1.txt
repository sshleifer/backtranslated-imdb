Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie. Less than 50 billion out of 10. If you want hard-boiled action, don't let it be rented! If you want a good independent movie, look elsewhere! <br /> <br /> I never thought I could see Burt Reynolds in such a crazy movie. It has the thinnest plot line ever. Van Damm flicks should win an academy compared to this one. <br /> <br /> Rob Lowe again shows why he is not the hottest actor in the world. Even Hasselhoff would have made a better drug abuser than him. I will not drill you with more facts about this crappy movie, except to say that you can better rent something from Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. This should show me if you get my operation. <br /> <br />
