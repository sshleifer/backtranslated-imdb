This "space piece" was kind of stupid. I suppose it should be a shockingly unexpected ending, but IMHO it was just a big downturn. Joseph Campanella and the rest of the terrestrial actors do a good job in this one; Their performances are not done justice with such a silly end though. How this conclusion could ever have made it through any kind of audit from the producers is beyond me. The second comment to this is not correct, the tongue of cheek vignettes only came into the second season, but this thing had to be taken seriously! The producers and authors could have been a little more creative with the end of doing the rest of the episode justice.
