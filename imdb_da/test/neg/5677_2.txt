This show was a fantastic, fresh and innovative idea in the 70's when it was first sent. The first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but it fell after it. In 1990, the show wasn't really fun anymore and it continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today. It's really shameful how far this show has fallen. The writing is painfully bad, the performance is almost as bad - if not for the guest's hosts, who are mildly entertaining, this show will probably not be in the air. I find it so hard to believe that the same creator who hand-picked the original cast also chose the wave of hacks that followed. How can one recognize such shine and then look appropriate to replace it with such mediocrity? I felt I had to give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show so successful. As it is now, the show is just awful. I can't believe it's still in the air.
