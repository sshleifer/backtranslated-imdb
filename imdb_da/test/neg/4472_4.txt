4 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This movie was neither fun as a whole, nor was it worth investing any kind of feeling in the characters. Eugene Levy is probably the most fun .... The rest of the cast does their job but the story never gets really deep and there are many gaps in the plot that will never be filled. It was just not that fun, even though it was fun at times. <br /> <br />
