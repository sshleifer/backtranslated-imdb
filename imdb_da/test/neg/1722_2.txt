'Tycus' is almost as bad as a science fiction movie can go. <br /> <br /> I can hardly find anything good to say about this movie. The premises are completely wrong. A comet must strike the Moon and cause catastrophic damage to Earth, but no one believes the scientist who predicts it. An entire subterranean village plus a launch weapon for nuclear missiles is built in the California mountains without anyone noticing. As the comet approaches the ground, the news for television and newspapers hardly comes a day before the event. And so on, and so forth ... <br /> <br /> Also, any kind of emotion makes it to the screen. Is genius discovering the comet and building the underground city a savior of mankind or an animal? The director or Dennis Hooper, who plays the role, did not seem to decide until the movie was finished and actually does not make any difference because action and direction are so confusing that you stop by wondering what that movie is trying to say. The special effects are so inexpensive that they cannot be convincing in the computer effects, but they could not have been convincing even in the 50s, four decades before this film was made. <br /> <br /> A total waste of time.
