This is by far the worst ever 'horror' movie, no, it makes any movie I've ever seen. Shame on Block Buster for even performing this type of crap. I never ask for a refund on any movie, but I think it will be the first. <br /> <br /> The movie is so bad that I had to stop after just 15 minutes to see it. <br /> <p> I had more fun watching some of the fuzzy YouTube movies than watching this piece. <br /> <br /> The filmmaker of this movie must have some kind of silver tongue to move this thing to a company like Blockbuster.
