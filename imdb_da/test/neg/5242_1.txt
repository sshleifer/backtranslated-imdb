When I heard that the largest and oldest preserved Germanic heroic poem was turned into a movie, it almost became my obsession to see it. The first glint of his appearance, I caught, never disappointed me. A futuristic interpretation With Lambert was our favorite highlander and Mitra, burial tombs to be in leading roles nailingly appealing, although some doubts arose (an important female character in Beowulf?) ... Two hours ago I saw the movie. After reading the instructor's name, my world fell apart. That said - from that point on, there were not many surprises. First and foremost, the film has nothing to do with the original Beowulf, if we ignore a few violent and meaningless stolen names. If they hadn't stolen the names and declared it to be a new story, it could have been like a f-class action stupidity with fine costumes and set design. That way it's simply a crime! An attack on a legend and its ideology as well as on common sense. Okay, let me be positive for a second ... except for the general electrogoth atmosphere that is beautiful, it also has good music. It was for both the positive part and this comment.
