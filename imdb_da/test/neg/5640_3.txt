It is no wonder that it was free by post on Sunday, slow, poor recording and movie recording (camera clutter, near movie start is not even artistic) = Right to video, but not in this case, why not recoup some of your (movie production cost) by releasing it for free with a UK Sunday newspaper, at least this way you get a captured audience and recover some costs. <br /> <br /> I didn't give this movie a 1 out of 10 because of the effort to pull some old actors out of their shell, it was nice to see some old faces (Vanessa Redgrave, it's not Blow Up), but Vinnie Jones as a leader and I think he was better in Gone for 60 seconds when he didn't speak. <br /> <br /> This movie falls into Ratings every day, I think this will find its true brand of 3-4 out of 10, in the very near future
