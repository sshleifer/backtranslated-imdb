Sadness was the feeling I felt after the screen became dark. Marveled, was another. Why would two spicy shawls like Matthau and Lemmon sign up for this scary project? I'm under the impression that they didn't read the script before the cameras started rolling. Everything thrown is wasted in this eerie, uninteresting and unimpressive film. Unfortunately, it was one of the elegant Edward Mulhare's last projects, here as the heavy. Dyan Cannon tries, Hal Linden looks bored, Donald O'connor recites a few lines charged with profanity. (?? !!). I'm not with the "Legion of Decency." My point is that they were spit exclusively for the odd thing to hear him use off-color language. It is a desperate attempt to add "humor" to an image. He actually delivered the film's only entertainment entertainment when he tattered on the dance floor. I save my hardest criticism for the leaders. Walter Matthau should have known better. He still delivers amazing solo performances (IQ, Dennis The Menace, etc.). His character, though gracious, is rather boring and one-dimensional. Saw him once, seen him all. Jack Lemmon gives another of his trademark grinning "just for darn sensitive" men's portraits. When he starts the fashion, I want to give him a box of tissue. Off to the sea is painfully unfunny, and who produced this mess must be done to walk on the plank.
