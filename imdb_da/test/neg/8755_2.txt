This is the worst movie in the world. The only reason I gave it a 2 was because the first 10 minutes were hysterical fun in a "is this really?" kind of way. It was so cheesy and low budget ... they shouldn't have even bothered. There was nudity and violence for the sake of having nudity and violence, and the effects were just as bad that you wouldn't believe it (think ketchup like blood and cabbage for cut heads). don't rent this !!
