I waited "Born to Kill" to be an exciting, high-voltage film noir. Instead, it has two good action set pieces (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some wonderfully atmospheric filmography by Robert de Grasse (usually a "glamor" cameraman and a surprising credit for a noir), but the rest of the movie is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through his psychosocial park, but it is a strictly numerical achievement that mechanically unfolds what the audience expects of him after "Dillinger" (an overstated movie, but at least better than this). Claire Trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to appeal to the audience, and the action (as it is) remains so resolute in the damned San Francisco house, the film becomes claustrophobic rather than really exciting. It is one of those films where the supporting players - especially Elisha Cook, Jr. (whose character homurotic itching to Tierney is one of the few features of an otherwise rather obvious script) and Isabel Jewell - the out-act leaders. It also doesn't help it, almost half a century, after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized the notion of psycho killers on the screen in "Psycho". Tierney is so rough and obvious that he might as well have "PSYCHO" tattooed on his forehead. Also, there is no indication in the movie as it states why the source's novel was called "Deadlier than the Male" - but perhaps James Gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than they are in the movie. "Born to Kill" is a real disappointment from Robert Wise, who already had some quality films under his belt and would move on to a star career.
