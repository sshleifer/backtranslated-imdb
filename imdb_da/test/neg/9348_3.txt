Wow. The story of this was just incredibly stupid. I realize that this movie should be a comic genre. But still, even nonsense must make at least a vague sense. Water has become incredibly rare substance? It is strange, considering that hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the most abundant substances found in the universe. And quite easy to make. Flood hydrogen and oxygen, and voil√†, water. Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or any such tingama jig should have been used as a plot unit as something the pirates would pursue. Water as a plot unit was just stupid, silly, stupid. "Comedy" seemed worked and constructed and forced. The comedy in the TV series "Red Dwarf" was worked and constructed and forced, but it was actually entertaining. Here instead I felt like saying, "Ha ha, it was just so much fun, I forgot to laugh ..." Sigh ... all the money put in sets, costumes, actors ... what a waste ... <br /> <br /> Instead of just crying and gnawing and complaining about it is lameness, my recommendations to do better: 1) Use a trustworthy plot unit. 2) Get rid of "comedy" None of the actors were really good at it. The movie would work better as a "serious" action adventure. <br/> <br /> The author's obvious intention was to make a spooky comedy, but they didn't quite take it out. It's not likely I'll ever see this again. It's too much a total hack job.
