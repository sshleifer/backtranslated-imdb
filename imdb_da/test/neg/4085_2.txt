This is definitely not a comedy - I don't know what it was marketing that way. As a serious movie, it lacks any substance. Unless you are healthy out of Sunday school or need your Noah solution, you will be sad. <br /> <br /> The beneficiary took away what little of the movie was left. Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife with no real depth. His children don't add anything to the movie. They seem to be exclusively brothers about their absent father in the beginning. Jonah Hill plays an eerie internet addict who doesn't come out as humorous. <br /> <br /> I found the original to be a decent movie. Disappointed that this didn't really go anywhere.
