I have read the 28 most recent comments from various people about this movie and were surprised that no one mentioned the fact that the first victim appearing on the bed with the "missing eyelids" that the camera pans up and away from her face flashes! Yes, flashes! I recorded it as it came on HBO last weekend, and when I saw this, I literally had to repeat it several times focusing on one eye at a time to make sure I didn't see things! It was, of course, difficult to take the film seriously, although there were some interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and give it a 4 mostly because the first victim flashes in one of the last frames, as the camera pulls away from the body / face. Too bad.
