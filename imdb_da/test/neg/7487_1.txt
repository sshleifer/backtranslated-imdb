I thought it was a very bad movie. The whole time I looked at this movie I couldn't help thinking about it again and again how bad it was and how it was $ 3.69 down the drain. So the reason was the jump. They did an excellent job at the beginning of explaining who dated who in high school, but they never really explained anything after that. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it an ordinary thriller? Apparently you can decide for yourself because they didn't see the need to explain. I basically understood what happened, I think. What I was confused about was the whole thing before, what was it about bloody noses, phone calls, etc.? Got this guy back? Where does the wife channel "Carrie" or something? Who knows? You certainly won't after watching this movie.
