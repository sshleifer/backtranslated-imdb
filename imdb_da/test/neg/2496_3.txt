The United States built the atomic bomb to show their superior military power and to end the Second World War. The movie Fat Man and Little Boy is a depiction of American physicists' efforts to invent the technology needed to create the bomb and the excitement that existed between scientists and the military over the potential uses of the bomb and even the acceptability of its creation. The researchers believed that the bomb should be created as a deterrent, a mechanism that would stop the war by wasting as little life as possible. Fist, they looked like in a race with German scientists trying to build nuclear weapons themselves. When the Germans were defeated, many scientists hoped to stop work on the bombing project, knowing that the Japanese did not have the technology needed to build a nuclear weapon and therefore did not pose a threat to massive loss of life. Those who preferred the continuation of the Manhattan project hoped that the bomb would be used as a demonstration, and called on the Japanese head of state to see its spread on a small desert island. This massive display of power they felt would be enough to win the war - no killing would be necessary. The American military, led by General Leslie Groves, constantly hoped to use the bomb as a real weapon to be deployed against the enemy, first against the Germans and then against Japanese. Due to the persistence of Japanese soldiers on the small Japanese islands, the United States decided to drop the bomb on populated cities to end the war, first Hiroshima and then Nagasaki. The display of the great amount of power also told the rest of the world that the United States was the dominant military force, a message directed specifically at Russia, whose growing military power and economic weight in Eurasia threatened our prominent world position. Fat Man and Little Boy were a film that had good intentions in mind, but dulled them pretty badly by choosing actors, script and movies. One of the main points of the film was the battle between the military view of science of killing and the scientific view of science of knowledge. The core of this conflict is the continuing disagreements between General Groves and Dr. Oppenheimer. Mr. Newman does his work in the general part, skewed, massively angry and radiates his dependence on the success of the project. Dwight Schultz, on the other hand, never sets much opposition to the general's demands, as he always looks rather weak, deflated and phlegmatic in his audience. John Cusack presents an amazingly unsympathetic character in such a flat role that I have ever seen - it looks like he just reads his lines. Laura Dern seems to suffer from the same disease. None of the characters are helped by the manuscript, which is almost childishly ridiculous in the way it attempts to explain scientific concepts rudely, giving the most unrealistic share relationship between Mr. Cusack and Mrs. Dern imaginable, do not even give us cheap excitement by seeing the army release nuclear bombs on Japan and rely heavily on voice-over technique that is evil at any time, even when explaining a character true inner thought or story about something that may not appear on the movie media, but is used here to read some absolute choices out of Cusack's diary. The cinematograph gives us more pictures of the shady shadow of the two bombs, which can be striking if it didn't look like they were cardboard cutouts instead of bombs. The fake nuclear fire looks really fake - and why does it use when the storage footage on the hand is so truly amazing and realistic - and the penetrating brown tone doesn't seem to be thematically appropriate. Besides that, it's not a bad movie.
