As a piece of a Michael Dudikoff fan, I sat down to see one of his good old-fashioned action people - I'm still waiting. The film is based on a group of American commands that try to get rid of a bunch of Syrian terrorists who have taken over a nuclear reactor. Maddie Reese (Felicity Waterman) was an English member of the command unit and of course she was romantically involved with Tom Dickson (Dudikoff). I have to ask since the British had female SAS members - as far as I know they are ever needed, they come from other sources. Although they did, I can basically guarantee that they would not be as wet as Maddie Reese. I would also think Tom Dickson would be a little more responsible in his position - or have I lost the plot? I know there is always the romantic angle in these movies, as it helps to give the emotional factor, but it must always be, especially when there are important things to consider - such as nuclear war crimes! <br /> <br /> The signing of the treaty on the American carrier fascinated me. The "holy pen", which was worn by one of the listed television news crews, is no security check to find out who or what is on board one of these ships, especially with the calibers of the people on it. If you were there, I think there was no story. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but when it came to "inner body swelling" to safely remove a sphere, I gave up on action drama movie bits and enjoyed it for the comedy it actually was. <br /> <br /> By the way, a news reporter would really say "Downtown Damascus" ??
