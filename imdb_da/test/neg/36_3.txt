This movie, which I rented under the title "Black Voodoo" should be avoided. I expected a blaxploitation / horror flick; but what i got was a very boring, standard "ghost extracts vegence". In this case, the ghost was the one for a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment, but who is accused was ignored and he died in an operation. The result: his spirit puts Sherry's nurse and forces her to commit murder. The only voodoo connection was one of the three black characters, in this case a blinded ex-football player whose mother practiced voodoo. The film is very slow and very boring. There is a very standard ending that gives excitement, followed by a horrible silly end (warning: SPOILER) <br /> <br /> In which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she was in possession. This movie is slow and bad in a non-fun, just stupefying way. Avoid it at all costs.
