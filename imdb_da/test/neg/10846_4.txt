This movie is only striking in its banality and use of clich√©s. Unfortunately, it was clearly through to the end. But do not be confused with believing that it ended strongly. Only a little unexpected, but nothing worth looking at the case through. From the taciturn and the fake hero, to the Germanic baddy to the consumable team, the characters were completely wood and clear. The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (geddit?) Gave some hope of humor, but it came to nothing. <br /> <br /> I'm a great science fiction fan, but it's hard to find any redeeming quality in this movie. A turkey! <br /> <br />
