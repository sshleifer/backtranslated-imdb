This movie is horrible, I'm SORRY. I bought this to get Star Worms and actually expected this to be better after how disappointed I was in Star Worms. Oh just kidding, turns out this is the worst movie I've ever seen. The action is garbage, not that there really is anything, and the protagonist is a big silly box that is attacked by similar things or something. I can't really tell you. The special effects are so bad that you can't even see the warring dinosaurs who, by the way, don't war, but just stand and move their mouths or whatever they are. The movie is headache. It is very obvious that the director is trying to establish a universe. Hahahahahahahaha ... Really, this movie is just abominable even at Troma's standards. The only good thing I can say about it is that it has a Lloyd Kaufman intro, as he again slips us into seeing something that does not fit into consumption.
