You just can't touch the NRFPTP! The new crop is just awful. The wit is not fun. Some of the troops make me stop watching TV together. Lorne - you've let your creation go down the toilet. The guests are sometimes good, the bands are mostly rubbish bin. Weekend update, Seth should tell the audience when to laugh ..... Seth would get a proper reception in a Baghdad cafe though ... Make sure Andy goes with him ... The show has about 10 jokes on it all, and They just keep rehashing them over and over again. Even the segments that are obviously not fun. Public people have become the name of the game, but they can't even do the right thing. Just offensive. I'm so disappointed with what happened to the show, but now I know it's safe to go out on a Saturday night!
