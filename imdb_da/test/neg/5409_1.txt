If you like to get a few fleeting glimpses of some attractive women, there may be another or two of the pleasure of this movie. If you enjoy watching poorly-designed and performed "action" scenes, there are plenty. If you are both blind and deaf, I still advise you not to have this movie in your presence. It's probably the worst or very close to the worst movie I've ever seen. And it seems that there was some money spent on it. Talk about throwing money away! As an editor, I hope the "editor (s)" of this "movie" will never be allowed to edit a movie, book or even a post-it note. As a writer, I hope the author (s) will never again be allowed near even a broken crayon. You'd think I didn't recommend watching this movie. Not so. Tape it (so you can stop your pain when you need to) and educate yourself on how bad a movie can be.
