Before Stan Laurel became the smallest half of the biggest comedy team, he worked under contract with Broncho Billy Anderson in a number of cheapies, many of which were parodies of great Hollywood features. Most of Laurels' parody films are only mildly fun, and even less fun for modern audiences who have not seen the original film that Laurel is parodying. Fortunately, 'Mud and Sand' lights a film still known: 'Blood and Sand', starring Rudolph Valentino. "Blood and Sand" was released just nine weeks before this parody and gave you an idea of ​​how quickly Broncho Billy's films were designed, edited and distributed. <br /> <br /> Various sources (including IMDb) indicate that Stan Laurel's character in this movie is called rhubarb vaselino, with a final 'o'. I have screened a print of 'Mud and Sand' with the original titles (in Hobo type font), so I report that Laurel's role actually cries Rhubarb Vaseline with an 'e'. But I agree that 'Vaselino' is more fun. Laurel copies the elaborate sideburns that Valentino had in 'Blood and Sand' (he should have made them longer!), And there is a parody of Valentino's dressing scene from the movie that made female movie goers swim in 1922. A señorita called Carmen in the original movie is parodyed here as Caramel (a girl, I would like to sink my teeth in). This movie (as the original one) seems to be taking place in Spain, but there is a ban gag. Laurel uses a distinctive hat-tipping gesture here that could have become a trademark for him (like Hardy's distinctive tie twiddle), but I've never seen it in any other Laurel movie. There is an entertaining dialogue: Rhubarb Vaseline tells the other matrices that "Save a bull for me." When Vaseline becomes a successful toreador, he says a bit: "The bull is outside, gentleman" ... which is fun, but I was disappointed that Laurel did not respond "without what?". <br /> <br /> There is a fun moment here that was almost certainly not planned when Vaseline shows up for bullfighting auditions. Laurel swaggers into the bullfight, and - before you can say 'corrida querida' - he throws a bull over the fence where it lands with a tongue near the other auditions. The bull is obviously a fake, but gag is fun anyway ... and there's a title card with a joke about "throwing the bull." The serendipitous moment arises when Laurel repeats the gag, and Vaseline beats another bull over the fence. This lands on his ass and balances upright for a moment before he topples over. Very funny! If anyone planned that gag in this fast-paced comedy, I greet the unknown gagsmith ... and the tech man who was raising the bull to land in that position. More likely, it happened successfully, and the director and editor were smart enough to hold it in. <br /> <br /> In the quiet time when Hollywood made a big budget feature film that was created anywhere Don't speak English, it was a regular cinematic entity showing a piece of text or inscription in the local lingo and then resolved to a shot of the same text in English. I was surprised that this low budget comedy used the money to copy this device here: we see a bulletin board outside the corridor with a message in Spanish, so it dissolves into the same text in English. Unfortunately, the photograph in this cheapo movie is so dark that the effect is wasted. The actresses in this movie are attractive ... including Broncho Billy's wife Leona Anderson and Stan Laurel's disgraceful wife Mae Dahlberg; The latter does a short dance. (Mae had danced in Stan's vaudeville action.) I was surprised to see Charlie Chaplin's half-brother Wheeler Dryden in a short role as Chaplin had nothing to do with this movie. In 'Mud and Sand' Laurel gives a fun performance that is unlike his later well-known Stanley character ... but this movie is much less fun than his brilliant work with Oliver Hardy. My rating: just 3 out of 10. TRIVIA NOTE: Thirty-three years later, Stan Laurel played his last American movie - The Bullfighters (1945) - a Spanish bullfight (with his Spanish voice coded). Coincidentally, this movie used stock footage from 'Blood and Sand': not Valentino's movie, but Tyrone Power remake. 'Mud and Sand' is more fun than 'The Bullfighters', but not much.
