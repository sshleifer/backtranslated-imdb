Without a doubt, one of the worst movies ever made. Tired and without structure, tensions or stories, the movie casts on the thin premise of "putting together a show". Conflicts are resolved within two or three seconds of their creation, and the dialogue is random and random. Everything is put together in a slapdash order and often "stepping out" feels more like a deleted scene reel than a real movie. The movie seems to exist only as a showcase for exciting and completely random Liza music tracks. Shelly Winters can be seen in the much better octo-epic "Tentacles", and REAL Liza can be found in the Showtime release of "Queer Duck: The Movie".
