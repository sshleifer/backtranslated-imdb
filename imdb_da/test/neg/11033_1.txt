Avoid this movie if you are looking for entertainment. It's filled with wannabes who are trying to be something they aren't, and Emraan is just wasted in the role of a tour guide falling for a newcomer who needs to play. Seriously, where do they get these people from? Just because you are beautiful does not mean you can act or be an actress. Asmit Patel will send an apology letter to anyone who accidentally sees him, makes a fool of himself in this bad excuse for a movie. He plays a creepy wannabe gangster as a drug girl and forces them to fall in love with him and sell them to the highest bidder.
