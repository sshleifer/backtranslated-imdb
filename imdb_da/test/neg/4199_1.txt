No, no, no. That's all there is to say. <br /> <br /> Summary: A random guy is in a grain field. For some reason I'm not sure, but it's his duty to run around inside. The next big thriller? <br /> <br /> A five year old could make a better movie, just filming an anthill, or even just grass growing. Seriously ..... <br /> <br /> You can't say it has bad acting because there is nothing acting. You can't say it has bad writing because it has nothing to write. You can't say it has poor filmography because there are no movies. You can't say it's a bad movie because there's no movie! If you don't believe me, you should see it. Just don't say I've never warned you .....
