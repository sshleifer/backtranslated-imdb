How two great actors unfold a piece of junk like this on movie-goers. My only conclusion is that they and their instructor believe that any movie where they starve just needs to be seen and applauded. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie - probably the worst "thriller" I've ever seen. The actors showed minimal feeling; the plot was reasonable for a 1/2 hour slot (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was almost a stupid parody - his partner was apparently stupid and did not speak a word. To rewrite Robert Redford, the villain was a pointless piece of shit! The movie was pulled out and meaningless - the only question was whether the hero would die or not. A really bizarre part of the story - The waiting family seemed to continue for at least several days; The hero and antihero seemed to only take one day. All in all - a waste of time
