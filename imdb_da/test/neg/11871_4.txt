Let's get one thing right: I like a lot of Snipe's work. In contrast to his other kick kicking contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme) he can actually act. However, this movie does little to improve its reputation; it is not exactly unpacked - but I am not in a hurry to see it again. In fact, if I never saw it again, it wouldn't disturb me - there are just a lot of better movies out there to waste my on! It's a shame because with a little imagination and some subtle changes, it could have been a valuable movie. Instead, the director has chosen to almost try to regret his audience in submission with too much violence and very little characterization. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have is with Snipes co-star, Silvia Colloca. I regret that the producers of this movie went to all the disturbances by hiring a stunningly beautiful (for my money anyway) and talented actress like Miss Colloca and then giving her such a pathetic one-dimensional character to play with. If she was hired just to add a little "glamor" to the movie, she didn't even do it well; There is no nudity in the movie nor any sex scene worth mentioning. Strange, really. Given the amount of violence in this movie, it baffles me why the producers have taken such a conservative attitude to sex and nudity. Do we live in 2007 or in 1957? What the producers of this nonsense (and probably also the actors) have forgotten is that movies are meant to be fantasies. Like most inhabitants of this planet, my real life is very boring. I would love to hunt terrorists, be able to handle myself as Mr Snipes and join a beautiful young thing like Miss Colloca. This film does not satisfy any of these fantasies very well. That's exactly why I give it such a bad review!
