This movie was nothing like the book. I think the actor must have wanted the job of writing the sequel to Gone with the Wind and has been knocked down. This was his or her way of getting their ideas in anyway. The only similarity between this film and the story it depicted was the names of the basic characters and the location of the main action. None of the events shown in the movie happened in the book. For one away with the wind fan (both the book and the movie) it was deeply disappointing. If you loved the Scarlett book, don't watch this movie and hope to see it play on the screen. They only share the title in common.
