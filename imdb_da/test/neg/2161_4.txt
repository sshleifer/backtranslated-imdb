In the early 1990s, "Step-by-Step" came as a boring combination of ultra-cheesy "Full House" and the long-sleeved loopy classic hit "The Brady Bunch". The differences between "Step-by-Step" and the two aforementioned shows were, of course, better to write, excellent comedic timing from almost all of its actors and a lot of more fun situations that were not quite as sugar-coated as they are extremely popular predecessors. Of course, even with the great enhancements of the show's basic dynamics and all that, it was still not quite spectacular, and it was not as memorable in the long line of corny family programming! It was just a much better hour-fit you can say, compared to the cutesy migraine-inducing "Full House" that randomly ran the neck and neck with "Step-by-Step" during this period in terms of overall popularity . The show, which is now ready in syndication, is certainly an appropriate family holiday, but do not expect much beyond that when you see it.
