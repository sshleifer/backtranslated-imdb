Essentially, this is a horrible movie with a few features that may or may not redeem it for you, depending on how much you want them to. In the "Open up" "The Red Green Show" to the big screen, filmmakers jettisoned the rustic charm carefully rooted over a decade worth of episodes set in and around Possum Lodge in favor of a gentle "road movie" with a horrible faux Hollywood "great" musical score and deeply boring story that's not adorned with enough good gags to make it as entertaining as even the most mediocre episode in the TV series. <br /> <br /> After devising a plotline that holds most of the members of the Possum Lodge offscreen for the most part of the movie and requires virtually everyone involved, it is contemptuous to mean the gracious Harold (who is the movie's hero, is the usually affably crusty red creature excluded in this incarnation for nothing but the role of head Harold abuser, are the only artists who truly shine, Patrick McKenna and Peter Keleghan as Harold and Ranger Gord, who deliver satisfactorily large screen versions of their småskærmsfigurer.
