In my childhood, I have seen the first three "Critters" films and enjoyed them. They were fun and entertaining horror comedies perfect for adventurous scary loving kids. I have never seen "Critters 4" so I finally decided to check it out. My judgment: Forgettable and pretty bad flick with striking low body count. The script by Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is both predictable and clich√©d, the plot shifts "Alien" and "Star Wars" and the sets look soft and dark. boring. "Critters 4" appeared to be such a low budget that the filmmakers could not afford optical effects, taken from "Android" look seriously. out of 10. One to avoid.
