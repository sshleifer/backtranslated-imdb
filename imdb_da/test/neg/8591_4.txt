Beautiful pictures, propaganda and history as toys. The ingredients in this film, good, interesting but with many shadows. Political call shadows. Jefferson is more than the hero of a mythical America. He is the silhouette of a vision of life and society, an extraordinary thinker, learning in much of North America. In movies, only Superman. The delicate contour of ideas is broken. The subtle birth of the essential truth is forgotten. And Jefferson is the basic instrument for creating a good picture of American realities. The end, triumph and fake, romance and heroic, are suicide gun suicide that can be high with more wisdom. And the war against "Avatar" is another gray spot. For someone who has not heard of Jefferson, movies are a good start. For the others - disillusionment. It's like the tailor-made silk. But the tailor is fascinating about silk and the clothes are just plain cloth. So a sad experience. Slices of beauty and boring lakes, patriotic lesson and love of expectation. A movie that has to be impressive. And ashes of a story that could be magnificent.
