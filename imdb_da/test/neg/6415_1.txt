This film has no respect for the viewer's time. It takes a 15 minute story and stretches it for 95 minutes. To achieve this, they must use a very slow narrative and get everyone to run around with some creepy freakish anxiety. Since this movie showed something interesting in the plot, it just didn't care. The problem is not in the play, but instead pacing. The story is just weak. Jim Carrey is an accomplished actor, but his attempt to inject light humor into a serious role is out of the question. His humorous style is not generic, so he comes across as an emigrated version of himself. Number 23 gives great sadness and frustration to the people of history, but the reason for this is never logical. At most, it is just mildly interesting. Jim Carrey has much more ability in a serious role than this movie reveals. Don't waste your money watching this in the theater. Rent this movie if you've had trouble sleeping. If you are still awake after 10 minutes, then you liked it more than I did. I did not like the light and artistic aspects of the film production either. A lot of passive visual eye light was thrown on the viewer with lighting or effects, and it did little to improve the already weak history.
