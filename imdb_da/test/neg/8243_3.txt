I generally loved Carry on movies, but this one is actually awful. There are very few laughs because it is all so forced. There is plenty of talent on the screen and some come out better than others. June Whitfield, Kenneth Williams, Hatti Jaques and Peter Butterworth are fine, but Barbara Windsor looks tired and Sid James is just sticky. Joan Sims looks good, but in the case of the usually wonderful Charles Hawtrey it's just sad. When you think of the sad end of his career, the film is almost too depressing to see. The homophobia in the film is unpleasant and it is a very unpleasant experience. The set looks cheap and unlike other films in the series, the film is very clearly set in England. The sea side looks cold, and there are little attempts to create illusions here. It looks like a cheap production. You will be surprised at how miserable you continue to see this, especially if you loved the series.
