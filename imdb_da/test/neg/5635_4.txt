The fact that this movie was distributed for free with a particular national newspaper that I didn't care about put me to some degree to see it, but when I had come across a copy that a local charity shop gave away for nothing I felt I could see it with a clear conscience. The movie has its moments, the view of the Thameside location is nicely finished, but it suffers, I feel, from a few too many mistakes. First, Vinnie Jones is simply not convincing as a journalist. Though Vinnie himself is an interesting character, the truth is that he simply does not have the ability to act as one. Secondly, who would carry a lost manuscript that they have been informed is "priceless"? It seemed that everywhere Mr Jones went this manuscript went with him! Third, the whole Dickens aspect of history comes in the way of what might have been an interesting movie of corruption at highlights. Maybe I'm just a little bit thick, but I really couldn't see the point in the story-in-a-story Dickens style. This added nothing to the movie and only served to confuse things when things began to become interesting in modern history. <br /> <br /> The one bit of praise I would give the filmmakers is that they at least tried something a little different. I am all for British Independent movies trying to be 'out of the left', but this is not a "red road" or "this is england". What it is is a little mess, and an overlapping thereof. Yes, it is partly entertaining, but eventually it felt as if two films merged together to do a whole and both failed to do so. (I also can't think I've seen anything like that done recently on Ian Banks television, set in Edinburgh with a story about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes).
