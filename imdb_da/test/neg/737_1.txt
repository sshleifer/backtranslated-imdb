We really don't know where to start when we talk about this movie. But we begin with the plot. We sincerely suspect who wrote / produced / never directed this movie. Because they missed the whole point. SATIRICAL, not horror. Just a tip. Second, the bath scene. Enough said. Third, the added characters. The outlined Gothic French lady and her black side enjoy holding hands and cartwheeling. We do not understand where it comes from. And then there was casting. All of them were really unlikeable. We were very sorry that Catherine and Mr. Tilney ended up together because they were so unlikely that no one would ever want to see them happy. And ... the music. We believe that BBC producers ran out of money, so raided their grandmother's ceiling. And they found some old records. Saxophone, mocking female voices and an occasional electric guitar. * Shudder * <br /> <br /> And the best line ever: "Since you left, the white rose bush is dead of grief." If anyone has any explanation, we would like to hear it. Because it doesn't make sense. <br /> <br /> We're still wondering what in the world everyone was thinking when they horribly released this pathetic excuse for a movie out on the public. We believe that it should be considered a federal offense. Torture is illegal. <br /> <br /> This movie is by far the worst we've seen to date. And I've seen many movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: Give this movie to anyone you hate. They want to see it and will kill themselves. And we agree with a previous post we would give this 0 stars if at all possible. Don't look !! And we strongly suspect that anyone who has commented so far in favor of this movie was involved in the production. Or was mentally insane. These are the only reasons we have been able to come up with that would initiate a favorable review.
