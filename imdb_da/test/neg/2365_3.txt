"TNT Jackson" is not completely unmatched. But either the version I watched DVD was edited with a weed-whacker, or the manuscript itself is the lowest level of gatehouse / blaxploitation sausage. Or maybe both. <br /> <br /> Jeanne Bell should have been Playmate at some point in his career and the movie makes the most of the connection by showing her breasts at least twice as much as it was really necessary (including a hilarious topless fight scene which I am pretty sure was supposed to be fun). I will admit they are pretty fine. Yet she is a kind of transparent look and does not have a Foxy Brown's charisma, even a Cleopatra Jones. She did, however, have her moments as an actress in the movie, but it would have been nice if the director had pushed her a little harder, or the manuscript had given her a chance to do more than emote "attitude" and kick people. <Talking about kicking people, the battle scenes (the second supposed reason to watch a movie like this) are pretty badly done. There is no real choreography to talk about here, just people pose and stick feet and fist in the general direction of their opponents. A minor exception is a good moment with an opponent equipped with butterfly folding knives; another is an order at the end of the end, where a blatantly stunt double for Bell (and perhaps for Stan Shaw) jumps around and makes some decent sweeps and groundwork in a moment or two before Bell / "Jackson" beats her the enemy lives out, Shaw collapses and the manuscript just stops. (Through this I will admit that this is much in the tradition of Shaw Brother, faster since the parents). There are a few supporting actors who are actually better than the movie deserves (I'm thinking of "Joe" and the fellows playing the right hand man of the addict). There is a half decent funk-laden soundtrack that complements the action on the screen and adds a star to the score alone. There is a deadly sex scene that manages to be effective almost in spite of itself. <br /> <br /> This is strictly for hardcore fans of blaxploitation. I saw it out of sheer curiosity, and I'm not sorry I took the time. But I can't imagine taking the time to see it again unless I decide to write a dissertation on the pop culture cross of "Kung Fu Theater" and "Foxy Brown".
