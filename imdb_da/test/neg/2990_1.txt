Bad, ambient sound. Lots of shuffling. Loooong meaningless scenes. For example: guy looks interesting woman in the lobby. Managed to stay there and see her under the dam of waiting for the developer to get a package. Nothing stares scary. More mixed and other annoying ambient noise. Wait. Wait. Wait. Guy says nothing. Woman looks scared or at least slightly disturbed by it and rightly so. Manager comes back with package. Guy goes up to the apartment with the package. <br /> <br /> Another example: the guy and his host are watching bad TV. More ambient noise and shuffling. Wait wait wait wait. Guy walks into bed. If you can stand to pass more of this movie, you'll see them watch TV again later. <br /> <br /> If you want a story, watch any dialogue, entertainment, or well-made movie. Look elsewhere.
