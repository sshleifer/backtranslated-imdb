I really didn't care about that. Had they turned off the comedy / slapstick and focused on the script's dramatic / philosophical aspects, it could have been worth it. <br /> <br /> The more the movie went, the less I liked the main character / mailman. He has interesting things to say, but he is also a hypocritical, uncertain jerk. <br /> <br /> 3/10
