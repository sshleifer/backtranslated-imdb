I love Ben Kingsley and Tea Leoni. However, this is easily the worst movie I've seen in 10 years, and I see my share of movies. One stinks. This is a bad idea for a movie, badly done. Nothing about it is fun, trustworthy or interesting. I was looking for humor, irony and real humor. Instead, it looked like most of the cast members walked on the kit to make Tea Leoni an advantage. It's too bad, so trading talent was wasted on such hollowness. Do not want to. I have to wonder what perception the film recipients have of their audience submitting to them the idea of ​​Polish mobsters in Buffalo, NY, sending a contract killer to San Francisco to become a chief assistant while attending AA meetings. Bill Pullman must start reading scripts before he agrees to be in a movie. Sad.
