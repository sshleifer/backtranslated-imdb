I suppose "scarecrow Gone Wild" is a boring slasher flick. Yes, it has something good, but it is a rehash from another flick. The trades are so terrible, not the plot either. <br /> <br /> The story goes from a legend about a live scarecrow on the corn field. When an initiation becomes a prank and causes life a boy in danger, scarecrow comes alive and begins to kill madness. Sound confidential, right? It is derived from Scream, Friday the 13th, Jeepeer Creepers, Corners Children, you are called! <br /> <br /> 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' is then below average movie. Barely has a scary moment. Even the final scene is ridiculous! Unfortunately, we can still enjoy it as our time player. But I prefer to see something else instead. Unless you are a big fan of bad and cheesy movies, of course. <br /> <br /> 4/10
