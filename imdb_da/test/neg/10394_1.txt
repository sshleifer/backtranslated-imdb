The movie started very well .. so far Isabelle's exorcism can be believed .... but later, gosh !!! I didn't know if it was a horror movie, a drama or a must-see one! The possessed creature who attacks the sheriff had no connection whatsoever to the movie .... makeup !! well it looked right at first, but at the end the last part of the film, makeup (especially teeth and eyes) was very exaggerated. If you want a good "Exorcism" movie, see "The Exorcism of Emily Rose". Along with "Hard Candy" (Absolutely boring, pathetic plot and ending), these two movies are the worst I've seen from Lionsgate !! But well, the film authority has provided excellent movie film fans excellent movies, but with one you want you never rent it !! Exorcism movie fans, just be with two "The Exorcist" and "Emily Rose's Exorcism"
