While I am usually a big fan of John Turturro's work as an actor and instructor, ILLUMINATA is a big disappointment. Though the movie has some charming moments, it generally falls flat. Worst of all, the movie is confusing. Where is the movie set? Italy or an Italian troupe in New York? Why bother making a historical movie if it doesn't convey an attitude? If you want to see a welfare, inspirational historical film also about theater, watch Tim Robbins' The CRADLE WILL ROCK. This movie has many pluses, including a fine performance by John Turturro.
