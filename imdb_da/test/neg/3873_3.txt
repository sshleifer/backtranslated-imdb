The original title always struck me as a rather over-tight definition for a bunch of gun-based saddle tramp. still; their screen presence was at least emphasized by a top-quality group of actors in support of Yul Brynner. Most were movie stars in their own right. <br /> <br /> But; This first sequel was a pale imitation, with a group of largely B and C list players, who were more mediocre than magnificent. It was a similar setup. Brynner's' Chris' would recruit another team of gun-based saddle pads to resolve Mexican farmers' problems again. Another tyrant grieved them. <br /> <br /> With the original and freshness of the first movie now in use, this recovery had little to offer. The budget was apparently very limited. This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the sub-pair script, which lends much to the former classic. It was also more than half an hour shorter than John Sturges' original. Still, we still had a repetition of the disturbing and moralizing, who even made the first little turgid. But here there was no decent action, action or location work to balance things up. Filmiing was less expansive. It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a large part of the original. <br /> <br /> General; it just lacked imagination. The first movie had been a smash hit, and this pedestrian succession was obviously composed as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to cynically deposit past success. And it shows. There is a lot of 'made for TV' feel about it. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
