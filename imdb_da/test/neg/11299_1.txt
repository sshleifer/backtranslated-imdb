Synopsis: The sequel to the recognized silence of the lamb, Hannibal, is a great budget production that completely fails to deliver; Not only is it not as wise as its predecessor, it is not even a splatter or thrill or horror movie, just a totally dull time consuming. Don't be fooled by the media hype, and especially the stories of people throwing in the cinema and being psychologically arrested for the rest of their lives because of the brain's eating scene: in the movie it just comes as ridiculously bad SFX. Why so many people in this forum claim that H is "not all bad" and "worth looking at the big screen" etc, is beyond me; And it's not that bad either, it's good, it's just boring. I usually respect others' opinion, but in this case I must say that they clearly cannot tell **** from Shine - Ola. Perhaps they have been switched to media hype, perhaps they have never seen a Ridley Scott movie before and were impressed by his exaggerated use of backlighting, smoke and ubiquitous AC fans. H is completely without voltage; instead, we get endless scenes of Lecter swinging through an English-speaking Florence, a completely convincing and uninvolving plot with more holes than a fishing net (after seeing H, I actually awake half of the night trying to find all the holes in the plot, And when I wrote them down, I quickly filled 6 pages in small type before I forced myself to stop). Instead of wasting your time and money watching it on the big screen, I advise you to wait until it comes on TV for a few years; and then go to bed early. <br /> <br /> 1 / 10. Below are a few extra legs, I have to choose with Hannibal: <br /> <br /> - H _is_ the successor to SOTL, despite what some people in this forum claim . And although SOTL was a very hard action to follow, there are successors who are similar to their predecessors (SOTL itself was the successor to Michael Mann's "Manhunter", based on Thomas Harris's "Red Dragon"), and although the first episode was a very funny movie, SOTL was even better; another example would be the Alien series initiated by H's director Ridley Scott - so much for the theory of falling successors). In any case, it's an excuse that a movie is completely crap. <br /> <br /> - This film has a well-known instructor, it is based on a novel by the same author as SOTL, the casting is strictly A-list, great filmography, big budget, top-notch writers, yadda, yadda, yadda, and the end result is simply a joy in the church. So what went wrong? I think a lot of guilt is going to the film producer, Dino DeLaurentiis. Here is my interpretation: DDL produced "Manhunter" which, despite all its qualities, was a commercial flop. Disappointed, he gave the rights to the Hannibal Lecter character to Orion - free, so Jonathan Demme could make SOTL, and the rest is cinema history. The DDL then had to wait for ten years (he is now 81) until Thomas Harris finally came up with the sequel. I think at this point that DDL had lost all interest in making a good movie and was desperate to finally get his piece of cake before he jumped his cork. <br /> <br /> - Another aspect that I find extremely annoying about this flick is that it gets so much undeserved hype in the media; I think it's boring, yet one of the highest gross outputs ever, so there's no need to give it free advertising. And while most reviewers have told how the Dantesque scenes in Florence are and why Jodie Foster did not participate, it is simply that this movie is a complete, complete, non-mentioned UTTER flop. But there is more: Hannibal is not being hyped through the roof, it is also used as a media agenda putting an abundance of "documentaries" (usually left-overs from similar productions in the wake of SOTL) on serial killers, cannibalism and profiling. However, H doesn't even seem to be realistic; Lecter has also ceased to be a serial killer (he now kills only to help Clarice Starling), profiling is not even mentioned (because we already know HL so there is no need to create a profile) and there is also no cannibalism: Lecter gives birth to the drug Paul Krendler's own brain, so it does (erm) ignorant vivo - auto cannibalism. Try to make a documentary out of it. - There is much to say about the play: primarily if Julianne Moore can replace Jodie Foster, and Anthony Hopkins (who plays lead Hannibal Lecter) usually gets a lot of praise. I think all these discussions have been met. There are several of my favorite actors in this movie (namely Liotta, Oldman and Moore), but the script doesn't give them anything to work with. Same for Hopkins: There is no development in his character and he is not challenged in any way. And by the way, he plays almost identical characters in all his films, only in H he must make the strange murder and be paid the tidy sum of $ 11 million to do so.
