"It should have got good reviews," says g / f. If so, I can't find them. She goes out and sleeps and I endure. Michael Douglas as a good boy - now there is a new one. Matt Dillon all turned up. John Goodman misses his win. Paul Reiser runs around in BDSM leather. Oh, it's a rebellion okay. <br /> <br /> Hitchen is likely to lose interest soon. Liv Tyler plays femme fatale, and critics complain that she may not have registered for her side. But it is immaterial: this film is not about character development. In fact, I would go so far as to say that there is no character at all. What you need to appreciate here is the plot. <br /> <br /> No one is 'bad' in this movie. Some wonder why all these 'stars' - Reba is right here for goodness - sign up for such a scary project. Odds are they thought it would be fun. Maybe they have fun. Who knows? Hi - maybe they also got well paid. <br /> <br /> But you have to fork over money somehow to see this turkey. And that's probably not a good idea.
