I got a copy of this movie from a friend for my 21st birthday, which he had of course picked up for 99p from a negotiating cart. Never have I been so frustrated when I saw a movie - it was boring, Adam West was wasted (literally) and in retrospect I can't remember a single thing about it. My lack of enjoyment grew to such an extent that the other credits we rolled shattered the cassette and hung the tape around the living room. Just for a good measure we set fire to the cover.
