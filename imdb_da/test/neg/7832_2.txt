If you are an average guy like me and enjoy good acting, good plot, good scripts, new ideas or entertainment, you might skip this one. I was honestly bored from the opening credits to the end, but tried to give the film a chance and saw it all the way through - only to be disappointed with every turn. <br /> <br /> The action was incredibly sub-par, but I'm not sure if the actors themselves are due, or if it was the ridiculous tree and terrible dialogue combined with an even worse script. The reason is very vague and underdeveloped, and I think the audience is supposed to derive some kind of deeper meaning from it or be able to look past it somehow, but honestly doing so would be a waste of time. <Br /> <br /> The movie has some kind of sexuality that doesn't serve any purpose other than showing some tattoos and underwear. No one seems to have any motivation except to make money from a kind of "investment" agreement that is never really explained. The connections between the characters are not terribly clear and there is little or no sign development. <br /> <br /> This is either a kind of subculture movie intended for a very specific audience to enjoy or absolutely crap, but you can decide for yourself. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 2 because it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but probably not the worst.
