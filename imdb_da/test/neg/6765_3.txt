We chose to watch this movie as an alternative to The Polar Express, which appears at our local IMAX theater. What a waste of time and money! First, it's not sweet. Snowman sometimes looked demonic. Other times he was simply a zombie. He showed no expression or emotion for the most part, and his hollow blue eyes were just incredible. <br /> <br /> Secondly, Santa Claus is initially a film about the spirit to give. Santa and a snowman declare war on each other is a movie to give? I'm too little parody, but it was just not fun or entertaining. <br /> <br /> The idea that the snowman's whistle is his voice is different. Too bad you never see or hear the snowman playing his flute ... not even a "thank you" to Santa Claus. <br /> <br /> The only funny parts of the movie were "outtakes" at the end of the movie. Too bad they didn't use them in the movie. It would have been better.
