I agreed to watch this movie with a group of friends despite my extreme aversion to horror movies. However, it was not a shock of a monster that struck me by this movie, it was the horrible spectacle and absolutely obnoxious ending. Inside or the cavern has no redeeming qualities - it is poorly made, ridiculously scripted, morally bloody, and the inclusion of the free-spirited final scene rejects me. No, it's not my aversion to horror movies that makes me hate this movie. I have seen such wonderful teenage frees as "House of Wax", that is, the movie leaves you with the horrible understanding that by renting the video, you support the creators within
