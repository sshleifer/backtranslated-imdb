My bad girl, they ignored everything that was good to you. Why does it have so little to do with the comics as possible? I would have loved a movie that followed the plot, or at least the characters were right. WHY WAS TANK GIRL American? She is Austrailian, dammit! And she also doesn't live in a post-apocalyptic war zone, she lives in the outback with Booga as a wild. She does it because she wants to live that way, not because she has to, because Malcolm Mc Dowell seems git. And why does she look for these children? The only children in the comic strips are choked by her, it is terrible that they made her a lame figurehead. <br /> <br /> And my bad Jet Girl and Sub Girl! In the comics, Jet is a sarcastic wisecracker and Sub Girl is ... another sarcastic wisecracker with a strange sense of humor. In the film, Jet is this mousy little thing and Sub is this ditzy middle aged favor. And Booga doesn't look or act like what he's supposed to be either. Though perhaps hot roo / human love was too much for the US Treasury office? The humor was so sad. What happened to every thing about Smiths and the brilliant snake they used all the time? What kind of line is "Will it take a long time? I will not miss Baywatch." Even programs for young children can come up with better material than that.
