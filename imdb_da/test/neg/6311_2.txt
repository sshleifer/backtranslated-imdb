It's really just awful. Quaid surpasses more than Shatner. The part where Elvis goes in and says "You can get it all" just kills something that could have been good in this movie, which is bad enough as it is. Drug abuse was completely snowy, the only thing that had anything to do with his life was a little about him being married to his cousin. Quaid also does not look like Lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. I wish this could be restored in the future with someone who is not trying so hard. A bigger budget would not hurt and perhaps more about his actual life. I was very, very disappointed with Quaid. Don't look at this movie or you will stay too.
