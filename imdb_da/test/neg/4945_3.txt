I watch this movie as I write this. It's about 45 minutes in the movie, and there has been so much back and forth and empty drama, I can't quite see where it goes. No facts, just enough to let you make assumptions. The daughter of a daughter is painful. How was this ever made ??? Not the best of life's movies.
