This is a student movie, and it's a piece of shit. I would use much stronger language to describe it, but the summary would not be sent and the world should know beyond any reasonable doubt - this movie really SUCKS. <br /> <br /> There seems to be another ruler used to measure an already famous director's early work. Somehow it was genius that we were just too stupid to understand since he finally got it right now today. I don't buy it. The early movie "Bad Taste" made by LOTR Peter Jackson sucks and this "early work" from another famous director also sucks in the same way. These "early works" are representative of crappy everything, from budget to scripts to actors, etc. It is all the bottom of the debris waste. Don't be fooled by the big name. <br /> <br /> If you like to see a handful of male 70-year-old hippie outbreaks, they'll ever command a ship with the worst special effects you've ever seen - this is your movie. <br /> <br /> I can't believe this thing won a golden roll for the best special effects. It's a joke right? Or a joke award? <br /> <br /> To see what this movie wants it was to rent a season or three of the Red Dwarf you smeghead.
