A lot of forgettable 50's monster movies have really dreadful special effects - the "claw" in question is a huge doll that would make Jim Henson kill himself. I just watched the movie last Thursday, and I can't even tell who was in it. It's a bad sign. I say that when the film's premiered audience laughed it from the screen .... and it was in the 50s, since standards in special effects were much lower. Basically I should have gone out of the theater as soon as the words "produced by Sam Katzman" came on the screen if I knew what was good for me, but then I sat through "Harum Scarum" too, so I think I deserve it .
