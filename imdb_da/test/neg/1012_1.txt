OK, I just turned channels and caught DW3. I saw it knowing it would be garbage. BUT a person who has seen lots of movies, this one stands out as one of the cleanest bad movies I've ever seen ... I don't mind. It's so bad you have to see it as a bad accident you can't turn away from. Sometimes these movie types, IE, Troma movies ... but see Martin Balsam and Charles Bronson slum it up as if this is painful .... What's even more fun, I pulled up IMDb to see what other people said and it actually scores a 4.1 / 10 ??? I can't believe it made it past 1.5! Just as fun is this not even the top of this series ... somehow this waste required parts 4 and 5? And to top it all, some guys' comments here have referred to this as the best of the series and his favorite movie all the time ??? Statements like that scare me about this world!
