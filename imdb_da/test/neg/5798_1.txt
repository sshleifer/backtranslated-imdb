I can laugh at almost everything, but unfortunately there is not one in this smelly bomb! I honestly looked at this movie from the beginning to the end and didn't even smile. I am shocked that Sandler, Schneider, Spade etc. would put their names on this piece of shit. Worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst ever came out of former SNL players. What more can I say? How could such a tasteless, extremely creepy drive come from such a pool of apparent talent !! Maybe I have lost my sense of humor, (not likely), but I can't remember a movie that I haven't listened to for a long time. What a waste of 2 hours I will never come back.
