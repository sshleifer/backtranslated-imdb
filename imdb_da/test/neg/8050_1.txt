"Son, you must stop the experiments I have started !!" Too bad nobody said it too for the green who facilitated this project !! I was almost literally drawn to this movie by one of my friends for a midnight show that we were in high school. Now, a midnight movie in high school on a Friday night, don't expect much, but come on !! And after seeing it again years later, I know my original opinion about it. Great special effects but so what !! Probably one of the worst movies ever made. Unless you enjoy blood and gut and see some Hollywood veterinarians (Steiger & Hunter) do fool themselves for a buck. YUCK !!!
