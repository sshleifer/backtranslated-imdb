Completely un-funny "jokes" that fall flat, amateurish acts (with one or two exceptions), boring signs and dialogue, which at best are mediocre. After watching this movie, one has to wonder how a producer could cross a project like this and think, "I'm going to make this movie." No wonder it couldn't get a theatrical release.
