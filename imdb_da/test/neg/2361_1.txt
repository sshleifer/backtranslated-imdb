I can't believe how this atrocity managed to catch hearts and thoughts about a cross section of the 'bright young things' in its era, but I'm sure I wouldn't. In my opinion, it is an inaccurate, poorly acted, weakly scripted, pretentious piece of gumpf. The short excursions to an imagined reality bludge any humor to death. The situations are unbridled exaggerations which make the already stupid characters even more incredible and abominable. The romance is boring, the end is unsatisfactory and destroys the only sensible medicine message in the movie, and the simple plot ('Withnail and I', 'Fear and Loathing') is tested to the extreme with the film's uninteresting movement. In short, this movie as a blatant visual assault without nothing about skill or initiative. I condemn it to the story of the ash hill and ask it to remain there.
