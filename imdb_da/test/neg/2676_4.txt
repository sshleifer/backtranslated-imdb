"Curse of Michael Myers" is a very frustrating piece to deal with for a fan of the Halloween series. After a very disappointing letdown in Halloween 5, the series reached a close ebb in plot lines with a silly devolution in witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to the worship of Michael Myers. "The stifle of Michael Myers" behaves ante in blood and does, but really represents a decay in the series' integrity. It's too bad, as this is the final movie for Donald Pleasance as the character of Dr. Loomis. Pleasance has some good screen moments (precious if you're a fan of the series) as the very old one and as he says "very retired doctor". Unfortunately, he died before the film was completed, and it is very clear at the end of the film that the stories of the original climatic scene were never realized. From the very beginning, Halloween 6 has more of the feel of a made-for-TV movie than the block-buster horror flick that it started out as in 1978. Any loyal Halloween alumni should have demanded more from this movie. .. Dr. Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserved more.
