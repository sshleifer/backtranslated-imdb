When Roger Corman attached this production, I had great hopes for this movie. Corman directed many memorable low budget horror flicks in the 1960s. I especially enjoyed his adaptations of Poe's stories like "The House of Usher" and "The Pit and Pendulum" and "The Raven" staring the late great Vincent Price. These films had solid, atmospheric excitement, strong characterization, exciting plot development and some chilling moments. Unfortunately, The Damned House mostly sacrifices these qualities instead of cheesy low budget special effects, free nudity and mindless gore topped with cliché quick edits and camera angles. <br /> <br /> "House Of The Damned" starts interesting with some beautiful spells in Ireland, but it's just downhill from here, unfortunately, instead of spending some time building the atmosphere, creating signs we maybe caring or building excitement - the director chooses to start running up the body counting After a brief introduction to the protagonists, a young couple and their daughter, the audience spends the balance in the movie, pushed from a "spooky" event to another who in this movie replaces a coherent plot development, the protagonists are so poorly conceived and so poorly behaved - the audience does not care what is happening to them.To make matters worse, the "spooky" events are either completely cliché or unconvincing because of low technology - Low budget special effects. The soundtrack has been lifted from the "The Omen." The reason why there is little, was loans heavily from "Poltergeist" and "The Legend Of Hell House", but lack any of The qualities that made these movies compelling. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in looking good haunted house flicks, I recommend checking out classics like `The Haunting (1963) '' The Innocents (1961) or looking at Corman's early American international film and passing on ' House of the Damned 'unless you are masochistic or thoughtless. <br /> <br /> 3 ½ out of 10. <br /> <br /> Rob Rheubottom <br /> <br /> Wpg, MB.
