I bought this movie and hoped it would be another great killer toy movie. I'm a big fan of the Child's Play series and hoped to see the same here. Boy, was I wrong. Most of the movie was not least scary, but the only time we really see Pinocchio "live" are the last few scenes in the movie. The little girl in the movie, her acting is so bad, it's almost ridiculous. Finally, the end never showed what happened to the puppet or what made them put the little girl in an asylum or where she was at the end of the movie. So, in my opinion, this movie is the worst of the "killer toy" genre. If you want a good killer toy series, stick to the Child's Play franchise. Pinocchio's Revenge is a waste of money and time.
