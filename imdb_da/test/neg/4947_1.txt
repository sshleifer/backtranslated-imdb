This was unacceptable. (SPOILER # 1) Main characters avoid the meaningless revelation of agonizing truths to their loved ones for not giving up status and assuming the roles of antagonists. (SPOILER # 2) The authors wanted us to believe that the exposure of multiple violations of the offender poses a threat and causes a retaliatory response of the primary victim to the offenses. (SPOILER # 3) Until the last 15 minutes I expected a score of 6 to 8 out of 10; Instead, it was like discovering that lieutenant Columbo dog is the real killer. The story just wasn't credible, and I don't think the world's best director could have saved it without massive editing.
