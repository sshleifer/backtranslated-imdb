While I'm not a woman, I can enjoy a chicken if it's good. However, this one is beyond bad. You have it in the history of the book, the girl gets divorced, boy with problems shows up. BOOM magic happens and his demons are banished when she understands that her life has a new purpose. <br /> <br /> Now that I can think that things can happen, I'm not an idiot. It would not happen during a weekend of geriatric rumpy pumpy, it would take time. But here the producers know that they only have 1 hour and 30 minutes, so they force the two changes to happen, I assume that one night will be hammered and one night of gramps and grandmother go on what dogs in heat can be enough If you thought Romanesque novels were the gospel ... but most people don't. <br /> <br /> Now, if that's not enough ... the producers remembered that a chick flick should make the viewer cry ... Well, they were trying to make you cry with the two seniors who got jiggy with it by fail ... so how could they beat you again? Why I know, let's kill one of the characters for no good reason, unless a random death will surely bring a tear to the eye ... and now we can get the teen daughter magically bonded with heart-breaking mother for no reason besides the fact that it would be nice (totally unreal, but who cares). So there you have it ... girl find boy, boy find love, death find boy and mother crying ... What a movie - NOT.
