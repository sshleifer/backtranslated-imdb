This film was a waste of celluloid it was printed on. It is a disastrous scene, as a particularly cruel train wreck. <br /> <br /> Seeing this is like trying to explain the meaning of life. The main point is that the character Steve Guttenberg plays is a party animal that should not gamble because it would offend his parole. The children he turns to refuse to play with him as a coach for a while because he gambles. BUT ... a few minutes later, after winning the championship, a huge amount of money saves their shelter. And where did they get the money? GAMBLING !!! Add this to the creepy scenes in the funeral home (why are there really bedrooms in a funeral home?) And the useless peripheral character
