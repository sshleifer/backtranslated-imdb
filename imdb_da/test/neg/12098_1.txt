This is one of the worst anime series I have ever seen. When I looked at the manga map in a magazine, I thought it might be interesting, but when I got the chapters I realized that it was a complete stupidity. OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are OK and the series has a standard. But as the plot develops, it becomes completely incoherent. The series tries to show something mysterious based on Christian mythologies, but it is a total stupidity. It has some demons and stigmata scenes ... Absolutely nonsense. The series seems to be deeply thought, complex or mythologically reviewed, but a guard with a bit of brain and cultural references will soon realize that all the elements used do not have a real sense: they are only set to IMPRESS The main chapters! The last chapters are full of nonsense elements: fights with cat-ridden demons, references to a presumably battle between demons and demons that control time (without apparent reason). Finally, it's completely nonsense; an ignorant guard will look at a floating finale that gives them a place to meditate; But the truth is this: The final and the complete series are a total coherent and inappropriate uncertainty.
