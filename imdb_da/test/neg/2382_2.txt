Ugh. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I've seen for a long time. None of the characters are externally sympathetic, making this movie difficult to see. They are all miserable thirty-year-olds who do not take responsibility for their curvy lives. I was only able to do it for half an hour of the movie, so there is a chance that got better afterwards, but I doubt it. I cannot imagine five people being self-absorbed, as they are able to remain friends with each other for ten years. Three sex scenes in the first half hour were also disappointing as they had no relevance to the plot and were clearly a free attempt to bring something to this otherwise bad movie. <br /> <br /> Save your time and money and skip this movie.
