The film gets a score of 3 because it dared to be so much different. It has a cast function while you can hear their thoughts and desires! This is really a strange movie and an experience I will not forget. The only problem is that the experiment, although interesting in some ways, is generally rather boring and unengaging. In fact, it's amazing that a Norma Shearer and Clark Gable movie could be this boring! The movie is based on a Eugene O'Neill game, and it really seems pretty stagy. In fact, it would have been best to keep it as a stage production - it didn't translate at all into the big screen. <br /> <br /> So this movie is only recommended for die-hard cinemaniacs and those who love Gable movies so much, just watch all his movies!
