I often wonder how movies like this are done, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to see them. <br /> <br /> With Aksar, the director seems to have made the story when he joined, adding phrases when he liked, no matter how ridiculous they were. The script was not existing with inane dialogues such as "Jo Sheena Roy Pehenti Hai, Wahee Fashion Hota Hai" and "Yeh Versace Hai Madam". Yes, it was right. Each of the figures was low and underdeveloped. The deals were terrible. Pieces (lycra to Udita and horrible costumes for a tired emran), rooms (the many houses used for interiors were not even vagally resembling a Victorian mansion), manuscripts, etc. Etc. Only a wordbook. <br /> <br /> For those who love Hashmi and his movies, see it. For me, I will never get the two and a half hours back. The only redeeming factor was some of the music that was decent.
