I've read the other user comments and I'm glad someone compared it to the original Kamal called Perumarzhakalam released in 2004. The original had a tight story and no loopholes as described above about the Indian government not having proper records or even bad shots and bloopers. The story is amazing and a meticulous and well-described by others. But unfortunately, Nagesh, who takes credit for it as his own story, is a sad thing and does nothing but plagiarism. <br /> <br /> I suppose he's been hit by Bollywood's so-called "inspired" syndrome. <br /> <br /> At least he must give credit where it's due. <br /> <br /> I liked some of his older movies, but now I guess if any of them were originals. <br /> <br /> Here is a link in IMDb to the original masterpiece. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425350/#comment I recommend everyone to see the original, even with subtitles, if necessary, to know which class direction and class action is about.
