This is a very strange item from Hollywood. Apparently, it didn't test well because actors who have footage in the credits have been completely edited out of the movie, which means a quick-cut job was done on it. It feels like it was destroyed by the usually competent Demmas hands and just thrown away. On the other, it is so completely lacking in substance that perhaps nothing could save it. It has no real center, either narrative or early. Although it says that the maturity is 92 minutes, I seem to remember it ends suddenly, about 80 minutes of mark. It is over before it even goes. It's pretty much laugh. <br /> <br /> The benefits of the "Matthew Modine Image" were so scary when the Luke Wilson image is now.
