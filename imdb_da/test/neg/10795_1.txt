I have seen both the MST3K version and the unknown version. I enjoyed it a little. It wasn't too bad with a movie. Sure it went a little slow at times. I liked it. <br /> <br /> As far as MST3K goes, they only did the movies they could get the rights to. Not all the movies they cracked apart, how bad movies, it was just that easy to get fun of them. Take SoulTaker. <br /> <br /> Joe Estevez and Robert Z'Dar's characters, where so lifeless and boring stupid, I couldn't help laughing. I couldn't take them seriously. It really created a unique feeling. <br /> <br /> Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script. A world better than 95% of the waste in the theaters today. Her role was played well. Not too screaming not to be masculine, but just right. The camera really likes her in this movie. I would have thrown her in the role after the clear script. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie deserves a little more credit than it is given. Please see the unknown version if you see MST3K. It deserves so much.
