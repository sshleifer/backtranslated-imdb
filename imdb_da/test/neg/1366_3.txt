This is one of the religious horror films that never explains why the forces of "evil" are 10,000 times stronger than the "good" forces. We have here a satanic cult who can: 1) "beam away" people (as in "Star Trek"), 2) kill through toddler dolls, 3) transfer a soul from one body to another, 4) hypnotize telepathically from a greater distance and 5) cause drastic car accidents, where selected persons become spaghetti, while others (children in this case) survive undamaged. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the forces "good" can: 1) sit around helplessly, 2) stand around cluelessly, 3) panic, 4) laugh hysterically, 5) waste time doing nothing, 6) Reading comics while people are slaughtered by dozens and 7) arriving late for satanic rituals In every religious horror movie I have to assume that the world of film is inhabited by God and Satan, and I must also assume that Satan cannot be 1,000. In other words, where were the priests in this movie who knew something? The best thing that this film's priest could do is that there are some witches about - nothing else. - reading all the books in his study At first glance, this priest becomes catatonic, so laughs hysterically, only to end in a great panic attack, so this should be God's contribution to fighting Satan? Ridiculous. Every good religious horror movie have the "good" powers that are equipped with one or the other n form of (more or less) supernatural power or at least some concrete knowledge of how to fight for evil. In that sense, this movie is quite idiotic. As it is Martin's casting to play the high priest (!) Of the cult. There is very little threat or awe in seeing the ornate Martin lead a satanic ritual. I mean, it didn't have to be Christopher Lee or Langhella, but couldn't they have found any less fun looks? Also, why does the couple return to the city after their car is put out of service? After their "friendly" meeting with the city's folk music, no sane person would have gone back; they should just go further. Man's explanation to his girlfriend (and viewer) is that "who knows what is in that direction".
