"What symbolism!" exclaimed a woman when we left the theater after seeing the Polish brother's paean to Ingmar Bergman. Some symbolism is there okay. But not much. "Northfork" adds some fine acting weakened by dreary filmography that doesn't give a coherent statement and a confused story that irritates rather than enthralls. <br /> <br /> Northfork is a city that faces extinction after a new hydropower is in operation. It is early to the mid-1950s and a group of identically dressed state agents, all of whom appear to have just replied to a casting call for "The Untouchables", have worked to relocate restrained residents who did not Appreciate both their immediate danger as well as the offered bounty to move. An exciting anti-development film is always an option, but let's be real: Rural electrification is one of the biggest advances in bringing decent living conditions and an increased economy in American history. Ponds can be built without forced relocation? Not in this country. <br /> <br /> But this movie is less about homeowner's situation than it is a fantastic creation of a dying young boy's escapist imagination. Nick Nolte is the pastor who tends to leave the bed, and much of what he says could have been interesting if the sound was clear enough to hear. <br /> <br /> Switching between the black suitable evacuation agents (working for "lakefront" land when the dam creates the valuable area) and a phantasmagorous collection of weirdos, the film develops neither theme coherent nor even interesting. <br /> <br /> The camera is poor. A washed out, subdued and depressive color permeates the entire movie for a small dramatic purpose. There is no reason why this large terrain should be depicted so bleak. In fact, a contrast between virtually untouched natural beauty and the massive and gloomy solidity of the developing dam and power plants would have been very effective. <br /> <br /> 4/10.
