Unfortunately, I went to this movie for entertainment, based on the limited information I had seen at Fandango. Since I'm a sci-fi buff, the idea of ​​a movie about UFOs has interested me. <br /> <br /> Instead, this film revealed itself as an evangelical Christian propaganda girl. Appropriate to an audience of like-minded individuals, but very unchristian likes to exploit the scene of the film center and preach to an unsuspecting audience, especially considering the cost of tickets and concessions. Shame on you! At least, the Da Vinci Code did not keep its wild eye. <br /> <br /> So this B-grade movie (and I am kind) will be appreciated in the churches with similar beliefs, probably shown to Wednesday and Sunday evening youth groups. But if you are a mainline Christian or non-Christian, you will not be comfortable.
