First, I am a big fan of Tolkien, and as one I will base most of my critic on his books. <br /> <br /> The film is a standard adventure movie, well made with nifty special effects, nice sound tracks and fine acting. Now if this movie was called something other than the master of the rings, the reviews would not be half as good as they are here. The film's problem is that it takes the basic story line from Tolkien's books, but then it goes and "hollywood's" all that can, many scenes from the book lack eighter or change quite a bit, the characters change from the book too, a thing that I think should be punished! What the film lacks is a deep insight into the characters in what I know it is almost impossible to make a good movie out of a good book, and it did not work here eighter, for the most part the motivation of the characters left behind unclear at best. As an adventure movie, it would rate 7+ / 10 As an adaptation of Tolkien, it rates 2/10 <br /> <br /> Honestly, what in earnest was Arwen at rivendell ford? And as for the comments that this movie "is the best ever", I can only say that eighter you are very young or you have not seen good movies ... Peter Jackson should have called this movie an adventure movie based on the Lord of the Rings .
