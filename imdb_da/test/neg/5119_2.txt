After watching this movie I felt like I had just eaten a box of outdated, cool cracker jack only to find no price inside. This movie has a real promise: pornstars in a skinemax feature! Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell the producers that we like some T&A in our T&A FLICKS !!! Sure, we get a few quick flashes and a few "baths in the creek" scenes. But where is sexy? How can you have four girls, "sorority girls" no less in this type of movie with only one, pitiful 5 second lesbian scene? Goodnight, USA Up All Night gives more titillation! See, we're not looking at this type of movie for great movie, writer or action. We want to see some kink! What a letdown.
