Stephen Bach's recent death, one of the producers of HEAVEN'S GATE, has raised the ghost of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the damned film. In addition, the original release, the "long version" recently shown on TCM, was postponing the movie to its largest audience ever. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie as it first appeared on a packed screening in a 3rd Avenue cinema across the street from Bloomingdales. I think it was released on a Friday and withdrawn on the following Wednesday. Maybe it wasn't a fair release, but it was and is a horrible movie. See the full length version recently confirmed this judgment and with more than thirty years more experience watching and writing about movies, I can better formulate why. <br /> <br /> First, there is the dreaded phrase "mise-a-scene" whose definition is so simple yet so amorphous that it puzzle even after being defined. Basically it is all that happens in front of a camera. For example, an extra crowd will be given a piece of action, just say go by on the sidewalk and a place to start from. When assistant director calls action, the extra will go through their action. If there is another, take the extra back to the starting point and go back to "action". All additional features do this. Then a cab drive says up to the sidewalk and the star comes out and embraces another principal while constantly the amount of extras doing their thing. This is the mise-one scene. In the theater they call it blocking, but the cinema is far more multidimensional. <br /> <br /> The importance of defining the mise-one scene is that when French critics developed their theory of the author opposite of an author, a metier-one scene, even more exceptionally, was termed a " traffic politician ". An author was intimately involved in the meaning of a movie and through the director's work style a theme or themes distinguished. The metier-one scene was basically a business man who reproduces in film what had been handed over to him on paper. That's the difference between saying John Ford and Sam Wood. <br /> <br /> The second point is how director Michael Cimino entered the film management position. Cimino first became prominent in managing the first million dollar TV commercial. This depicted a Chevrolet floating down the Grand Canal in Venice. This commercial never appears on any lists of major TV commercials from time to time and is remarkable only because of how expensive it was and how completely exaggerated it was. The effect is like that of a three-year-old girl brought out to entertain company that gets her biggest answer when she whistles her dress over her head. Sweet for a three year old, embarrassing for a thirty year old. So Cimino was praised early to spend a large amount of money on some over-the-top images, and then he learned. <br /> <br /> His first film, THUNDERBOLT AND LIGHTFOOT (1974), features a scene where Clint Eastwood and Jeff Bridges are passengers in a lunatic car traveling back and forth until it leaves the road and The driver opens the trunk full of rabbits, which he continues to shoot one by one. I had the feeling that if the producer Eastwood hadn't stepped in, the scene would have lasted until every rabbit had been killed. <br /> <br /> Which brings us to HEAVEN'S GATE. I guess if you watch the movie on a DVD in snatches as a mini-series, it can be impressive. This is because scenes are aimed at such a dense mise-one scene that each scene is like an encyclopedia, it's just exhausting to sit through nearly four hours of this. Its like sex, at some point it just becomes a whipping. There is a 40-minute opening at Harvard. Brillant photographed in Oxford, it is something of a non-sequitur. I personally favor the artistic way of unfolding a story as opposed to the more commercial - "Now I'll tell you what to tell you" about most movies. But the whole preface only adds one line - Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt went to Harvard together. Now twenty years later ?? All the time, money and effort, not to mention all the attention and energy of the audience, just to provide this almost useless information. <br /> <br /> There is the stage in the street between Kristofferson and Masur, which just goes back and forth with a populated city of background extras and horse-drawn vehicles in the background in continuous motion to deliver a little bit of exposure information. It's just so exhausting. There is only one scene after another like this. It's like trying to eat fifty pounds of pizza. Then there are these long conversations of inconsistent details and incomprehensible, unclear dialogue that go on and on and are exhausting and boring. <br /> <br /> Of course, every single scene looks widespread brilliant. All in all, it is a rich piece to span commendable articles. Seen in snatches with the possibility of fast forwarding through the boring bits or turning it off, if one feels mise-a-scene whipped, it is basically painless. But don't let anyone tell you it's a good movie. When I saw it in 1980 there was a guy sitting in front of me who commented on the scene where Kris Kristofferson is on his horse, and he turns a road and then the other and does it about six times. "It's symbolic," he said, "he doesn't know which way to go." It is basically the core of any Heaven's Gate criticism. <br /> <br /> See it if you need to, but beware, it's not a movie whose time has come, it's a stinker that will smell all the time. <br /> <br /> HEAVEN'S GATE is historically incorrect in the extreme. I recommend the book BANDITTI OF THE PLAINS by Asa Mercer at Johnson County War.
