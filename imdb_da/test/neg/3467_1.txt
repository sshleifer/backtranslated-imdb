Many of the negative reviews here focus on the historical accuracy of this movie. OK, it had almost as much to do with the actual NFL as your average war movie has to do with an actual war, or a Western has to do with the true "old west". So I think we should give them an artistic license that fits it. <br /> <br /> The problem here is that the director (Clooney) seems to be doing a screw-basketball comedy means a) doing stupid things b) mugs for the camera, and c) taking stupid scenes full of mugging and stretching them all out too long. Screwball comedies need a fast pace, not necessarily frenetic, but moving fast all the time. Here pulls and pulls and pulls. After watching this movie, it will enable you to appreciate how brilliant Mack Sennett was when he pioneered the genre with his Keystone Cops. After 90 years, you think executives would have studied the old masters and learned something or two, maybe even better at things a little. But no, it was as if someone had seen a car pioneer who built a Duesenberg, and almost a century later, shouted and "improved" on the concept by scratching a stroller with square wheels. <br /> <br /> I have had several of Clooney's films, I consider him a gifted actor. But very few players can competently lead themselves; Clint Eastwood took a while to get it. Clooney is clearly at the bottom of a very steep slope. The film becomes more visible during the very few times he is out of the frame, but when he is in the picture, he makes himself the center of attention. In the battle scenes, his tremor is so unpleasant that you want someone to dump him for real. <br /> <br /> If you make a screwball comedy and want some romance thrown in, you must develop some chemistry between the male and female driver. Clooney and Zellweger have all the chemistry of couple of dumpsters sitting in a parking lot. No spark, no sizzle, not even a slaughter after slaughter. Zellweger, which has also shown some really good films, must have traded with its botox injections for oak tannin, which gives a fantastic wood performance. She could just have pulled the "hard in a man's world" action if she had just looked into the camera with a little half smile and glimpse into the eye. But no, she kept her jockstrap cinched up close at the end. <br /> <br /> Of course, the biggest sin here is that the movie is simply not fun. Doing stupid things is not the same as slapstick. Making stupid things very inventive, like Stooges, or very athletic like Buster Keaton, can be fun. But otherwise it is boring and well stupid. I think I got a good laugh out of the whole movie. <br /> <br /> Avoid this. I saw it for free on cable, and still wanted my money back.
