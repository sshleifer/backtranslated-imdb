I would be one of the few people who own a copy of this classic. But I do not only own 1, I actually own 2. It's so good. Well, when I say good, I mean bad. But I will try to do a thorough review. I even saw 'born a ninja' as one of the other reviewers here mentioned to compare it to this. And born a ninja is actually worse, but not quite as fun. <br /> <br /> And it's ever fun. Everything about this movie is poor. EVERYTHING. The plot is completely full (note 'you must keep me alive if you want to know where you find your wife'). Each action sequence is also full. Our hero's canon is more than a hero; he can stab people with twigs, take 3 balls in the heart of 50 cm away without even bleeding and tie a rope up to a tree, which when an enemy steps on it, attaches a knot around the founder bone, picks him up and throws him 50 meters in a bunch of spikes. The action is so bad, it's impossible to comment on it, but it must have you rolling, especially the dantons' jumping out of the ground and crying at the bad guy. ‚ÄùOh yes, and the bad ones: Somehow they think to revive 5 times each in the movie. Maybe it's just that there were not enough actors, but in a movie of this caliber? I doubt it. "The Plot is about how danton was a soldier in the Vietnam War, And now his colonel chases real people for training for his mercenaries. The colonel just happens to get danton, as danton fights back. This is just the excuse for a rambo clone, where most of the movie is danton slaughtering soldiers. And I really can't explain the plot anymore because there is nothing else for the movie. It still rocks. <br /> <br /> What else could be wrong you ask? Don't let me get started. Hand grenades that actually go out on the actors' feet because the explosion is the size of a fight. Sets where there are 5 people chasing danton, then the camera cuts back and forth and there is 7. The way each time danton reads the grenade launcher he is against the same background, even though he is in quite different places. And the worst part is when danton pushes the plastic blocks on the enemies, and an enemy is completely untouched by the mountains, so he doesn't know what to do so he dies half-heartedly without being touched. It's ridiculous !!! <br /> <br /> But fun. Very, very fun. This is one of the few movies I can thoroughly recommend to anyone, if you don't find it fun, you're 1 in a million. And for the rest of us it's magical.
