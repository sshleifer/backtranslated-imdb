I didn't want to write this movie on reviews and critics in the Western world, I mean, how wrong have they been about Asian cinema that has now become a stiff diet of Hollywood remake monster? Plus Jet L is pretty amazing and he has made some interesting movies in Asia. So with an open mind, I was surprisingly average of this movie. <br /> <br /> There are good points. The story is very clever, using M-Theory as a base to convey the plot, that there are several universes each with their own versions of worlds, and probably you. Every time one of you is destroyed, the rest shares energy and power among them. The idea that somebody might try to become the only edition of himself in all universes to find out if they become a God. There is also Jet Li and he is not a bad actor and pretty nimble as a martial artist, plus Jason Statham, an all-round good actor. As for the special effects, some of them are really cool, a blend of bullet time and slow motion at normal speed, very cool to look at places. The bad points? Good Statham's accent is terrible and some of the effects are not as comparable as others, so it is quite clear that money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others who were probably considered too short on the screen, or They just run out of budget. <br /> <br /> A big sore point for me is the tightly trimmed camera action that Hollywood has long favored, something Jackie Chan has often talked about. Filming battle scenes close up serves two purposes. It gives more weight to a single stroke or movement, making it look harder and more real than it really is, and it also hides what is going on around the camera lens. For example, people holding a fake arm or face on a stunt double, etc. What Chan always said was that he was trying to open the camera and show the audience what was going on, let them see the people fighting properly rather than a close-up of a face and a fist and cuts to someone who falls into the frame. Showing the whole picture is more effective and it is more impressive. <br /> <br /> So the dense cropped shots were just more annoying than anything you couldn't see impressive Li's fighting skills, and you found it hard to see any of the action. Pull down the cuts and pan the camera Hollywood Directors! The biggest problem was the story, though they had such a strong base to build, they seemed to loosen the plot's feel and concentrate on the action scenes. There are some serious plot buildings and explanatory moments that are just completely overlooked and covered by a few sentences, but these could have formed an excellent and complex character development. <br /> <br /> It was just all together held together weakly, and not enough of the story. All in all, not a good movie and its potential was badly spoiled.
