Of course, Sadie is by far the worst show I've ever seen, it's such a piece of sh ** and loaded with complete bullsh **. I didn't find any of the gags to be funny or anything wise, they were all horrible jokes. The actor sucks, many of the characters sucked by acting, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) are such a horrible actor, the other characters also suck (Magaret, Rain, Hal). The reason is not unique and creative at all, and the show is so much predictable. This is one of the worst shows ever made, it should not even have been made, the idiots responsible for writing this waste must be fired (if they do not already have it). The fist period was actually visible, but the second season was just a disaster, it's too hard to see this show, it's beyond terrible.
