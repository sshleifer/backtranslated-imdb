OK, let's start with the best. the building. Although it was hard to believe that it had electricity and running water after 35 years and a fire, the horrible walls and odd things were found all over interesting. Other than that, it's not worth it. <br /> <br /> As far as bad, it's made by WWE movies. WTF? do you have to get it to see it? If anything, stay away. horrible, horrible idea for them to make movies and allow Gregory Dark to correct it. bad choice. The previews in advance were more interesting and entertaining. <br /> <br /> I can't even begin to discuss how bad this movie is. untalented actors & a disappointing, vague storyline. Apparently many of the actors are from the show "All Saints". It is a wonder why I have never heard of them or their show. Apart from that, the bus driver, whom you never even see, just closing the door, has had more action than almost everyone. At least he handles stunts for some decent movies. <br /> <br /> I like watching scary movies I really do. but this blew so much, the whole audience laughed at it and cheered the characters halfway through. very annoying. the child behind me was yelping more during feasibility studies of other horror films. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie to see, even less if you have to pay for it.
