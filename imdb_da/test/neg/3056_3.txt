It's hard to decide if this movie is suffering from crap dialogue or if it is just made to appear by crap actors. In any case, it suffers from storywriting, which at best is mediocre. <br /> <br /> Even though it was made in the late 80's, the first part of the movie plays like a 60's teen screwball comedy (excluding the absence of actual humor), especially the part of it good girl 'who is as annoying a Doris Day figure as you could hope / fear, including the little whiny opposition to something' fun 'that her friends will do. The net effect is after a while you start hoping she will bite it so that you no longer have to listen to her voice. <br /> <br /> Some beauty and free naked and some really 80s style clothes are your only clue that this movie was made in the 80s. Oh, and also a beautiful passable music. <br /> <br /> Storywise is quite a formal thing. A bunch of horny (apart, of course, from 'miss nice girl') teenagers decide to celebrate Halloween night by throwing a party in a haunted house. Partying and fornication are accompanied by an inappropriate 'seance' that starts the demonic possession spree, which is the subject of the film. Then the only exciting part tries to guess in what order the characters expire. You are sure not to care about whether they want to. The actors are so bad that demons / zombies / dinner actually improve their performance and the ridiculous clich√© dialogue is so annoying that you crawl into your seat. <br /> <br /> Gorewise, this flick is not nuthin 'special, unless you think cheesy is a kind of "special". For example, the demon head, which occasionally appears, is so frighteningly fake that you wonder if it's a 5-year trick-or-treating. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that there is no fun in the girl. Some of the music is not half-bad, and the first of our greasy Scooby bands to become occupied performs a fantastic and really sexy dance window at some point before she gets uncomfortable. Also, and I don't know why I actually got anything involved at the end of the girl. The excitement lacking in most of the film made a delayed appearance, and I started scrubbing out of turmoil instead of irritation. As is what a horror movie has to do. <br /> <br /> I can't bring myself to give this movie a rock-bottom rating, then by an inexplicable miracle (I don't rule out being in possession of demons) I was actually a little scared. <br /> <br /> Don't pay money to see it. It's hardly worth your time, but only hard money. Watch it on YouTube while it's there.
