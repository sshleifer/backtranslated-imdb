I don't know who financed it or why, but this "will be" vampire girl is really terrible. It is trying to be hip and appealing to the young MTV generation audience, but it's just ridiculous. The action is horrible and the management is horrible. I heard the budget was $ 600,000. I want to know where all the money went?
