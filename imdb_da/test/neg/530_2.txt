Two things are always a sign that you are going to see a bad movie: <br /> 1) If you are immediately reminded of other movies such as TERMINATOR, HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER under the title sequence <br /> < br /> 2) If there is a death during a sex scene just after the title sequence <br /> <br /> There is actually a third warning sign and that a caption indicates lazy exhibition warning the poor ignorant naive audience of the dangers of the corporate greed. Guess what ? CYBORG 2 starts with a caption that warns us about the greed of companies in the future followed by a title sequence reminding me of TERMINATOR, HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER followed by a death in a sex scene! Hey, you don't suppose I want to see a bad movie with any chance? <br /> <br /> As you can guess, it's a bad movie. It is basically a series of action scenes written around a thread just plot of a cyborg on the run from a greedy company. It is poorly written, directed and acted and especially it is very lit, which means that it is very difficult to see what is happening on the screen, although I am not quite sure that this is actually a bad thing. The only interest to be is that it is the film mine debut of Angelina Jolie who plays the cyborg along the way and who says the prophetic line "They are lovely, I wonder if they are real?" Which is something I ask myself when I see one of her movies
