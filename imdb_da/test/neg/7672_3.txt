Some slacks can be cut this movie because of the fact that it was made in 1979. So much so, it's really pretty dire. <br /> <br /> Never mind the ridiculous back-projection or the horrible, horrible camera-tracking of suspected "in-flight" objects, these are the stunts that Concorde pulls off that make you blink in disbelief in the absurdity. Barrel rolls, loop-the-loops and violent "evasive" maneuvers left me wondering why the world forces did not just fly Concordes as their main warriors. So here are the important lessons I learned from this celluloid cheese party: <br /> <br /> 1. The Concorde is at least as excited as a jet fighter 4. <br /> <br /> 2. You can turn off a flare gun at Mach 2 by simply opening the cockpit window and sticking out the arm. <br /> <br /> 3. If the flare gun does not discharge, do not drop it as it may go away. <br /> <br /> 4. The Concorde can dodge up to two Sidewinder missiles fired at it at once. <br /> <br /> 5. A flare will distract a heat-seeking missile each time. <br /> <br /> 6. Interrupting your jet engines is a sure fire to throw out heat-seeking missiles if 5 (above) fails. <br /> <br /> 7. When driving in Concorde, it seems impossible to dilute your fuel in advance. <br /> <br /> 8. Concorde pilots are all trained veterans. <br /> <br /> As you may imagine, this movie is not very realistic. The effects are primitive by today's standards, and combined with the nonsense robotics that Concorde does, make it a movie that deserves little but scorn. <br /> <br /> Not recommended. Not recommended at all!
