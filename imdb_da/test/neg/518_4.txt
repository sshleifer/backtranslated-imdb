"Submerged" is certainly not "the worst movie ever". It has its faults, such as loan recordings, crazy script and non-existent special effects (these are the worst), but it also has some good points as well. The action is surprisingly good, there are lots of familiar faces that you probably know if you are a b-movie fan like me. I was delighted to see Brent Huff play one of the heroes, know him most for his 80s action movies, and I must admit he is not a bad actor at all. Fred Williamson, Maxwell Caulfield & Tim Thomerson get a little limited screen time but are trustworthy in their parts. "Eye candies" in this Fred Olen Ray movie are Yvette Nipar and Nicole Eggert, both looking very sexy and very significant. Michael Bailey Smith adds some muscles to the background as a Navy SEAL. Unfortunately, the only throwing member who, in my opinion, is completely out of place, is Coolio. He does not act at all, speaks as if he did not even read the manuscript, and being a badass at the beginning of the film is shot like a wimp an hour later. Not a good choice. <br /> <br /> To sum up this movie, this is not that bad choice for late night entertainment. If you can get over the special effects (so many weapons, so much fire and not a single wound on anyone), Coolio's annoying performance and the reused recording from Airport 77, you like this no-brainer after all.
