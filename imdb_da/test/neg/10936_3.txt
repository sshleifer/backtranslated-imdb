I went into this movie with low expectations, knowing Uwe Boll's legacy as film director and screenwriter, and I was still disappointed. Uwe Boll finds a way to make every movie he is involved in worse and worse. The overall concept was not bad, a man bored with his life as a stockbroker becomes a serial killer. But the problem with the movie is that there is nothing in between, he goes from stockbroker to serial killer. The movie has no names of actors, and I can see why after watching the movie, I can't see why any actor with a career would like to be involved in this movie. Anyone who knocked it down did their job a favor. And if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and not. <br /> <br /> I give Sanctimony a 3 out of 10
