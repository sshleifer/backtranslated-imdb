This adaptation includes two parts: <br /> <br /> 1. The "now" time when Gulliver is home in England and soon is put in a mental asylum by the evil dr. Bates <br /> <br /> 2. The "described" time in which Gulliver describes his travels. The times are mixed with a very choppy pace, making willing suspensions of disbelief far more difficult than it would have been if the movie had simply discarded the part and followed the book as written. In the book there is no Dr. Bates, no asylum, and Mrs Gulliver gets very little publicity. The trips - in the majority - are depicted as one in the movie. There are several movies covering the subject of sane people dumped in asylum by some unpleasant person out there, looking at them if you want those things. The "Now" time slot adds absolutely nothing to the value of history, is a complete invention of movie adapters, and takes precious time from the real story. All the time this was happening, I longed for the next bit of real travel to be shown. <br /> <br /> So much for the disadvantages. The parts that are actually part of the real story are well done and the CGI is really well done for its time. Many small (and some medium-sized) parts of the real journeys are simply carved, but that does not stop the story. This is AFAIK's only version depicting all four journeys, and for that, the film must have special mention. <br /> <br /> The two cut parts get about the same amount of time. I rate the first part 0 out of 10, and the actual travel coverage as 8/10. On average, I give it a 4/10. If they would only have cut the dirt and focused 99% on actual travel, as this cut would have released much time much better spent filling in the details cut from the voyages. <br /> <br /> Why some adapter thinks he's gifted enough to improve Swift's work, I don't know. My best guess is that the CGI was so expensive back in 1996, so the movie company felt a need to incorporate a lot of fillers that didn't need elaborate sets, GCI, etc. To keep the total cost below a limit while simultaneously producing one mini series, which clocked in at a certain number of minutes.
