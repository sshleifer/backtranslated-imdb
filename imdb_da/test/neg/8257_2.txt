It is really a pity that the movie of this movie had more gaps than you could shake a stick on (mixed metaphor on purpose) because Kinski and Coyote - both highly talented artists capable of great subtlety and nuance - has wonderful chemistry together, and the always provocative Fairuza Balk did not hurt the mix either. Jeremy Piven would also have been fantastic here if his character (and all the other supporting characters) were not written as a plot entity. As for the main process, the authors did not know how to create the appropriate guilty or innocent excitement for the character of China - instead, they gave us confusion, contradiction, and at the final, even the let's-hope viewers - not the claptrap.
