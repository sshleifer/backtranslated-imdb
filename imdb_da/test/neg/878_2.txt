This is one of the more uromantic movies I've ever seen. Casting: Richard Gere is just too old looking for more romantic roles. Diane looks a little eager to please and frowning as usual, but she doesn't seem to be convinced by the romance itself. Supportive cast not too memorable. <br /> <br /> History: The medical drama he has to deal with is compelling and is not interesting. The story is weak - not enough to make a movie about. There is nothing new to say or no new way of saying this. <br /> <br /> The setting is a bit gloomy and the house set is uninteresting. <br /> <br /> NOT meant to be a great memory.
