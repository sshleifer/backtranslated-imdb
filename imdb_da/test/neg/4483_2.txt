OK, let's start with the good: nice landscape, Channing Tatum is easy to look at, Amanda Seyfried has good hair, it's about it. How much of this movie went to the editing floor? Probably plot, action, good dialogue and point. Terrible act, horrible rude dialogue. Let me tell you how bad it is: my friend who is always crying for movies came to the part that was supposed to cause tears, and she laughed so hard we thought she was crying! The movie seems to have a shock to many problems - war, loss, autism, cancer, but so miserably failing to cover a topic satisfactorily. Make sure you have something to munch on and your cell phone to return text messages!
