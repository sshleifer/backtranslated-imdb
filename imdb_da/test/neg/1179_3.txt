This movie was really bad. First, they didn't even follow the facts for it. Half of the film was made, and it was more about the substitute whose mother was one of Ed Gein's victims. The action was horrible, except for the guy who played Ed Gein, but it's not hard to destroy playing a strange guy. even though I think it was terrible, I gave it a three because they started it with actual crime pictures. It was the best part of the movie. As soon as the introduction of the movie was finished, the film went downhill. The author of this movie tried to spice it up, but it didn't have to be. The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough without falsifying information.
