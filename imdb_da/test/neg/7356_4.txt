An American family moves to Spain in the country to live in an isolated house. Regina (Anna Paquin), the teenage daughter of Mark (Iain Glen), who is ill and has some mental problems, and the nurse Maria (Lena Olin) notes that strange things are happening in the house and with her young brother Paul Stephan Enquist), but her mother doesn't believe in her. Reggie decides to investigate the house's origins with his girlfriend Carlos (Fele Martínez), and they find that forty years ago, the place was six child's death. Reggie decides to ask for support for her grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) to protect his brother from the house and her father. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD that expects to see a good horror movie of haunted house mainly due to the name of Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Martínez (from "Special" and "Abre los Ojos") and Giancarlo Giannini. I also like Spanish cinema. In spite of this, I found a terrible manuscript, a horrible direction and a regrettable act of excellent actors and actresses. The intention of the story is good and reminds me of "The Shinning" for a few moments, but unfortunately it is very poorly developed and it is never clear, for example the reasons why the American family moved to Spain or the terrible relationship between the members of the family, mainly the situation between Maria and Reggie. The direction is confused, badly trying to use dark and shadows to give scary effects to the story. I love Anna Paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this flick. Lena Olin is a caricature of the great actress she is; and Stephan Enquist is too weak for such an important role. Only Fele Martínez has a good performance in his support character. I liked the open end of the story. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Sétima Vítima" ("The Seventh Offer")
