Another horrible movie about hockey. I, if I never watched hockey and saw the Hollywood version, would hate the game. This movie doesn't make Canada that big either. I can laugh at it and not take it too seriously. Still, this movie is horrible, with everything you can put into an 80's movie. In the end, it doesn't even look on TV. 4.10
