Now I have to do this without putting spoilers if I can. My cousin and I rented movies the second weekend and we stumbled upon this with the great freaking 'scarecrow on the cover. It looked cool, so we rented it with Kungfu Hustle. <br /> <br /> Wow ... Just ... Wow. To begin with, the movie was horrible. Now, visual arts, opening scenes and music were decent to well done, but the film itself is horrible. The action is underpair (Sean, the leader, hardly shows emotion and / or action in his character), the scarecrows do not look like the one on the cover (False advertising, maybe?), And the camera's shots and angles were for a bad wrestling event. <br /> <br /> And believe me, I'm a wrestling fan. I know bad camera angles. And honestly, this is right up there with Gigli and Pootie Tang. It's done so badly that it AMUSES me. It makes me laugh. So somehow this movie takes its place as a good comedy to me. But to be fair, it serves as what to do and what not to do in movies, especially the slasher genre. I recommend people see this just to get a good understanding of what to avoid.
