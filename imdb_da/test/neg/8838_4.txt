I saw the beginning twice, couldn't make sense, and it bothered me about the whole movie. <br /> <br /> So work this out with me: Wayne (the good guy) jumps on the stage coach, disarms the drivers (!) steals the money (?!) and leaves. <br /> <br /> Disabled, a driver is then killed and the other wounded by the evil ones. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed them, so it happened. <br /> <br /> Then Wayne drops the money into the dirt, saves the girl, rides into the city, chuckles it up with Yak (too bad about the dead guy, I guess) ... and then he says later "found "money back on stage. And everything is okay with that. <br /> <br /> And he is the good guy? And I'm pretty sure there were little hand lamps at that time. And Bell made his first telephone demo in 1876 ... were they in houses then? Am I thinking too hard about this one? Normally, I'm happy to suspend the verdict to enjoy a movie, but this disturbed me. And it's a sign, it didn't work right for me.
