There have been many films about living the American dream. And this is one of them. <br /> <br /> First and foremost, on the technical side, it is very wrong. The sound is bad, I had difficulty understanding the dialogues here and there, and the camera's positions could have been better. <br /> <br /> They were really trying to make a good movie, but for example, the part where they show how Jonathan loses his dream, with girls, drugs and alcohol, is very badly done. The action is also very bad from all the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> I had difficulty seeing it from the beginning to the end, and couldn't wait for the movie to be over. <Br /> <br /> If your expectations are low and you are bored on a Sunday with bad weather, you should see it. If you are in a deep story with action, then it is not your movie. Normally I would not give a score of 1, but of 4.5 for this movie. But the reason I gave it a 1 is because of the bad sound and the camera uses, not to mention the bad cheeses with cheese effect.
