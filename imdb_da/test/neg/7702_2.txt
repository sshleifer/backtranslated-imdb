The problem with this movie, as so many other movies that fail, is the script. <br /> <br /> The script is so unfocused that it floats everywhere. What's the story here? OK, it's a biopic, but I think everyone will agree that a lifetime can be condensed to 100 minutes. Some selections and editing are required, but this script has just not been selected or edited enough. It did not give Hoffman's life to one or two definable pivotal moments or themes that the audience could identify with and through "get" the bigger picture of the whole man. <br /> <br /> The movie wanders from being a straight plodding 'troubled genius' biopic, to semi-docu / mocu-mentary (using new shots faked up to match archive footage), under True Life Sob Stories Film of the week (all "I bring up a son who does not know that I am his father" shtick ") for political conspiracy theory video, etc. etc. It never goes entirely to what it wants to be and the half-hearted Citizen Kane likes storytelling (reporter interviewing people from Hoffman's past) is soon abandoned, leaving the film even more unstructured and flabby than it begins. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of moments and events that do not contribute to the story and could well been cut to leave room to expand something more important. The whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after Vincent D'Onofrio pounding the window screaming: "I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! "(" I'm acting! I'm acting! I'm acting! ") Could have been easily cut. Everything that happens is the psychiatrist says:" You have bipolar disorder here is some lithium. "And the two women In his life, "We could see your weekends more often." And bang! That's it. No more psychological problems. It's such a ridiculously meaningless tokenist scene, it could easily and should have been dumped before it was shot. where they all get high and watch news movies from Vietnam and Hoffman, phones GOD? Nonsense. Tells us nothing about anything. But when it comes to a pivotally important moment as the drug disorder, the film production is so quick that the situation just comes out of the left and does not make sense to the audience. Suddenly he acts in heroin? Where did this come from? Why? What happens here? <br /> <br /> I, who is a middle-aged leftie, would guess that I am well within the audience of this movie, but even i got tired a For the depiction of 'The Man', 'The Pigs' 'The Fuzz' etc. As brutal, suitable, unthinking, hippy-hating androids. It could have been like that in the 60's America, I don't know I wasn't there, but in movie terms it was cheaply polemical. <br /> <br /> Having said all that Vincent D'Onofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger Hoffman and I could see Janeane Garofalo in something, even reading a bus schedule, though she just wasn't right for this part.
