This representation of the popular children's story on film is quite pathetic to see. I know this is one of the earliest filmmaking efforts, but this 15-minute picture is imaginative and badly shot. "The Great Train Robbery" (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to see. <br /> <br /> We see a little long-haired Jack shopping a cow (2 men in a cowboy suit) for a dull bean from a grocery store, and later a beanstalk grows from where his mother throws them in the yard (I assume that poor Jack has achieved the wrong kind). Jack dreams of a goose (in fact, it looks like a chicken) and golden egg, and the next day the stem climbs into the sky. There is no effort to be creative in this movie. The stalk looks like a rope with leaves on it, the giant is just a tall crooked guy in a home with nothing abnormally big compared to Jack and the climax of the movie, where Jack makes his escape with the goose chick and its golden eggs are miserable as a stuffed dummy falls from out of the screen instead of the giant, and so the actor takes his place - rises up to his feet in an exaggerated dance of death as in most early films. The prayer glove (leaf-covered rope) comes down from above and coils well on the giant's forehead. <br /> <br /> See something else.
