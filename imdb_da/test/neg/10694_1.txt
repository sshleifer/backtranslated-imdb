This movie is bad. Not so bad, it's good. Just bad. However, it is fun bad. I saw it out of some morbid curiosity and will never see it or any other Chuck Norris movie ever again. If you have to choose between this movie and death, you should be happy to choose this movie as it is a master class in horrible filmmaking (hence the hilarity). It is a constant depression to me as I turn away at my desk job that some people get involved in film making and decided to produce things like this. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10. Still better than "Starship Troopers" though.
