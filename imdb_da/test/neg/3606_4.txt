EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE cast returns to Disney Pictures follow-up, but this time the spotlight on Kronk (pronounced by Patrick Warburton), which is no longer Yzma's (Eartha Kitt) henchman. Kronk has started a new life and is very pleased with his role as a cook of his own restaurant. Things are happy together until Kronk gets the word that his Papi (John Mahoney) comes to visit. Kronk is worried because he knows his life will not impress his Papi. One thing that he has always wanted and never received is a "thumbs up" from his father. A flurry of blunders and a giant cheesecloth in the restaurant leaves our equally quite deep in trouble and anxiety. To save the day, a little help from his friends. Other voices: Tracey Ullman, David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, April Winchell and Gatlin Green.
