Calling the "Rocketship XM" is due to a science fiction classic more to its release date (1950), its clever ability to exploit the advertising of "Destination Moon" and the appearance of actors who would later star in television like Sea Hunt's Mike Nelson, Rockford's father and Wyatt Earp. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is poor enough to be good feed for MST3K and is best seen with comments from Joel and the robots. This is the type of movie that is best suited for adding riffing from the MST3K characters; something preaching, slow, bad script and full of painfully bad plays. Though unintentionally funny things like "Plan 9 from outer space" do not make up for satirical comments (because the movie is constantly rising up on the hosts), there are really bad and boring movies like "Rocketship X-M". Then add some stars to the rating if you look at the MST3K version. <br /> <br /> The basic story has the crew taking an unscheduled turn on the moon and ending on Mars. What they find on that planet is the remains of a human civilization destroyed by a nuclear war. Only a martian is shown in close-up, an ordinary-looking woman who is blind or at least does not have eyes in the eyes. The men look like "goons" in the old Popeye cartoons, they scamper agile around the rocks and throw stone beams into the crew with amazing accuracy - especially if they were to be blind. Of course none of this is ever explained, as it would require some sign of logical analysis from the actors' authors. <br /> <br /> The scenes on Mars are featured in something called "Sepia Color" to distinguish them from the rest of the B&W movie. If you think of the "Wizard of Oz", you will be disappointed because it is just black and white material with a light brown color added to the output of the post production. In keeping with the moronic sexism of the film, the icy female scientist screws up her fuel calculations - both coming and going. Her inability to measure up to the men causes her feminine side to surface, and she and Mike Nelson coo sweetly to each other as they face their deaths (insert the sound of gagging here). <br /> <br /> The real stars of movies are the journalists on the command line. So much so that MST3K was inspired to especially greet these unrepentant heroes. The rugged group of "newsies" are recorded in the first 10 minutes of the movie, and then take stations about 12 inches behind the technicians and monitoring equipment in the command center. Later, they are invited to ask the moronic questions the missionary director needs to comment on the film's already obvious message. The DVD has an extremely low sound level, is not the text and is accompanied by a trailer. Although you will be grateful that it is only 77 minutes, it is still about 60 minutes long as any 30 minute episode of "The Twilight Zone" has several times more content than this entire movie. <br /> <br /> So what do I know again? I'm just a kid.
