Everything about this movie was bad, the play was bad and the plot was bad. And where is all the blood and gore that was in "Demons", which is a good movie, and it was not scary at all. My brother said this movie was bad, but I had to give it a try since the first movie was very good. When the film was over, I understood why my brother thought this movie was bad. The only plus in this movie was the music of "The Smiths" and "The Cult", but it is a movie and the soundtrack of the music is not the most important. And I saw that four successors have been released for this movie, I have not seen any of them, but can they be as horrible as this, I have no plans to see them, but maybe I will see them time.
