I saw this movie with very low expectations. I didn't know much about it, so I wasn't sure if it was worth it. <br /> <br /> The story did an OK job to get you curious about these ruins they are traveling to. The excitement continues when the Mayans come up and force them to stay in the ruins. <br /> <br /> Then the movie from something exciting to pointless. The amount of gore found in this film did not equalize if it was really necessary or used more for shock value. <br /> <br /> They made no attempt to fight vines from hell. They had fire and tried not to burn it, nor did they attempt to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not. They quickly jumped into a sacrificial role, and their helpless attitude was not real. It reminded me of the old horror movies, where the people just scream and shout and don't have a half brain to try to fight back.
