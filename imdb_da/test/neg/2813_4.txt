Big D.B. trying to keep peace between the settlers and their red brothers. <br /> <br /> Boone (an aging Bruce Bennett) will try to prove to the local Indian chief (Lon Chaney, Jr., who seems to be drunk, as usual) that his son was killed by the tribe's leading shakes. There have also been gun deals when no one sees it. Faron Young sings, even though he holds his rifle like it is a mop. <br /> <br /> OK western adventures directed by two guys, none of which have many credits on their CV, but this flick is not that bad and it has a nice short maturity of 76 minutes.
