I hate it when people in the cinema talk back to the screen. That's one of the main reasons why I stick to DVDs or videos. I watched The Clearing on DVD, but if I had seen it in the movies, I would have to get up and SCREAM "HIS DON'T DEATH THAT FUN!" Clearing is another on a long list of horrible movies containing Mr.Redford. Legal Eagles, Havana, Indecent Proposal, Up Close and Personal, Sneakers, Last Castle and Spy Game. If Robert Redford told me to invest in something, I would go the other way. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing you can do for an audience is this. Say you're kidnapped and your kidnapper has a gun. He keeps it on you for most of the movie. You turn the tables on him and start choking him. Whatever you do, you continue to stifle him until he's dead! Don't just crush him for ten seconds. Keep it up! Ten minutes at least. But Bob stops prematurely, goes away and forgets about Mr. Kidnapper until ....... He stands up, finds the gun and holds it on our hero again. At this point, I wanted Mr. Kidnappers would shoot Robert Redford. More than a couple of times. And I would also shoot him.
