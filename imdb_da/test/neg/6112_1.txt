A good friend of my one said, "A monkey is fun, anytime, anywhere." There is one exception to this: GOING BANANAS. It's simply the WORST movie I've ever seen. It's worse than PLAN 9, worse than BEACH OF YUCCA FLAT. It's terrible. The talking monkey gag gets old after about three minutes, and believe me, that's all there is. Make sure you have a lot of people around to revive you when you enter TOXIC SHOCK from GOING BANANAS, the worst movie ever.
