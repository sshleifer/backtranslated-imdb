I want to repeat - what a silly scenario. <br /> <br /> Is there something new inside? I don't know who wrote this. But I think this guy has all the Hollywood kids - family - no movies ever made ... all the scenes and dilouges you can see anywhere. Why are you making people in this movie? children are like adults? they like money gold cars ... and they are positive? they have lucky ... and feelings of course ... without it can be done. o the young actors - wow :-). I like when is the camera focused on their beautiful faces? what a crap ... there are 90% better kids movies like this! This is not creative or funny movie. This is simply not something. <br /> <br /> D.
