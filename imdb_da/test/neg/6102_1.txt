It is clear that the director, writers and everyone else does not know anything about their own religion or the people who practice it. This film is infinitely flawless and generally a complete crock. For example, there is a scene where the rabbi enters the woman's ritual bath, while a naked woman baths, puts her hand on the head of a woman who and her blessing. In this scene, some of the promised statutes are: modesty, a rabbi would never enter a ritual bathhouse while there is a woman in it. Incorrect contact, a rabbi would never put his hand on a woman's head not to mention that it is not the way a blessing is given. <br /> <br /> The woman from the ritual bath knocks a naked woman by pushing her head underwater, the laws of ritual bathing require the whole body to make direct contact with the bath of water; that means no one should be in contact with the person who is bathing, certainly not pushing them! <br /> <br /> There was more just in that scene alone, like knocking 13 times (where does the concept even come from?) not to mention the rest of the movie was a total mistake. It's scary what ignorance can gather!
