Shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding school for rich teenagers and completely happy ending. Welcome to Zoey Brooks and his friends. Zoey Brooks is portrayed by Jamie Lynn Spears, the self-proclaimed actress who made her fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star Britney Spears. With its lovely blonde wig in the first season and an attempt to save its monotonous country accent, it is confirmed that Nickelodeon has actually gone to the dogs with nepotism. When Kristin Herrera, the actor depicting Dana Cruz in the first season, left the show, all hope came as she was the only decent actress. The female casting is a complete disgrace, but the male casting has the potential for teenage media. If they continue to pursue Jamie Lynn Spears as a picture of perfection, many people must lower their standards. With hope, they will soon find out that you cannot make a career out of nowhere. Jamie Lynn Spears is useless for acting, singing and anything else she is trying for the downward spiral she calls a career. One does not wonder why she is a self-proclaimed actress. Critics would surely proclaim her something other than that.
