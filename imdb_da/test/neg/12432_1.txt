It starts out as a very serious social comment that quickly makes one think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But then it is just as fast that it's unravels into a straightforward mess. Who is the protagonist? Is this a serious movie or a Gregg Araki-esquire over the top goofy movie? Is this a skate documentary with dialogue elements inserted? I have no clue. I found myself looking wrong and wondering when this turd would end. I continued to think that there would be no major shocker culmination that never came. I cut a good 20 minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the meaningless skate scenes. Yes, it illustrates the changing landscape between the hare's does not have. I got it far back in the beginning. Children and bully were made in such a way that I actually felt I was observing the reality of that group of friends. Wassup felt very staged, poorly constructed and still worse. Teenage Caveman, whom Larry did not write but instructed, was horrible. But at least it felt like it was a horrible movie that didn't take itself seriously. Wassup Rockers was simply bad.
