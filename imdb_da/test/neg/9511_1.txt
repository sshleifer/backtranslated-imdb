It is one of the joys of Shakespeare that there can be no good performance - no single performance can be right, but some can be wrong and one is. There are at least two things about Hamlet that cannot be dispensed: 1. His indecision and inability to take any kind of action. For God's sake, that is what makes the game last as long as it does. If you had Othello there instead of Hamlet, Claudius would be dead before the end of Act One. Any production should try to explain why Hamlet delays why he is not able to act. 2. His sexual disgust. His total disgust at the thought of what his mother and uncle stand up in bed fills him with a complete disgust for all sexual things, and that means any relationship with Ophelia is impossible. At least hints of sex throw Hamlet up. So what does Mel Gibson give us? Lusty action man. You couldn't go further from Hamlet's character if you tried. There are many ways Hamlet can be played, but it's not one of them! What I don't understand is when they managed to get such good actors to the other parts - Claudius, Polonius and so on, why couldn't they find one to play Hamlet too. Mark Rylance in the section would have made this a good movie. This æ‹· ib 'Mel Gibson', who he is, completely slip the rest of the casting. And let's see, Hamlet without the prince really doesn't work.
