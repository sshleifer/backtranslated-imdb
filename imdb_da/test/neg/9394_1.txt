This is just another of these "Americans find romance with charming foreigner in exotic European locality." This genre has been cinematic bankruptcy since the 1950s, but they continue to churn them out. I let my girlfriend talk to me about this - bad idea, we hated it both. If all you want to see is Tuscany, try to see "Stealing Beauty" with Liv Tyler - a marginally better movie. <br /> <br /> These types of genre films are very much Hallmark Greeting Card-ish.
