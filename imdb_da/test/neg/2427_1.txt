Ok from an American point of view, which I don't suspect much about rugby, it would be a great movie for them. First of all, it has the heart, good morals, the typical good trainer trying to change the bad boy. But for us where I come from rugby is number one sport, it's a way of life, it's a game only played by the bravest, and the victory is welcomed as heroes as if Americans are doing for their baseball / basketball stars. Not really sure if it was the cheap budget or maybe the director or actors knew very little about rugby and being a rugby fan all my life I can see than some of the actors didn't even know that rugby existed before you shop in this movie . In summary to me, this movie was horrible. If you see it and thought it was great, take the time to go online, and maybe Google "All Blacks" is the new Zealand national team and those who made the chin famous. Believe me, they will make Highlands boys look like schoolgirls.
