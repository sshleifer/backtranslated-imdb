This movie is so copied, cliché-ridden, clumsy and worked, I find it amazing that someone couldn't feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it. <br /> <br /> Here is the line of idiotic clichés, ridiculously psychologizing and simply impossible storytelling in this "hard-hit" representation of high school: The tough guy Jock is really gay. A-students are dissatisfied because his father pushes him and somehow causes him to commit incest. A teacher is privy to a student who wets his pants in the class. A girl who goes out with the above jock is really in love with him and "just wants a family". Perhaps the only saving grace is student counselor scenes that are vaguely interesting, but most of the devices in this movie are so charged that it begs faith. <br /> <br /> This movie shows me no insight into teens, and I'm not surprised when it bombs, especially with teens. The people who like this movie seem to be parents worried about their teens, and boy are they barking for the wrong tree if they think this movie will help "understand" teen problems. I mean, what is moral for this movie? "Hey guys, let's all look out for each other and hug each other" Give me a hug. Anyone who thinks you can get through to a 14-year-old with this kind of message should think back. In the 1980s we saw Kentucky Fried Movie, Xtro, Porky's, Evil Dead, Terminator, etc. This movie will fall on deaf ears. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is up there with another Australian "indepedent" movie, "One Perfect Day", which was as bad as this totally turkey of a movie. Thank goodness, no taxable money was spent on this boloney. <br /> <br /> AVOID !!!!
