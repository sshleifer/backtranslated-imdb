I saw Ed Woods biopsy many years ago. Tim Burton warmly paid this extremely unbearable yet enthusiastic film maker. <br /> <br /> Then I saw Plan 9 and it actually ticked me to no end. A stupid story, kind of poor production values, but still entertaining and even fun. <br /> <br /> So this. What can you do about it. Well, since Wood has been reported as a cross-dresser, it is spectacular to see a movie dealing with it as a cartoon. Yes, there are some staffs to teach the audience something about the subject, but for the most part it is a kind of really twisted self-parade. <br /> <br /> One of the problems is that it has a hundred views. On the one hand, it is a plea of ​​tolerance. Another depicts transvestism as a disease. And finally, it tells the audience: "Okay, if you're shocked now, wait until you see this!" The problem must have been that Wood had to compromise that the film could be made. You can almost feel it when you see the opening title from the producer: Personally supervised by ... So where are we. This is neither a serious subject film nor an all-out shocker. The entertainment value is practically zero. The mood is mildly fun, but only because it sounds so misunderstood. However, this was made in the 50s, so one can argue that it was courageous to make a movie that even mentioned the word transvestites. It all comes down to what the film itself is trying to fight against. Schock. The rape scene while mild is simply there to do so. <br /> <br /> Sorry. This is a miscarriage, but discredit is not Woods alone.
