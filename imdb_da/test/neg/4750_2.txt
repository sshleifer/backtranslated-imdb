I'm sorry to say that these films were one of the year's biggest disappointments. After one of the biggest disappointments in the movie monster matches the story, you would think they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into many of the same traps, the plot line was completely forced, the dialogue was so poor that the movie could be better on mute, and the action was constructed and far from the heart at the bottom of each sample's original film. The best part of AVP-Requiem is actually the trailer, which as you go through the movie end up realizing that almost every single death and every really cool shot in the movie was already shown in the trailer, leaving little to be revealed and a little to be excited about. I gave the film an extra star to let the extra hot woman look almost naked. The movie played out as a color-for-number sci-fi monster party, which also played a part in the fact that nothing was a surprise as it happened because you had seen it a thousand times before. The biggest lack of both of these films is that the creators believed that tuning the movies of our time would make us interested in the story more as if it could happen to us. But what penetrated people when they released the arcade game back in the day was that it did happen within an over-futuristic version of the ALIEN trilogy timeline that allowed more suspension of infidelity. This is where the film of the future will draw inspiration from. To be honest, we see a waitress killed by Alien, as we all feared since childhood, it really does not do for us. Let's take the series back to its roots. learn from the previous masters and not mess with a winning formula by trying to make a "bold new vision" we liked the originals for a reason we would like to see it again. Finally, the end is the real WTF moment for the whole movie, * SPOILER * after the great climax, survivors are afflicted by Special-Ops soldiers who justify their terrible actions by saying "we followed orders" and then turn on a crown and begin to trade everything well and become saviors. so after the long move back with one of the survivors who look unmistakably into the sky, we cut to the most bizarre cliffhanger I've ever seen, with characters you never saw in the rest of the movie (Save the Government Dude) So with all the subtlety of a blow to the face they reveal that there will be another movie with hints of a plot line that would make a sci-fi channel original film blush and screw up its nose. So in summary, if you have to choose between this movie and do another activity on Earth's surface, skip the movie and do the other thing instead.
