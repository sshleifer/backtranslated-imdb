License fees to see this trash and pay for it with hard earned money? Humorless, no shine of laughter, God knows how it won a BAFTA! <br /> <br /> We've been exposed to "Eastenders" for twenty years. When, when should the great British public see this awful soap for what it is? Crass Pap! This program no longer shows the reality of the East End of London than everyday life in Beirut, and it has never done so. <br /> <br /> I know (the right ones) Eastenders are friendly, courageous, hardworking and loyal. And one of their greatest features is humor. It was Eastenders who went through the worst of London's flash and still stuck two fingers up to Hitler. And what do we see on our screens for five days a week (including an omnibus)? Nothing but a bunch of moaning, moaning, "dead from the neck up" wimps, which seems to do little more than sit in a pub all day sniping at each other. What a great ad for the UK that is !! Do the authors actually write this waste they pump out? It is obvious that the woolly section of the public is doing, but then I have heard that one might seem to be brainwashed to believe in something.
