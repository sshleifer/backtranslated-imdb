I saw one at. 12:45 last night and I would have gone 20 min. in, but there was nowhere to go! Blatant product placement, youth script, so many talent wasted, gay ... what didn't they do? The film is also crazy long (we came out at 3). As someone who rarely pays full price at the cinema, you can imagine that my chagrin cripples $ 22 for this matured, medieval nightmare (plus $ 2 parking). I woke up today, still feeling depressed and unable to shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn and he just seemed to be into this thing as I was. When Cedric Entertainer is the high-water mark (a man so entertaining that he should call himself the "Entertainer", then you will understand what he thinks he is doing), you have a serious problem. Also, the appearance of Robert Pastorelli is down-right scary when he died nearly a year ago (March 10). This should give you an idea of ​​how long they have polished this turd. This film is the means to the bitter end. We just stayed to make sure they didn't give Robert a "To Memorize" as they didn't. Save yourself! Save your money! Save Your Soul!
