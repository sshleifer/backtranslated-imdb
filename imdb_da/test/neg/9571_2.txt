This very forced attempt to melt Robert Altman and Quentin Tarantino (which is wildly overstated) is neither informative nor entertaining. The character development is arbitrary and incredible - especially in the final scene of the bitches and the little boy that other reviewers have noted. Also, a few humorous moments aside, the movie is not so funny (black humor or otherwise) as the director seems to think it is.
