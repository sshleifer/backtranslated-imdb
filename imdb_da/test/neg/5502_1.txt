surely this movie was hacked up by the studio? maybe not, but I feel there were serious flaws in the narrative that if one could not be attributed to the editing process, it could only be caused by bad, criminal, writing and ruling. I understand the effect Burton wanted to achieve with the stylized play similar to the gothic fairytale atmosphere of edward scissorhand, but unfortunately it does not fall flat and achieves no mythical depth of troops, but only the offensive trait of influence. ie bad acting and low characterization even for an adventure. Finally, not so scary, actually only mildly fun in his attempts. The use of dialogue as a vehicle for plot background was clumsy and unnecessary. The mystery of who is the headless rider would be sufficient, not necessary for the myth of a German mercenary, although Christopher Walken cut a dashing figure, but not so threatening - seeing Horseman's head makes him seem far friendlier to a beheaded inhuman nine foot high spirit like in the original legend. No real rhythm or universal tone was ever established and not a classic away from us. stalked and cut like my divider ...
