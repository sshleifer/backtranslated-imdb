I only gave this movie a 4 because I saw it in 3-d. If you don't see it in 3-d, I'll give it a 2. This movie is so bad, it's not fun. Anyone can make a movie like this in a week's pay. Bad plays, effects and history !!! But it was cool to see in 3d. Why can't they make good movies in the 3-d format ???
