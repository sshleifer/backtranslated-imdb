With Pep Squad receiving an average of 4.7 on IMDb.com, Steve Balderson is not wondering about this site. But the fact is that Pep Squad is a poorly crafted "black" "comedy" (both words in quotes for a reason). It's a movie full of over-acting (Cherry, Beth's Mother), combined with a few lethargic performances (Beth and Julie's boyfriend). A movie where you can follow cars from twenty meters away in a shiny red jeep and never be noticed. A movie shock full of not-so-appetizing cleavage and nudity shots that make you wonder, "does the director think it is fun or wise?" Most of all, the characters are so paper-thin and poorly developed that the film becomes rather unpredictable, but probably not intentionally. Pep Squad cannot decide whether there should be a comedy or a drama or a satire (patriotic music I get it ...). The film fails to be serious, because the idea of ​​killing for any school position (this is Prom Queen) crosses the line of insanity (not to mention shot of flag burning and drift shooting, a bad attempt to be controversial and edgy), and fails to be a comedy, for all the forced and spooky jokes (great mum, "funky" black principal and excessive cussing delivered badly by the main cast). Looking at the documentary film "Wamego: Making Movies Anywhere" has only made this movie more worthy of praise, with praise against it by ... the director and the director's father ... hmmmmmm. Not a black comedy, or anything for that matter. I think Kansas has to wait.
