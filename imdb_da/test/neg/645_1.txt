The first thing that struck me about this movie was the terrible act. The whole cast was so uniformly unfortunate by delivering their lines that I started laughing at the terrible dialogue between the film. An even bigger problem with this film is that we in no time find out what motivates the actions in each character. The one somewhat redeeming aspect of the movie is Halfdan Hussey's innovative visual effects. But as conspicuous as they may be, they do little to compensate for the above-mentioned gaps. A horrible script mixed with community theater level acting does not provide a pleasant display. I was honestly shocked at how bad this movie was.
