I watched this movie 2 weeks before I took a snowboarding holiday, so it was for me that it was really just thinking about fashion for my vacation. The movie boasts some cute snowboarding skills through the action scenes movies. These moments were great, a bit like watching the extreme sports channel. Unfortunately, the story was quite honest, the play was generally okay, with a rather small cast. This movie is apparently comedy, at least it tries to be comical, but it seems that comedy and storyline are written by a teenager. The story lacks any depth or purpose, and the comedy struggles to be something more than a little snail a couple of times during the film. It might be worth renting just to watch the snowboarding action, but then again there are lots of movies out there that are totally devoted to snowboard stunts and don't have a UN fun, badly written story.
