Based on the true story of two young Americans selling national secrets to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, "Falcon and the Snowman" will be both exciting and philosophical and blowing up in both departments. It's less le Carré than who cares. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton stars like Christopher Boyce, a former seminar, who, despised by the Watergate and middle class values ​​around him, is probably the wrong guy to be hired by a company running spy satellites to the CIA. Sean Penn plays his drug dealer, Daulton Lee, who makes Boyce's courier and delivers secret files to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. An offbeat synth-jazz score, lack of sympathy or emotional attachment to anyone, and many scenes of guys get angry in space all to kill what could have a decent moral dilemma thriller. <br /> <br /> It's truly Penn's movie despite the other billing; His character turns to turkey with the Russians, while Hutton plays with his pet falcon. Hutton looks like they woke him up five minutes before calling "action". With Penn, it's a crapshoot, whether you're getting a brilliant performance or an over-the-top. Here it is a bit of both, but the latter, especially in the second half, when Lee switches from cola to heroin. He is screaming. He snorts. He overthrows Russian embassy parties. He gets pummeled with phone books. He spits in a mirror, a great goober he must have saved for a paparazzi. "I don't know who my friends are anymore!" he is crying. It is exhausting to just see him. <br /> <br /> Penn seems to have modeled Lee on Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo from "Midnight Cowboy", complete with excessive nasal line readings and constant eye changes. John Schlesinger directed this movie as well as "Midnight Cowboy", but he seems to have had another Hoffman movie in mind, "The Graduate", throwing up scene after scene of Boyce and Lee's poolside and trying to determine how to live their life in their gilded cage. Too bad no plastic suggested. <br /> <br /> From the opening shots, news movies of American decline show alongside Boyce and his bird, "Falcon" makes it clear that it is a message movie, although the message itself is far from clear, probably because the characters never come into focus . Should Boyce Be an Idealist? Or is he just a mercenary? Hutton and Schlesinger do not seem to know which makes it harder for us. Meanwhile, the chances of creating some excitement that Boyce steals documents from the top secret "Black Vault" where he works or Lee plays games with the Russians are interrupted by cuts to the couple's scenes with their family and friends. It is the normality of the story that Schlesinger finds interesting, but that is the least interesting aspect for us. <br /> <br /> Good Things: It is interesting to see a movie that works in the 1970s as early as this one that refers to Maria Muldaur and Tang. Dorian Harewood, memorable in "Full Metal Jacket", has a good trip as Boyce's paranoid colleague Gene, showing Boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder, but has some serious' Nam issues under his festive exterior. Macon McCalman is also fine in a completely different way as the non-nonsense manager who gives Boyce his high-security job. David Suchet as the Russian embassy officer dealing with Lee makes for a fascinating mix of threat and graciousness. <br /> <br /> But "Falcon and the Snowman" stands or falls on the question of the two title people, and neither the actors nor the Schlesinger are able to remind much of the answer. Worse, after more than two hours in their alternating feral and catatonic company, you don't really want to get answers. You just want these credits to roll.
