It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou's "Hero" with Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. 'They were both big budget Chinese kung-fu movies with breathtaking cinema of Chinese landscape and a cast superstar. But, apart from the obvious, there is really nothing else to compare. "Hero" fails to deliver at almost any level that really matters, showing that big name stars, beautiful scenes and action effects are not a substitute for a director's art and vision. <br /> <br /> All marketing hypotheses take place The premiere of `Hero 'has done nothing more than make its failure a spectacular one. Highly anticipated, "Hero" made movie-goers in throngs when it first opened at theaters in mainland China and Hong Kong, making it an instant box-office success. But even though the manuscript was satisfactory government censors, Chinese audiences went to newfound heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic humor to express their contempt. On-line critics, both professionals and amateurs, proclaimed the film "ideologically disruptive", "from a deep servitude point of view", written "either by an amateur historian or a person with backgrounds". An article was simply called: Hero, you make me sick! <br /> <br /> The deepest shortage of the movie is in its plot, which is not only morally reprehensible and based on unforgiving historical mistakes but - worst of all for a movie - is boring! All blockbuster epic films are known to take some freedoms with the facts of history, but "Hero" goes beyond artistic license to unforgettable ignorance when it tries to glorify an emperor who was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. `Hero 'does not make up for this lack of moral compass by being entertaining or fun. Instead, it makes a profoundly poor attempt to be "deep" and only manages to be pretentious and preach. <br /> <br /> Although historians agree that the first emperor in China was ruthlessly violent, Mao Zedong was known to have admired this ruler - no surprise, given Mao's own tyrannical rule. Likewise, the Communist government in Beijing sees the claim that can easily be drawn between the first emperor and his own iron fist methods, so they were particularly pleased with Zhang Yimou's recent work. Tony Leung, one of the stars in `Hero ', noted during an interview promoting the film that the Beijing Government had done right in 1989 by crushing student demonstrations because it was necessary to maintain stability in China. For these remarks, Tony Leung received shocked criticism in his hometown of Hong Kong, but he only pronounced the film's underlying message highly. <br /> <br /> Director Zhang Yimou has stated that his goal was to surpass values ​​of loyalty and revenge, traditional in kung-fu novels and movies, to reveal a higher wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of `wisdom 'shows: the upright is right. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have framed this message, art was the last shrine in which the individual could actually find freedom from such a tyranny. The great popularity of the Kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to escape in an alternative world: one where kung-fu warriors roamed the country and sought adventure and fought for justice, free from fear and to win against all odds with their super-human skills. Only in the novel does the individual ever win over institutionalized power in China, and only in the short story did they find oppressed their masters. Zhang Yimou has not gone up to a higher truth when he had hoped, but down, the level of government propaganda. No wonder the government was so happy. <br /> <br /> Some film lovers may secretly wonder: "All moral judgments are present, is it at least entertaining?" Fortunately, the answer is a resounding no! Because the same story is told again and again with only small variations, it becomes boring to see. In addition, the three conflicting versions of the same story serve only to confuse character development as it leaves a valuable time for the viewer to feel any sympathy for any of them when the "real" version emerges. <br /> <br /> The movie is not without its beautiful pictures. But all the scenes fall flat because they don't connect or amplify the story. The use of different colors to distinguish the separate versions of the story comes across as simplistic and constructed, and cinematography appears self-conscious rather than truly beautiful. Great for a trailer, but a disappointment when you're there to watch the whole movie. <br /> <br /> For those in China who despised the Crouching Tiger's unrealistic kung-fu, much was expected from "Hero." 'Jet Li, who plays the title role, is a real kung-fu artist who has national titles before starting his career as an actor. His previous film has revealed limited capabilities, but many hoped that Zhang Yimou could use Li's light body movements to full effect, throwing him properly into a role that would not be his play. But it wasn't to be. `Hero 'is trying to go beyond the kung-fu genre, so there are not many fighting situations, and Jet Li is expected to perform a difficult piece of play: an inner transformation that leads to deep wisdom and self-sacrifice. As the custodian should have expected, Li failed. Meanwhile, the only fighting situation that reveals any true kung-fu skill is the first movie, between Li and Donnie Yen. All the scenes that follow are a disappointment, so `Hero 'fails to satisfy even at that level. Although most non-China audiences are unlikely to be aware of the historical lack of history of the cruel First Emperor, it seems even more unlikely that they would accept Zhang's "Chinese wisdom" version, which is anything but. Perhaps the only time an audience came out of a "Hero" screening was smiling - rather than yawning or fraying - the special screening for Chinese officials. <br /> <br />
