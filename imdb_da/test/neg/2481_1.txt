When Las Vegas came out, a review described this show as, "A harmless bit of fluff" quote. Needless to say, having seen a dozen or so episodes, I think this description is right on the money. A selection of beautiful boys and ostentatious model types play a variety of paper-thin stories while constantly trying to pretend to be serious business people. One-dimensional figures, in a one-dimensional setting, pursue one-dimensional stories. It basically sums up Vegas. I'm still looking from time to time to see if the show is trying to evolve and take a little seriously, but unfortunately, to no avail. Until now.
