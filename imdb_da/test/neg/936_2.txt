All I can say is that this movie is made for the lifetime channel on TV, which means no solid characters, no particular style, weak action any kind of suggested sex, but no breasts and slut (because boy, it would just catapult the film in depth Sleaze wouldn't it?) But the highly simulated sex, yes it is okay. <br /> <br /> Looking at these movies, do I have to ask myself when will these types of TV channels and their advertisers ever grow? I think these companies are actually the way behind time. They really have no idea what the younger generation is in line with and if they knew they would require us to change. The whole point of many American television channels like these seems most to revive the same sanitized, diluted waste over and over as a generic movie collection line. I think it works for them ... or at least it has. Not sure about the future though. <br /> <br /> Don't let yourself die as I did. See some real-world movies on HBO, Showtime, IFC, Starz, etc. Any channel that puts into their work and doesn't need to ask a priest what they can or can't show.
