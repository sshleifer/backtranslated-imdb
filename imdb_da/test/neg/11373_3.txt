I gave it a rating of 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> And what's sad, I made a point of looking at the movie plan for that channel so I wouldn't miss seeing it. I wanted to watch this movie because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors, Barbara Wilson. As a lesbian, I expected to love this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how Mrs Wilson felt about the movie, but I found it a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> It should have been exciting - it was a mystery - in Spain, and the protagonist Cassandra is a language translator who is approached by a mysterious, beautiful woman who offers Cassandra much money to find her former husband , Ben. <br /> <br /> There are secrets obviously revealed, but for some reason it just didn't matter. It was like, oh, so what. I couldn't get involved in these signs or worry about them or feel them. I couldn't even identify with those characters. <br /> <br /> I think that much of the movie's failure was the actress who played the protagonist. She looked old, tired, worn out and as dull as dishwashing liquid. Her hair was an eternal mess, her baggy clothes were dull and she was just not appealing or interesting. <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie was hearing a Dean Martin recording, but even it was destroyed by the strange makeup worn by the man who danced and synchronized to the song. Believe me - it wasn't like coming to see the suavely beautiful Mr. Martin doing it. <br /> <br /> The ending is so syrupy you want you had some pancakes to go with the syrup. <br /> <br />
