It's great what you can see if you wake up at 2 o'clock and turn on the telly. I didn't know they showed such movies. I immediately thought of Roger Corman, who reused movie locations or used other movie sites for his own movies. <br /> <br /> The marks of this movie could just move the camera angles and add some time and they wanted a XXX movie. <br /> <br /> There was no story, just minimal dialogue that led to stripping and sex. I bet there were not 100 words in the whole movie, but there were probably many very big busts and hot lesbian acts. There was also man / woman action, but it was only about 25% of the film. Another interesting thing came to mind in watching this movie that might interest those who buy hi def DVDs. Sony refused to license Betamax for adult filmmakers and adult movies came out on VHS. You can guess what happened to beta max as the adult movie industry produces millions of videos. Sony has again refused to license Blu-ray to the adult film industry, and they have just signed an agreement with Toshiba. You can guess which high def system will disappear.
