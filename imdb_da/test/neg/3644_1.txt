I've tried to like this show, I really have, but I can't find a reason why anyone would like it. The story is weak, the play is weak and incredible. Every cast member seems to have been picked from the street by chance. And it seems to me that the whole show is just a vehicle for Jamie Lynn Spears to move to movies. Every episode shows Zoey as the girl that every girl will be her best friend and that every boy wants to dance. She is always perfect, and no one is like that in real life. How can people relate to a character who is just a Barbie doll? Jamie Lynn's play is fair, but she is not a strong enough actress to be the lead in a series. All the show's fans are just young girls who don't know anything better. I'm sorry if you think my comments are too hard, but if you can find a meaningful and deep moment in this series that is not quickly addressed to a beach party - please accept my opinion and find something that is worth seeing.
