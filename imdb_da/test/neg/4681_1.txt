Andy Milligan, New York's independent film producer, manages this little "treat" as his version of Sweeney Todd's legend. Sweeney beats the customers' necks in his hair salon and his cohort wife lovett turns them into meat pies. Thankfuly I was well informed about the plot prior to seeing this movie travesty. In fact, Milligan, for my money, has to run the worst conductors all the time. Ed Wood is similar to Orson Welles in comparison. This movie is so bad in oh so many ways. Let's take Milligy's direction to starters. The film quality is grainy. The sound quality is grainy. Many scenes look as if Milligan was using a video camera. The credits say "Photograped and directed by Andy Milligan." He wants to take credit for ceilings that appear after a scene of death? What about the terrible musical score chosen for the movie? The film cuts with a bad transition after another. A little logic is used in the layout of the plot. The story has little to do with Todd's actual legend. The murder scenes are abundant but not terrible in any way. Hands, legs and other pendants are cut with the skill that the editing was done: choppily! And let's take the chest in the pie scene. Yes, it's in there. The cake manufacturer did not know that a whole breast with nipple filled a whole cork? Later we hear from our characters that they "have been careful not to get caught" for the 200 plus murders they have done. Obviously, they are a few breasts that are unable to keep up to date with what is going on (sorry it was too tempting). The actors are not terribly bad for being honest. Some even have masters of talent, and everyone seems to be genuine English articles. Many non-erotic naked scenes are forced all the way through. Milligan seems to have some sex problems. Plot strings remain unbound. The end is almost unavailable due to poor camera work. I could go on and on again. I liked something about the movie? Not much to be truthful. I have a high acceptance level for films of this ilk with regard to low budgets and marginal talent, but this film lacks any purpose other than being raw and sick.
