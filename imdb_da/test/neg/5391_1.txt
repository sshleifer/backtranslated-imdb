I, like many others here, bought this movie on my local WM in "Two for $ 11.00" cheap-o bin. I love cheesy B horror and sci-fi movies, and this one certainly fits in that category. Almost what everyone else on here said is dead. Yes it was bad, but it was to be expected. The "main" problem I had with this movie is that it was just basic to wear. I mean serious yawn-o-rama. The action was bad, the costumes (K Mart Skeletor outfit circa 1982) were worse and editing was horrible. No continuity at all. Sir. Skeletor eventually dies in a kind of explosion ... uh, even though he encountered several explosions throughout this movement. I suppose the last one just took his toll on him. Apparently previous meetings with this "military" group (cough) took his toll on his horse .... it would change from red to black throughout this crap party. Even for a B movie, do yourself a favor and skip it. The only good thing it serves me now is adding to my DVD collection. Hopefully no one can recognize it when they look through my movie collection. Thumbs down, big time.
