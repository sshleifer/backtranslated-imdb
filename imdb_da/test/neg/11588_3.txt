I just found out before I wrote this review that "Komodo vs Cobra" and another movie called "Curse of the Komodo" were both directed by the same guy, Jim Wynorski. It can explain why they are films of almost identical premises. They both have a military-controlled island, a colonel who worried more about covering his tracks than the lives of his employees, people running to get to a helicopter conveniently located in a field somewhere on the island, and giant komodo dragons created through genetic testing runs amok. What are the differences? Now the uninvited on the island are now capitalists who want to postpone the government's secret, and there is also a huge cobra on the island, and thus the title "Komodo vs Cobra", although the conflict between the two monsters is hardly relevant to "history." "Komodo vs Cobra" is more or less what you would expect given its title and its channel origin: Sci-Fi Channel. Even if you sometimes find someone who can appeal to you for some reason (I liked a movie called "Komodo"), I hardly doubt one will. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs Cobra" is not just a boring movie, but it is also one of the least enthusiastic sci-fi flicks I've seen for a long time. In some of these films there is an air for those who suggest that the filmmakers at least made some effort, but I see very little here. It is indicated again because it is just a rehash of "Curse of the Komodo." The CGI for the monsters looks like they came straight out of another wagered video game, the cinematography and the second scene are bad, the play ranges from passable to poor, the action scenes are boring, and then there are some parts that are frankly, unforgiving bad. I see many movies where a person will shoot a gun many times without reloading and I can handle this. But in this movie, where Michael Paré takes a twenty-first handgun and burns it approx. 50 times without a stop without reviving once? Well, first I laughed, but even then it just became tiring. That would be the 'action'. A monster appears, people scream, Paré burns nonstop without reviving his gun once in the whole picture, and someone is eaten. <br /> <br /> "Komodo vs Cobra" is a very bad movie. The only thing worth mentioning in the film is an actress named Michelle Borth who is not only very handsome but a surprisingly strong performer. Even with the skewed dialogue and lack of enthusiasm in the play she was given, Michelle Borth managed to avert a surprisingly good performance, and it just appeals to me that an actress as good as her can get stuck in a movie as crazy as this . She obviously took it to the payslip, but it won't increase her career anyone I'm afraid of.
