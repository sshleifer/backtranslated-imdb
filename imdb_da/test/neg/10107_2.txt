OK, it was a "risky" move to rent this flick, but I thought I had nothing to lose. Well, I was wrong. This is next to "Bloodsurf", the worst "horrormovie" I've ever seen. Crappy actors, crappy technical production, crappy history and so on. However, the sound track is not bad. Therefore, I give it a 2 by the vote and not just a 1. And of course the cats are a positive surprise. By far the superior actors in this movie ..... Don't rent or buy it. Stay away from it and hope that this horrible, horrible movie will disappear to some unclear existence and not become a "cult classic". It certainly does not deserve any recognition.
