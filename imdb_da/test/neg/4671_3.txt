spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is not packaged; It is slow and boring. It's not fun or exciting, it's predictable and plays cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism. The special effects are not imaginative or impressive. They are noisy and uninspired. <br /> <br /> The acting talent is wasted on hopelessly stupid one-liners and clich√©s. These are spit of characters, they should just be called 'gentle giant black man' 'eccentric genius that is breaking' 'square jaw that comes in age', 'by-the-book coward' 'luckless gambler lives by a honor code, 'impulsive princess' and so on. <br /> <br /> And the writing! How many undramatic counts did they find fit in this thing? Should a scene where people have to cushion a bomb by cutting some wire even count as fiction more? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the film depends on the audience if there is something that can happen if some jerks can devote their personal differences to Ben Affleck and say goodbye to Liv Tyler in time to save the earth. All the work is done; We just have to wait a few seconds for Harry Stamper, the jerk, to throw a few dish candy lines. I know Bruce Willis is a general charismatic guy, but his Harry Stamper character is an unpleasant drilling. I thought he served the Golden Razzy, he was assigned to this role. Since the film is so long, the plot is so obvious, and the dialogue so available, one cannot help but notice the untouched inaccuracies, inconsistencies and plot holes. 800 feet in anything, the size of TX is less than a pinprick. Try to walk 800 feet in TX and see how close to downtown you are. After all the discussion about the artificial gravity at the Russian station, it seems to be arbitrary once inside. In fact, gravity comes and goes the whole movie. Does it make any sense that anyone besides Michael Bay would give these morons a few shuttle buses and send them to blow up an asteroid that threatens the earth? <br /> <br /> The sentimental phone / insurance / cola commercial style assembly was disgusting. <br /> <br /> I like action movies. Really. This one is boring, stupid and really firm on himself. It deserves hate and mockery because that's all Hollywood's most expensive effort has been - a bunch of cheap cliches that run from an expensive explosion to another. Oh yes, it is all steeped in a neanderthal conservative view of sex, politics, and so on.
