Is it a badly traded, clich√©-ridden pile of waste? Of course. Anyone who is not aware that when they download the box in the video store, they probably have no right to judge movies in the first place. Thus, I will now consider the aspects of the film that we really care about in a scale of 1 to 10: <br/> <br /> Violence and gore: 4 - For this genre there are very few deaths and Gore is almost non-existent. Anyone who is looking for a little blood should look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality is the fact that children do these horrible things, raising the bar a little. Suspense: 1 - Okay, I feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kids. Emergency / Sex: 7 - Lots of breasts from three different women, one of which is MTV v. Julie Brown. There are two sex scenes, but nothing is shown in them. <br /> <br /> Unintentional humor - 4 - There are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary, but all in all it's just bad, not fun. <br /> <br /> Overall - 4 - It's not unmatched. There are a few fun moments and enough nudity to keep your attention on the whole movie. But just watch this movie if you are a big fan of the 80s slasher flicks. This certainly falls on the lower end of the scale, but it is not at the bottom. The real downside is the disappointing end. It almost ruined the movie for me.
