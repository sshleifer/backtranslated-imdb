I feel that many people like this movie (not all people but many of them) because they will not admit that they do not understand it. People with medium intelligence, if you want, who pretend to be ever so avant-garde and trendy, who think Lynch is a genius. <br /> <br /> For me, Lynch is like Tarantino. They are both great, but no one is the messiah as so many fanboys will believe. No director can change the world, so chill out. And both do sucky flicks sometimes, it just happens. Everyone has a bad day. And, of course, when this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hack-worked in a feature film, it was not made of all the passion and thought that one would put into a movie. Face it, much of the movie is gibbering incomprehensible, which cannot be understood. We can all make sense, Lynch can have his own opinion, but none of that matters. It was sprinkled about the screen incoherently. Certainly, the first part had the shadow of a deliberately past due interesting story, but then it falls. <br /> <br /> The cowboy, the mysterious organization of men with their phone calls, the lawyers ... come on. I can almost picture David Lynch shouting cut, forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining them all "See how crazy and strange I am! Isn't it nice? It's so strange and crazy!" Nice and brittle, if it's a by-product of your style. But it is pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do other things. It's like all the half-massed Pulp Fiction throw backs that came out after Pulp Fiction. It's just not cool.
