Rented this tonite from my local video store. It's called "Black Horizon." I think somebody felt it was good enough for a new releasing in 2004 ... Unfortunately, Micheal Dudikoff is not a ninja in this movie, one of the biggest flaws in this movie just outside bats. Another big mistake would be that Ice-ts action scenes are stolen from other movies, especially the first scene in his rescue, which is directly from Wesley Snipe's movie "The Art of War", with Ice-T edited in. I hope they paid for that recording. <br /> <br /> The reason is horrible, the special effects have a little effort in them (love the wires that hold them in the room), the play is wood (also love the New York / Russian accents). Ice-T is in the movie is meaningless. These guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in the room, but I suppose they were not worried about it. <br /> <br /> Micheal Dudikoff should go back to doing what he is "good" to and making American ninja 6.
