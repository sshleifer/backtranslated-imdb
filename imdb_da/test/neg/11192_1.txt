If you want a good April Fool's joke, please still show this movie to anyone. But it is important that you in no way criticize the film, but instead talk about what an artistic triumph is and how "they just don't make big movies like this anymore". As your victim watches many interrupted and obscene scenes (like a cute dog being pounded without apparent reason, a cow stands on the bed, a woman licking a statue's feet or Jesus apparently raping a woman), make lots of comments using words like " brilliance "," equated "or" transcendent "- all the while appearing as if the film actually makes perfect sense and is not a complete waste of an hour in your life. Also, be sure to keep a pretty face and celebrate shock when (and if) they say they didn't even understand it or thought it had all the art of a kopatty. Then, to disturb them, show them all the comments on IMDb, which almost everyone (except a few issues like almagz and rooprect) speaks glowingly about which genius and artist's this movie is! When you finish this little charade, they most likely think they are idiots and will make an appointment with a psychologist. <br /> <br /> This, for me, is the only possible reason to see this horrible mess on a movie !!! It or you can show it to the Guantanamo prisoners to make them speak! <br /> <br /> If you ask me, the famous painting of dogs playing poker or a velvet Elvis painting is superior artistic.
