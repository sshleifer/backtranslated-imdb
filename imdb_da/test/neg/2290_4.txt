Not as bad as some people say ... This is an unofficial Bond movie and a remake of "Thunderball" written by Kevin McClory (co-producer in "Thunderball"). Well, throwing is very interesting, Maria Brandauer is a great Bond villain, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are like the "original" Bond girls plus Rowan Atkinson and a really great Edward Fox who looks really refreshing in the "M" role. In fact, the whole movie is refreshing and gives some new impulses. Sean Connery makes it even more confident and charming, except he looks a little too old. But okay, he's the original Bond, and it was great to see him again in this role. The locations are also typical - the Bahamas, France etc. The only thing that really fails is the music, the song "Never say never again" is O.K., but the theme song is just missing. All in all, a good try to make a difference from the comic and silly Roger Moore movies as "Moonraker". Only if there was another story, "Thunderball" was an excellent movie and didn't really need a remake
