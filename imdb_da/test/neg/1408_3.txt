Combining serious drama with appropriate comedy is meticulous at best times. LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE MUSLIM WORLD struck it off thanks to a current topic and a fantastic script; not to mention Albert Brooks' excellent tailored character. But this year's year cannot come close to comparison. It has a messy message folded in with forced jokes and a twisted love story that is absolutely incredible. The priest originally seemed very promising. Put a Jon Stewart-like comedy news guy up for the US President and see what happens. This independent runner is Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams, RV), a successful television personality who is pushed to run by his audience. Together with him comes his manager Jack (Christopher Walken, CLICK), and his author Eddie (Lewis Black). Seedling to have very little chance of a successful race, Tom Dobbs wins the amazing choice. <br /> <br /> But did he? Eleanor Green (Laura Linney, EXILCIST OF EMILY ROSE) is a computer whiz at the company that designed the new software for electronic voting at polling stations. She finds a bug in the system that is quickly swept under the blanket by the company's owner and his dark lawyer Alan (Jeff Goldblum, INDEPENDENCE DAY). Good at losing billions of dollars if the words of this come out, the company's evil men decided to discredit and / or kill Eleanor to make sure she never tells anyone. But Eleanor is able to come to President-elect Dobbs and finally waste the prayers (this is where the incredible love story begins to flourish). Dobbs goes on Saturday Night Live and explains everything to the world and removes himself as the newly elected president and finishes career with them in the computer company ... oh and saves Mrs Green's life. <br /> <br /> Does any of this sound funny? The comedy is heavily squeezed into history and is often awkward. Robin Williams blows for a moment during a debate, but is quickly doused as the degree of how he became president, bearing on him. <br /> <br /> The movie announcement is interesting and debatable as well: the particular interest holds presidential candidates. I am sure there is great truth in this and if you wanted to make a movie about it, you could. If you wanted to make a comedy if you could. But this year's man is not.
