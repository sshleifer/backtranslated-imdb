Oh, my God, who must be one of the most unusual heartless comedy ever done !! What happened to Subhash Ghai, even the Apna Sapna Money Money was worth looking at <br /> <br /> Eww! GOD This movie stinks. Don't look at it. Save your money. Bad movie. Bad cast. Bad jokes. Bad. Although this film is an example of shoe polish being rubbed on a face <br /> <br /> Trust me This movie also makes you smile, vulgar jokes, cheap jokes, a real silly movie with no concepts Rating 0 on 10 <br /> <br /> AWFUL Movie they are the two hours I never come back. <br /> <br /> Syed Shabbir Aly Naqvi from Pakistan
