If it wasn't for editing out of curse words and a superimposed blur when a character gives another finger, it would be easy to celebrate this low budget snoozer for a sci-fi channel pilot. The reason for the government's attempt to destroy a group of telekinetics, originally trained as military weapons, ends ambiguously with the hero, even gifted, in the quest for a telekinetic survivor beckon. Alas, the movie is talky, boring, predictable and even devoid of interesting special effects. Top image Louis Gossett, Jr. has a smaller role as the evil government bureaucracy that comes from the program and now wants to remove all traces. He goes through that part and it's hard to understand why he was bothering. Other members of the cast do a decent job with a script that requires little.
