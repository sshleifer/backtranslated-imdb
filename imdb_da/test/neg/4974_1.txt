I started to see this because I was looking for a nice 'background' comedy for my Sunday morning. Then I noticed that this was going to be a road movie and I decided to watch this. First 15 minutes was awful, but I would give it a try because I never judge a movie without seeing it through. Then things started to get a little better. This seemed like a good roadmap about friendship. But then the movie began to have terrible predictable clich√© phrases, and when the film was over, you felt you had wasted your time. Does this have anything to say? Why did they even make a movie like this? And I don't expect a modern Citizen Kane, but still I have several ideas on how this movie could have been improved. So take my advice; Leave it alone and watch a real road movie. There are many of them. I don't want to make the directors of these movies seem bad by putting their names on this review. <br /> <br /> 1/10
