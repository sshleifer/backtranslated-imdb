This thing, it should not be called a movie, is almost worse than "Manos", but just watch it, it's fun. If you watch it in video store, rent it if you see the 10 year anniversary edition, yes, there is a special edition, for under $ 10 buy it, if your friend borrows it, then just watch it. The action is so bad, and gore is so false. After seeing this you will ask yourself, why did they make this insult to the movie's art? It assumes that your face does not melt like the Nazis in "Raiders". If you manage to see this, be sure to vote this movie as 1 (horrible) so it can make the bottom 100, it really deserves a place there. I'm surprised it's not number 1 right now.
