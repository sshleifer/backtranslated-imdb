I felt last night's episode was slow and a bit boring at times. I honestly don't think it has to do with writing. Because I know the story was well-tuned and tried to keep things in place. I thought it wasn't that bad, but overall I didn't enjoy it. Most blamed has to do with the director of that episode - Stephen Williams. I always hated Stephen Williams instructions. If Jack Bender continues with this episode of the season's premiere, he would have kept it at a good pace and keep things flowing to keep things interesting. I'm glad Jack Bender is leading next week's episode and it gets much better, and I'm glad he got the first Syaid episode to lead, and I'm curious about what he'll pull off this time Stephen Williams had targeted many Syaid episodes before. <br /> <br /> I always think Stephen Williams should be thrown out of the show. He doesn't even do anything interesting about the show. <br /> <br /> Why should the opening be done with a goal while in the helicopter? It was so boring! Bad perspective on camera work too!
