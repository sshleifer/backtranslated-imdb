Interesting plot but painfully boring. Scripture lacks ... missing action. For me, this film compares to "Made for TV" type movies. I was fortunate to survive the movie without falling asleep in my popcorn. I watched this movie with my family. It's pretty safe to see with your children. (only 1 half sex scene) If you want to see a young Meg Ryan ... check out this movie. Very 80-ish. You will like this movie if you like the combination of depressed people in Christmas, booze, super glue and tar. Or maybe you're like me ... and have a higher standard of acting in movies. But I liked how the movie started and ended! Brand.
