Yah. I know. It has the name "Sinatra" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, trust me! I rented this line of thought, it was a movie I missed in the theaters. It is not. It's some waste "movie" made by people at Showtime (cable station). Geez, these cable stations make a few bucks, they think they can make whatever sweet movie they want! It is not good. I'm just as big a Sinatra fan as any sane man, but this movie was just stupid. Boring. Dull. Unfunny. Uninteresting. The only redeeming quality is that (provided they adhere to the facts) you learn about what happened to the prisoners of Frank Jr. Otherwise, it's just a silly movie.
