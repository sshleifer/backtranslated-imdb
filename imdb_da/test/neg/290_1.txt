As said by others, this is a ridiculously horrible movie (NOT A MOVIE!). It's not bad in a fun way, just painfully trying to endure. Do not waste your time. <br /> <br /> Erika Eleniak is pretty hot, but there is a scene where she is in a bathtub and you can see the wrap covering her breasts under the bubbles. She too gets fat. The battle scenes are so bad that they cannot be packed if you know or care about martial arts or even decent choreography, and editing / effects are unpleasant. <Br /> <br /> There is no payout, it goes nowhere and sucks there.
