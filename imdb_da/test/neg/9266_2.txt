My grandfather gave me this DVD. With friends like these. The front cover looked pretty scary I thought I'd see it. What a bloody mistake. <br /> <br /> Basically, the movie follows three people on a bus, and what happens to those who involve friends. The first is about a guy who buys a car that speaks to him. The other is about a guy waking up to find a cassarole clone in the fridge. And the third is about a woman doing online dating, but it turns out he has a robot arm. The DVD case rated this movie 18, but even a 5 year old can see this and not be scarded or entertained. The film has to be judged at 12 for light intimidation and the sword is bloody. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie is completely shite not going near it.
