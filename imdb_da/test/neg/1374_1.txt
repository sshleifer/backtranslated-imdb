It doesn't take balls to make fun of retarded people. Having to listen to Mencia insists that he is brave to make "retard" jokes unacceptable. It also doesn't take balls to bite the chapelle show. The racing fashion shows, the racing meetings, seem like many sketches have only been reworked Chapelle Show skits, it's just much less fun. <br /> <br /> But the most annoying thing in the show is his insistence that he just marches to the blow of his own drum when he actually marches to the rhythm of many overtime, over-finished drums that have been drum often. <br /> <br /> I hate this show. I hate that it presents itself as a voice for Latin America. <br /> <br /> And no, Carlos, I'm not trying to censor you. If people like it, keep it up. But I personally think it's a bad show.
