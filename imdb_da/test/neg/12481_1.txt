This last-day Fulci Schlocker is a totally scary collection dealing with an incurable gambler (Brett Halsey) who decides Bluebeard's style to pay out his ever-increasing debt by seducing some of the ugliest bitches you will ever face and who just should be wealthy widows! The Fulci-penned script also strives to incorporate a few black comedic elements - which only results in an involuntary business involving a body that will not be put, an opera singer offering that will not stop singing, etc. - for not to mention a doppelganger theme straight out of the PRAGUE STUDENT - although the two persons in this case communicate via pre-recorded radio messages !! Finally, I cannot say that I am surprised that this movie does not show the sophisticated Mario Bavas HATCHET FOR HONEYMOON (1970), which it looks like in several ways, and that it is just raising the disgusting gory ( but non-compelling) effects of dismembered limbs and squashed or melting faces, with which unfortunately Fulci had then been completely associated.
