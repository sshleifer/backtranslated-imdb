The delimiting scene for this movie is when the fat guy finishes, but the evil doctor just gives him one more duty, look at the dinosaurs. Remember that he no longer has this job and then it is absolutely not to be paid for this. Remember that it is a divine dinosaur, and the doctor he is supposed to trust is evil and does not like him. But he is still like, yes okay. It has just defined the stupidity in this movie. A Melissa Brasselle seriously proves that anyone can turn on some breasts and be in movies. I can ride a mountain bike between them, but hey except that, people in Paraguay are very nice. Eric Roberts gives his absolute worst performance so far, there is no adjective to describe how bored he is anywhere. Corbin Bernsen saves what is to save and you start blushing for him, but they have to stick to the formula of course. And I wonder how much your life sucks when you play as one of the army guys in this one? How low can your acting career go? The special effects are so embarrassingly ssingly asked you to expect a character that says "Studio 3" to enter the frame. It's not even honest pulp, it's all taken from "Carnosaur" which even sucked everything by itself. And then I wonder why just someone has to make a movie.
