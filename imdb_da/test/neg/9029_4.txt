Allegedly the "true story" of Juana de Castilla, the oldest daughter of the Catholic Queen Isabella (yes the same one who financed Columbus expedition), the film shows the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, the Archduke's Filip in Austria. as "The Handsome" (and played in a slightly unispired way by the Italian hunk Daniele Liotti, at his most buttery and beefy here). This is a moan-inducing well-known story of the end of the 15th c., Early 16th c. Intrigue, betrayal and bodice ripping. It destroys destructive desire from start to finish. But while La Reine Margot succeeds in making cruel sensuality and reckless, sharp intrigue entertaining to watch, Juana La Loca just doesn't pull out. It ends up feeling like a big budget soap opera with below average, lazy or compelling plays. Liotti looks positive and Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala in the title role ?? though to be fair, can she mature in a proper talent ?? just seems to try too hard to switch back and fourth from two-dimensional horny-looking to spoiled teenage hysteria all the way through. Some of the supporting casts are OK, with the exception of Manuela Arcuri, another Italian pin-up, successful and beautiful, but really no "actress" to talk about. In fact, I could not feel any concern about any sign, and for that matter, I also felt strongly in a negative way against any of the supposed villains. What a waste of a significant movie budget! Unfortunately, this is just rhetorical and deja-vu and nods to other films in the genre instead of its source material - history - for inspiration. It seems to me that such a fascinating and complex historical era deserved a much better film maker to evoke it.
