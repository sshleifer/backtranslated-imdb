I'm usually a glutton for bad movies, but this thing stunk. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> Awful effects and very little humor, what the hell was this movie doing? No one is talking about and no action to talk about. <br /> <br /> I could only manage 45 minutes of this rat to lose a movie and that is rare for me. <br /> <br /> Something positive to say about this drive? cover art was ok, i'm pretty sure the movie has an end even though i didn't make it to it. The wheels were disorganized and constantly blowing their lines, lacking in intensity, and just seemed to go through the steps of their paycheck. The actors were worse.
