Because that's what Hell Ride is, very much. Larry Bishop and Tarantino celebrate at Weinstein's money with the promise of delivering a movie once down the line. I'm too fake boobage and splash as much as the next guy, but did we really need the movie? Really there is nothing worse than the reheated used remnants of an old trend. And I'm not even talking about the 70's Grindhouse cinema, because Hell Ride doesn't have any of the raw and unpolished feelings of the era claiming to pay tribute. No, this is smooth and shiny MTV Hollywood through and through. The old trend I am talking about is the self-conscious pseudo-hip quirky cinematic world in which Tarantino meets Guy Ritchie and Robert Rodriguez. All three guys were at least talented and found success for a reason. Hell Ride is just a used copy, unstable and uninspired, polished to the maximum when it has to be raw, the "super cool" aspect comes out of forced and stupid. There is no reason why why such a simple and utterly eerie story should be told at the bottom, back and forth in time. It's just a post-Tarantino quirk. There is also no reason why the dialogues should be so senselessly meaningless, people slam their gums and say nothing: at least when Travolta talked about cheeseburgers in Pulp Fiction, it felt fresh. Dialogues here represent slightly more than pseudo-macho posturing. There is also no reason why a rock'n'roll guitar guitar should twangle aimlessly throughout the film. Perhaps the lowest Hell Ride hits are when they try to be quasi-existential. There is a hilarious dream / illusion scene in the desert where the bishop eats peyote and sees colors. I was half waited for an old Indian to come out and offer wisdom clothes. <br /> <br /> The only saving grace of this eerie turd is the bubble and Vinnie Jones's monologue on his wings tattoos (and perhaps some of the desert's outer shots). Lots of boobage and hot scantily dressed babies. Now it's something I can get behind, but a movie they don't make. Everything else is just an empty shell, an imitation of other infinitely more talented imitators.
