Ugh. Even the ever-popular Diane Lane couldn't save this movie, and the most exciting thing about the movie was to see if Rourke's face would move. You've heard so much "gossip" about his broken face lift etc. As an accident on the roadside, we had to lower and see the wreck. The ground was thin. Here we have a very professional mob hit man who somehow locks to a wild and uncontrollable punk / villain, and throughout this movie we wonder why this guy stays with this idiot, let alone stay with the guy in the first lap. Then, the crime that was not even committed was the one who went after the witnesses. He would have popped them right now and then. But then we wouldn't have had a movie so would we? And why did the real estate agent agree on the blackmail? There were more holes in this flick than in my collar. The action was horrible, the whole movie was predictable down to the minute and even the end. And so much could have been done to make this a much better movie. But if you have about 90 minutes to kill and don't need any brain cells in the process, then this movie is just what the doctor ordered.
