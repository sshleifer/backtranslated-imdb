If you just want to do and nothing but do and torture, you've come to the right movie. If you want a crooked of good acting, logic, story, consistency or even a good guy ends, go somewhere else. <br /> <br /> I could only think of myself, "Jeeeez, are these people mentally challenged?" Example, after being chased around and seeing other people mutilated, the lead character encounters a police officer and wasting his story to the policeman with tears and everything and told him about the psychopath running in a yellow truck. The yellow truck pulls up and the officer just goes to it, speaks to the guy and the truck runs without problems. The actress comes out and says why didn't you arrest him? And then the truck runs over the police officer ... after being rammed, the truck stops on the road about 20 feet way just standing there while the actress is trying to pull the police away, but he's too heavy. (At the time). At that time, the truck lifts itself up and runs over the police force twice. The truck then moves away. Why didn't the actor shoot that gun is past me. (Who later shoots the police in the head twice because the psychopath was burning him alive). Once through the mouth that did not kill him (Duuuumb) and twice to finish the job. * Scroll your eyes * Right after that she turns away to escape the bathroom that was going to explode, and as she climbs near the roof, she turns around and the police are no longer there ... OK ... <br /> Another example, The greatest actress meets a captured woman in the bathroom, she jumps out like a gallon of blood on the floor and covers about 1/3 of the room. (Probably more) After the biggest actress goes outside to grab a towel, she comes back and everything is gone. : / They don't explain why everyone also disappears. Stupid stupid. <br /> <br /> I like horror / thriller / gore movies, but one was just too stupid. I lost the brain cells that looked at this dribble and you shouldn't.
