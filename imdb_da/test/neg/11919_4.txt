Didn't have any idea what this movie was about, but based on the fact that John Leguizamo appeared in it, we decided to watch it. It turned out not to be the smartest decision. In fact, as another comment in this forum puts it, we felt embarrassed by the actors who participated in this movie. <br /> <br /> Though the movie is by no means horrible, it doesn't make sense at all. The overall performance of William Baldwin also does not help the situation. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserved better. The basic problem it seems to be the movie was a project that started with good intentions to make a small comedy and the responsible people ran out of ideas along the way. The result is an uneven film.
