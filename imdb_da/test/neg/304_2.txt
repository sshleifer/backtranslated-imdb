I wasted enough time to look at this core of a movie, I won't waste any more and write a great review. Not once did I do as much as a smile. ALL the jokes were boring, forced and lacked any kind of joke. I continued to say, "Where's the punchline?" Almost every character was an unpleasant stereotype, and all situations were clich√©d and half of the time there was not even any sort of solution. Things just happened to come to the next scene. For my life I can't understand how this got so many good reviews as it did. If you like clunky acting and poorly composed movies, then the Fat Girls movie is for you.
