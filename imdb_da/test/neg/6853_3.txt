I've never been disappointed with a Kurosawa movie, but that's the first. "Doppelganger" is the worst I have seen from this director. <br /> <br /> Tartan Films announces this as "The most scary movie yet by Kiyoshi Kurosawa". What? The most scary movie from Kurosawa is definitely "Cairo". And if you think it's horror, it's a surprise. This cannot be classified as horror or thriller. This is a drama and a rather bad one on it. A lot of scenes that should be shocking turned out to be fun, and much of the plot is really confusing. And since it is Kurosawa, pacing is slow. But it's so slow that you lose interest forty minutes in, and want to do something else. What irritated me most was the use of CGI. Now CGI, if used well, can be really cool. But if executed with little care ... It can be a disaster. I think a scene is described here that has a very minimal use of CGI. The only positive thing I can give "Dopppelganger" is that it has really good plays. Koji Yakusho gives a good performance along with the rest of the casting. But it's pretty much it ... <br /> <br /> Please do yourself a favor and go see "Cairo" or "Ko-Rei" if you want to be scared. This is a bad, bad attempt at a smart drama. Which is intelligent, but ... Good, much missing. <br /> <br /> 3/10 for the good acting.
