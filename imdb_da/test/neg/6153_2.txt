Wow !! I didn't even know about this movie until I searched for the name of another Mark Hamill classic (Time Runner). Some things are better back, unknown. Mark's role is right ... limited. I would compare his appearance in this movie to all the plays of Vincent Price and Christopher Lee in the bad horror b-movies of the 60s and 70s. In these films, they appeared in the first and last 5 minutes of the film. Memorable act of Mark with such big lines as "Don't try to run. You're arrested." I said he says EXACT stuff more than once. Bill Paxton fell into a Uzumaki-type spiral of drugs and splashes after foreigners because he ended up in this movie after waking up on the set after a binge session. HARD .. HARD !!! .. Priceless Bill. Really should have been "PLAY OVER" for Bill .. but somehow .. he got treatment .. and went on to better ??? movie. This movie is blowing. It's more boring and boring than The Crazies. At least that movie was crazy ... it's just boring. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE SOBER.
