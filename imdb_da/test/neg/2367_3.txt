No way out in 2007 was really bad and if it is the way to wrestlemania, they choose the wrong way. Chris Benoit & Hardy Boys Badly MVP & Mind: In my opinion, this was the best match for the night some good wrestling here, but not much. 7/10 <br /> Cruisweight Championship open (which won Chavo Guerrero): Awful, no high flying at all, really fast and boring. 3/10 <br /> Little Bastard & Finlay Def Little Bogeyman & Bogeyman: This was more comedy than wrestling, some laughs. 5/10 <br /> Kane def king booker: a decent bet of these two, but they could do better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> WWE take hold of the championship Paul London and Brian Kendrick def deuce & domino: another boring match, no high flight of champs. 4/10 <br /> ecw world title Mr Kennedy def bobby lashley (disqualification): in my mind the worst fight of the night. really awful. I thought ecw was no rules I was wrong. 2/10 <br /> <br /> John Cena & Shawn Michael's def Batista & undertaker: An okay fight but could have been hell much better. 6/10 <br /> All in all, it was bulls * it gives it a 3/10
