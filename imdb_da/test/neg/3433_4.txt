I found this movie to be okay. <br /> <br /> On paper, this movie has everything a person wants! Romance, comedy, drama. A bank robbery, a unique cast, great music and story! <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie ended mostly in the wrong way and I tell you why. <br /> <br /> This is my biggest problem: editing. This movie has by far the worst editing I've ever seen outside of local car dealerships advertising. The editing could have been better through a deaf Parkinson's patient who knocked on iMovie with a dead cat. There are scenes where two characters speak to each other and you can see their lips move and the sound / video is not synchronized because it is clearly called. Why was it called? I do not know! Its English dubbing English! The voices were performed in a studio elsewhere in certain scenes! Couldn't they find a boom-mic? They are not expensive; Jesus, even I own one! And I'm not making movies! <br /> <br /> b) Andrew Keegan's performance was lacking. It really didn't seem like he would be part of this project and his action was equivalent to a shit done by D.A.R.E. for school children. At least John Krasinksi showed some enthusiasm. Yes, John Krasinski is the only reason to rent this flick, and that's the only real reason to see. He did a good, witty performance, and he was the three-dimensional character. Dean Edwards' character was pretty thin, as it was. <br /> <br /> Final Word? If you are a fan of John Krasinski, this is your time worth it. If not, don't even bother. Editor
