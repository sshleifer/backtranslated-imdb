This is one of the stupid ideas for a movie. Repeat a classic movie shot-by-shot. I hope no one tries this technique again. In 1998, "Good Will Hunting" director Gus Van Sant tried it by reusing Hitchcock's 1960s classic "Psycho" and failed miserably. What on earth did Van Sant think about? This remake doesn't even come close to the top of the original. The few changes made here were no help. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is obvious. See the original. <br /> <br /> * (out of four)
