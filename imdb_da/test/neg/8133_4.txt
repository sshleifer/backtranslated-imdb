Julien Hernandez is definitely an attractive and likeable on-screen persona. In fact, his character carries almost all of this movie, or whatever is worth it. The problem is, with the exception of his crazy pal (played by Marisa Petroro) and Paul Lekakis (as a trick / date / girlfriend for some of the characters) no one else gets close. Hernandez plays a 30-something director of Cuban heritage, and unknown sexuality, coming to L.A. and get a job to make a gay documentary. In the process of meeting a group of gay people, while he finds topics, he comes out ... but very much so. Of course, even in 88 minutes, the film has been stretched out and padded with various film school equipment, most of which only end up disturbing the story (it's not much to start with) or point out the overall amateurity of the film production. <br /> <br /> It's a shame because there's a love story in here somewhere, and the last three minutes when Hernandez Sebastien finally clicks on a wealthy West Hollywood party thrower (nicely underplayed by Lonnie Henderson) And they share some sexy soulful kisses, it works after all that came before. But we don't care about any of the other characters or their situations: Why would beautiful Dante have a Eurotrash price for a girlfriend? He didn't want it. And don't even get me started on Sebastien's friend Paulie's "rules" for dating - no gay man I know hell no sense person, period would put such narrowings on himself or others. And tell me how Sebastien gets a peeled banana (which is usually pretty shmushy, doesn't it?) Stuck on his beard and go to a doctor to have it removed? <br /> <br /> I noticed Hernandez won a prize for this movie as a "card" - it should probably have been that way. All this said - I would look forward to seeing Hernandez on the screen again, in a better scripted comedy with a safer direction.
