Wow. As soon as I saw the film's cover, I immediately wanted to see it because it looked so bad. Sometimes I see Bollywood movies just because they are so bad that it becomes entertaining (eg Koi Mil Gaya). This movie had all the elements of a horrible movie: a "gang of local thugs" who are completely harmless, a badly made motorcycle scene, horrible dialouge ("Congratulations son, I am very proud that you are a bad boy"), actors play basketball as if they are good, terrible songs ("I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad bad boy"), unexplained plot lines like why are the good boys and bad boy friends ??? And why is the hot girl in love with the geek ?? I have never seen such a badly constructed story with such horrible direct. Some of the scenes actually took 30 seconds long as the one where the good and bad boys inexplicably jumped over the "bandmate's" poker game. Congratulations Ashwini Chaudry, you're a bad director. If you want to watch a good movie, see Guru if you want to see a movie so bad that it is actually entertaining, then look Good Boy, Boy.
