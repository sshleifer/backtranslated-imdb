There is no better way to describe the HORRENDOUS experience to look at Mamma Mia: Hitler must look up and tell the pseudo-director Phyllida Lloyd 'You monster, what have you done?' <br /> <br /> Everything about the movie is wrong. Just?? Wrong! Even its success, which is inexplicable. I can understand when these crappy parody films, like Epic Movie, make their minimal share of money and make profits just because they are cheap (of course they are!). But when something like Mamma Mia makes $ 450 million worldwide, you think "what the hell is wrong with the world?" <br /> <br /> And to believe we have Meryl Streep, one of the world's largest live actresses, in it? What was she thinking about? "I need the money," she could say. Well then, sell one of your grandchildren, even that would be less embarrassing. It's not that Meryl is good at a catastrophic piece of, erroneous 'movie'. She is also disastrous! When she sings, even though she has the song, it is ridiculous. Worse than her only Pierce Brosnan. He used to be James Bond. Now he sings Abba in a little spandex under the credits of the worst movie ever. Really? And when I mention Abba, I don't mind the band and their music. Although it doesn't help them when the actors started singing (badly), dancing (worse) and the extras joining them (they jump out of nowhere! Often!) Presenting a horrible musical sequence in sequence. You will cry when the music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first in the genre where you ask for the actual silence. <br /> <br /> I could continue. The list goes on forever. You can write a Stephen King novel with the complete list of errors in this movie. <br /> <br /> In summary: go see it! Really! You have to witness to understand !! And as it is already a huge success, who cares if it makes a few dollars from you? And it doesn't like you selling your soul to the devil. Meryl did it before. For all of humanity. And now the world must end because we have committed the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed.
