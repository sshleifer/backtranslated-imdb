May contain spoilers <br /> <br /> Obviously, who ever made this movie must have had many connections. I just can't see it in any other way. What really surprises me is nobody named Allen Smithee, and, more surprisingly, everyone involved doesn't use that name. <br /> <br /> Anyhow, where to start. The bad dialogue, the curvy costumes, the sad movie, the unintentional comedy, the top characters and more inconsistencies than George W. Bush's career. I don't know what was more fun, the guy lost his arm because of a snowball or the slow motion scene where all baby Jack Frosts were killed. Also one of the great lines of all time was spoken in this movie. "How do we know it's him?" Just like there is another mutant snowman who can talk and kill people with snowballs! A great camp movie, but a very bad movie in general.
