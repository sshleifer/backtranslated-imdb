I think I win the "bargain" competition for this movie when I got it as part of a "Martial Arts Movie Classics" DVD collection with 50 movies for 20 bucks, which means I paid something like 50 cents for the chance to watch the "Black Fist" version of a movie released as "Bogard." <br /> <br /> For a basic "revenge" flip, "Black Fist" is not too bad, although it is obviously hampered by a low budget. One of my informal "rules of thumb" for watching a movie is that if the main actor is better than his production and manuscript, the movie automatically gets at least three stars. This is certainly the case here; Lawson has some presence and some charisma, and probably deserved a better movie career than he got. <br /> <br /> Street fight choreography (the shady reason for the movie) will not really impress anyone who has ever sparred in a martial arts school or even just been beaten in a schoolyard fight. I spent only about two years learning basic kung fu but even I would never fall to the front "stamp" kick, arm drawn and roundhouse beats on display here. But the atmosphere is good - dust and blood and shouting crowds, and the actors put some feeling into battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Less credible is the plot. Dawson's character "Leroy Fish" is portrayed as a street-smart, crisp young man looking for work as a pick-up fighter in illegal, unused street fights. Still, he's surprised and indignant when he has to pay the police? Sorry, but I was raised in the small town of Iowa and even * I * knew (from seeing the "Hard Times" with Charles Bronson) that the police should be paid for this kind of action and that the guys fighting are in need of fixers to get their battles and fixers were worth the money. So you have to watch this movie with some intentional suspension of your critical faculties to accept it as a "black brother suppressed" movie. (Most of the other non-black fighters in the stable are also faced with the same deal too?). <br /> <br /> The movie suffers from a brief attention. The director obviously did not have the budget to film some of the scenes he needed, so he had to fill the gaps with some rather ridiculous scenarios ("I win him, I ate him, and then I killed him" scene just works not) along with voice-overs and mounting that is clumsy and convincing. This is especially true with the whole romance angle which seems to have been filmed as if it were an afterthought. It's a little scary when you consider the death of "The Fish" wife's death to convey his impetus to revenge. But when the film changes all the way from "young fighters rising through ranks" to the vengeance theme, it fetches some steam and plays with a little more conviction. I'm not sure the final payout is worth building - Roger Ebert calls this kind of thing "a long drive for a short day at the beach" .. but it binds things in a reasonably satisfactory way. <br /> <br /> If Sylvester Stallone had made this movie with a real budget and the same cast, slicker sets and costumes, and even as the hero, people would have hailed it as the next "Rocky" that goes to show you how circumstances and chances can play chaos with the dreams of wild filmmakers. Worth watching once for various decent shots and lines and to see Dabney Coleman surrender himself in a role under him.
