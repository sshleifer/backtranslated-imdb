One of the worst gay movies I've ever seen. Since these are not signs in this story, it is difficult to comment on the current movie. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) has put his life open to everyone to see, I think he is fair game to criticize. And it's not hard to do. Here goes. 50 Something Glen is a great time porn star who wants fame and happiness as a great time singer. (I think 11 movies make him a "star") Being gay and forty, I've seen porn and I don't recognize him or his lover. Personally, they all look to me with different hairstyles. Face it, guys, he's no Jeff Stryker, Jim Bently or Casey Donovon. It is okay. The purpose of these films is about 6.5 minutes, so they have virtually all the same requirements if you know what I mean. <br /> <br /> So, Glen will be a serious (legit) singer after he dumps the porn industry, but he can't make anyone take him seriously. I wonder why? Was he so stupid to think that he could wash his clothes off and have sex on film. And according to the film, not only porn movies he indulges in; It is $ 500 an hour to entertain at a private party. Strip games on clothing optional "hotels". Making something called meth that I suppose is a substance. And then you have the balls to get angry when someone in a club try to touch you ---- because he is "legit" now. Oy! <br /> <br /> The only interesting non-cardboard character is the Oscar-winning gay screenwriter who would not give his name. And considering this is a documentary, yes, porn is like porn does. You can tell he is most amused by the stupid-rabbit pornstar. Glen has a hypernice boss (Kyle) who wants to "sell" him as a porn participant hoping to get him gay clubs. He tries to do the Svengalli routine. "Use this" "Don't smile" "says it" in what quantities are controlling problems. But our anti-hero will not be controlled or told what to do. the first mistake. I'm not saying that Kyle was right, but if any budding singer begins to question the leader, they won't come far. Kind of: Anyone who is their own lawyer has a fool for a client. /> <br /> All this would not have been bad if it wasn't for a little bit of information. Drum roll, thanks. He's bad, he's sucking. His singing talent goes up with Ashlee Simpson. hard to mess for someone who - while trying to make his dream come true --- at 50! --- Does not work as normal people. No job. Can you say lazy? And whining and "why don't they accept me." Singing and dancing. And a few months after scratching the surface of the music industry, he jumps out: "Why don't I have a record deal now." What? Actors are servants. Authors work in low-lying newspapers or stomachs - regardless. This guy is over it. It is true. He just wants his success just because he decided he wanted it. Whine. Whine Whine. His girlfriend leaves him to return to care, but I tell you that I don't want the moron to give me medical care. Both were useless. Airheads. The movie is useless. Unless you really like Whine and Cheeesy stay away. Don't waste your money on the hard life of useless people, there are far more interesting things stuck in the bottom of your shoe.
