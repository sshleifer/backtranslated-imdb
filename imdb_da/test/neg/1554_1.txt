Examines the limits of extreme boredom. Life in a small Canadian city in the winter as an experiment in extreme sensory deprivation.

In a groundbreaking study, David Snowden found that he could predict Alzheimer's thirty years in advance by comparing the autobiographical essays of nuns as they entered the monastery.

Perhaps my mind slowly begins to race to see this infinite, autobiographical, contemplative film, which in simple direct style shows the gloomy and stoic life of a small community living next to gigantic asbestos slum dogs. <br /> <br /> This movie became popular in the height of the Quebec separatist movement because of its presentation of this community as permanent wounded victims.
