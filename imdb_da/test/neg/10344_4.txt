Corben Bernsen oriented horror movies about a chemical weapon released in a sporting event and transformed everyone into crazy monsters. We see when the staff of a radio station take reports. <br /> <br /> It has moments, but it plays mostly like a lifetime war movie with breasts and blood. There are some really good ideas here, but they just don't work. In fact, the film's ideas are better handled in a movie called Pontypool, which largely works through and builds tension by not showing us anything. This shows us things and it just seems cheap. Given the choice, I would see Pontypool again rather than see this movie again.
