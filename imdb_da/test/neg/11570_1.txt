I'm like I am. It has its charm, but in the end it is too much propaganda in it. For an outsider (a non-American), the patriotic feeling may be a little too much. <br /> <br /> I don't think Rabb and MacKenzie go from being lawyers (as they were in the early part of the TV show) to being superheroes, stopping wars and saving entire continents. It's almost like watching a recruitment video from the US Army. <br /> <br /> I'm still looking at the show so it's not that bad. But I prefer several episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie are investigating military accidents and not saving the world in the future.
