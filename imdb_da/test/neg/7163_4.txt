This is a textbook example of how Hollywood does not (not) trust moviegoers, and pans for its big names stars. The character of Christ is completely rewritten, the anti-Semitism that Noah faces from his own army is almost eliminated, Michael's history is changing significantly, and the end result is to clarify the book's power and terrible beauty. I almost wished I hadn't even seen it, because of the film's (sounds and pictures) ability to resonate so strongly in your brain; I would have quite rightly been back with the impression of the book. The book could have been written today, it is so honest and courageous. The movie, neither. My advice: SKIP the movie; Read the book.
