I had the unfortunate experience of stumbling upon an example of this movie and thought it might be interesting. I am a fan of the two main players, and I even find Meatloaf to be oddly appealing, but it could not compensate for the droning plot of this movie. This film tries to make social comments and be artistically intelligent. I'm sure the audience gets the sociological message clear, but must suffer during the process. Personally, no matter how bad the movie is, I can't stop it in the middle. Something drives me to finish the worst movies, but I often regret it. This is one of them ...
