This is a candidate for the worst movie I've ever seen. It would be as shocking as "the silence of the lamb", but has neither the style nor the white of the aforementioned. Make-up is excellent, the play is pretty good, but the story seems to be dragging on for years, and the murders are so cruel that they are more disturbing than entertaining.
