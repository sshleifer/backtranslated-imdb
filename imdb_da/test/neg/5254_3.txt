We screened this movie in a club as an example of how classical literature can be transformed into some of the most horrible films of all time. Just the fact that the back of the box proudly proclaimed the plot to be put into the "techno-futile" future should have been enough of a tip. I think the word describes the movie itself, because no matter how much technology they tried to use to save this movie, the effort was completely useless. Not to mention that our roster advised us that it was allegedly unable to get a distributor for two years. <br /> <br /> This movie bug is filled with cheesy, clicher dialogue that is worse than angsty teen poetry. Beowulf's character changes halfway in a way that is by no means credible, and when he is in an action scene, he constantly blocks as a hyper gymnast. There is even, as they say, a "token black guy" whose attempt at humor is completely out of place. And of course, the daughter of the leader of the outpost Grendel is terrorizing a total vixen. A vixen whose breasts are exposed to the entire movie. A vixen who wants to fight the creature, yet she never puts on armor. And the selected weapon is a small carving knife. And despite their grim situation, she still dresses for dinner in a dress with a transparent skirt that exhibits her short shorts underwear. There are a few scenes that can pass as soft core pornography, and in the second scene, they even reuse recordings from the first. I thought Grendel's portrayal was bad enough, but then came the end of the movie, which was a show of CGI that could be decent in the 80s, but is quite ridiculous for a 90's wait. I could go on, but you should all watch this movie for the full ridiculous effect. The other club members and I managed to have fun watching this by taking a cue from MST 3K and mocking it all the way. I still rewind from an extra weapon: an eternally spinning pizza cutter on a rod.
