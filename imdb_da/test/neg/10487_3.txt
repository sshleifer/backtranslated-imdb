What? - thats it? The city sheriff (John Agar) blows the mutant gorilla with a dynamite stick hidden in a mannequin? Did I just write that? Did I just see that? <br /> <br /> With Instruments from The Wildcats, "Night Fright" is a flick that never deserved to be made as late as 1967. Gorilla's grandeur was well over and other than Ray Corrigan in a monkey costume just asking about problems. Repeat this in black and white and set the story about thirty years earlier and you will have at least a 4.0 rating on IMDb. But unfortunately this should never have been a chance to see the light of day. Oops, which is another decoration - you can never tell whether it is day or night in history, as they are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> I give you this though, a few of the early paint shop scenes looked as if they could have been on the air like cola advertising. Think about it now, they were probably the best and best thought scenes in the picture; Coca Cola must have paid for them. Had they seen the finished film, they could have been better served to prevent it from being released.
