I've been a classic horror fan all my life. Many evenings stretched to the early hours of the morning watching the universal films of "Horror Incorporated" and "Creature Feature Night". Unfortunately, I have seen this movie in the early evening, and yet it still lets me sleep. <br /> <br /> I don't think I've ever seen a "horror" picture where everything was so much. Dr. Edelmann does not seem to believe in the supernatural, yet he suffers medical on Dracula and sees the Larry Talbot change into Wolfman, while he hardly blinks an eye. He and Talbot discover the Frankenstein monster as it is an everyday occurrence. Edelmann is all fired to bring the monster back to life, but after Talbot Miliza and Nina protest that he is like "Aww you are right. After understanding Dracula's betrayal, he opens the count's coffin for sunlight and POOF, he is just like that. <br /> <br /> The only person who didn't seem to just ring in her lines was Jane Adams as Nina, her reward being pushed out of hump in her back in a pit of Frankenstein Monster at the end of the movie ... and no one even tries to save her! She, Dr. Edelmann and Monster all die while Talbot and Miliza randomly leave the castle. <br /> <br /> Absolutely the low point of Universal during the classic annus horribilis.
