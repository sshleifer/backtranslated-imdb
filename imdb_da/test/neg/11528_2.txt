What a clunker! <br /> <br /> It must have been made for TV or cable. <br /> <br /> See: Forget the manuscript - forget about the mass of forgotten actors. Excuse me? Continuity? NSA / NIA / whatever or who he is (an agent) take-off in an F16 - is shown in an F18 chucking his guts up, and later the plane shown taxiing is an F4 Phantom! Oooh, wish I could be so cavalier. <br /> <br /> Except for the male actors (!?) the women are WASPS: blue eyes and long legs and eventually cry about the heroes save them. Even when a solid welding could save most of the cosmo-astro-nuts, the blind drops the welding tool. You h! <br /> <br /> As an SF movie one in ten. Like a movie in itself: 1/2 (that's half a point). They should have killed the space station and led to Mars. <br /> <br /> Large raspberries.
