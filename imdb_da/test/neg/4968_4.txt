How could this get a 6.0 rating? Are we as horror fans so used to horror movies being so bad these days, that when you come up with what is some, and I repeat 'only some', redeeming quality we are much too excited and give a rating that only a little too high? The director has a certain visual flair. No doubt about it. But between some decent shots, he forgot a good story, mood or horror. It had a very slow first action, lazy killing scene, annoying and flat characters and a very stupid and very unbelievable twist. And what about the portrayal of American teenagers in so many of these kinds of movies? Should they always be stupid, annoying and then God # m superficial. I do not remember that teenagers are like this when I grew up in the Netherlands. All things considered, you can't give this movie anything more than a 4 out of 10 character.
