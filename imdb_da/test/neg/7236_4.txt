This is the sequel to octopus. <br /> <br /> Pff ... OK. A lot of stock footage, but pretty good. I'm surprised they actually had a huge robot squid that actually wasn't that bad! In fact, I was totally surprised by that. <br /> <br /> The movie parent was just OK fun. It never explained how squid was so great and it is not linked to the first. But it was still fun. <br /> <br /> The end me and my friend laughed at. Basically, after blowing octopus up once, the two protagonists start a bomb, and five explosions, most stock footage, appear on the screen! We jogged that they went to the dollar store and bought a "five missiles in a toy! Believe me, it must be seen as believing! Overall just stupid fun. Worth giving a chance, buy if it's cheap.
