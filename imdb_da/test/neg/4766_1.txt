I just saw this today at TCM, where the other reviewers here saw it. <br /> <br /> Sorry I was the only one to find Davies a weak actress, with a really terrible attempt at an Irish (Irish-American or otherwise) accent. As she is the star, it was a little hard for me to get past it - especially as the other reviewers have said this was her finest performance. Another very horrible Davies performance was in "Marianne" (1929), which I also saw today. In this film, her accent from here changes from a (correct) French woman to an odd combination of Italian and Swiss. <br /> <br /> Interestingly enough in TCM's one-hour bio by Davies - "Captured on Film: The True Story of Marion Davies" (2001) - film historian Jeanine Basinger claims that "one of the things you take note of about Marion Davies in her audio work, is how good she is about to make accents. "Of course, this bio also includes comments from fans (do whatever you want). <br /> <br /> Davies was a very attractive young woman and of all accounts a great comedienne in reality. <br /> <And because part of her anatomy did not add the answer to Joseph Scott's character search for the meaning behind Kane's last word in the big "Citizen Kane" opening scene, she has earned her place among the great stories if Hollywood's story. <br /> <br /> But I think Welles & Mankiewicz mostly got the "Susan Alexander" facsimile of the real article. <br /> <br /> Don't bother to vote if you agree or disagree with this post, which I really couldn't care less.
