It was so bad that I want God to give me an extra two hours of life that has had to sit through it. <br /> <br /> First, the play was uniformly bad. There was hardly a plot unless "Shaggy's story with a guy in a rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog" counts. The editing was everywhere and the slow moot of "gore" (red corn syrup flying through the air - no doubt thrown by a spoon) became annoying after the tenth time and staggering after a hundred times. I like Michael Rooker. He has done some good work. It was not good. This was less than good. And so I mean it sucked. Hard. <br /> <br /> For God's sake, don't see this movie.
