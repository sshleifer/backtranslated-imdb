This takes place in the 1920s Harlem. A black owned nightclub should handle gangsters and corrupt police officers. <br /> <br /> Terrible vanity project for Eddie Murphy. It tries to mix comedy and drama and fails both. Comedy is simply not fun, and the drama is boring and badly acted. You think a movie with three comedy legends - Eddie Murphy, Save Foxx and Richard Pryor - would be great, but it isn't. There is a non-stop gang and the OPENING scene has a young boy who kills a man (this is shown as OK). We also have the beautiful Della Reese broken down to play a lady. One of the "comic" highlights has a long, eerie and terribly vicious battle between her and Murphy. A boring, offensive and stupid mess. Not the worst Murphy movie, but pretty close. A 1 all the way.
