If you're one of those people who don't really like Sci-fi because of their sometimes long-term ideas and surreal world perspectives, stay away as far as you can from Stuart Gordon's Space Truckers! It is truly an absurd space adventure filled with eccentric characters, colorful kitsch and ridiculous plot twists. Frankly? I would probably never have watched this movie if it wasn't for Gordon's name on the credits. This guy comes pretty close to being a genius in the horror genre with undeniable milestones such as "From Beyond" and "Re-Animator" on his summary. Apparently Stuart Gordon likes his humor as twisted as possible! He already went all over the comedy peak once (with Re-Animator), but with the slight difference that the bizarre humor was effective there. Something that is not the case for Space Truckers? Most gags do not lead anywhere, and the completely exaggerated atmosphere only works in small doses. Ultimately, everything left is an occasionally entertaining but completely unnecessary mess. Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance (or at least a semi Charles Dance) are always a joy to watch, and the still amazing Barbara Crampton has a small role near the film's ending. Crampton was Stuart Gordon's regular heroine in previous horror films. The story of Space Truckers is as stupid as they come. Dennis Hopper plays the self-made wages that are busy with his job. Who wouldn't be when transporting pigs over the galaxy for a company called Interpork? He sees his change to escape while he brings his mouse to the ground. They float into Space pirates and find out their cargo is supposed to eradicate half of the universe! Stuart Gordon returned wisely back to horror again after this little escapade. Since Space Truckers he has already made the sublime 'King of the Ants' and the absolutely brilliant `Dagon'
