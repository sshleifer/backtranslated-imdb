I didn't think this movie was very good at all. Basically, they took a lot of one-liners from various Shirley Temple movies, threw them together, and had Orr act as Shirley Temple worked on the screen. "Oh my God!" was said quite a few times. If you are familiar with Shirley Temple movies, you will recognize several lines directly from her movie. The problem is that they have Orr who says these in Shirley's everyday life. Ultimately, what we get is a hodgepodge of restored Shirley Temple movies, rather than any kind of real look at Shirley Temple. Save yourself the trouble and rent Shirley Temple movies, it's much better than watching Orr and try to recreate Shirley's acting style.
