This really is one of the worst movies ever made - and I don't mean such a bad-it's-good kind of way. Eddie Murphy is a great cartoon and it is a testament to how bad this movie is, it almost killed its career. The script and direction are inappropriate, the sets and the performance are as imaginative as a Brady Bunch episode, and the play shows how bad a big cast can be when they absolutely have nothing to work with. If it wasn't for the costumes - which besides Eddie Murphy's ego seems to account for the bulk of the budget - you would swear that this thing was merged by a bunch of high school students wasted on peppermint. That anyone could find this travesty in any way fun or entertaining is scary. It is probably not by chance that the deceived souls who boast this stink are hardly read. But if your thinking about hilarity is that Della Reese gets her "pinkie toe" shot out, then by all means, you should set aside your cold cup and rent this movie.
