This is a god horrible Norris movie, with one of the most annoying performances ever in Calvin Levels and a weak script. The signs were horrible and it hardly has any action, plus even Chuck Norris stinks in this! Christopher Neame is very weak as the biggest villain, and the story was not very interesting, but Norris felt sorry for everything and I did not blame him as I was! Calvin levels give one of the most annoying performances in a movie ever, I couldn't stand as I was tempted to pull the tape out of my video, plus Norris and Levels had no chemistry together! If you are looking for some fantastic martial arts flights from Norris, you are not close to this, but if you want a movie with an uninteresting story, hardly any action and bad acting looks! This is a god horrible Norris movie, with one of the most annoying performances ever from Calvin's levels, Avoid it as a bother! The direction is incredibly poor. Aaron Norris does an incredibly bad job here, without excitement or excitement gentle camera work and keeps the movie at a dull pace! There is little blood and violence. We get 2 gory impaling's, torn out heart, exploding body and a few shots shot. The action is really bad. Chuck Norris is not amazing as he usually is here and seemed very bored here, his one line is flat, and his acting was not that great, and I'm a big Norris fan, this is his absolute worst! (Norris still rules!). Calvin Levels is INCREDIBLY annoying here, his whiny wimpy performance tore me tremendously, I hoped he was fine, but unfortunately he did not. Christopher Neame is pretty weak as the biggest villain, his voice was tough, but he over acted great time! Sheree J. Wilson is beautiful and did it okay with what she had to do. The rest of the throw is terrible. Overall, avoid it here, it's not worth the torture, even if you're a big Norris fan (like me). BOMB out of 5
