Man this thing bites! I'm sorry I ever sat down and looked at it! Friedkin was insane to make a movie trying to win over the viewers' sympathy for this lunatic. If I had that, I'd have gotten the audience hated the low life instead of getting everyone foggy over him! He killed people! Totally grizzly, I can also add! And Friedkin wants you to be sorry for him, because he is "not real"! I say Friedkin can forget it! I hate the guy, this movie is partly based on it and hope they did well and give it up, the juice !!! In a nutshell, don't waste your time! It's sick and perverted!
