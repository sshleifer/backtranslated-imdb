I probably don't hate this movie if I spoke Polish. I chose the English version on the first menu, but it gave me a Polish dialogue with English subtitles, just like the Polish version did. Perhaps the dialogue was so uneven, because the person who did the subtitles couldn't translate it into English very well. To aggravate the problem, some of the dialogue had no subtitles at all. The action was pretty bad, especially the female leader who was melodramatic about everything! A scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing, and when the mob fell around her, opened her shirt and the instructor showed close-ups of her naked chest for the next 15-20 seconds. I couldn't see how her chest added to the drama on stage or movie. Perhaps the instructor tried to increase the number of teenage boys in the audience. Much of the movie takes place in an extermination camp released by the Americans. First, the "American" uniforms did not look like US Army uniforms. Secondly, none of the extermination camps in Poland were liberated by the Americans. I think that a Polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would know better than an American born in 1966 that all six extermination camps were liberated by the Russians. All in all, it's just not a very good movie if you don't speak Polish.
