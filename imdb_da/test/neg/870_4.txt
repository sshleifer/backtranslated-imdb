Any great romantic comedy needs conflict between the romantic leads to derive excitement, anticipation and allure for the plot. This story falls completely flat in this area. There is no conflict - at least no one would inhibit the final joining of the two main characters, and so the tension is flat, there is no expectation, and there is no conviction at all. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane is at best representative of friendship, and with the two special actors' talent I was totally surprised. During the movie I expect them to play a game of checkers and talk about the weather more than to see any moving passion. <br /> <br /> While I'm a fan of both actors, I think the casting in this movie was off - or maybe the direction off-base and it affected their deliveries. The writing was very weak, which could also have affected the performances; Probably the script could have used some help from some Harlequin writers who have real experience of putting the heat in romance. <br /> <br /> This movie may be worth watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but only after it's on a cheap shelf. <br /> <br /> (Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
