Downhill Racer is essentially a movie to watch only for the amazing ski sequences. Although there is a story here, Robert Redford's character, a skier trying to make the US Olympic team, is so bland and unsympathetic that you wonder why you don't worry about him at all. Gene Hackman adds nicely in an early performance, but it is a movie that could be seen with the sound off and it wouldn't make much difference.
