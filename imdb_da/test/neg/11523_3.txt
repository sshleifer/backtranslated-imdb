I really should have learned more about this movie before renting it. It was one of those films where you continue to see what is expected to improve. So when it ends, you feel stupid for wasting precious time in your life that you can never come back to. Ice-T did its evil guy things and well it was the highlight of the evening. The pictures on the pendulum look like it was made with a little toy inside a box, and the spacewalking scenes were fun because you could see the strings attached to the space package. The manuscript was missing and the cargo scene with the guy blew and went unconscious was incredible because he was driving better than I could have on one of my best days. All in all, I've seen worse, but it's probably not one I would recommend or will remember.
