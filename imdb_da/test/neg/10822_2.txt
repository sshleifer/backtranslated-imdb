Mixed groups of "experts" (explorers, divers and scientists) wander one kilometer underground and go another 2.4 miles underwater to a place even more remote, finding salamanders, giant albino piers (??) and some major ones razor-fanged, winged, computer-generated creatures wonder. The cave is sealed by a rock slider and then attacks monsters and begins to kill everyone as they seek an exit. And that's all she wrote with this low-key effort that doesn't even combine action, science fiction and horror at the most elementary levels. Imagine if anyone gave people on the Sci-Fi Channel $ 30 million to make a monster movie. It is exactly what CAVE is like; almost unforgettable in its awkwardness, sometimes full of clichés and almost exclusively dependent on the special effects that must entertain. The only difference is that they had more money to build sets, more money for polishing monsters and more money to hire allegedly professional actors who still give horrible beliefs. Otherwise it is business as normal. Some of these movies are still fun to watch. This is not and there are many reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1.) It takes way too seriously and has no sense of humor at all. So you get a completely unoriginal and predictable movie that doesn't even recognize how unoriginal and predictable it is. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening order serves no purpose other than killing a few minutes and adding to the redundancy. <br /> <br /> 3.) Unoriginal-looking CGI creatures do not impress anyone in this day and age. <br /> <br /> 4. Using shakycam and quick editing for your horror scenes is simply lazy, imaginative film making. And why confuse the action further by making things too dark and adding annoying distractions such as. Fire and explosion of bubbles? This makes these scenes not only difficult to see but also impossible to enjoy even at a no-brainer action level. <br /> <br /> 5.) Although it wants you to take it seriously, the script is full of clichés, the dialogue is horrible, and there is no attempt at characterization. Casting 25-year-old model types in roles such as brilliant scientists and gruff veteran explorers can give something an eye, but it completely kills the credibility of a movie that otherwise plays out completely. Sorry, you can't have it both ways. <br /> <br /> 6.) There were two exceptions to the model rule when they decided to throw an old guy and an average looking Joe. These were the first two signs to be killed. <br /> <br /> 7.) For a small variety they also pushed into a black guy and a Chinese guy. Strangely, much of a voice has not been given in this film and is basically in the background when whitey discusses what their next move will be. Insulting. <br /> <br /> 8.) In addition, how many movies should be made where a black character sacrifices his life at the end to ensure that Hot White Female Lead and Hot White Male Lead end up at the end? Ugh. Give me a break already. <br /> <br /> 9.) Much of the play was terrible. Cole Hauser's performance was absolutely ridiculous. The other male lead looked as though he just walked away from the set of soap soap and coasted using the patented dimpled-smile-makes-all-the-ladies-swoon technique, which is the PG-13 gender shift similar to my - Great breast-make-all-the-guys-swoon technique often used by ladies in R-rated movies. In any way, his performance was completely phoned. Daniel Dae Kim (from the TV series "Lost") and Piper Perabo also stood up in the room with their stylish and monotonous line delivery. <br /> <br /> 10.) Where does a joke end? Absolutely terrible. Please God, we don't need a successor to this garbage. So basically I wouldn't bother with this unless you've never seen a monster movie before, or if you're just really desperate and the only other thing is "The Simple Life." The sets were good, the blue-colored photography is ok, and a couple of the actors (Lena Headey, Marcel Iures ...) tried their best, so I decided to increase the rating on a notch to a "2."
