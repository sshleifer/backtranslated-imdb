I just have to comment on this movie because I gave it a 4 rating, and in my opinion it is pretty high for a softporn smut movie. The actual plot is kind of hokey (which would expect otherwise) but Hafron is so incredibly fun and he delivers everything in a cyborgish voice so it's easy for him. The one who wrote the script had something quite clear! I must have liked ten times, and that is not one reason why anyone would download this movie. The only soft-film I've seen that has other benefits than beautiful women (and believe me, Emmanuelle is drop dead beautiful ... just look at the cover!) <br /> <br /> Any movie that can entertain me considering how poor the plot was and how bad the play is, and considering that the film was not made for artistic entertainment, so it is at least four in my book. I mean, who wouldn't see this before Stop! Or will my mother shoot?
