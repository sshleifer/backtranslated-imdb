It's such a shame when high-quality actors and actresses get involved in pure crap, probably because they were offered a lot of money. Not one of Helen Mirren's better career moves. The action of "teenagers" is simply appalling, not helped by a script that is in parts, just inappropriate. Most of Kevin Williamson's work is above average box office dross, but it's really under par. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie you watch on TV when there's nothing better, and you've had half a bottle of wine to drink and waiting for the pizza to be delivered so you can drink the other half.
