Family Guy is easily one of the worst shows I've ever forced me to watch (not at the bottom, even though I've seen The Jersey Shore). A popular hit with high school and college kids who fail immaturity for edginess, this show is unoriginal and outdated. Since this has been called a comedy show, let's take a look at its "humor". 1. Random flashbacks / cuts to celebrities or movies or politics or something that can be cut for a knee brace. It was old after 5 or so repetitions per. Episode. Simple Solution: Every time you hear "This is worse than / as time ...", connect your ears. <br /> <br /> 2. Inability for your own sake. This show is notorious for inserting inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall plot. Solution: See South Park. They did it right. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that Family Guy is not worth your time and doesn't hold a light to The Simpsons.
