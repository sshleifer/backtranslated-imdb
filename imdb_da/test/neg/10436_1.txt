The recent DVD release of Good Humor Man marks the movie as a comedy. It's hardly a comedy, rather a boring indie film about a group of losers. Probably set in the 70s, there is little attention to period details, with excessively subdued color correction taking its place. The monotonous soundtrack only serves to emphasize the repetition of the movie (perhaps that is the point, but it does not add to the enjoyment of the viewing experience.) Fortunately, the click of losers resembles hanging out in one place, the ink. It seems to the film's packaging, as a comedy is supposed to deceive people into renting or buying this movie, which is a complete waste of time.
