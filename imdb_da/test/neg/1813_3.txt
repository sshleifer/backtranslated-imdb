Despite the excellent cast and the potential of history, this film fails at many levels. I was convinced that the director was a beginner. The movie is very poorly edited, shows many non-important and annoying flashes, has very visible goofs and has no exciting atmosphere at all. The question that repeatedly appeared in my mind while you watched this was "so what?" I couldn't care less about the main character and what was happening to him. It is not that the story is not convincing, it is simply the way it is told. The film tells the story. PERIOD. It's like an actor mumbling his lines without knowing what he's saying. The film simply tells the events that happen without any soul. And the director is to blame. He does not know how to make something interesting or exciting or fun. (And believe me, I'm NOT someone who wants to see die hard 8 or 2 fast 2 crappy. On the contrary, I especially love slow-paced movies.) So I was convinced that the director was a beginner. But to my surprise, this man has many years of experience and has worked as a film photographer or camera assistant on many fantastic productions. Guess he had a bad year since then.
