Altman's Quintet should be considered more than just defective: As many other reviewers have pointed out, the ideas behind the film, even some of the choices depicting these ideas, should work - and yet very little in this difficult movie. The partially fogged camera lens - I noticed my wife that it must be the most distracting direct performance I've ever seen - never allowed me to enter the "movie world." <br /> <br /> In general, there are serious problems with the mise-one scene employed here. Obviously, there was little thought in factors such as costume and production design, but it is not very effective to induce a credible world. Maybe it's a matter of scope; The film is so phased that I laughed aloud when it was mentioned that "five million" people lived in the city. (Yes, I understand the limitations of the film's budget. Matte paintings here and there could have helped.) In all the most disappointing Altman movies I've ever seen. Great ideas and great metaphors do not always come through in art - it's just part of the game.
