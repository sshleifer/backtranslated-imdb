the worst sequel I've ever seen. really horrible songs that are disturbing considering how amazing the first movie scores and stories are! Also, who destroys the movie for me, there's no John Cleese, so Jean Bob can't even be in it, and the new villains are terrible. It is really annoying how the old woman type of thing cannot stretch a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words again and again and again. But to be fair Uberta does not turn off is a little fun. but it was her 50th birthday: Why is she drawing her as an 80 year old? I should give this a 1, but now I think ... I can give it a 2. But the story is still not as good as the first movie. It is the same without any humor from certain signs. All in all I didn't really like this movie because of the disappointing music, the serious lack of talent: having changed Prince Derek's and Jean Bob's voice, the new villains, the disappointing story the annoying habits of some characters and the very simple animation.
