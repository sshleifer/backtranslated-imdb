I really love Lucy too ... comic genius yes ..... MAME ... NEVER ... she was as ridiculous as Mame ... who was the movie adapting divine secrets of the Ya Ya sisterhood. Both just lost the point. Roslind Russell was, is and will always be the first and only Mame. Perhaps Ball, as a young starlet, could have drawn a role like this, where her inherent beauty and youth could have carried her through ... but it seemed a desperate attempt by an old star to show she was still viable in the field. The reason why there are so many other supporters of Russell's version (except that you can't improve the original) is that Russell had a presence, she absorbed every scene, while Lucille Ball might as well be a pattern on the wallpaper in Mame for all the attention she commands in the role.
