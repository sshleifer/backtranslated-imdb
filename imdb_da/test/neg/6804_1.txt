Have not really heard too much about this movie, so I went and saw it. I realized that this movie only appeals to someone who has not lived in the real world. And even these people would think that this movie was moving too slowly. <br /> <br /> When the movie opens, you see Nicole Kidman go to a nudist camp. Whoa. Shock. The scene, dialouge, was all great. And then the movie went down. <br /> <br /> While respecting the vision that the filmmaker must have, this movie is sucked. It was too slow, too predictable, and not moving enough. Robert Downey Jr. is great as usual, but this movie is not good enough to sit through. It tries to be shocking and abnormal, but makes bad use of all the actors' talents. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money even if the gender scenes were boring.
