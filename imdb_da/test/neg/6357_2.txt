<br /> <br /> As a fan of bad movies (and MST3K, and member of MFT3K), I have to say I've seen my share of them. Men geez! Even the worst I've seen has at least had a soundtrack. As George Lazenby stumbles around Hong Kong, who knows what you can guarantee you won't be distracted by any of the background music that fills today's movie. Or any of the music that fills elevators. I don't think anyone in this movie even topples. <br /> <br /> Now it's not quite true - there * is * a soundtrack. If you listen carefully, you will hear the chime about fifty times through the film's course. Of course, the timing will be completely inappropriate and it does not take very long, but something that can be classified as "music" occurs. Your best bet, however, is to sit your toddler armed with a wooden spoon just in front of the TV with a collection of pots and pans while you watch. The rhythm and power would be better than what the movie offers. <br /> <br /> Watch for Sammo Hung as a minor villian in this movie. Are we not all happy that he found Jackie Chan to work with?
