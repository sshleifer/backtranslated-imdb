Following an undercover mission in Bucharest to reveal an international gang of dealers, Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) is assigned to protect Romanian Nadia Kaminski (Silvia Colloca), the widow of a Romanian mafia accountant. But the CIA security house has been broken by the criminals, and Sonni realizes that the information was leaked from the agency. Alone who only trusts his friend Michael Shepard (William Hope), battles Sonni to survive and protect Nadia. <br /> <br /> The career of Wesley Snipes is down. I've just seen this flick and it's another disappointing movie by this actor whose career is currently similar to Steven Segal's one. The movie has many explosions, shots and car crashes associated with a horrible story and horrible acting. First, the African American Wesley Snipes are being chased by the police in Bucharest, but they never find a black American man. I have never been to Romania, but I think there are not many African Americans in this country. His character doesn't like bathing, wearing the same clothes on many days. There is no chemistry between Sonni and the sexy Silvia Colloca, but she has free sex, falls in love with him and shares her happiness with him. The boy performing Nadia's son is horrible. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Detonador" ("The Detonator")
