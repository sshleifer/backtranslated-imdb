Although this film was nothing special as such, I am drawn to commenting on at least one factor prevailing in its favor - that of the leading female artist in the movie Dyan Cannon. Despite the film's ridiculous story and what she's going through here, her best acting in the movie, making the incredible seem more plausible. Her raucous scene with gay photographer David Hemmings should be seen as being believed. Good work, Dyan.
