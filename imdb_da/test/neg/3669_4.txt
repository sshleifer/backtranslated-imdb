"Undercurrent" has a top-notch cast of wonderful actors who may have been brought together to the perfect comic book comedy. Alas, they are pretty much wasted on a 'women's view' of potboiler - and a paper thin on it. Katharine Hepburn is actually brilliant as a tomboy / old girl who finally marries but her husband is severely disturbed and has dark family secrets. Director Vincente Minnelli has no idea how to mount this foreign plot, summarized by Edward Chodorov from a story by Thelma Strabel, and the friendly, first-class cast (including Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Edmund Gwenn) leaves treading in dark water. ** from ****
