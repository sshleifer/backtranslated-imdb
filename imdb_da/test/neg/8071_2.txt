I live in Rome, where the Turkish director of this movie lives and works. From my Italian friends I have heard many good things about his film ... so after seeing prevleven I really wanted to see "Cuore Sacro". I am deeply disappointed, one of the most pompous, pseudo-religious, highly unlikely and naive films. I love movies, but this one is really heavy and bad. The protagonist is really crazy and should be locked up in a madhouse ... made me sympathize with an aunt negative character who runs a dirty business that will only make money ... and I consider myself an anti-capitalist ... so bad !!!
