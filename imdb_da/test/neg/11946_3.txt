There is really only one reason to see this almost inadequate and completely predictable movie about a bred chef Kate Armstrong (Catherine Zeta Jones) whose life changes as she inherits her orphan niece Zoe (Abigail Breslin) after her sister is killed in a car wreck. And that's why Aaron Eckhart (Nick), with his floppy haircut and appealing laddish attitude, looks good enough to strike between two slices of organic Pannini and eat with an olive oil and balm vinaigrette dip and a pair of finely tarted sun dried tomatoes. He reminds me of Sean Bean. The thought that he could take off his shirt was the only thing that kept me awake until the end. He removed his apron petulantly several times, but to my disappointment he never went further. <br /> <br /> I can't be too critical because I saw it on pay-per-view at home, so it didn't cost me the price of two movie tickets at least, and I was brought up to be grateful for little mercy. But really, this is Rom Com at its most formal. Zeta Jones gives a very flat, monotonous performance, she seemed completely deficient in passion (possibly due to the time she apparently used in the cold store in the restaurant? Tretti takes in that could not have been fun) and her face hardly changed expression throughout the movie. Abigail Breslin was pretty good as a niece, she is such an attractive little girl that it is quite impossible to criticize her, and yet I loved her in Little Miss Sunshine. Patricia Clarkson is always good value and I can't really fault her performance as a restaurant owner because she seemed very unhappy, given what a good actor she is and how little she had to do here. But everything is just as clich√©d, much of the dialogue path, and the result is so obvious. This is the cinematic equivalent of paint by number, and Zeta Jones and Eckhart generate little heat on the screen. Nick likes Italian food (undoubtedly indicates his burning inner passion) and boils to the sound of Puccini. His appearance in Kate's kitchen at 22 Bleecker (the restaurant's name) presumably predicts his feathers, but his eerie ability to join his niece by making pizza and building a Bedouin tent in the living room brings Kate around and despite a couple stumbling along the way she ends up giving him her valued possession. No, not her. But her recipe for saffron sauce. <br /> <br /> I'm very unfair here, aren't I? I think Rom Com is Rom Com and we all know what we are doing when we sign up. But should it always be so mindful that it is numbingly boring?
