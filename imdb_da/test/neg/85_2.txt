I have no idea how anyone can give this movie high marks. I did not rent it because it was the next big horror flick, the next big horror poof or the next big low budget horror poof. Obviously, this is not supposed to intimidate, but a fatal error in production completely excluded the joy of viewing. The audio editing was horrible. I had to work with the volume control the whole movie. You can imagine how hard it is to get into something - even with a low budget spoof - when you either turn the volume up or down or try to predict the next time you do it. The regular dialogue is very low, and all screams, sounds, etc. are very loud. We are not talking about switching between 5 and 7 on the volume control and finding a good medium in 6 years. We speak between 2 and 9 on the volume, where it is almost impossible to leave the volume alone. Again, this movie can be a decent example of what it is supposed to be, but you will spend so much time adjusting your volume that you never get the chance to enjoy it.
