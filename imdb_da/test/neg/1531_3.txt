Because it came from HBO and based on IMDb rating, I saw the first season in this series what wasted. The characters are occasionally interesting, but most cartoon-like. The play ranges from good to mediocre talent with a S T R O N G emphasis on the latter. Not only do prisoners, also viewers, should leave all hope by the cell door that this story is credible, it is such a lot of mouth that you will need unusually strong testicular strength to keep an eye on. The violence, which, with most of the developments in history, is titrating, and what morality probably serves, is that of the slight variation. If your idea of ​​excellent television includes the writing, acting and overall production quality seen in THE SOPRANOS, DEADWOOD or SIX FEET during, avoid OZ. If you want to see a Disneyland for illiterate Jerks, see OZ. Things like this give edgy a bad name.
