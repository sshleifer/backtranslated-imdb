I like underdogs. So 12 years after seeing Star Trek V first and thought it was bizarre bad, I gave it a second look and hoped I would find a redeeming quality that I missed the first time. <br /> <br /> I didn't. <br /> <br /> The script is half-baked, and although the quality of the play is initially stable enough to hold the film on its feet (albeit shaky), the farther we get into the plot the sillier it gets. The film's last quarter is just rather ridiculous. What was even worse, from the original cast's POV, is that this was the first ST movie released after the franchise returned to TV with Next Generation, and the average episode of Next Generation would make it shameful * - including the special effects! What an embarrassment. The final limit is not thoroughly miserable - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it is so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes also the first) that the only reason I would like to see it is because you want to appreciate the other movies more. <br /> <br /> * unless it's an episode of Troi's mother in it.
