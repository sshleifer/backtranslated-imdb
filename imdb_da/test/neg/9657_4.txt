I find it amazing that so many people (probably Poles) voted for this movie, giving them such characters (mostly tigers). OK, the movie was fine, fun, but it was nothing special on the other side. The only good thing about Kiler is the dialogues that are not quite comprehensive for non-Poles. Manuscript is primitive, the actor (except Jerzy Stuhr as Ryba) - horrible. It is too much ado about nothing - fortunately it is not included in the top 250. P.S. The sequel "Kilerow 2-och" ("2 Wedges") is on its way, and that's just the same story.
