Yes, this bizarre feature was written by John Sayles. Shot in Toronto is another 80's era feature about the dangers of the city's jungle, where the police fear to walk and the homeless and criminal classes are the only residents. In this blend comes the myth of Wild Thing, a young young man raised by a bag lady, after his parents were murdered by a dirty policeman (Maury Chaykin) and Chopper, the local crime commander (Robert Davi). Touch the local do-gooders (pastor Sean Hewitt and clueless social worker Kathleen Quinlan) and you have a recipe for some pretty unexciting action sequences. Davi is a standout among the cast, and film photographer Rene Verzier does a pretty good job. Otherwise, this is a pretty shabby action image that does not satisfy action fans and will leave Sayles' admirers slack-jawed.
