***** I reveal two "twists" at the end of the movie. Don't read if you want to watch this movie for some reason ***** <br /> <br /> Oh my, this is bad. And for some reason, Sean Bean, one of the greatest contemporary actors, has sold his soul and appears in it. The only consolation is that the screenwriters must have realized that someone who, ultimately, pathetic as Steve Guttenberg would never in his life strive to kill anyone as tough as Sean Bean. Instead, he is killed in what must have seemed like a wonderful twist at the end of the good guy who was to be killed by Bean, but was actually his boss and faked his own death. Do not worry. I haven't ruined anything for you. The action itself is spectacularly absent, with Guttenberg's patented "Hey-look-I-can-pull-a-Chuck-Norris face" hard-man star dominating most of the two-hour hell on earth. Added to a plot that I could have written while being tortured and hung upside down with both hands cut off, there is also a completely obscene critique in the fact that for a moment the virus will escape if they see it so badly In another moment, Steve Guttenberg is poorly killing it, throwing, catching bashing and generally abusing this 'virus', which has a distinctive look of a collection of the small balls of soap you put into your bath. My last word? If you are suicidally depressed and feel like you are laughing manically at something that should be a bad comedy, but even worse, don't lose it the next time it is on channel 5 at midnight, and then burn it when you realize that I actually tell the truth.
