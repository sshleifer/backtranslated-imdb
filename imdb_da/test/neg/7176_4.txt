I admit this is not a good movie. It strangles almost "low budget" even strangely, I still thought I liked the movie, because even if it lacked quality, it was abundant of energy. It was like the little engine that could and a movie merged into one! <br /> <br /> The movie takes place on a radio network and relates to some of their low-key employees - two-side boys (a very pushy and brash and the other a wuss) as well as a new receptionist. All three have visions of the radius star, but currently have to satisfy their poor job. <br /> <br /> In this story, a murder appears that seems a little out of the blue. I didn't know this was a murder mystery movie and was a little surprised. But like most B-mysteries, the Poles are lambrins, and it's up to our intrusive hero (Moran) to try to save the day. Through all this, I had difficulty deciding whether Moran was unpleasant or endearing. I'm still not sure !! <br /> <br /> There is a moment in the movie that is high on the "cringe factor" and that is when the two sides try out the radio comedians. They appear in black-face and make a 3rd or 4th rate imitation of Amos n 'Andy. Apart from being very insensitive, it wasn't fun either. Fortunately, the show manufacturer they tried to feel the same way. <br /> <br /> All in all. It's easy to skip this movie and I wouldn't blame you if you do. However, the odd and frenetic pace of the movie seemed to make up for the film's artistic shortcomings and I'm glad I saw it. A good movie? No. But there is still a look at fans of old Bs. By the way, maybe I just didn't have very good taste, but I thought both female song dives really had bad voices despite how everyone in the movie is imprisoned by their warblings. Listen to yourself and let me know what you think. I just couldn't believe that it was not allowed to sing on film, even though it was only too low Monogram Studios.
