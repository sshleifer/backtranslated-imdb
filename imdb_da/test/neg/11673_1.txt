This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max movie after watching Road Warrior and experiencing the excellent movie, I felt a little disappointed after seeing this. It apparently started as a kind of child in the desert movie, and was merged with the Mad Max franchise (bad idea). Castings were not exactly the best I think to come at Tina Turner? One of the biggest problems with this movie is that there are no bad guys. No Wez, no Humungus, not even a decent sequel! Nothing really even happens if you plan to see this part pair action flick (can it even be called it?) Make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max, or better yet both. Another problem with this movie is that there are too many people, even though the Thunderdome battle sequence is boring, Max doesn't even kill anyone! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not the right way) and after watching this movie, it left a very bad taste in my mouth.
