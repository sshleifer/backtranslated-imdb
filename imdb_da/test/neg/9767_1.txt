This movie was not good at all. I was able to capture it at a film festival and did not appreciate the content I was forced to see. It is a well-shot movie about family seeking to reconnect after the death of the family's cornerstone (Gabrielle Union) dies. movie stars Billy Dee Williams as brother of the Union Union. Well, in fact, Gabrielle Union portrays the woman in her early years, which should help explain why the woman was Billy Dee Williams older sister. This had to be Billy Dee Wilhelm's worst performance in his career, ever. He looked like he couldn't remember his lines in a couple of scenes. He was an unlikely, almost never empathetic character who drove a daughter while he was married to a white woman with whom he already had a daughter. The two daughters are older now, and when the daughter he had with the white woman (Lucy) tried to connect with him, his second daughter didn't want to do anything with him. Billy Dee's character was so pathetic that the only way they could get him to fly in from Paris for his sister's funeral was to tell him that the funeral had already gone and his sister left him responsible for dealing with her. paperwork. Why did they have to fool him? Because he didn't like to attend funerals. I know. You ask, "but he didn't want to attend his own sister's funeral either?" Yes! He claims he did not like being around the forced feelings of emotion shared by the people who pay their respect. He didn't want anything to do with it. Now we suppose that empathy with that one ** hole? The rest of the performance in the film was flat with even flat figures. The director and editor did not care to consider the film's pacing. Flashbacks were painful to watch. It was a bad movie. However, it seems to be the favorite of black film festivals; a movie that exerts African American dependence on Caucasians to find a love that they can settle with, even if it is a healthy relationship. When lame love stories like this win the best of festivals at the black film festivals, it causes me to question the judgment of black people on film. At these same festivals, the only films that win awards are educational films about African American culture and black films directed by Caucasian instructors. I'm not saying that something is wrong with a white person who leads stories written to people in color. The problem with these films is that they never argue from both points of view, which are usually the films that actually speak to the masses. These films are often unilateral forms of didactics. These films fail to exercise the powers on both sides of the argument that the film is revolving. The authors and directors never compose scenes and sequences that contradict your final statement with as much truth and energy as those that reinforce it. These films always trembled the argument. What I am saying is the people who run these black film festivals judge a movie of pure content, which for me means controlling, performing, writing movies, editing, etc. Or do they judge the films simply because the message is delivered about African American culture? Do we consider expecting a movie like Constellation to get a shot in the world against movies like "Million Dollar Baby" and "Sideways?" What happened to movies to be entertaining? When I mean entertainment, I mean the ritual of sitting in the dark, staring at the screen, investing immense concentration and energy into what you hope will be satisfactory, meaningful emotional experience. Why can't these festivals appreciate movies that get their messages without preaching? Why can't these black film festivals recognize movies that are well-written pieces of work that are brutally honest, tell the truth? "I think we have no responsibility to heal social diseases or renew faith in humanity, to raise the spirits of society or even to express our inner being. We have only one responsibility: to tell the truth." - Robert McKee. Now it totally agrees with me. These same black film festivals put down "Hustle and Flo" as if it were such horrible movie stereotypical blacks. But it's an honest movie about a pimp with a dream. A pimp can't dream? I remember the last time I saw a real pimp he was a human. And aren't they, pimps and prostitution, a tough reality in our society as a whole, not just in the black community, but everywhere? The powers of "black Hollywood" believe that movies like this make African Americans bad in the eyes of others, as if others don't know there are pimps in the cap. The truth is, until African American people in movies can accept the truth about themselves and dare to share it with the world, then our movie will never have a chance in the world. This movie was horrible. The best part was the movie and Zoe.
