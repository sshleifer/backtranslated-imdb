Maybe I'm too generous when I give this movie two and a half stars out of five, but there was an occasional moment. But as an "American werewolf" movie, this one is a bad chance! There are no real plot connections to the superior original to talk about, but the story is in some ways "London". <br /> <br /> * Possible Spoiler Warning * American children go to foreign country, you fall in love a beautiful girl. Another of the children is slaughtered by a werewolf in the same night, being bitten, and in spite of his undead friend's warnings, by the light of the full moon he traces fur, fangs and claws! <br /> <br /> But there are some differences in history, for one; the girl is one of the werewolves. Second; There are three American children. And third; There is something strange - @ $$ Werewolves intention to take over the world! So crazy as it sounds, the last one was not a joke! * Spoiler Ends * <br /> <br /> The movie suffers from many things, firstly the weak play beats it a lot! Tom Everret Scott's performance is at best amatuerish, and he and Julie Delpy, who play their love interest, don't seem to have any chemistry at all. Second; A weak script that seems to be everywhere. Many elements of excitement and dark comedy that made the original great lack in this. And the one who said to eat out of the wolf's heart that bit you will change you back human? Last I heard it was not part of the werewolf lore at all! Third; horrible special effects Werewolf effects are made with computer animation that works for things like dinosaurs, ghosts and spaceships. But it seems choppy, fake and artificial when used for frantic creatures like werewolves. <br /> <br /> But there were a few things that saved this from the overall "turkeydom", a hilarious scene in a cafe in Paris, when Andy (Scott) has coffee with Serafine (Delpy), he Drop a bunch of condoms on the table and try to deliver them as chewing gum by chewing and blowing a bubble! Also; the soundtrack, a very cool mix of alternative rock bands like Bush and Smashmouth. Although none of the songs have the word "moon" in their title, like the original movie, the soundtrack is nevertheless fantastic. And another fun scene when a decaying corpse played by Julie Bowen tries to whistle and her eyeball pops out, making me laugh aloud. <br /> <br /> But overall, this movie seems to lack game and excitement of the original. And the overriding conclusion doesn't help much either. <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 Two and a half out of five stars (average.)
