As with most viewers of this movie, I am an avid reader of the books. The first two films have Buck, Ray and Chloe as main characters, but in the second sequel they play second gossip to Louis Gossett JR's presidential efforts. World at War is based on the meeting he has with Buck in the book series. <br /> <br /> The problem is - this movie is as horrible as the first two. Amanda appears from nowhere and suddenly has a significant role to play (I won't reveal it if someone hasn't read the series). Other illogical parts have function. I really really want Cloud 10 to make a good Left Movie, but unfortunately it looks like all the bad ways to the first 2.
