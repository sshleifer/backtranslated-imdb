Childish history struck by a lama Hollywood movie, horrible plays, cheesy dialogue and not quite "up-to-couple" sex scenes. It's really another great softcore parody! I really enjoyed this movie! Sure the play is terrible, but that part of the fun! The story is ridiculous, but some things have to be sacrificed when the story is about girls-on-girl sex scenes. And because it's only softcore (no penetration), the sex scenes were a little gentle. But it's like the great god softcore smut Russ Meyers said, "Who really cares what goes down below the waist." I do not know if I agree with Mr. Meyers on this one, but what the hell ... the girl entertained me for an hour and a half. I give it a C +, it would have been a solid B if they could throw more of the girls to look like Russ Meyer's actresses. Vavoom! Vavoom! ~
