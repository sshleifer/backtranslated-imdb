<br /> <br /> Man, I just can't believe this movie. I've seen it all (believe me, I've done this!) And the best part was the trainees at the start (and I hate traillers !!!!). No plot, no action, no nothing. I watched movies and thought, "When will this start?" It never began. How can people spend money and time to do such a crap? "Plot": A dog is bitten by a bat and gets rabies - Okay, until now no problem, nothing special, but OK. Now the rest of the movie will be - the dog will hunt people !!! thats it, nothing else !!! Now add some of the worse acts / actors I have ever seen, some totally irrational scenes (and some others really idiotic as the child can't breathe and the mother gives him a big and strong hug to see if he gets better) and a lot of lame conclusion, this is what you have CRAP ... ops! .... CUJO. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and do something more dignified, such as hitting your head against the wall or chess with yourself. <br /> <br /> Zero out of 10. Gabriel.
