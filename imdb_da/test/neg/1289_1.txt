If you ever plan to rent (hopefully not buy) this movie, think again. It was as if Gary Busey had a gun in his head and was forced to act or die. I'm just wondering if Busey was arrested for anything and was sentenced to play in this movie because I just didn't see the guy who acted so much better with Keanu Reeves in Point Break games in this disaster. It was a good movie, but there are thousands of other emotional movies that make you laugh without having you get the money back. <br /> <br /> The only reason I would ever tell anyone to rent this movie is to watch this movie watching Gary Busey jump up and down like a monkey. If you want a good fun movie, send up Quigley and let SpongeBob or something.
