"Marathon" has a very interesting premise, excellent ambient sounds and good nature. Unfortunately, apart from these aspects, the film falls flat on the face. For a woman trying to complete so many crosswords in a day, she spends a terrible amount of time standing around, like, and not making puzzles. I think there are more walking shows in the movie than her work on these puzzles. Also, while I understand the point of showing so much nature, there is simply far too much of it. The movie is incredibly boring and unfocused. It is not worth buying, renting, watching TV or seeing in any conceivable way. I lost interest so quickly that I am not sure why I got through the whole movie in the first place.
