I find it hard to find the words to explain how much I detest this movie. The historic attempt at Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and Duc de Praslin is a tragic and convincing story that, in my opinion, had the potential to be a great movie, but wrong. <br /> <br /> Although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself, it could in no way compromise the terrible structure of the movie, the poorly written script, and most of all the horrible obsessed characters. The worst of them was Duc's children, who were so over-top-corny and morally fake that it was almost painful to see. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie showed me no more than annoyed and deeply disappointed.
