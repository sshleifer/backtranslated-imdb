Produced by International Playhouse Pictures, it looks like filmed in a dollhouse. Everyone is a liar, everything is dreamlike, toy-wise without good reason. I'm not saying everything in all movies must be completely realistic, but such incredible fantasy things and situations in a movie are far too much. How did they get these fine actors -signs specifically for this movie? It's great to see Mia again; If we were to understand why her husband wants to kill her, Mia does well. Not fun, not moving, just fake. Stephen Dorff appears briefly at the end and fits a game perhaps, less for a movie, but it's not one that measures things. Terrible.
