This was a very nice concert by one and only MJ. The choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent. The voice was okay. I must admit that his vocals were crap on Human Nature and Billie Jean. You couldn't hear him half the time. The other songs are the song. The highlights of the show are: Jam Smooth Criminal I just can't stop loving you. She's out of my life. Thriller Billie Jean (The Dancing Not The Singing) Black or white man in the mirror The concert was almost perfect. If it was anybody but Mj, it would have been a 9. It's a must see. I wish I was born so I could have got a ticket for the best concert in 1992.
