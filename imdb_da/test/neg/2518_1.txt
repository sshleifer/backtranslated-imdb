I, like most other people, saw this movie after hearing it from Patton Oswalt. Oddly enough, it was easier to find than I thought it would be. Although it should not come as a surprise, I found it used. <br /> <br /> The plot is summed up masterfully within the title. It is a bed that eats. Nothing more, nothing less. There is an effort to throw a story line but not a very good one. A demon blood ended on a bed and as a result it becomes obsessed. It consumes everything that happens by absorbing and then dissolving it in what appears to be orange Fanta. There is an artist who fell victim to the bed, but was ill and ended up behind a painting in the room it occupies. The story is told throughout him. <br /> <br /> This movie fails terribly everywhere, even though it's bad. Yet it is not without its own charm.
