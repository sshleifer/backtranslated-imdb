The murder of the Red Comyn in Grayfriars Abbey was far from one of the most horrible things ever done in the Scottish Independence War, and fighting (and killing) in churches was not unusual at all. Not much later, Robert Bruce's wife, daughter, two of his sisters were captured during a battle in a church where people were killed. And compare it to the Berwick massacre, where the English slaughtered at least 8,000 non-combatants (some, indeed in churches) is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> It is said that this is not a well-functioning movie. It's a bit of an antidote to Robert Bruce's absolute RIDICULOUS slang representation in Braveheart. Whatever Bruce was, it was nothing. <br /> <br /> Too bad that they didn't do a better job of this because someone had to make a really good movie of a war so amazing that it sounds like something that someone made up of completely defeat in the Battle of Methven for a secret return from hiding to a long guerrilla war to Bannockburn. That is not the case. Poorly made and largely poorly written and acted. Too bad!
