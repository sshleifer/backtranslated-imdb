This is a bad attempt to spin the old "drawback" good yarn that we have seen so many times before. It actually reminded me of the American series 'The Players', although it was not as good as good. Omar Epps is totally convincing as the hard man of the pile, which is Ribisi, whose attempt to be the funny guy is lost along the way. Danes performance was decent, and you can see from this show why she was thrown into Terminator 4. <br /> MOD Squad is a movie set in some gray area between serious thriller and comedy. Sometimes it takes itself seriously, but other times it tries to be humorous, but doesn't fail. The film has a kind of half-finished feeling about - as if it was stretched to 90 minutes of mark. <br /> <br /> You'll be disappointed.
