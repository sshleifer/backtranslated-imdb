I was out of town and visited an old friend. After supper he spoke some reservations about his daughter's boys. She is 15, handsome, smart, athletic, and the young man is also from an excellent family, lovely, also athletic (if not so smart). I told him he could just feel the normal dangerous worries; But a few minutes later the young man arrived with his DVD of this flick, which he apparently had been eager for some time to share with the others. <br /> <br /> These people have a bona fide home theater setup with a screen over 4 feet, and the two young people preceded it while the young swain continued to immerse his virtues almost frame-by frame. <br /> <br /> In a few moments (and with some fascination in its horror) I probably saw all the most critical comments I've seen in scanning some here. <br /> <br /> I told my friend that I would not go as far as disqualifying the young lawyer solely on the basis of his taste of this opus - but it certainly seems to warrant that he is carrying it carefully. <br /> <br /> Some flicks are so bad-they are good: the classic "outer space 9"; and in my opinion, the wonderfully horrible Bruce Jenner / Village People, "Can not Stop the Music." <br /> <br /> But one simply stays in the horrible category. <br /> <Second / Third / Fourth "Bananas" - even the best of these (eg Tim Conway, Don Knotts, all with Seinfeld) have great difficulty in implementing a later starring series (or here, movie) . And these were great supporting characters in their original situations. The "Eddie" character, really at approx. 5th or 6th banana level in previous Griswald films, and never added a lot to them, in my opinion. Randy Quaid is a talented actor who has delivered some good performances. His contribution to the previous "Vacation" pic was on average at best. Both he and the other cast members, many of whom have done some good work in the past, have done nothing for their efforts here, except deriving a few years of house payments or some IRA contributions. <br /> <br /> This entire presentation --- story, performances (from lead to support) couldn't be worse.
