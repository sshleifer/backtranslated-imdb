JS Cardone instructed a little known 'Video Nasty' in 1982 called "The Slayer" and since then has gone on to get a hand in a handful of feature films; including the rubbish 2001 vampire movie The Forsaken. His latest feature film, Wicked Little Things, boasts a plot that sounds decent as well as a creepy looking poster, which I seem to remember building a few years ago compared to a movie that Tobe Hooper was supposed to lead. Now I assume he felt that this was too similar to his stupid zombie mushroom movie 'Mortuary' and then turned it down. I don't blame him for that either. The plot focuses on a mother and her two daughters who move to an old house in the mountains that once belonged to her late husband. But what they do not realize is about a hundred years earlier; a group of children used as miners were caught in a mineshaft. Of course, it's not the end of them, and they managed to survive their trials and now prowl the area of ​​seeking revenge? <br /> <br /> The film is essentially a collection of clichés; from the youngest child with an "imaginary friend", the mother who rejects it and all the usual baby waste. JS Cardone tries to get horror fans back on the side with shock and horror scenes (mostly involving kids), but that's not enough. The story also doesn't really look good and reminded me really too much of the former Mortuary, and that's not a good thing (though Mortuary is actually a better movie than this). The action is nothing to write home about either; Lori Heuring is decent-looking, oldest daughter Scout Taylor-Compton; but it does not succeed in providing an interesting performance either. Chloe Moretz is a little better than the usual child actor. The reason is almost unreliable and one cannot even plague the manuscript to explain the reasons why the children attack the locals. It all boils down to a typical and rather boring ending, and generally I have to say that if you know your horror movies, you may be welcome to skip this one!
