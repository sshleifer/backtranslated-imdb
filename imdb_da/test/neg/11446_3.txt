This movie really left me thinking ... but not about the plot, the direction, the characters, the underlying message or the smart script. Far from. I was entrusted with what went on in Sam Hill behind the scenes. It was clear that something was wrong from the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm surprised by the positive comments made on the movie and on Jodie Foster's performance. From the go it was clear that Foster had called this. An earlier comment even gave a positive mention of her facial expression. I must have seen another movie since Mrs Foster (usually a personal favorite) seemed to be completely uninterested. <br /> <br /> In one of his first scenes with Foster, Fred Ward looks as if he is also distracted by her lack of energy, and he struggles to deliver his own lines of enthusiasm. At the time he was invited to participate in a presumably desperate search for abandoned fetuses, Ward also seems embarrassed half-heartedly about the project. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Dennis Hopper has always been a uni-dimensional performer, so I don't expect much from him ... and he delivered. <br /> <br /> Yes, one left me thinking long after it ended. The fact that Joe Pesci and Charlie Sheen refused to get their names associated with the project suggests that this was a real stink for everyone involved. But then one learns that the director who prefers to hide behind a pseudonym speaks volumes. <br /> <br /> But why listen to me? I always think Foster looks ridiculous in a dress, but she is sensational in lacy underwear.
