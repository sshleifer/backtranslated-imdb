Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> But if you were not dropped on the head as a child and then used as a football, then you agree with me that this is one of the worst and yet hilarious series ever made. Centering around a woman who, like a young girl, was beaten by her father, who also killed her mother, she spends her time drawing, but wait for it, then she becomes superheroes and continues to fight crime and therefore becomes " drawn by pain "so clever. The story itself is actually ok, but that's just how it is done, Jesse, the author and the director have no idea how to write a script, just listen to a monologue with the 8-year-old hero's version and it sounds like it was written by a 30-year-old man, while her father, who grows a large mustache, just walks around the house all day while she looks angry, just shows how bad the characterization is, especially the bit where he gets sour in it first episode and beginning to repeat phrase "no more" while holding his wife's head before killing her using the marble surface. The following bang sound effect and just his terrible action as all he can convey is angry is just brilliant, including after where he goes to beat his daughter using his belt, which is all done with him, groans and looks angry in slow motion. The sections themselves could easily contain a good clean script in 5 minutes, but oh no Jesse doesn't want this. Little Jesse, throwing out for modernism, as if he had just eaten Donnie Darko and then arguing for death. Spotless cameras, all at odd angles, overly repetitive lines, and even pointless sequences, just get confused over and over to fill out the long-standing episodes. In summary, the idea is not bad, it's just how it's done, even there is a big character of a fat guy on a bench who doesn't come up enough and is great, I just want to hug his chubby cheeks because they look like this out soft. Character development is non-existent, as the protagonist only says the first philosophical sounding thing that comes to her head, even though they all contradict each other. But all in all, mostly Indiana Jones 4 is much better, Write "Jeeharv" in you-tube, so the results can make you cry on the world's beauty also you will hear many cheap sex jokes, mostly homosexuals.
