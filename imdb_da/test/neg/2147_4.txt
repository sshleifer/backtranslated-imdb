I don't know which one was released earlier in 1970. Cannon for Cordoba is a "Europen Western" It was made in Spain. This means that this is quite inferior to Sergio Leone's so-called #Western Spaghetti and to the real American masterpieces of John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hugues, John Sturges and Anthony Mann in my favor. This order should not be interpreted as all John Ford Westerns are better than all of Sam Peckipahn's. I think IMDb's 100 sort them out pretty well. <br /> <br /> The worse thing about this company is Casting. George Peppard is suitable for a sergeant's role, Raff Valone for a "Maffia Capo" and Giovanna Ralli for a "puttana" in "Piazza Vennezia" in the sixties of Rome.
