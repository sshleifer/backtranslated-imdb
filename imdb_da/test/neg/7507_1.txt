When you think you've seen the worst that the zombie subgenre can offer, another budding Romero and his team of no talent come to prove you wrong. <br /> <br /> I have a little Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, endured Death Valley: The Revenge of Bloody Bill, put semi-comatose through Zombie Diaries, and laughed hysterically under Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence, and really thought that amateur movie production couldn't sink any lower. However, I've just seen Zombie Planet, a two-hour festive pile from the author / director George Bonilla, I think I've found the ultimate in horrible zombie movies. In this terrible amateur effort, which is part Mad Max and Del Dawn of the Dead (but ALL bad), Frank Farhat stars like TK Kane, a fierce battle that kicks zombie ass for a hobby, armed only with knives, a machete, some concussion grenades and what he obviously perceives to be a truly transparent. After a desperately rude opening order, taking a horde of risky-looking zombies, Kane collaborates with a group of survivors who will not only avert attacks from the undead, but must also place a gang of evil evil who has taken control of the area ( by searching for and delivering valuables they find). <br /> <br /> Of course, Kane is not the kind of man to take orders from a bunch of z-class post-apocalyptic bullying boys, and he sits on teaching the evil boys a lesson (mostly on glowing on them a threatening way), only breaks to regularly save friends from zombies. With horrible action by almost everyone involved, a horrible script, ridiculous effects and shoddy production values, there is almost nothing in this movie to make it worth watching. To be fair, I like the basic premise that the zombies are the unexpected result of a very popular diet that blocks carbohydrates (we learn this when a character conveniently explains the back story to Kane, who hardly knows what is happened), but it is about the only vagically interesting aspect of the whole production. I have some respect for anyone who manages to fund and make their own movie, but when the results are this poor, the respect is lost when they decide to make it available to public viewing. I would have kept it under cover if I had made it.
