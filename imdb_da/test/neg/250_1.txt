Despite having a very beautiful leading lady (Rosita Arenas, one of my boys ripples), the play and the direction are examples of what NOT to do while making a movie. Located in southern Mexico, Popoca, Aztec Mummy (real Aztecs, by the way, have not made mummies) have been awakened by the protagonists and starting to make problems in Mexico City suburbia during the first movie (The Aztec Mummy). In this second part, the leading man and woman will find that mummy and put it in its final resting place (a fireplace would have been my first choice ...) <br /> <br /> The Bat, a criminal master -mindless stereotype of a criminal genius that creates a "human robot" (something idiot inside a robot SUIT) to control Popoca and (get this) take over the world. The final battle between the robot and the mummy is fun, some of the worst choreographies ever witnessed. The funniest part is that this film was made and released by a serious Mexican film studio! <br /> <br /> The play is just as horrible to hear the movie in Spanish as it is in English (they called it the over!). You have to watch this movie through MST: 3000. The comments are even more fun.
