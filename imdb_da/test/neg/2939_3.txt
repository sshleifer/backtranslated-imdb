I'm a little surprised that someone found this movie moving or moving. <br /> <br /> The basic premise of the movie sounded like an excellent if provocative idea of ​​a rare kind of movie, but one (if I can judge by the actual examples I have known) is extremely deep and loving. But the film is cheap scripted - bad scripted - and even though it has a number of very beautiful looking shots, I didn't find it special. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is probably that it is too short and badly composed to give the audience enough time to invest, emotionally, in the characters: we are not really interested in any of them and their stress and obstacles do not really affect us. <br /> <br /> I think a REMAKE - from the manuscript up - with some character development of some really good writers - could greatly improve it. It is instructive to compare this movie with Brokeback Mountain, as screenwriters took to much higher levels than the writer of the manuscript - screen printers who were clearly aware of how to write a classic tragedy and did their job with care, planning and excellent craftsmanship ! But people just seem to re-record the movies that don't need it! You really miss something if you skip this one: I found it very disappointing, and it's only saved from getting a 1-star from me because of the bold and gravity it took to make a movie on this sensitive subject .
