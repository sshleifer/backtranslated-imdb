I do not recall much about the factors others have objected to here - action, lighting and so on. Mostly, these things were done well enough to carry the movie and put its points across. It's just a horror movie. <br /> <br /> What bugged me was the points themselves. Because this is a deeply moralistic film, and its morality is deeply tacky. In fact, it is fundamentalist Christian morality, and it is a fundamentalist Christian film. Look at the 'sinners': <br /> <br /> * Sutherland's character is selected on a child in school when he was a spring man who led to his accidental death. <br /> <br /> * Baldwin's characters used masculine wiles, persuasion and good looks to shag few women, some of which he recorded. Ooh, pig! How unfortunate for him that women are so passive, gormless creatures that they had no involvement in the matter. <br /> <br /> * Roberts' character's father came back from Vietnam as a junkie, so ashamed to be caught shooting up that he kills himself. Yes, what a terrible sin! Why couldn't he just be an alcoholic like all the others? <br /> <br /> * and Bacon's character picked on another schoolkid. How terrible! The fact that he was a child himself does not count. Children seem to be divinely judged by adult criteria. <br /> <br /> Well, many people may support this level of moral absolutism. It seems to have gone outside in this movie's comments. Buy All Just These Things? At least human laws treat children differently than adults, recognizing that their ethical meaning is partially formed. This movie has no such nausea, and I find it quite strenuous. It is the idea that women are helpless, fluffed creatures before the young men's evil desires. Or that a Vietnam veterinarian driven for drug abuse is so shameful that suicide is a valid option. Pathetic.
