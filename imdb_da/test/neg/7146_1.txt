This movie confused me for the simple fact that it was made only because Shepherd was gay. The men who murdered him are clearly evil. What happened to the poor man was really awful and a tragedy. But where was Hollywood, when four religious white children were executed, having been forced to perform a host of sex acts on their killed and each other, by two wicked black men in Wichita just two years ago? The celebrities only fight for the camera when it serves a political purpose. Laramie is also portrayed in a bad light by this pseudo-documentary, which, of course, is hardly surprising because they are the rear hicks to be trained by omniscient and enlightened California. Still, it is always a good experience to see Laura Linney.
