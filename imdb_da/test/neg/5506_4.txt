I can't help believing this to be Franco's 'hamage' to the Marquis de Sade's "A Thousand Days of Sodom". People (in this case women) abducted to serve as slaves to a privileged elite? Check. Kinky sex? Check. Torture including whipping? Check. Victims are randomly chosen to be killed? Check. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much Franco didn't go to the horse and introduced the cinema audience to the delights of coprology (and indeed coprophagy), another perversion that repeats itself in Sade's boring long and vile story. <br /> <br /> I was hoping that this movie would fall into the 'so bad good' category. But even the acres of naked meat and many sexual encounters did not constitute the gloomy dialogue, horrible spectacle, elusive plot and - just to put the tin hat on it - dubbing AND English subtitles (a belt and braces approaching lack of women's costumes). Alsation, however, gave a very professional performance. <br /> <br /> Of course, I could be wrong about the Sade angle. After all, I didn't understand that the actor who played the leader of the prison was a transsexual. I need to pay more attention to the size of people's hands in the future. <br /> <br /> According to another reviewer, the film was banned in the UK. Well, this is clearly no longer the case, although I would like the nipple needle to be cut to satisfy the censors. On the DVD I watched, it was only clearly visible on the Spanish trailer (as if you were wondering, I saw comparing it to the English one). <br /> <br /> The DVD also includes an interview with jess franco, although you need better Spanish than mine to understand it. Unless I have much error, it is neither duplicate nor subtitled. And it points out that the person who sodomizes the character that Franco plays, is Ajita Wilson spoiled by using a mustache. Kind of ironic when he or she had got the necessary appendage removed surgically.
