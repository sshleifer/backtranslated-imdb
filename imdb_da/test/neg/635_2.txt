See Alien EXPRESS inspired feelings of awe, shock, pity and, indeed, pure terror. To think that actors who have previously done good work should come to something like this. Fear, horror. <br /> <br /> Tell me if any of this sounds familiar. <br /> <br /> A train specifically built for a political campaign is heading to Las Vegas for a big rally For the candidate, a Texas senator (Barry Corbin, the only actor with roles both Alien EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD BUT in the same decade. At a railway crossing in Utah, a meteor burns a car waiting for the train to pass. <br /> <br /> The train stops. Local law enforcement is convened. Oh, can it be? The Senator has a lovely young lady (Amy Locane from CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who has just married one of the officers who respond to the 911 call. Lou Diamond Phillips (STAND AND DELIVER, LA BAMBA) is a former man. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow on the train. <br /> <br /> The train leaves. Lou gets his buddy to control a helicopter so Lou can fall on the trains (about 70 miles per hour) so he can save the day. As his friend's reward, he rushes the helicopter into the mountain. <br /> <br /> Which is another example of how badly written ALIEN EXPRESS is. The politicians' sidekick must die, we all know. But he must die at the end of the third act, usually while saving more lives. <br /> <br /> On the trains, Lou manages to lose his shirt so he can channel Bruce Willis into DIE HARD by wearing a wife's t-shirt. Yes, Lou is 46 years old, but he hits the gym. The part he plays is not worth the trouble, but he is in good shape. The Senator will have an afternoon delight with Miss Utah, but foreigners confuse and both he and the woman are young enough to be his grandson paying the ultimate price. Soon we have bomb threats, multiplying aliens, and of course, the train goes out of control and speed toward its date with fate, while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT STROKES) try to save as many lives as they can. <br /> <br /> There is exactly one surprise throughout the movie. Early in history, a pair of wine glasses lift their thirty five year anniversary, hoping for another thirty-five years together. The guy gets smashed, but he and his wife both live. Maybe the authors just lost their tracks. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movie you'll love being a fly on the wall. These actors who have done better work (and really deserve much better than this) are probably just happy with the work. Do they actually think they are working on something that is worthwhile, or are they crying (and / or drinking) themselves sleeping at night? At the end of the story, they (quite a lot, all) gather together in the last car of the train, which is unheard of. The other cars cross a cliff, but the one containing the protagonists only stops inches short of the rock. Lou and his ex are reunited. Happiness governs. I would have thought the first thing they would do was get out of the train so they would have solid ground under their feet, but I went out. <br /> <br /> Someone looks out of the window and sees a shooting star. Look, make a wish. Then someone else. So more and more. The earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly puppets with big teeth will be everywhere. It has got a point to see the words "The Sci-Fi Channel Presents" on an "original" film telling us we will be happy that we have Ti-Vo so we can speed up the next two hours. Or better yet, just go ahead and delete it two minutes into the story and use that time more wisely.
