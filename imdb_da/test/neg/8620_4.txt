In Thailand, Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) quarrel in a Muay-Thai fight, and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the hotel's direction for a stranger, in fact the average vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by her gang of evil vampires in motorcycles. Connor joins a clan of "good" vampires led by Sang (Stephanie Chao), trying to save Amanda from Niran's claws. I expected "Vampires: The Turning" was a good movie. The location and cinematography are beautiful; the very heavy music score is excellent; Stephanie Chao is beautiful and attractive; but unfortunately the manuscript and the director are terrible, and the very loose costume of Meredith Monroe does not help her fallen breasts. The story is very short, and the unknown Marty Weiss uses long scenes of motorcycle combat, fighting and boring flashbacks to complete a minimum movie time. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vampiros: A Convers√£o" ("Vampires: Conversion")
