My daughter liked it, but I was appalled that a sign in this movie smokes. As if it's not terrible enough to see "product placement" actors like Bruce Willis smoking in their movie - at least, kids movies should be more considerate! I wonder: was it intentional? Did the big tobacco "sponsor" the movie? What does it take to ban smoking from movies? At least film for children and adolescents.
