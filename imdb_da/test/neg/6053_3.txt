I hadn't heard anything about this project until I saw that it was going on, so I saw it with a completely open mind. And, zest is full of strong players. <br /> <br /> Sorry. . . It is terrible. I don't think it's not good; I think it's extraordinarily bad - sometimes ridiculously so, but most of it is just boring. Its strongest appeal comes from having attractive people as naked as the American networking television will allow, but it's all right and no matter, and having nymphs as back-up people can't justify hours of bad TV. <br /> <br /> There are two basic issues that the cast cannot overcome. First, the script is * terrible *. Yes, it is traditional to make changes to the Hercules myth (which is not at all a single monolithic story), but this version is relentlessly dull and too often stupid (and sometimes quite shaky peculiar) with horrible pacing, bits borrowed from it and there (and several parts seem to be in different movies) and really terrible dialogue. The dialogue is often unbearably bad, actually to the point where you feel embarrassed by the actors. Sean Astin, apparently now typecast as the second banana, seems particularly burdened by a horrible line after another. There is no consistency of tone or atmosphere and little coherence to the plot. Second, most of the special effects are really bad. Really bad. There is occasionally a little bit of CGI, but for the most part you feel embarrassed on behalf of the cast. I have no idea what the budget for this project was, but it certainly looks like crap compared to "Clash of the Titans" or even "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" and does not even compare very much to the old Lou Ferrigno and Italian " spaghetti 'Hercules film. Just painfully miserable. There are many other problems - the story is unnecessarily complex and cannot stop itself, and Hercules itself is not presented as a very interesting character. Almost everyone who does not have a European accent is trying to fake one of a kind that is not only amateurish and dated, but never really sensible at first: drama doesn't get better just because the actors use British accents after all. But the terrible script and equally horrific effects lower the whole thing just outside bats. <br /> <br /> In fairness, "Hercules" was apparently calculated as four-hour miniseries, but shortened (for this aeration, anyway) to a three-hour television movie. I don't know what they are cutting, but it is possible that the edits made it worse. I don't think you can make "Hercules" good at adding to it, but that doesn't mean continuity says it's not been hit by the network editor. There is no way I look at the US version to see.
