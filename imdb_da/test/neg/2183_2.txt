"Go Fish" got Rose Troche right or mistaken for a film company's reputation with great promise. It was so hard to understand how she could show herself a movie of stereotypes that you associate with inferior sitcoms. The whole movie rings hollow. I cringed all the way through. It should be a look at ninety-one sexuality. Not much more here to be taught than from "In and Out". Now, most of us actually know that there are men who are sexually attracted to women and men who are sexually attracted to men, and there are even men who are sexually attracted to both sexes. <br /> <br /> Rarely, this revelation has been portrayed on the screen with so little humor and style. <br /> <br /> Pathetic.
