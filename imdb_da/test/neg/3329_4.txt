Some movies are just ?? unfortunate. It is about the films, which of course thrived with a lot of good will and a handful of potentially good ideas, but simply did not have the budget funds and / or professional cast and crew members available to make it happen. "Strangeness" clearly belongs to this category. You really want to like it, but even the most tolerant and incredible 80's horror fanatics have to admit that the movie hardly reaches the level of mediocrity because of its atmosphere of fairness, clumsy stop-motion effects and tireless dark cinematography. "The Strangeness" has a pretty original plot and setting (okay, it looks like "The Boogens", but on the contrary, I doubt that director David Michael Hillman deliberately slipped an insignificant 80's B movie) and the players provide enthusiastic performances Although they are all wrong. A collection of amateur peleologists goes on an expedition to explore the infamous Gold Spike mine. Many years ago, several miners died mysteriously there, and the place has left since then, but there should be too much gold stored there to remain closed forever. Shortly after they fell into the mine, the group members met one by one the slimy ruler of the Gold Spike mine; a Lovecraftian monster with tentacles and an incredibly cheesy way to move on. During most of its running time, "The Strangeness" is a dull and incompetent mess that is difficult to follow due to the complete lack of lighting. The characters are uninteresting, and the mine remains a mystery because the only light effects come from the speleologists' helmets. There is very little action or horror to experience in the first hour, but Director Hillman takes the viewers' attention wisely by showing bits and pieces of the monster on a regular basis. As soon as you get the first glimpse of the monster's tentacle, you're doomed to watch the end. The creature is realized with stop-motion effects that I usually worship and worship, but here in this case they look extremely weak and pitiable. The person responsible for the special effects should have been more aware of Ray Harryhouse's work. The death sequences occur virtually outside the screen, and there is very little tension throughout the film. A horror-flick with a setting like this should benefit from claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects, but "The Strangeness" lacks all this. The biggest trumpet of the movie is undoubtedly the beautiful appearance of the blonde actress Terri Berland. She looks like a speleologist as much as I look like Mother Theresa, but she looks good in her tight white top and beige pants.
