This movie is the worst thing I've ever seen. You may think you've seen some bad movies in your time, but if you haven't seen this, you don't know how horrible a movie can be. But wait there is worse news! The studio will soon relay this masterpiece (I'm ironic) for everyone to see! The only things that are worse than the plot in this movie are the effects, the play, the direction and the production. Bill Rebane, the poor man Ed Wood (not that there is a real man Ed Wood) (I like Ed Wood's movie though) manages to keep things at a snail's pace throughout this movie. It opens with the capture of a baby bigfoot (a Littlefoot? - Sorry, couldn't help it) by a couple of unlikely hunters killed by the parents. This causes the whole city where the hunters lived on a Bigfoot hunting jihad. This is pretty much the plot. Nothing even externally interesting happens, and we viewers are never able to care about any of the characters. If you are interested in Rebane's movie, I would recommend almost everyone else about this. But as I said, it will soon be re-released by Troma to drill a new generation of movie gamers.
