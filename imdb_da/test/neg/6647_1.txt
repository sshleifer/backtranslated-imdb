This movie was a complete disaster for me. There is one thing that movies should have to be seen, and it's * some * psychological credibility of characters ... unfortunately that's not the case here. The main characters behave most annoyingly most, and although they have some reason for such behavior, it is not revealed to us by the director. Sophie Marceau's character is particularly annoying and makes pictures of everything in the whole movie when one can expect something more rational (for example, meeting with her mother in the hospital) ... and why did she marry this guy? (No, it's not a spoiler) The plot sometimes seems to have ripped off some soap operas, and while the performances of the actors are not bad, it doesn't help much. All in all, I just couldn't find a way to connect with this movie. Not that I tried too much after the first hour, though. I have never left the cinema during a movie, but this time was the closest in my life so far.
