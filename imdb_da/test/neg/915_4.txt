It is difficult to assess an author / instructor first effort. After all, it's a movie more than I've written or directed. James Hunter wrote a story that was interesting but suffered from an uneven flow. <br /> After all, the idea that a man (Ja Rule) has to choose between thug life and just go, is commonplace and even falls in love with the daughter (Tatyana Ali) of it man you killed has been done. Doing this again requires something that is original and the original is missing in this movie. I was drawn by the inclusion of so many favorites: Tia Carrere (Trues Lies, Wayne's World), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, Good Night and Good Luck) and Ving Rhames (Rosewood, Dawn of the Dead ). They did not disappoint in their performances, but they had little to do with. <br /> <br /> Directly to video is becoming more and more common, but that doesn't mean it's a waste of time. Perhaps Hunters sophomore efforts will be more comfortable.
