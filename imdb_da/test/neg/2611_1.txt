This movie may have been the first puppet master, but it certainly bored me to death when I saw this stupid movie I wanted a refund. This was a bad series for the puppeteer and I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this was terrible. For some, it was good, but for others it was a ticket for snores and boys, they are right. The dolls didn't even do anything, nor did they kill people. It should not be seen by people, so I warn you not to see it. You will be disappointed even for the fans who love the puppet master, it was a waste of their time and it didn't make that much money. No one has even killed, but one or two, very meaningless. <br /> <br /> 1/10
