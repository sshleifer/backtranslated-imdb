I love the first and third Beastmasters, but this was an abomination. It was almost as terrible as 'The Never Ending Story 3' for the same reasons. They took a fascinating fantasy world of barbaric tribes, farm towns, witches, supernatural creatures and a cult of religious fanatics using a pyramid; and thought it would be fun to blend into our materialistic pop culture world of rock & roll, sushi (I think that was what it was) and flashy sports cars. These two worlds do not belong together. I don't want to see a bunch of ancient barbaric people dancing to a rock song on the car radio. I have a sense of humor, but it's just stupid. This makes Hollywood great fantasy movies when they run out of ideas. Don't give up, the eye of Braxus is much, much better. The one I gave a 10. This one, the Portal of Time, I give a 1. Believe me, I don't always give such extremely high or low ratings. I tend to comment only on such films.
