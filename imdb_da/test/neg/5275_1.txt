I'm a big fan of Kevin Spacey's work, but this is an under-standard movie. If you think it looks interesting or if you saw it and liked it, check out John Boorman's "The General". It is basically about the same guy, but is far better in every way (and does not suffer from the Hollywood glorifications).
