Call me old-fashioned, but I like movies with plots. I thought "stoner comedy" was only a way to more specifically describe a comedy on how many weeds are smoked and the people who see it are more likely to enjoy it aloud. However, "Grandmother's Boy" has decided that this is a full blown niche and that stoners represent a piece of the comedy girl to be reached. Apparently, Allen Covert (star and producer) and the Happy Madison band were right, but it doesn't make the "grandmother's boy" any less boring and unfunny. They can be completely stony - but the signs are mostly half-baked. <br /> <br /> Alex (Covert, a long-time player for Adam Sandler, first gangster) is a mid-30s professional video game tester whose roommate has been exposed to them. He could look for a new apartment, but then we didn't have a movie. After trying a few friends, he ends up living with good ole grandmother Lilly (Doris Roberts from "Everybody Loves Raymond"). She wakes him up at noon. 6 and has his job and soon he falls asleep at work, and the new video game sequel may not be completed on the deadline. <br /> <br /> Like most people, Alex acts with his frustration and eradicates boredom by either playing video games or becoming tall or both. His friends / colleagues all do the same. Most of them are virgins who live at home in addition to loving video games. They are all awkward, and everyone with the exception of Nick Swardson and Joel Moore (only at times) are their characters not fun. It's fun if you're flaming ... surely, I suppose, but I can't say of experience. Perhaps everything we lose is becoming tall, becoming tall, playing video games and awkward messing with specific attention to their breasts, yet it should not be the driving force of a whole movie. Likewise, old women should get high on accident (so it comes) or be that of coarse sex jokes - but that happens when a movie is not about anything. No conflict arises before the last 20 minutes out of the little trouble of being out of the pot, Alex is trying to get the hot girl (Linda Cardellini) to like him and the boys scrambling to finish their levels for the video game deadline. <Br /> <br /> Signs can be the saving grace of these wobbly stoner flicks, but apart from a gracious Doris Roberts, the aforementioned Swardson as the virgin friend living with his parents, calling them his roommates and Joel Moore's skills to make robot sounds that are little character ingenuity. Covert is a huge protagonist with no comical dimensions, his dealer friend Dante is an unlucky actor and a waste of screen time, and Jonah Hill and Kevin Nealon are written so far in the periphery, it doesn't matter. <br /> <br /> If you like movies about nothing and see them in a state of mind and body that doesn't improve it, "Grandma's Boy" will probably be what you're looking for. Those who need a little more talent and willingness to board a comedy will not be unaffected. The most I can say to "Grandma's Boy" is that it can be seen despite its meaninglessness. It will not feel like a total waste of time, but you will want you to do drugs so you could at least get the most out of it and half an hour. <br /> <br /> ~ Steven C <br /> Visit my site at www.moviemusereviews.com
