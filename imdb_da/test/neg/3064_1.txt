Like Michigander, I got Michigan jokes. Very fun - make fun of Pontiac, Ann Arbor, all the lame suburbs of Detroit. Yes, yes, I've heard these jokes a million times. I give them credit for accurately depicting Grosse Points lameness. It couldn't be more white. Did you hear the lovely Michigan nasal accents? Where the girls talk so fast, can't you understand a word coming out of their mouth (nose) ...? As much as I love Michigan, I hated this movie. <br /> <br /> I never met a person from Grosse Pointe I liked. Listen to the horrible live band and the annoying and horrible background music! What is it? One of your Gross Pointe homeboy's bands? Probably. Wow, what great "Detroit scene" you have in there. Funny how Grosse Pointe's people always say they are from Detroit. They are so white and rich they want them to complain. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is blowing. All the way from the lame jokes about girls in sweaters to the horrible character development. Oh wait a moment, you think the whole basis of a sign is that he says the f word a lot? What a deep personality. Great job, Grosse Pointers! And I love all the sexist lingo, like how the narrator calls the first girl to be killed, which we never even hear, speak a "naive b * tch". It's really nice. <br /> <br /> And the homemade masks with Marilyn Manson contact lenses are really good. And I love how it made perfect sense why the cyclists came and killed people. And how their narrative master had such an obvious role in the movie ... ?? The head girlfriend was so boring, I fell asleep and looked at him. The three idiot guys (or were it two or four? How can I tell, they all look and work the same!) Tried so desperately to make me laugh, but Beavis and Butthead already came out of my ass humor that laughing back in 1994. And what about gay jokes? No wonder this movie is sucked - everyone involved has some minor problems with their masculinity, eh boys? <br /> <br /> The only saved grace for this movie was the maid. Despite what the other people have said, she was actually a good actress. Teenage girls talking as she spoke. They really act the way she acted. Her plays were very natural and credible. I really thought she was a Grosse Pointe convenience store employee. .. maybe she is! And yes, she had big breasts, most women do here. Michigan is the poorest state in the association, you know. In all aspects. <br /> <br /> So those of you who think this is a representation of Detroit are not. It's the suburbs of Detroit. They are very white and full of speechless anxiety. Limp Bizkut, ICP (yes, ICP is from one of our suburbs) and $ 75 baggy khaki pants all the way! Lame rich kids who are crazy because they have lots of money and nothing to complain about. And they also do bad movies. <br /> <br />
