This flick, which is a "Life In the Fast Lane", is easy to be one of the least entertaining movies I've seen for a long time. I think it had been taken into account by the sick, twisted and combed L.A. women, representing about 100000001 of the population of the states. The characters are all one-dimensional, even the lead. After she has stacked her boyfriend in the head with some scissors, a cheap laugh (and unsucceeds) is attempted by sticking a cork to the cock's skull to stop the bleeding. Oh, clever! Patrick Dempsey (whose film is almost always a classroom - sarcasm) plays this "devil" who changes his life - but from what we have seen, her life was the first of those series of vignettes. No emotions, no laughs, no history. The only reason I give this a 2 is that Jeffrey Jones is ok as the pastor and there is a bit of style (albiet zero fabric) in the camera. Otherwise, one of the 5 worst movies I've seen. Grade 2 out of 10 AN F! I think even the most driven junkie who would laugh at a toilet seat would fall, didn't like this movie. I can't stress enough how much you need to stay away. <br /> <br />
