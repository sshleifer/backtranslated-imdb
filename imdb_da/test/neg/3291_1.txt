You've seen the same tired, worn clich√©d sit-com stories, characters, thousands of times before? Only this is distinguished by sucking more than others. First of all, there is not a single character in this show that is even extremely like-minded ... especially Michael Rapaport's. Dave Gold is by far one of the greatest donkeys ever to reach a TV screen ever ... contradictory in mind. If in fact a father was this unlikely, cruel and just generally unfit for parents ... fratricide would be your only option. Calling the remaining character stereotypes would be too complementary. If these signs ended with life support, the line to pull the plug would be light years. How this show ended a complete season, much less 2 is a mystery. FOX cancels "Arrested Development" and keeps it on the air ??? You tell me that the terrorists are not winning.
