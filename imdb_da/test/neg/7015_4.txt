In 1967, I saw an outstanding musical at Wintergarden in New York City, where Angela Lansbury eased the scene as Mame. But gave Hollywood her head ???? No Lucille Ball great as Lucy got the role. She killed the movie. What a mistake There was no chemistry when there was on stage Bea Arthur and Angela what a twosome when they sang. It's too bad that a manufacturer doesn't put these two together even today
