Wow, Jeez, I don't even know where to start commenting on this thing, they called a movie. I don't really know what hell David Bradley started smoking after making Hard Justice, which, in my opinion, was a great movie after the American ninja features. I hadn't seen any of this guy's last movie after Cyborg Cop. Lucky I saw them on Amazon for like 5 pounds each and I can say the following: if I had dropped into the drain the 5 pounds I spent on total reality, crisis and expect to die I would have ended happiness than having to sit through those 90 minutes each lasted. My God how HECK can anyone notice these as "movies" ??? And why do action / martial arts players fall knee-deep into the most odorous horse mower when they want to reach their peak? I mean, David Bradley is no Oscar deserver, but his first movie was pretty entertaining. Tough, cool guy with pretty good martial expertise who provided corny lines, but at least entertained action and martial arts fans to some extent. But I would very much like to know what went through this guy's head after making Hard Justice. His last 3 movies must honestly be the WORST I have ever had to sit through. As I mentioned before, I would love to get my money back on the 3 DVDs I bought. The crisis was the epitome of sleepiness, Total reality was tough, but this Expect to die is just complete nonsense. I bet the director was either mega-stoned when he did this, or he just took a pee out of every David Bradley fan who would sit through this pile of crap. The plot circles around a doctor (Bradley) who develops a kind of Virtual Reality game where he just kills different people one by one. Sorry, but I just couldn't take this guy seriously playing a baddie with the skillful hair-making, glasses and gray slacks and doing absolutely no physical fights at all (honestly, his best asset). The movie is even worse than any of these Saturday afternoon B movies because the actor is ridiculous, the manager is horrible, and they get to fight in the movie, well, what can I say ... The actors seem to be training with their gym mate. We get a stupid muscular policeman who starts showing off his fighting as an hour in the movie and fails strongly ... a French hairy version of Van Damme who just can't fight, act or speak to save his freaking life and Bradley Den supposed protagonist who played the evil doctor, whom I was really happy about when he stopped making this type of used waste. I even think he didn't throw a kick in this movie, probably because of his heart disease that is already playing on him. For a B-actor, I must admit that I really liked this guy, his style, physics, fighting skills ... But I'm really glad he stopped acting after this monstrosity because I honestly wouldn't have been in able to sit through another fifty minutes of pee-taking material like this. Avoid at all costs, even if you are a family of David Bradley, you'll be glad you did, words.
