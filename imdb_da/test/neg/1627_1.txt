Cave Dwellers, or The Blade Mater, or whatever it is, is in a word: VILE! I saw this on the MST, and I laughed not only at the big ongoing comment, but at the monstrous film production that was proven. Sunglasses, deck tracks and where did Ator get an enema? Then they lift a couple of shots from another movie, where Eagles Dare as Tom Servo points out. To show how cheap this movie really is, see the scene where Ator and Thong have to fight with invisible swords. Or better yet, look for the giant snake dressed up as a snake, Ator must fight! And what do the scenes in the credits have to do with the movie?
