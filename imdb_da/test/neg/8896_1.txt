Hi, I know Angel isn't the kind of show that gives people a happy ending, and I know they couldn't just make everything perfect, but I couldn't believe Angel ended. I absolutely love the show, it's possibly the best show ever. But I really hated this end, as well as all the other half of Angel's season 5 went on (similar to Buffy season 7). My favorite people's deaths were basically meaningless and did nothing for the plot. Cordelia was one of the best characters on the show, and when she and Angel finally came together, she turned everything into a demon. I wanted so much to get her back, don't confuse me that the episode where Cordelia comes back is great, but I was still really angry that she was gone. Then was there on earth with Fred dying just after she finally came with Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was meaningless, it didn't matter to the plot, and the blue-haired demon girl is a horrible, useless character. They used too much of the end centered around her. Another major problem is that they do not connect the elements well enough. I know they dudes in that the black tower wanted to create the apocalypse, but there wasn't even a date set for it to happen. The Apocalypse should have been done and discovered throughout the season, instead of just mentioning there are some evil dudes an hour before the season ends. One of the biggest problems is any character that the audience cares about, is either dead or has nothing to live for. My three favorite people died, and Angel, Spike and Gunn (who I am not sure of surviving) have no office, are not even back to their helping helpless, are in the midst of a big blow and have lost all they care about . Angel and Spike are never redeemed, they lose the girl they care about, and almost everyone has died, and they still have to fight against this weird evil army. I get it all, you never stop fighting, but it was silly to finish it right in the middle. Could not have been a redemption, knowing that there would always be many more matches to come. I don't understand why this episode is so highly rated because I think the Buffy ending was 10 times better and I wasn't even a big fan of one. Why should they slip at the end, seasons 3 and 4 and the 1st half of five were so amazing then they went and messed up the show.
