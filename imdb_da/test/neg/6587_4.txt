I borrowed this on DVD from a friend the other day. I didn't really know what to expect. I haven't seen many Russian films, and I don't think I've ever seen a Russian war film. Maybe it made me expect something else, something more along the line in a imagined Russian mentality. But no matter what the expectations were, they became ashamed, as it is a fairly common war movie. <br /> <br /> The whole formula of following a couple of youths from their recruitment through training, implementation, and through some struggles is well known. We've seen it done many years ago, as well as recently (as with Jarhead). Sure there is a difference here because the film is about Russian soldiers instead of Americans, as is almost always the case. But in general, it could just as easily be a Vietnam movie. I guess I just emphasize my feeling that Afghanistan was the Soviet trade unions Vietnam. A country that should have been a pushover for a superpower made the war drag for years with terrible loss of life for both soldiers and civilians. The good points in this movie felt I was good photography are some beautiful mood images) and decent effects for what I think must have been a pretty low budget film. What made me disappointed is mostly the story itself. It just doesn't manage to touch any emotions in me. Mostly because character development is miserable. And to really feel something when people are shot down, make them people, not just faceless cardboard cuts. They fail to do so in this movie. It's also too long, and it seems to be a kind of trend lately. In my opinion, a movie that is more than two hours long should have a lot to offer, and this movie does not cut it. There is also a disturbing music set like a wet rug over each scene. Especially in the action scenes, this is very disruptive, not that you need action music, but something more than just slow keyboard music would be nice. Otherwise, the production values ​​were good enough, it was not where the problem was. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to watch this movie. As a reminder that wherever you are, war sucks? The Russian filmmakers have already seen too many American war movies to make something original? Whichever, this movie is pretty clichéd, lacking in spirit, and while it has acceptable technical qualities, it lacks in script and character development. In the end, it just becomes another one of all the war movies that doesn't make you think, and don't add anything to the genre. I've seen much worse, but also much better. I rate this 4/10.
