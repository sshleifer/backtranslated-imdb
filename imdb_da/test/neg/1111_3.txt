The concept of this movie is pretty convincing: zombie kids climb out of an abandoned mine to seek revenge for their deaths in backwoods in Pennsylvania. Cool. The problem I had with the movie is the lack of creativity when dealing with the zombies. The actors could really have spiced this movie up with some terror-like image to leave "The Ring" as stop action, reverse camera walking or things like that. As the zombie kids go through the woods, they look like a bunch of 9-year-olds going to a playground in West Philadelphia. Instead of choosing axes and shovels, they could easily have worn baseball bats and gloves. Why would I fear these little children? Anyone could just run away in a straight line for safety. Also who in their right mind would have stayed one night with their children in the creepy, run-down house? The moment I opened the front door and looked around, I would have said, "Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Son, get started with the car. I walk around to pee on a bush and then we're out of here. " Absolutely incredible movie. Do not waste your time.
