This movie is about a man who likes to blow himself up on gas containers. <br /> <br /> He also loves his mommy. So, to keep the money in, he takes his action to Broadway. See! CODY POWERS JARRET BLUE STAYED ON HIS GREATEST GAS CONTAINERS NOW! TONIGHT! 7:30! <br /> <br /> But one day his mother dies, and Jarrett goes crazy. He kidnaps the audience in the theater and makes them all on top of a huge gas cylinder. <br /> <br /> Leaving the control further, he gets them screaming "MAKE IT MA, TOP OF THE CYLINDER!" in harmony. Noise is so deafening that it breaks Jarret's eardrum, causing him to topple from the cylinder into a vessel of acid. <br /> <br /> This Warner Bros. movie is not all it has been blown to be.
