I gave this movie a 2, mostly because it actually has an ok cast, but the movie itself is just like (insert unusually rude word beginning with the sixth letter of the alphabet) - meaningless that I felt bad when I voted for the lowest vote was a three. Very predictable plot .... Two nasty-well-well musicians have no money and lots of money problems. But when a friend leaves a bag full of money (belonging to drug dealers) in their care, they of course use it and then the "fun" begins. <br /> <br /> Not an original idea throughout this movie.
