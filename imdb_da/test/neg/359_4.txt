The man with the golden arm (film) is a decent career car for Frank Sinatra, but fails abysmally as a good fit for a great book. You always hear how books are "changed" when they are made in movies - things are cut out, dumbed down, etc. Well, you can't even say they "changed" something with the movie - they just told a hero different story. The signs and the setting are the same safe, not the ambiguous characterization, the depth of the Polish Chicagoers men and women in the book. As for the setting, it has become just a game stage, complete with the unnecessary "supporting role" players who go way too busilly down the claustrophobic, inner exterior streets. The movie is a dumbed-down, quite different from Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When this happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow loses all their psychological edge. Frankie's drumming, a modest dream in the book, becomes his full passion in the movie (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug abuse is treated as shlock, exploitavely. The action is decent, especially the sneaky Louie, who is more threatening in the movie than the book. But it's just a shame that this kind of movie can be heralded as a classic along with the book it's "based on", the real story of Frankie Machine. The movie just goes to show Hollywood can 'get something right without stupid it down and add a happy ending. In this case, they just changed it completely, cheaply an important and realistic story in Hollywood fluff. I'm sure as hell biased because I read the book first, so I can't really treat the movie honestly by knowing how good the book is. I was actually thinking of turning off the movie (and I never do that), just so I wouldn't get its stupid plot confused with the beauty of the book. But this is an overestimated movie, and while it's not that bad, the book must come first, as it was the first. And it should have been the only story about Division Street and Frankie Machine.
