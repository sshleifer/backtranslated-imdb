Milla stands out in this movie because of her personal sense of style and the way the clothes hang on her. I've learned to hate the curly little three-year-old face she does when she pretends to cry. It quickly makes a few things she tries to do as a serious actress. Of course she shines in a movie with a BALDWIN and Denise of course as a mature actor. David seemed to make Woody Allen using Howdy Doody. Not a single word or gesture throughout the movie seemed sincere or even sincere. "How Harry Met Sally" and "Two Weddings and Funeral", even "Sleepless In Seattle" had scripts, locations and ACTORS. The script seemed to be a string of bad and raw gags separated by a lot of talking. The location seemed to be within a few blocks of each other. There are only two players in this dishrag of an indie flick, Milla and the lady who played chicken, who were in the stars. I saw most of it all through the first time with the sound off, just to see Milla. This subscription gag was old the first time I saw it, and it's a silly rip off of a song in "How to succeed in business without really trying".
