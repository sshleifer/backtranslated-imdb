Junior and his father start a new life in a new city. It's the same life because Junior hasn't changed a bit. He is still the same rat abruptly as before, he has grown bigger. This time, he has a pal called Trixie, and she is a little worse. Junior does not like his father, dating and challenging any occasion he has. Then Grandfather enters and the dog comes together. I thought the two would have made it a good movie, but they didn't even make friends at the end. This is a movie for the most immature people. It has diapers, farts, doggy making and toilet humor in it. Only a person under the age of 12 would find this to be super fun. I hope that when I have a son, he is like Junior.
