If I were to consider this movie exclusively based on acting / script / production, etc., I would give it a star. All these items are terrible. I can partially forgive this in light of the film's $ 250 budget. The movie features many entertaining scenes, mostly the unintentional fun variations. Some of these include: A 14-year-old child who steals and runs a bus, teenage hooligans (one of whom is sporting a Joy Division t-shirt) gets scared from harassing the movie's protagonists by a woman who is burning an obviously fake firearms and a meeting with a plastic bull in the Arizona desert. I would have given it 5 stars only for the entertainment value if it was not the presence of the terribly annoying moral pontifying old grandmother. However, I had to have a star just because of her. Who * bleep * does a wedding cake with black frosting, anyway?
