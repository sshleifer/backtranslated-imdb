The series does not start as it means to continue. Although the first two seasons are packed with incredibly average episodes, as well as many duds, the pace goes up and one of the finest space operations is born. The first ever episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation is remarkable for two things: it's very fun introductions to all the main casts and Marina Sirtis' peculiar accent that would later disappear. Seeing how it all started is very satisfying, and in mind of the rest of the series, rather than actually moving. Otherwise, it's a very mediocre episode with Q and some giant jellyfish. It is true.
