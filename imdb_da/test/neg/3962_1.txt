If you're like me and watched the original "Benji" phenomenon from afar and finally watch the movie for the first time 30+ years later, you may be shocked to discover how truly horrible it is and more mystified than ever about its popularity back in 1974. My assessment is not entirely objective, as I tend to have a favorable pretension towards children's films and therefore cut them considerably lax. On the other hand, I have always hated this particular dog, a feature on the last few seasons of "Petticoat Junction". Never a good show, the dogless early episodes were at least a good showcase of beautiful actresses and the introduction of the dog cut into their screen time. Benji is an 86-minute megadosis of the dog following him on several daily cycles through the town of McKinney, Texas. If it sounds boring, you will be asked to give "Benji" a wide birth and never let your remote fall into the hands of a "Benji" fan (if there is still someone out there). <br /> <br /> Unlike "My Dog Skip", "Monkey Business" or "Because of Winn-Dixie", the human actors in the cast are extremely weak. "Big Valley's" Peter Breck plays the standard strict father and just seems to be embarrassed by the idea of ​​appearing in something that is this lama. <br /> <br /> If one of your children (of any age) seems to find "Benji" entertaining, consider cutting back on their medication. <br /> <br /> So again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
