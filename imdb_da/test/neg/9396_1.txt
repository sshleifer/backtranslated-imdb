This film was supposedly based on a non-fiction book. I'm not sure which book the writer reads to write their adaptation, but it has absolutely nothing to do with Frances Maye's true life experiences in Italy. Instead, it is an uninteresting tale that takes liberties at any time to bash men. Note the following examples: <br /> <br /> ************************************ ** **************************** <br /> <br /> SPOILING DETAILS <br /> <br /> * *** *********************************************** *** ************** Bash Number One: Lane's husband cheats on her and her marriage ends in divorce. <br /> <br /> Bash number two: Lane ventures into a local Italian city and is immediately called by every man on the street. Bash number three: Lane is tucked away from the horny people of a charming gentlemen. She falls for him after completing an afternoon of love. She later finds that he is already attached and cheated with her. <br /> <br /> Bash number four: You must expand your horizons for this because the reference is definitely in the movie. Her lesbian couple friends decide to have a baby by invetro (SP?) Fertilization. I am told that in most lesbian relationships you have a person who assumes the female role and another who is based on the male role. In the movie, after the woman has become pregnant, the "male" lesbians decide to run out of the relationship because she can't handle it. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie has nothing to do with book that it allegedly was based on.
