Abysmal mass adventure exploitation in the jungle woman genre. Lousy sound obscures the silly dialogue. And it's terribly talked about a movie about people who don't speak English. There is no adventure here; It is a jungle adventure with cliff hangers and a wild animal attack that happens in flashback. <br /> <br /> Three pale facials roam the African desert and face fighting human-seeking tribes of Amazons. These wild women have only evolved out of the Stone Age in terms of inventing makeup, shoe and underarm hair removal technology. Despite their desperation for "house-bahnd" the ladies insist that they will fight for the men and burn the weaker ones. <br /> <br /> The only thing that is interesting, as if there was a question, is the assortment of young women dressed in animal skin wisely designed as swimwear from 1951. Lots of wrestling and bad dancing mixed with stripless 1950s stripper moves . No nudity or noticeable violence. On the other hand, you can be humming the catchy native song for days.
