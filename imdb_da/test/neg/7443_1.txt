Violent successor to RoboCop was directed by Irvin Kershner (Never ever say again, Empire Strikes Back) will never be as good as the original because it is almost humorous, and it is extremely mean and should have been rated NC-17, Due to Of scenes with infants involved in weapons skills, people threaten to brutally murder very young infants with REAL automatic weapons and even scenes with a 12-year-old using lots of explicit profanity, giving drugs lots of random people, shooting and graphic shoot up and kill police officers and SWAT officers, open fire on police officers when there are many small and small children present, and a whole group of children using strong shame and beating shop owner (who is a very old man) of an electronics store and steals and destroys many things there. This movie gives new meaning to the phrase "terribly meaning", but the effects and action sequences are exceptionally incredible. Overall an OK movie.
