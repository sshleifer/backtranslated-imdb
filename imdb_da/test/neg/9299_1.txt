I went to this movie full of hope. With so many talented and humorous actors on the head of Sir Ben, I thought it was a little treat. Oh how I felt like throwing my eyes out as the credits rolled. That I had wasted 93 minutes of my life, this movie was clearly DOA. There are some real problems with this movie and it will probably be easier to list them 1. No jokes, I'm not very hard to please comedically - high or low forehead - but there really isn't a laugh in this movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Does Sir Ben mumble through each line, whether he is supposed to be drunk or not?!? 3. There is no effort to begin not to develop the relationship between love's interests in this. 2 people randomly in the street would immediately have more report. <br /> <br /> 4. All the working talent that is gathered is completely wasted. Don't be fooled into seeing this because of the names. <br /> <br /> 5. For a cold ass man, he rubbed more people in Gandhi than this dull waste of time (one of the way colored beards look really creepy) I hoped this was a slow burner, but Eventually, the only thing that could inject any life - and justice - into this is that Frank pulls his 9 out and knocks all cast out with tea and ends with himself - sorry it was so bad.
