Let me first say that I live in South Africa, where rugby is our biggest sport by far, and our national side, Springboks, has won the Rugby World Cup twice, so that's a great deal here. I have been playing my entire life and I am shocked by the poor attention to detail in this movie! First, I thought it had the potential to be a great movie considering the cast of Neal McDonough, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole and Sean Astin for the sake of goodness, but it turned out to be a mockery of the sport. They mostly mashed with your normal American football movie. <br /> <br /> My first problem is that this movie probably captures the values ​​of rugby but the discipline or should I say the total lack thereof during the games is contrary to this. In the final, it looks more like an NFL game where Penning is tackled by the ball many times, in front of the referee ... it would immediately have led to a few red cards because it would be unpunished so it would be unpunished by a judge I can assure you of that! You would also not be able to find a coach in the world rugby who would have so little control over his team. Any trainer would take a dump on a player's head if he deliberately stiffened a opposing player or double hold him as they did in the final ... red card and some suspension, full stop. <br /> <br /> Secondly, it is absurd that a coach would take a brand new player who has played his entire life I am collecting, moving him to hooker who is a highly specialized position and says it is beneficial to TEAM?! What?! Hooker is a highly specialized position in the front row where you must be able to scrum very well and preferably be able to throw the ball into line-out time, which Penning NEVER does for some reason. By moving a wing to hooks without any extensive long-term training it will only lead to your team's death at scrum time and secondly, the poor child will probably break the neck! How good is the team, I ask you? Finally, the film's overall high emotional pitch is far too much, because although rugby is a good sport and it builds good friendships and team spirit, it rarely gets it out of hand and corny. I have seen true life football drama with less emotion than this movie and it turned out well, but in this, Sean's (Penning) acting skills are drawn too far and the movie trials also force an emotional response out of the audience ending up Be boring and difficult to see at times. Hollywood has made some great sports films over the years, but the next time they wake up in a sport that has just been picked up in the states, they should try to do their homework and maybe get some experts in fray. Do it right or not at all!
