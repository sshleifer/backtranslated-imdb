Although Humphrey Bogart got star billing in King Of The Underworld, I'm willing to bet he doesn't thank Jack Warner for that. In fact, this movie was a hollow crown. King of the Underworld apparently was a remake of the Paul Muni film, Dr. Socrates, but when Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in the Petrified Forest. He even has an English author together in James Stephenson's person. <br /> <br /> Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a couple of poisonous doctors, and Eldredge is taking a difficult operation on one of Bogart's minions. Bogey is a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge $ 500.00 and there is more where it came from if he plays his cards right. Eldredge, who has a game problem, sees a good way to get some black income on. <br /> <br /> But when he is killed in a raid on the gang's shadow, Francis is also thought to be involved in the law and the American Medical Association, no matter how much she protests for her innocence. It's not good, and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from the infamy. Of course, the infamous and Bogart and a traveler Leslie Howard meet as a writer in Stephenson all with her again. But Kay is handsome and inventive to say the least. Bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor guy screamed for better parts. He is a gangster who both shoot down people without mercy and give his palms hotfoots just for laughs. He is worried about his image and therefore author Stephenson kidnapped ghost to write his autobiography and of course regrets enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let Kay Francis completely pamper him, hard to believe he was king of anything. Definitely one of the smaller works for any of the stars.
