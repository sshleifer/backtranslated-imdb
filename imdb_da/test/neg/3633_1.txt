Imagine this: a high school. Except it is boarding school, and the children do not have parents around. Oh, and that's in Malibu. And the kids are all thin, white and beautiful, with the extraordinary token minority or the cool kid playing "weird" outcasts. And there are no reasonable rules, such as how they have cohabitants, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stands, a sushi bar and a free laptop computer. Student. <br /> <br /> Here's the story: A girl, Zoey Brooks, attends PCA, a former all-boys school. Perfect in every possible way, she is smart, handsome, thin, athletic, creative and everything a perfectionist wants to be. Almost all the boys in the school want her and every girl will be her friend. She is the only one who comes to counsel, the one who saves the day with a simplified plan, and is just amazing. Too bad it doesn't make any of this. <br /> <br /> Do we believe that if we don't even get close to Zoy's perfection, are we bad people? In the show, nothing is to blame and if anyone contradicts her, they are portrayed as the bad guy (Logan). He can be a jerk, but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of just agreeing with the princess every time. <br /> <br /> Her loyal group of blind followers is: Chase, the average stupid ass who has a secret in her, Michael, the token black guy (and the only decent actor on the set), Lola, a wannabe actress and anorexic, snobbish airhead, Quinn, the clever but clueless girl when it comes to teenager things, and Logan, the rich jerk who has a soft side. Yes, this show essentially spies stereotypes. <br /> <br /> What ticks me off though is that they all try to pretend to be normal kids. They complain that Logan gets too much money while they have to work on their own, even though they already go to a good home school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers cannot afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi regularly, hardly have homework and tan almost every day. Wow, they have a hard time! Other issues? I'm too handsome, rich and stress free! I think Zoey 101 (what is 101 for, anyway?) Is Nick's attempt to portray teens realistically. Apart from having a glimpse of reality, they did not like it and decided to give the children life as donkeys at The Hills. <br /> <br /> But hey, at least the set's beautiful.
