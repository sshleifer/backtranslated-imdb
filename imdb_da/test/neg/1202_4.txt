... But it certainly deserves only 4/10 stars and no more. A moronic stupid child's father is a fighter pilot who is shot down by an Arab country. They never name the country in the movie, it's really ridiculous, they just refer vaguely to some Arab countries, this movie is really ignorant like that. But Lamar from Nerd's Revenge is in here, he's friends with the protagonist Doug Masters. Well, Doug Masters, who lives on an air force base, his father is an air force pilot, but he fails to enter the Air Force Academy, perceived by a plot (with the help of his late friends) to steal two jets and rescue his father. Yes, just - this is one of the biggest movies ever made !!! Louis Gossett Jr. is fantastic in his role. You can tell he wanted to throw hell out of Doug Masters the whole movie. Well, you can guess how the plot ends, I can't believe they made 3 followers for this movie.
