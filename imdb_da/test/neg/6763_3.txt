Jeff Morrow is Leslie Gaskell, Barbara Laurence is Vera Hunter, and John Emory is Hubbel Eliot. Together with some air force assistants and a comic geek, they are responsible for a super secret underground laboratory on the west coast. Mom is thrilled when he discovers a meteor that passes through the atmosphere, but does not add up when the meteor decides to take a dip in the Pacific Ocean and emerge as a fantastic machine on the Mexican coast. No one knows what this colossal, block-shaped structure is. It is clear that it is a kind of twisted artifact, because the whole is made of right angles with a kind of bald ball half visible on top. It turns out that the machine named Kronos is from some remote planet and has been sent here to rob the earth for energy. You see, here on earth, we have learned to convert matter into energy, but on the Kronos planet they have found out the other half of the equation - how to convert energy into matter. And now they run out of energy on the other planet. Do you take note of this? Well. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you will be able to complete some of the scientific issues raised by Kronos mission. For example, if Kronos' builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa, why not just convert some of their own spare parts into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to the ground to extinguish LA's light? But it is doubtful that the authors could also explain it. Conversely, the polarity of two antennas is described as an "anthropic transformation", which means a "counter-human change" which makes no sense. But it doesn't seem that any of the science makes sense for that matter. The chart Morrow draws on the board goes in the wrong direction, from positive to negative. <br /> <br /> There is also a problem with Kronos' progress. It marches along the coast and threatens "populated areas" (read Southern California), but it has no joints in its two or three legs. These stumps just come up and down and squash some people. The movie doesn't make much of these squashed people. They are shown as Mexican farmers, so they may not count too much. USAF also drops a hydrogen bomb on Kronos - while in Mexico, you think. No one raises an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> Not much play is required and not much is given. Jeff Morrow has a clear and resonant voice, great for radio or for television voices. His face is less expressive. He has only one expression, no matter what the situation is - a tight smile as if he has his picture taken at the Universal Studios Tour. Barbara Laurence had a fine golden quality when she made "Street With No Name" a few years earlier. She was a slim seventeen year old as Richard Widmark's wife. Here, her care and behavior reduces her to the level of B-movie actress, though she is still beautiful. It's always good to see Morris Ankrum in one of these movies. He's made so many, I get them mixed up. <br /> <br /> On the whole, the movie comes across as flat, I'm scared. (However, there are some good shots of a B-47 in flight.) The sets reveal a low-budget business. It is not necessarily bad in itself, but there is nothing to compensate for the harsh settings. A little excitement in the script, no direct viewing and little effort put into the performance. <br /> <br /> You can get a kick out of it - a relaxed high - because this is clearly disadvantageous. It's just that there are so many better movies of the genre out there.
