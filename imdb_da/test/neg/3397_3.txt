I have read many comments on how this film goes to the book. I don't think any of them have read it. Edgar Rice wrote about a dangerous African jungle and monkeys were murderers and hunters. We know differently now and this film depicts the Apes in a more modern view. I have never seen a Tarzan movie that even comes close to Edgar's vision. Maybe one day Hollywood with trusted talented and respected writers to tell the story. So if you've never read the book and enjoyed a good story of emotion and a fluffy bunny view of wild animals, maybe a good cry, watch the movie. I hope John Carter of Mars gets more respect than Tarzan has. We miss you, Edgar!
