Perhaps the wildest outlier in Alfred Hitchcock's career is this direct-released vehicle of the director, mating Carole Lombard with Robert Montgomery as a couple who discovers a mistake has void their marriage. Where do they really stand together? Contrary to what others say, there is an element of excitement here: The idea that these two miserable people could escape each other, free to inflict their terrible on some other, unworthy friend. It is fun to read comments on how Lombard's Ann Smith plays out in this movie because Montgomery's role is so much of a heel. He handles Ann, schnapps to witnesses, short-shrift customers - just the kind of lawyer who gives his profession a bad name. Ann is also overbearing, of course, the kind of wife who keeps her husband hostage from work for six days over a petty curl and behaves like he did in Paris when he was 20 and had not even met her. "I forgave it!" She says it was big of her. <br /> <br /> For David, a revoked marriage is an opportunity to have some illicit pleasure with his "mistress" before joining the knot for good. For Ann, it is an attempt at premarital sex that must be rejected with a bottle of champagne to the head, followed by expulsion from their apartment and her life. The eco does not seem to fall far from the tree when Ann's mother is scandalized in apoplexy when she learns what David was trying to pull: "Oh my poor baby! Thank you sky your father is dead!" It is a rare good line in this shameless, unlikely comedy. <br /> <br /> You can call this an example of "recycle comedy" where the spouse's bonds are challenged to be confirmed. You can also call this an example of what Roger Ebert calls the "idiot plot", where the storylin depends on the protagonists acting as idiots. Hitchcock seems to have a laugh at the tight American morale, but can't really do much more with it than a jokey scene where an older couple is scandalized by the sound of loud plumbing. Lombard died within a year of this film's release; It was the last movie of her she lived to see. What a shame it couldn't have been any better! She was also overbearing in "My Man Godfrey", but in such a sympathetic way you didn't just have to go with her that you wanted. Here she plays for laughs that are not there while they sadly break David's chops again and again. Montgomery rolls his eyes much like Groucho, a smugitude study. The only really decent thing in this movie that lasts more than a few seconds is Gene Raymond as David's law partner Jeff Custer, who makes a game of honor and decency with respect and actions. Raymond teaches his many shots and even an enchanted scene, too good a power. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** So decent a guy is Jeff that Ann ends up rejecting him for not fighting David after she strikes him in a confrontation and calls Custer "a lump of jelly" . Jeff leaves the scene and leaves Ann and David together for their future murder suicide. Here's a Custer who managed to escape a massacre! *** SPOILER END ***
