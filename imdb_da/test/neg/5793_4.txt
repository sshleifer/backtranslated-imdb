If you thought Herbie was trying to kill herself by driving from a bridge in the 'The Love Bug', you waited until you see him act horny in this confusing stupid other sequel. Dean Jones is back as the driver competing in Paris for the Monte Carlo rally; This time, his feeling VW falls in love with another car in the race, a Lancia run by Julie Sommars. At this point in the series, energy and charm lack even more than in 'Herbie Rides Again'; The film is overlapping and threadable, although it is visible thanks to the return of Jones's typically recallable performance, a few fun pieces and the cast's scary curl.
