I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, where Zombie Planet was filmed. I had heard about the movie ever since, from various people who claimed to be a critical part of production. So for several years I heard absolutely nothing. Imagine my surprise when I found it all alone in the local video store, just itching for a rental. So, being the cinephile I am, I decided to give these local filmmakers a shot. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. <br /> <br /> Zombie Planet is long, dull, badly acted, miserably shot - and that's just the good stuff. I tried my hardest to enjoy it, which contained the removal of my brain and put it on the table so it would not get in the way of the horrible story. Alas, nothing worked. Zombie Planet is so bad, it's pathetic. And the very idea that they are planning a sequel makes me believe that the director and his minions have listened to none of the critics, I am sure they have heard. Go ahead, you guys. Please. In fact, refrain from filming completely. Or participate in some classes on pacing, storytelling and, well, basic direction. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, for God's love, hang it up.
