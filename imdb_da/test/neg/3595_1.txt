Now I know that a lot of black humor damages fun on typical black things such as gold teeth. But that doesn't mean they are always fun. Don't be a threat is an example of this. The city movie is dedicated to satire. The problem is that Wayans and consorts not only attempt to satirize the typical "ghetto" culture, but they also reject valid statements made in urban films such as Boyz 'n' The Hood or Menace II Society. Personally, I think the film makers must get their heads away from their white masters stools. Besides this, the film itself is horrible. It is definitely not fun. The wit is racist. Instead of satirizing the urban movie genre, the film developers show their views on the "ignorant" urban (ghetto) blacks. Now, there are some other jokes in this movie, but I think this is the main ticket. The conclusion is that this film is crap, and decision makers need to use their talents to make a constructive comedy / satire movie. They have examples in men with black hats (which were made before this movie) and Friday.
