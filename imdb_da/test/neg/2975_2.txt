Okay, so I'm Singaporean, and I want to say it's time to stop stereotyping singers and make such movies. Some of the actors / actors actually have talent, but unfortunately it wasn't much in this movie. I was fidgeting in my seat when I saw this when I was very young at the time, my parents took me together to see it. Honestly, I could say that I should fall asleep. And there was this arrogant, westernized boy who just got on my nerves. All in all, a boring movie, and a general waste of the actor's talent. I've seen better Singaporean movies than this. Chicken rice war was good. However, I cannot believe that this would be considered a better Singaporean movie. Sorry, I would not recommend it.
