Pun calculated. This low budget action / horror vehicle for Don Wilson's ability to kick things is stuff straight to the video ticket made from. <br /> <br /> The reason: Wilson is a humorous vampire hunter who comes under fire from local law enforcement after being forced to slaughter creatures by night in the light of the public. Police chase him, vampires chase him, he reacts by kicking ... much. <br /> <br /> There's a little more to the story, but it's so insignificant that I honestly can't remember it; I think people actually talked in the movie, but it's up to debate. The reason is nothing but a setup for Wilson to kill as many vampires as possible over time, usually by kicking them. <br /> <br /> The technical specifications are in one word anemic. Small color processing, amateur use of lighting, simplified use of camera and angle. Blood and gore are noticeably limited, odd for this type of film. The most damaging of the movie foul-ups is the crooked shift to the super-shaking cam during every battle scene. If the camera starts jumping around like a travel leg on speed, then you know that Don is starting to kick everything in sight. All in all, this is the kind of bad movie that can be done well with a few friends and very cynical humor. Otherwise, don't see unless you really like to see things kicked. <br /> <br /> 3/10
