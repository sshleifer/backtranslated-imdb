I can't say I was surprised at this cruelty when I saw it a few months or weeks ago (can't remember). I saw it as a two-part episode of Zoey 101 because that was how they showed it here in Canada. <br /> <br /> I was incredibly annoyed at Makeover a Nerd thing, it's just an example of how unacceptable, unworthy, superficial, negative, biased and stereotypical the people of the entertainment industry are and honestly I'm extremely combed. It was not fun at all. A geek is a stereotype, and it makes people very offended. <br /> <br /> Secondly, the people of Zoey 101 have no real problems. Logan has a big house, he has a famous father, he has everything and Zoey is also rich. They never have to deal with the things that today's tweens and teenagers should do deal with as peer press and stereotypical issues. The actors are also horrific. Jamie Lynn Spears does not deserve to be in a TV show as successful as Zoey 101 (what's wrong with the world?), She has no talent as an actor. In fact, she is worse than Britney! Chase and Zoey stuff were incredibly predictable, I mean, how could the show continue with Zoey and Chase dating? What other problems might they have? Except that Chase doesn't get the girl he wants, everything is perfect! The absolutely worse 48 minutes of my television watching life. Ever. 0/10 (and it's generous)
