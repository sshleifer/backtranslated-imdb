Ram Gopal Verma usually makes a so-called cookie cutter formal fare, lifted from some Hollywood flick. His every movie after Shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre. Sometimes he makes a really horrible movie like this. <br /> <br /> In the first 55 minutes, we are introduced to the only 2 characters, a fighting gymnast who is a skilled dancer (go figure!) and a wannabe actor trying to turn it rich in Bollywood. They become in love, zero becomes completely, dancer / gymnast gets no break, gymnastics, anxiety, the usual heartbeat, more gymnastics, anxiety, singing, dancing, anxiety, a little more gymnastics, more ridiculous gymnastics, and before you know it, be quick asleep. And this despite the HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY HOT bodysuit from the leading lady-cum-gymnast-cum dancer. <br /> <br /> Hey, you're not alone !! The editor, the director, the photographer, in fact, sleeps the whole cast and the crew asleep throughout the production. Only difference is that they were paid to snooze while paying money for this crap, so you lose. Ha, joke is on you. Don't be sorry for yourself, but for our poor, crazy broke as she tones up daily in her senior penthouse in the sexiest leotards and tracksuits. Pooh reading, when will the poor thang get a break, she is STARR WINN? <br /> <br /> Antara Mali can't act. RGV has lost its marble. Abhishek tried hard but failed. No plot. No story. Nothing. She must have paid RGV beautifully to do this all-nonsense thing besides free gymnastics lessons on her casting bench. What a great deal. No need for a acting career. Such an absolute nonsense can only "Made in Bollywood" of course!
