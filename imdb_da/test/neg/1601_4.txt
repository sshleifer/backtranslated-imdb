I was looking forward to seeing "Wirey Spindell" since it happened over Schaffer's "Fall". Unfortunately, I found "WS" to be a wandering, unengaging, boring bunch of claptrap pieced along with what apparently is Schaeffer's signature, a mix of history, narration and poetry. The film tells sexual and other experiences of a Manhattan man about getting married through self-taught flashbacks. As pearls on a string, Schaffer apparently tied together every little sexual life experience while neglecting to tend to the beauty of neck beauty. The result is a contradictory story of a boy who grows up, who does not create empathy and leaves the viewer disconnected, dissatisfied and with a poor aftertaste that protects the mechanical emotional end. A mediocre indie and a step backwards to Schaeffer.
