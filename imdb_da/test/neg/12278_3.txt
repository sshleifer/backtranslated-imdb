Tony Curtis and Skip Homier both wear black with white trim canvas in the scenes just before and after the swim pond and the tank blows up. Must have been too hard on the young stars feet. If the real Marines had been on the mission, they would have used boots. In the first scenes they took off their leggings just before they started their little trip to find the danger. When they went to the area where they dug the fox holes, Tony and Skip jumped on combat boots, then later when Lovejoy and Curtis ran into Framer and his daughter Tony wears "Tennis shoes", but hey has been difficult. The movie of a true story, but did they really need the love interest ??
