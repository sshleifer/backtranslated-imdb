Reading the other user comments, the review of A666333 has articulated most of what I felt throughout this movie-predictable story, cliché versions of lesbian / heterosexuals (ie, straight woman being lesbian while concluding that her husband is abusive and aggressive). <br /> <br /> Also, the score was very disappointing. It was gentle, soft, sentimental elevator music - another regular cliché in movies about lesbians. The movie would have had some interesting dramatic moments if they had not been destroyed by the music. <br /> <br /> A couple of sex and erotic scenes also struck me as trying to titrate and raise shock value, including parts of the final performance scene. The traditional "hot and steamy" moments were as boring as the overly sentimental score. For example, during the pool scene, the women kiss, and then the camera throws along the abandoned wine glass, the flowing water, the sound of their heavy breathing over the soft wave breakdown. <br /> <br /> The only items I liked were costuming and arobatics. They are well choreographed, and the development of attraction between the two characters felt very natural during the training scenes. I really smiled under these, and during the last scene with the police officer. But they weren't enough to balance the negatives or make me enjoy this movie.
