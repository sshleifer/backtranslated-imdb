This movie, though well shot and excellently acted, was terrible. I felt like I was looking at a car accident - I was still watching, but I really wanted to turn my head. The reason leaves little to be desired, was extremely heterogeneous, and the ending was eerie. Although it fits the tone of the movie, I was hoping for something to improve this movie. I still do not understand what the references to rabies and the child get bit of the fox at the start of the film. Fifteen minutes of plot that really didn't do much. It's really sad to see a movie with fine actors and a beautiful set of wasted on such a horrible, horrible story. There is not much more to say about this movie. Save yourself time and watch c-span. It becomes more uplifting.
