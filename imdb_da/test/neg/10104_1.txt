This movie is really pathetic in every imaginable department. awful, awful, terrible. It's only about 80 minutes long, but believe me you will feel like you are watching an Andy Warhol movie (then again, twenty hours in the empire's life will surely be far more interesting). <br /> <br /> Where to start ... the rugged script, the obnoxious filmography, the so bad it is bad, the spectacularly gloomy effect, horrible music, or just wafer-thin plot resembling a aim. This movie is a disjointed shambles <br /> <br /> A particularly notable scene takes place outside a cafe when Dominic Pinon decides to shoot a cat, cue waitress looking through the cafe window, commenting on an average English accent "God fucking" . Right the woman. God cursing this horrible monster. <br /> <br /> Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves. Let's hope the director never finds the funding to work again.
