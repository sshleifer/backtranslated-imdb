This was so poor I had to turn it off in the end. I've never seen such a pathetic movie. I love B-movies and looked forward to more of the same, but unfortunately I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> This has the worst action / plot / direction / writing, etc. ...... of anything I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone thinking or looking / buying / renting, don't go there!
