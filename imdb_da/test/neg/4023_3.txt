The original story had all the ingredients to make a thoroughly gripping film. But failed in this version as even Cherie Lunghi was a pale imitation of what she was supposed to be - so much so that I supposed she would turn out to be an accomplice in the end. Sherlock Holmes turned into a warrior who was unlike anything suggested by Sir Arthur Conn Doyle? In fact, it was Doctor Watson who showed what little common sense was coming. The trivial swarms of the Andomans looked as if he couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag, and what the villain did in Baker Street for a breakdown was something other than the old Scottish yard could ever have dreamed of. So send this movie to their black museum thanks.
