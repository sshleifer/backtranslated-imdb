I got this on a dual feature DVD called "Scream Theater" and it is undoubtedly one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen. And I've seen some really bad ones. The school's out and of three girls (as if they are teenagers, I want to eat my hat) talk about "non-stop party", so of course they all go to the house girl whose parents are most strict for a dormant party. Meanwhile, a psychotic has fled the local abbey, where a girl's father works and is loose with sharp objects and wearing green scrubs and sporting wide-open eyes ... I think it's showing that he is bonkers. Of course, as he has a bone to choose with that doctor, he goes to his house, whose location is apparently common knowledge. In the meantime, some dumps beat beer and out to scare the girls, and of course, the loony also shows and begins to cut the neck. And it's about it when the heavy metal music chugs along in the background. Or maybe it's not, but that's all you need to know. Unless you spend your time forever stoned or full, you'll find a bit of interest here, and even if you're wasted most of the time, you'll still find your intelligence insulted. 1 out of 10
