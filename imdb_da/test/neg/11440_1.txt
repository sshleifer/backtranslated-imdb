WOW, I would hate to sound meaning, but anyone who rated this movie higher than I just have must have an I.Q. It reaches unimaginable low depths that extend over time and space and connect on the planet "Hopper-er-retard-for-making-this-movie". WOW this movie STANK. Fred Wards haircut sees SSSSSSSTTTTTTTTUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPPPPIDIDDD! In fact, I was considering sending Fred Ward some money to compensate for the miserable haircut he owns in this horrible movie. Jodie Foster has of course not had much to work with, but still has a terrible performance through. Joe Pesci, oh my ... Joe Pesci (who's mysteriously not thrown) plays the ultimate stereotypical Joe Pesci movie character, complete with mob killings and constant use of the F word. You will not believe in your eyes. Dean Stockwell, who saw him in this mess, made me feel bad for him because I actually thought he was either drunk or temporarily retarded during the movie. Jon Turturro must have been drunk when he agreed to be with Vincent Price, Bob Dylan and Charlie Sheen. I know what you're thinking, GREAT CAST! I know, and that was the WORST big cast movie I've ever seen. Dennis Hopper leads and stars and it is just as bad in both areas. How the man could have corrected EASY RIDER and then this is far away than my excellent imagination. His incredibly dragged man-character accent is beyond the realm of horror and is merely the hilarious bad end. They (Hopper and Foster) are the most uninteresting couple I think I have ever encountered in my exposure to the cinema world, and you will rejoice that they will lose and then become magnificent at the end. What exactly are the two of them who CHOOSE at that action full conclusion? I do not know, but I know that if I ever meet Dennis Hopper, I will make it extremely fun with him to be responsible for this celluloid waste. Join me! IAN
