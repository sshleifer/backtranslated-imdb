This movie is absolutely horrible! I thought because it had good actors in what Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper, and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams. The film is long and draws with a documentary style showing Gabrielle Union, who is dead in the movie and talks about his family; Which, by the way, is a confusing family because you never know who is who and who is related to who. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and I wish I could take it back where I got it. I fell asleep from time to time because of the boredom. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It could have been more true in life with more drama and less boredom.
