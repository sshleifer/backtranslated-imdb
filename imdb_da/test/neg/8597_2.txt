The second day I showed my boyfriend a great movie, Stand By Me, a movie I've shown to many people, and they absolutely loved it, but for some reason he didn't like it. He makes me a movie called Backdraft, and he tells me he has shown it to many people and they loved it, instead I hated this movie. I don't think I've hated a movie so much for a while, how this movie even has a 6.6 rating is beyond me. I couldn't keep an eye on the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin becomes a firefighter, the random sibling rivalry, the random love story (s), who is a firefighter story, the investigator, the fire that has a personality of its own. I just have a problem that this movie can't keep an eye on all those stories, they didn't balance well enough, making the movie interesting. I would just have preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or investigator, and how he came to be one or what exactly he does and why. <br /> <br /> The film tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, the older brother, is obsessed with beating the fires he is fighting. Brian, the younger brother interrupted the school of fire several years before, and then began a number of other failed careers before becoming a firefighter. He's looked down on his older brother who expects him to fail in his newly-chosen career as a firefighter. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is a fire researcher dedicated to his profession. He is called because a number of fires that have arisen have similar connections. . Martin Swayzak is an alderman in the city council. He has obvious hopes of being elected mayor, but has had to make a number of budget cuts for the fire department. Many of the ranks and the firefighters believe that the cuts he has made threaten the firefighters' lives. However, Swayzak is initially successful in depicting the fire department as inflated and ineffective when firefighters are repeatedly killed in fire. <br /> <br /> I just couldn't get into this movie, I don't know how anyone else could it was incredibly unrealistic and depicted firefighters all wrong. I loved how they had every action clich√© in the book to match this action flick. I also felt as if there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser-known man who had the upcoming talent at that time. I know Ron went for good quality, but I think he threw such great actors in small roles was a mistake for this movie. I even had to joke through as I watched this movie and commented on how the doctor in the background was Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic, and the movie was just out there, I didn't enjoy it and honestly wouldn't recommend it to people, I stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on. <br /> 2/10
