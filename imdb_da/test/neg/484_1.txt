I was exposed to this horrible excuse for a television movie. I only watched it because I didn't have cable, and my only other choices were golf, college basketball or local news. The reason is very generic and has no substance I could see, not to mention it had a big mistake in my eyes. The main character, Dr. The Sorensen, is a washed astronomer who believes that an asteroid called "Nemesis" will hit the ground and cause the whole life to cease. He bases his faith on his discovery of cave paintings by an aboriginal (I'm sure I spelled one wrong). The paintings show an apparent timeline that shows significant events throughout history, such as. Construction of the Great Wall. All events are displayed in perfect chronological order, and the very first picture in the timeline is that the earth is destroyed. Now for me, if the painting showed things that really happened, why would the big doctor believe that he could somehow change what would happen? All that in turn moved the film along with extreme formal precision. There was nothing in the movie that surprised me at all. The actors were not that good, and on some occasions I just felt that they didn't even take the film seriously to put enough effort into trying to convince me that the characters were worth watching. The whole movie was clich√© ride and a fair waste of time and money. I would recommend Armageddon over this piece of shit any day. At least Armageddon has some good actors (in relation to this), not to mention the eye candy that is Liv Tyler. Now that I think about it, Golf is not that bad .......
