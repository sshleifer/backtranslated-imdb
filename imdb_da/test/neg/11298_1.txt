Hannibal must be the most god-fearing movie I've seen for a long time. In fact, I want my money back. What a waste of time. No plot, minimal character development, dubious motives, poor dialogue, distracting effects. What more can I say? If you haven't seen it, don't bother. I wouldn't even rent the video and if you happen to come with it on TV ... change channel. The only reason anyone had to watch this movie would be to see if the free violence followed up on all the hype (which is honestly why they added it). If you want to see some gug that eats its own brain, fast forward to the bit. What was the purpose of this movie? It's as if someone just asked 'I'm wondering what Hannibal is up to these days' and we just went together for the trip. He is free at the beginning and he is free at the end. In between, there is a lot of complacency at Anthony Hopkins and the filmmakers. Julianne Moore valiantly tries to inject some life into her Clarice, but they gave her a sub-standard script and, as far as I was concerned, she was set up to fail. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's just a very very bad story in every sense of the word. The only reason it made so much money was because of the meaningless violence they added that, at the end of the day, leaves you with more contempt than the horror you have to feel. <br /> <br /> I give it a big fat RASPBERRY!
