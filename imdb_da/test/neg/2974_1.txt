For football fans everywhere - stay away from this movie. It was so baaaaddd! Lame acting, lame script, lame football and no directing! I rented this movie in my style in Asia and was shocked that this was considered one of the better Singaporean movies. It was just indecent and thoroughly boring. There are thousands of rich, exciting stories in Asia. Why write a bad story about the top and stereotypical Singapore people?
