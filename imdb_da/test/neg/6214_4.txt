The movie is not bad in itself ... until you see the original movie Hitch (2005) with Will Smith. The film is an equal copy with even the dialogues for most of the movie, simply translated from English to Hindi! The origin of the original is immediately executed. The Hindi version fails to keep viewers interested. The overall kind of comedy by David Dhawan seems to have gone overboard with Govinda's hysterical rubbing all the time ... sometimes more time is used to understand the cause of it than the plot. :) <br /> <br /> If you know English that I assume you know when you read this, see the Hollywood original. At least see "Hitch" if you've seen Partner compare. It is the least we can do to support the creative geniuses whose work I am sorry to say is shamelessly promised by "inspired" people like David Dhawan.
