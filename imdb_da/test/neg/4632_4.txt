History and experience over the last few decades have shown us that intellectuals who talk about sex are about the unrelated and unintentional things that anyone can do, but it was not quite as obvious back in 1986. The reason is the idea in This film that these characters insatiable driving to find comfort, security and pleasure in sexual acts is actually the unhealthy motive that makes them so unbearable to themselves - as they hide from themselves with more sex. This drive is linked to "the US empire's decline", as evidenced by an early interview in the movie. <br /> <br /> So the idea is that relatively abominable people talk about sex and that it is supposed to reveal how horrible they are as humans. Arcand at least by giving it drive and momentum by making interesting things with the camera, such as isolating most of the characters in single frames, revealing their final loneliness and cutting quickly between them and showing how they are more at war with each other than they are by appointment. And to give Arcand credit, it is basically the intellectual life, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to stand out, even when everyone stands out means they stand alone. But yes, the signs and actions are unsexy and kind of pathetic. I think this movie is much more an aspect of its time than it is something that must be last, which makes it a bit dated. It is also the exact type of mental buffing in dialogue and references to people like Susan Sontag who make art house films so unpopular about the populist entertainment films. All in all, I take it anyway - it has its place basically among the exact types of people the characters are - it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't these characters. <br /> - PolarisDiB
