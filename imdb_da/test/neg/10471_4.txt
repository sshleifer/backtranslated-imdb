.... OK, small town, clueless sheriff? Check. Sheriff's hot daughter? Check? Ne'er-do-well girlfriend of the sheriff's hot daughter who sheriff hates? Check. Corporate land developer who greedily puts people over? Check. The developer's rank-and-file accidentally triggers a primordial monster, so is it pushed to cover it? Check. Native warnings of mass death and destruction if things do not return to their way? Check. Amateur CGI special effects that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Check. Seriously, almost all the clich√©s in your typical Sci-Fi Original movie have been lumpy in a classic, so bad-it's-good movie. The only thing missing is that the researcher / expert tries to convey his / her knowledge; There is a paleontologist with three students who makes me put my The Bone Eater back in the movie early, but they are basic extras in the movie. And I can honestly say that I pretty much predicted all this; right down to whoever survives and who does not (though I have to say that I got the dead time for one of the characters wrong for about an hour). I swear I could have made this movie myself if they gave me all the characters. In spite of all this, the movie is fun to see if it is nothing but playing MST3K with your friends. If you are capable of some thoughtless fun, it is a great movie to see why I give this movie a surprisingly respectable 4, although for all purposes and purposes it deserves a much lower rating. But then again you wouldn't tune into an SciFi Original movie, if you were looking for a movie with a real plot, content figures or good special effects, would you?
