WARNING!!! Some possible plot spoiler if possible !!! <br /> <br /> Okay, if you haven't figured out the plot yet, I'll give it to you. Two couples go to a campsite, but a clown-murdered killer appears and causes all sorts of chaos. Now is the time for me to give these couples some advice. <br /> <br /> 1. Never, ever go to the camp called Camp Blood by the locals. 2. Don't have sex or make out in front of the killer. 3. Don't hunt for the killer if he or she runs away. 4. Do not fight disgrace on the killer. 5. Make sure your cell phone works before you go camping. 6. Everyone needs to bring a sharp or dangerous weapon and carry it on himself at all times. 7. Wear loose and comfortable clothes and take a good pair of running shoes. No tight and binding clothes and no high heels or sandals. 8. Use glasses or contact lenses if you need them so you do not support the wrong person. 9. Always carry your car keys on you. 10. Put out a camp fire when you go to bed. 11. See your step. If you travel on something, you will break a bone. 12. Check the rear seat for intruders. 13. If the killer has you corner, at least put a fight. <br /> <br /> And guess what? At least one, but usually all four protagonists break all sense of that sense. They are the stupidest characters ever to grace a movie. <br /> <br /> Now for some brief comments. This slasher film was on a very tight budget. So make four of the 7 or 8 actors play more than one role. Action, writing, direction, sound, lighting, camera work, plotting, editing, etc. are all at the bottom of the line. But like the classic movie JACK O it seems soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fun. So rent this and take it well and laugh. My rating: 5 out of 10.
