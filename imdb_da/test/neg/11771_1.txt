Well, I thought the movie was 1/10. Still, the best part is the first 5 minutes of the movie with nerds or whatever the girlfriend, that's the part you guys watch for Tho she had big hooters, I thought it's really a random actor? Heck no, it wasn't that actually was a model called Larissa McComas, but you already knew it <br /> <br /> So it made sense, but it was about the rest of the movie (which I saw anyway) did not care about 4 and did not disturb the rest of it. It was <br /> <br /> all I needed for C to be happy, so the two of you who just care good wherever you go
