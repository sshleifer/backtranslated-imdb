Honestly, people who gave this movie a ten would have given 100 for pulp fiction. This is the level we are dealing with here. <br /> <br /> The movie is not bad, but it's not like "OMG, the best movie since Pulp Fiction!". Some people have incredibly low expectations for movies, even those of indie variety. Personally, I found my interest in the movie fell after the half-hour mark. The foundation interprets logic and belief. You have to hear the part about why the wife did what she did to "save her husband". Yeah right. I guarantee that you will leave the theater thinking: "Hmm, now it doesn't make sense." This is a movie where you really need to suspend all logic and belief. Those who said the music score was good probably listened to their MP3 players. It killed the movie in some parts. <br /> <br /> Finally, watch the movie only if you have nothing particularly important to do. I give this a three because there is a long sex sequence in the motel which is decent.
