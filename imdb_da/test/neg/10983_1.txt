This woman is a terrible comedian. She can't crack a joke. She has no real character. This is another example of typical American waste that people are laughing at because they have no idea how to react so they say to themselves: "Well, it's a comedy show," so I'll laugh, I think. <Br /> <br /> I can't stand this miserable woman and her pi $$ bad excuse for comedy. She deserves nothing but booing. Why can't America dump this kind of Turdish joy and go for something that actually contains humor. She's not fun. Not at all. Why ohh, why even a person like this idiot?
