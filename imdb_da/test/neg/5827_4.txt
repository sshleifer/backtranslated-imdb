I saw Winnie's Heffalump a few days ago. A good story based on well-known characters created by A.A.Milne. Although Winnie, Piglet, Tigger and Rabbit are all present in this animated feature, the main character is Roo this time. He is kind with scary Heffalump who turns out to be not scary at all and shows everyone that friendship knows no bounds and everyone wants and deserves to be happy. I love this movie and I would love it even more if I was 10 or 15 years younger. Unfortunately, I'd like to be a kid again to enjoy this Heffalump story a lot more, but all I'm left with is a sense of sadness at the loss of some kind of childhood and innocence that this movie is full of? I was happy to hear Carly Simon singing, Joel McNeely gave great score.
