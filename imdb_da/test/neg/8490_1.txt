Is there any reason to revive characters 10 years after the only reason they worked for the first time was due to the actors who played them. <br /> <br /> Who can replace Jim Carrey or Cameron Diaz - or better yet, who can replace them at discounted prices, as most studies know that successors do not bring the same revenue as the originals to cut corners get-go. Where are the good movies will play if powerful Hollywood studios can clog 3,000 theaters opening weekend with whatever sires they feel the public can be suckered in. <br /> <br /> Enough enough people, this sequel is have to stop and the Hollywood people have to start getting their action together or start distributing the much better foreign product flowing in limbo. Wake up Hollywood because the people have woken up and they don't buy it just because it's new and shiny. Give us the good stuff and send the rest to the DVD shelves, because we take back the theaters once and for all !!!
