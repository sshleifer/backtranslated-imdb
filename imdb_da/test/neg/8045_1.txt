The COC had its moments. I enjoyed the action sequences, but I despised the manuscript and the plot. I hate this movie so much, I'm just writing about the stupid part. First of all, the plot will never happen. Secondly, the turmoil of the Chinese Presidency was unfortunate for. It would never happen. Finally, the dialogue is. Using non-Chinese players to play Chinese roles is understandable, but writing dialogue for those who are completely OFF is stupid! For those of you who understood the Chinese in the movie, you know what I mean.
