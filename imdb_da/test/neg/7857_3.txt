For some of us, director Ernst Lubitsch, loved his underlying cheek and ironic comic touches, it was pretty wet when it came to picking material. It is not that Lubitsch is overstated - on the contrary, he was probably ahead of his time in terms of a visual narrative - but the projects he was associated with (or was awarded) are not quite his comedy fans like to feel them. With "Heaven Can Wait", a screen adaptation of Lazlo Bus-Fekete's "Birthday" game, Lubitsch is put in the sleepy Don Ameche at the forefront - and the combination of an anemic plot, a colorless star and a musty flashback frame stymie director. An evil man at the turn of the century "falls asleep without realizing it" and presents facts about his life in front of Hell's entrance. Ameche ... evil? It was problem number one. The promising opening order (set in the Hades lobby) quickly allows for boring whimsy, and the support support is of little importance. * 1/2 from ****
