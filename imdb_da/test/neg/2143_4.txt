Ahem .. I think I'll be the only one who says this, but yes, I was boring during the movie. Not to say this is a bad movie, it is actually a very good attempt to portray the inner feelings - dilemma, grief, love. It's the director's debut (read from somewhere, is it true?). I felt that something was not quite right, maybe it's just me, I'm not drawn to the characters enough to immerse myself in their world. This is a simple story of ordinary people, ordinary life. Through simple and short dialogues, the director tries to relate to a simple guy's life, and how to handle the news of his illness by laughing it every time. Oh, his laughter was a little sweet first but gradually it comes to me, such a deep heartfelt roar for a gentle man! I have to say that I did not feel the effects that most readers felt. In fact, I was more attracted to the trivial scenarios such as the sperm of watermelon seeds with his sis, which clearly show that they are comfortable with each other, the grandmother who came back to another shot - it's a bit melancholy, the thought-provoking gesture of writing the procedures for his father - hmm but it is predictable. Don't misunderstand that I'm an action lover, independent movie is my cup of tea! Maybe I just have a really high expectation after seeing many deep movies with stronger pictures. Some Asian movies worth the watch: Tony Takitani (depicting loneliness) Wayward Cloud (only 1 dialogue) My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (loneliness too) 15 (gangsters live in local setting) Before sunrise and before sunset (I just have to mention these though they are not Asian movies. Fans will understand!)
