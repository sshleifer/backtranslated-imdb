This is another Bollywood remake of a Hollywood movie. Hitch ... If I'm correct. <br /> <br /> The movie has some great moments that make you laugh aloud, which frankly comes only from Govinda, who has become a legend in Indian cinema and will always bring his A Game of Comedy . Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav; who is fun as a gangster imitating 'Don', an Indian icon of cinema. Lara Dutta is a plus ... I know I sound low, but it's mainly because I have a soft spot for her, she's trying to be fun, but it seems to be forced. Her acting is weak ... but she is still shining. Salman Khan is horrible, he tries to bring the cool, charming depth, but fails, he overcomes actions and continues to shout without apparent reason. <br /> <br /> "It's not actress called to be mentally challenged" <br /> <br /> Katrina Kaif is just bad ... not so good at anything. No charisma, no talent .. and I can't see why people consider her beautiful ... The reason was far fetched and I had difficulty believing that Katrina's character had been removed attracted to Govinda. The only good thing is the music ... 'You are my love' was the best in the soundtrack.
