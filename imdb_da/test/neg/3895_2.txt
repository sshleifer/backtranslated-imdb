I will admit that I have not followed the attention of everything in this movie, but to be honest, I do not think it would matter. Basically, Municipal Manager Sidney Fiddler (Sid James) persuades the incompetent mayor Frederick Bumble (Kenneth Connor) of Firecombe to hold a beauty contest to enhance the city's image. They face opposition from women's liberationist Augusta Prodworthy (June Whitfield), who is trying to sabotage the competition, but they have publicity agent Peter Potter (Bernard Bresslaw) and Palace Hotel owner Connie Philpotts (Joan Sims). Soon the young beautiful Wannabe models will appear, including Hope Springs (Barbara Windsor), Paula Perkins (Valerie Leon), Dawn Brakes (Goldfinger's Margaret Nolan), Debra (Sally Geeson) and Ida Downs (East Enders Wendy Richard). When the girls have cat games, the ordinary residents pull away, but after a while it is not so fun to indudeos and William (Jack Douglas) have overactive traits, but it eventually comes to the competition and it's just after I couldn't be bothered. Also contributing to Patsy Rowlands as Mildred Bumble, Peter Butterworth as Admiral, Joan Hickson as Mrs. Dukes, David Lodge as Police Inspector, Angela Grant as Miss Bangor, Arnold Ridley as Advisor Pratt, Robin Askwith as Larry, Patricia Franklin as Rosemary, Jimmy Logan as Cecil Gaybody and father's army Bill Pertwee as fire chief, Charles Hawtrey had of course interrupted Carry Ons, but where is Kenneth Williams? I suppose to see Babs and adolescents, beautiful and looking at Pauline Fowler in bikinis, but for comedy value it fails to fail, and the assault of the swimmer's flute just comes on your nerves. Very poor!
