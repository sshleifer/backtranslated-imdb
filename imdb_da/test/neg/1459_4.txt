It's hard to decide what to say about this. It's not quite a hundred percent bad. Although the film-in-a-movie is incredibly poor, it is believed to be campy, but missing by a mile. I'm pretty sure this is intentional. Danny Aiello is quite appropriate here, and more or less nails his pathetic character. Dyan Cannon was good in a small role. Clotilde Courau was impressive as the last twenty any girlfriend. And Linda Carlson had a brave topless scene that she took good care of. <br /> <br /> But it's not bad, but I don't believe it achieves its goals. All in all, it's probably worth passing on.
