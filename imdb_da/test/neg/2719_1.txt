Radio may be one of the best movies I've ever seen while being one of the worst. It made me laugh in places where you were crying and made me hug in the moments you were going to laugh. It lacked any kind of character development that is usually crucial to a sentimental flick that this is. Some questions, why did Ed Harris character radio under his wing, it was not properly explained, and I am sure their relationship (which is the most important aspect of the movie) is the most meaningless if ever seen. <br /> <br /> continuing to give Cuba Gooding junior work, he is a acting actor and should be tolerated heavily until he picks up another style of work. <br /> <br /> Like true stories, it's not that interesting. That's why I said it's one of the best movies I've ever seen is because, despite it's complete cardboard, I still enjoy it. laughing at the manuscript and most monologues who are really working either are idiot or a very clever who tries to show how easy it is to drop a crazy movie about a retard who gets everyone's favorite joke. The fact is that Cuba's character is comedy food for the people who watch the football matches.
