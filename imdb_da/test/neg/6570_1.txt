When I first saw it 9 years ago when I was 9. I thought it stunk. I'm 18 now and I still think it stinks. I don't mean any special effects or anything, it was boring and a little anti-climatic. My cousin saw at once, and George Takai (Sulu) kept talking about how much better, but they continued to cut the budget. It would have been a fantastic episode, but it was a horrible movie.
