Some of the secondary actors try, really hard. And the camera pictures in the desert are quite lovely. Otherwise, this movie is terrible. <br /> <br /> William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. He is also a psychopath, a man who literally comes from a mental institution. Is the point of this movie that amateur writers are psychopaths? Harvey will do everything to get his script read and transformed into a movie, even if it means taking a movie crew hostage. Do amateur screenwriters ... grovel? Maybe they do. <br /> <br /> The movie setup is too long. We do not come to the point of history until we go well into the other half. The first half darts and flashes among different characters. <br /> <br /> "Shoot or get shot" is adorned as a comedy, but I didn't find it fun. Dialogue contains no subtitle. None of the signs are credible as real people. They are all stick figures that perform "action" in a way reminiscent of cartoon characters. In fact, the movie is basically a cartoon for adults: silly, inane, birdbrained. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some actors are in this movie. They need the money or the exposure. But what do insiders Shatner and Harry Hamlin do here? Maybe Shatner wants more comedy roles. Is that the best thing he can do? Is Hamlin Desperate for Money? He used to be a respected actress. What happened? <br /> <br /> Although history must be satire, it comes across more like a laydown of amateur writers. Maybe it wasn't the intention. But it is certainly how the film can be interpreted. As such, the script was very, very badly written.
