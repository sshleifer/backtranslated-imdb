If you haven't seen the first one, at least you need to know someone who has and you need to know it was painful to sit through. There was just nothing good to say about it at all. So what's different about the other? Why bother making a sequel to a movie that was miserable? This does not take seriously. It knows that it was made for television and does not try to impress with great or serious dialogue. There are moments where it tries to become "serious" or "intense", but these moments are so corny you have to laugh. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, some elements of Uwe Boll are gone and a hint that this came from a video game (except the title of course). Don't go into this movie expecting something worth mentioning your friends unless they are in camp, lame zombie movies or are interested in making a drinking game out of this movie. Take two shots when Ed Quinn's character mentions his dead brother! Take a shot when a ball would have been better in a zombie head instead of pumping three in the chest! etc etc
