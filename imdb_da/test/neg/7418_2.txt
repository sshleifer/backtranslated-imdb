The Untold ... Is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story really looks like original, but it was very bestowed on the screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, ended with this shot. But hey he made a lot of low cost movies ... you have to pay the bills, do you know that? Kidding. Lance is a great actor, but he ended up with this bunch of stupid actors. Seriously, Andrea Roth was just getting a nudity scene and other actors ... yes they were just there. There was constantly a fake fade in editing, and that makes me sick! It was the most horrible move that just keeps going and it really makes you angry. It was also very predictable, boring and slow. It has a bizarre pace that just goes ... wrong. <br /> <br /> Can't say more ... don't rent it or buy it. You can see it if you are on TV.
