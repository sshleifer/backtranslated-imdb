MGM tried to mate and get young men with the Divine One to give them exposure and try them as senior men. Gable and Garbo had chemistry in SUSAN LENOX, but it was a miserable movie. Here in INSPIRATION there is no chemology at all between Garbo and Robert Montgomery, and the manuscript is also poor. What did they think? The modern, fast-paced, clever-smashing creepy Montgomery and the long-standing Garbo? It's a story like CAMILLE. Young students fall to the world's woman and are rejected by learning her past, rejecting her, taking her back, rejecting her .... you get the picture. Garbo is completely credible as a top Parisian artist model and at home, though bored, with her life at the top of society among her artistic friends and their loose morals. Suddenly, she is fascinated by this innocent. She finally gives her life to him and sinks into poverty, only to be saved by him and set up in a separate house. Ironically, he intends to marry and keep her on the side - so much for his pure moral ethics earlier. The scenes are incredibly boring and boring, and nothing happens much. Only Marjorie Rambeau as Lulu is able to inject life into the case with such lines as "unfortunately have weak women strong appetite" and "Odette, where is your sting?" Only for Garbo fans.
