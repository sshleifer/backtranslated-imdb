When, when, will Hollyweird write a decent movie based on computers? I can't believe people actually think this movie is a credible story. No computer operating system could ever survive the kind of annoying scrolling interface. It may look good on a movie screen, but if you actually tried to use it for a long time, you would go nuts. <br /> <br /> As for "tracking", people like it could simply not do that. Network security alone would prevent it from happening. The key figure was highly ridiculous. <br /> <br /> With regard to the software that was apparently installed, no system administrator could allow such a critical piece of software to be installed on a production system until it has been tested, tested and tested again on a sand-bagged system. <br /> <br /> But probably the worst part of the movie was the "virus". There is no way that a virus that works on an operating system will work on any other system. And for a virus that could take a mainframe is a few seconds, it just begs faith. There is no way that an open remote would have the necessary superuser access that would allow deletion of system files. <br /> <br /> I could go on but I can't be bothered. <br /> <br /> A porn has a better thought out plot to this pile of waste.
