Let's get things right. I was brought up Catholic and in a very religious family and spent so much time in church and talked to priests as at home. It was useful for two things: To make a convinced atheist out of me and give me deep insight into the church and its dogmas. And I say: If a Catholic priest testifies to a murder and clearly sees the killer's face, he can report it to the police even if the killer has confessed him afterwards. He can't reveal what he's told in acquaintance, but he can talk about everything he sees outside of it, and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. So here we have a movie completely persistent on a lie. And another lie is that there is no absolution for murder. According to the Catholic Church, there is absolution for every sin as long as there is sincere repentance. So far, this is the biggest plot hole in this weak thriller. As people often say, this movie would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates had changed roles. Of course, Hoskins is well suited to playing gangsters (I will never regret that he lost Al Capone in favor of one of De Niro's weakest performances in "The Untouchables") and Bates' features would have been perfect as the pastor with a gray one. ahead of time. But over it, I think the movie would have been much better, had the reality Ulster-native Liam Neeson (then best known to the large audience) played Mickey Rourke's role. Not only his face is perfect for playing tormented characters, but he would make us believe in the character as right, something Rourke cannot do. Back in the 80s, Rourke was not a bad actor (afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his appearance), but he was one of the artists like Brad Dourif who is as good as the director he works with. And as a former IRA terrorist, Rourke's trades come more like a pimp. Sad to believe that this movie was made only three to six years later (when Neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with Sam Raimis pleasant "Darkman" and superstardom in 1993 with "Schindler's List" while Rourke was largely by Liam and Mickey could Have changed parts for greater benefit (Rourke would have been effective in Docherty's support role, but just can't carry this movie as a leader). Yet another missed opportunity and another movie with the potential to be a classic became the instant forgotten ticket Ironically, the often criticized score (by the underrated composer Bill Conti) worked for me, I didn't find it too melodramatic, but appropriately gritty and beautiful, reminding me of Howard Shore's score for "The Lambs Silence." Here's Mike Hodge's talent, who made "Get Carter", yes, but don't forget he's a mastermind behind "Flash Gordon" so well ... It looks like the movie was massacred in cutting (it shows that some parts are really h naked and confusing, and others just do not glue) and a director cut complains about seeing the light. OK, but I seriously doubt that it will make it a good movie, as we still have the bad casting and the false premise there. 10.4.
