Woof! It's pretty boring, and they might as well have shot it in black and white. It was so colorless. The movie starts with rolling text explaining cryogenics, asking if God or Satan is behind. There are some protests outside a cryogenics lab. Some people rob a bank and many of the robbers and guards are shot. The father of one of the robbers (I think) makes sure his son is frozen. There is a lot of jumping around in the beginning from scene to scene that introduces characters without us knowing how they relate. <br /> <br /> There is a power outage and the cannists containing the frozen people are hit by lightning strikes and they appear like zombies. They all have silver mylar-like suits, and their skin is dark green and curly (no idea why they look so bad - they clearly don't freeze their appearance) and they have silver eyes. They walk around and kill people, sometimes lurching like zombies, sometimes moving like normal people. Linda Blair stops showing up every once in a while, for which purpose I am not entirely sure. I think her character works in the cryogenics lobe, but she is not very important to the plot and her role is very small. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with some freezing frames with text texts that tell us what happened to the characters next, which is pretty stupid.
