I'm sorry, but I can't agree that this was a good movie. Yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and I have to say the story sucked big-time. How in the world managed to clear some of these plot holes past the critics. Better story and I would have given it a higher voice, but I was impossible to do it and still be able to live with myself. I've always been a fan of scary movies, and the previews had really fooled me. All the scary scenes were shown in the previews. And why did the family being killed continue to haunt the house? Why did the father come back again? Why did he decide to kill in the first place? Why were the children the only ones to see the ghosts first? For many questions, not enough answers. If I could have given it a zero, I would have it.
