Northanger Abbey is not my favorite Jane Austen novel, but it has its charm. This movie doesn't. It has some of the same character names as the book, but the story is drastically changed, and the cutest man in the whole Austen cannon (unless Emma's Knightley is proud of) is designed like a heartless and mercenary insect. One or two wholly foreign characters are introduced and a palpable air of corseted perversion hangs all over. I was so disappointed when I first saw it on its release in 1986; Even today, it is high on the list of films that dispute the books on which they are based. Even Robert Hardy fans should give this a wide berth. It has nothing, and I mean N-O-T-H-I-N-G, to recommend it.
