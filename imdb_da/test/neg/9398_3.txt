Diane Lane is beautiful and sexy, and Tuscany is beautiful, but this movie is no better than mediocre and it is generous. The storyline is grafted on a travel note and remains thoroughly involved. <br /> <br /> Seen (let's say) a suburb of Newark, the plot would be considered ridiculous. All that saves the movie is the Tuscan landscape and occasional scenes in Florence and Positano, and a movie of the sunset in slow sunshine would have served better to show what it certainly is one of the most beautiful places in the world.
