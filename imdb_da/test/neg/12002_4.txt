I couldn't help but look at the time every 5 to 10 minutes because I found this movie a total move. Childish humor, cheap set set, cheap look, a plot that makes "legal blonde" look like "the usual suspects" and so many coincidences that I can now officially say that Robert Rodriguez had brain surgery somewhere after 1996. the only thing he left as his trademark is some cool camera movements, but there is where it ends. OK, so the guy decided to do something new for a change, a children's spy movie. Well, if I was 12, I would feel offended. The best thing about this movie is the amazing Carla Gugino who just stole all the scenes she was in. Unfortunately, there were not many. 4.10
