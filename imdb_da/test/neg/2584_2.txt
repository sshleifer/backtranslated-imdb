It is clearly a French movie. It is about a young group of idealistic / revolutionary / anarchist people. It moves very slowly. Long takes. LOngs close-ups. One minute or more dedicated to an attempt to turn a tube full of hash / opium. A long take on how a group overturns a car and burns it. It's a black and white movie. The subtitles were white, so about a third of the time they were unreadable. (Why do they do this?) I went out after approx. one hour and three quarters when it became clear that this picture was not moving slowly. I wasn't the first to go out. It was the first time I went out of a picture for my long life. (Well, maybe the other one.)
