I would give this movie a zero if I could. How someone could judge it something higher is beyond me. Until I saw Rollerball, this was my choice for the worst movie ever from a big studio with a real budget (claiming Mangler 2 or Leprechaun in the Hood as the worst ever doesn't say very much, it's supposed to be bad) <br /> <br /> Tim Curry's mother must have needed surgery or something for him to accept this non-sensual garbage. I'm really not sure what happened here. The novel was great, the director Frank Marshall had a solid track record with Alive and Arachnophobia (perhaps they should have changed the title to 'Africa'), the cast was good and the budget was there. You would think someone would have bothered reading the script. <br /> <br /> You would be better off seeing Battlefield: Earth again than wasting your time. Congo longs for you to return MST3K
