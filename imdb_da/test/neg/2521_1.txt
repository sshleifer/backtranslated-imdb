It's hard to criticize a movie titled "Deathbed: The Bed That Eats" and involves a ghost player caught behind a 2-way painting he drew and a bed that snores and ?? If I am not mistaken, masturbate. (Now it comes back to its human companions!) In addition, it is foamed (in orange, for whatever reason) to absorb apples lying on the surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and of course humans. Again, suffice it to say, it doesn't expect too much when you see what I'm guessing is stomach acid? the final remnants of something that orange needles take ?? only dissolve certain things. It will drink the wine, but the bottle is okay and it will eat away at the chicken leg, but the shovel is just fine. Heck, the bed even replaces unused containers. Hilariously, at some point it down Pepto-Bismol. I had to laugh at one. I don't think they really wanted you to take any of this seriously. It's low budget and it's extremely easy to see where they cut costs and save money money. I thought, in a world where there can be a killer 'Lift' and a 'Blood Beach', this 'Deathbed' can be entertaining to watch. For reasons of cost, 90% of the movie is voice-over, no one screams or shows extremely low signs of scared / confused why a bed would attack (I can think of one and I was never one of those children who jumped on the bed) and you will have to suspend your unbelief outside of faith. (A victim loses all flesh on his hands and hardly says "ow.") Only one scene that went too long was tense? A woman only tries to crawl away to be pulled back using a sheet. Where are MST3k guys?
