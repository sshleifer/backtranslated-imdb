I think I saw a heavily edited version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected - based on the other reviews I've heard. Other than 1 is written by the same person who wrote the original "Emmanuelle" (1974), Emmanuelle Arsan, 2. The protagonist is a sexual free spirit, and 3. is set in Asia's exotic location, "Laure" does not have it the same flair as its predecessor. br /> <br /> I just found this movie too talky with philosophical topics that I'm really not interested in. the voyeuristic, open relationship between Laure and Nick, "I'm just happy with what brings her pleasure" ... something like that. I can't relate to this mentality, and the movie / characters don't shed any light. <br /> <br /> The other half to find the Mara tribe just seemed like a completely separate movie. One that I didn't care about. At that time, I just hoped that it would turn into a porn so it would at least keep my interest. <br /> <br /> Maybe I just didn't get it. <br /> <br /> I leave it by.
