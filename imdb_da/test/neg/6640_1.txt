So I activated HBO, which I just thought it would have some quality movies, and I saw this. Carrot Top is so unfunny it's nauseating to see. I've seen unfunny movies before, but I think I find this so impossible to see because Carrot Top seems to think he's funny. Watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for 5-year-olds with crazy, over the top over-reactions filled with ultra-stupid jokes that only a 4-year-old would appreciate. <br /> <br /> What's amazing is how some other talented actors actually signed in for this project, such as Larry Miller and M Emmet Walsh. If you've ever seen Carrot Top's horrible MCI advertising (or what they were), this is more of the same, just worse. It's a slapstick party that's a waste of a high budget that could have done something, saved the homeless ... anything but this. I'm not sure it's at the bottom 50 at all times, but for the $ 10 million spent it's a disgrace.
