Thunderball and Never are two of the biggest box office misses and Never is a surprise farce from Empire Strikes Back hero Irvin Kershner. Klaus Maria Brandauer seems to steal the show when it is in the middle of the plot that Bond's mission turns more to Hollywood romp (Sometimes around when Basinger enters). What about Klaus Kinski? I still believe that the casting of Largo does or, as evidenced by both films, breaks the story. Worst of all, the attempt to resign the aging and very hard Connery, since the sex symbol was actually in the 60s. The 80s were a barren time for Bond flicks, but only for your eyes is a great title. At times, when I happen to need to waste some time in the holidays by watching this movie in the often-connected Bond festivals, I think the movie's best feature is its score, and I'm not soft '80s' jazz .
