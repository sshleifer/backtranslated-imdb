This story begins at the end! Then the film's open credits advise us. Unfortunately, this is not true as we are then treated at about 70 minutes by a typical B science fiction film from the 1950s. The story is boring; the plot is very weak and has clearly been filmed on a low budget, as was often the case these days. The story could have covered any situation where people take refuge in an isolated house and are threatened by someone outside. It just happened to be adapted to fit around a sci-fi story. Nature consisted of a few stones, shrubs and smoke. - Oh yes, there was also a pool of water. Someone had a rubber mask with a beak like a face, and it looked like feather. <br /> <br /> Written by Lou Rusoff, who wrote several sci-fi stories around the time including The She Creature and the Defeated World The movie was completed in a few days without giving actors time to develop their characters for better advantage. The low budget constraints also prevented this film from reaching its potential. It could have been a much better movie than it turned out. <br /> <br /> Mike Connors and Richard Denning got some life for the movie, but even they couldn't lift that movie into the category where one could say - 'I enjoyed the movie' Richard Denning's acting career began in 1937 He starred with Gregory Peck and Deborah Kerr in an affair to remember and later became more known on the television in the Hawaii Five-O series and The Flying Doctor series. Directed by Roger Corman, who has many films for his credit, both as director and producer. He has made some good movies and still does them. He became well known for his film orientation from the story of Edgar Allan Poe, who was often Vincent Vincent. He also made other low-budget films; some were good and entertaining for some reason, and most were much better than this. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. <br /> <br /> September 10, 2007 <br /> <br />
