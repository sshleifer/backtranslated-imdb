Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn Nightclub dancer named Rusty, who specializes in cheesecake Chorus revues; She manages to get to the front of a national fashion magazine, but her forthcoming success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) has beaten the boss Gene Kelly chomping. Terribly tired piece of Technicolor cotton candy, with unmemorable musical sketches (the two worst being irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s, with Hayworth depicting his own grandmother). Kelly dances as always, but works with false sincerity; when he is serious, he is insufficient, and for the rest of the time he flies on adrenaline. The scripture is a major issue, not even giving supportive players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden any good lines. * 1/2 from ****
