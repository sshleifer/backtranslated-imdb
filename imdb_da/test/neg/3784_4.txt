If Corky St. Claire in WAITING FOR GUFFMAN had instructed Blaine's citizens in a horror movie with comic undertones, the result would have been much like THE MILPITAS MONSTER. To be generous, this was the longest hour and twenty minute movie I've ever seen. To call the pace is to be good. Almost no one affiliated with this project has ever made another movie except for Ben Burtt, who made the truly admirable (considering the budget) special effects. He continued to make sound films like MUNICH and several other major budget projects. The story is by veteran voice-over actor Paul Frees, who probably donated his efforts. <br /> <br /> When you see the opening titles and see the Milpitas Unified School District listed as one of the manufacturers you know of for a long, strange trip. Pollution by dumping in Milpitas, California, becomes so toxic that it creates a monster. Remember that this is 1975, and ecology was a hot topic. Just a few years earlier, movie guests were treated at GODZILLA VS. SMOG MONSTER. <br /> <br /> So far so good. The monster is a winged creature at least fifty meters long and has the ability to tear the city apart. Instead, it steals garbage can. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the premise is the idea that this monster can prowl a small town and leave eight foot long footprints back but not be noticed by anyone. There is a nicely designed scene where it goes through the middle of the carnival at night, but by no means notices it. <br /> <br /> The only person who sees the monster for the final scenes is George, the city is full. The whole movie was hoping I was hoping that George would be torn down on camera, but that didn't happen. Drat. In fact, no one is killed. George is supposed to sacrifice himself to save Priscilla (he is tied to a helicopter to lure the creature - George smells worse than waste and the monster is attracted to the scent). The nominal leader is a group of high school students. There are beautiful Priscilla and her undisputed boyfriend and some "bad" boys who (surprise surprise) whisper in shape to help defeat the monster in the final stages. The monster is involved in four headsets. He is attacking a Browning-Ferris bin and leaving it next to an elevated highway, but no one observes. He goes through the carnival, again unnoticed. He tears up a building (fine miniatures), and no one sees him, but George. Then he attacks the college during a dance and grabs Priscilla and carries her out, just like a certain very tall monkey has done several times, most recently in late winter. <br /> <br /> There are plot ideas coming out of nowhere and being dropped. Local citizens picket at the town hall because they want their trash back. An elaborate secret weapon for tracking monsters is flown in by private jet, examined and forgotten. <br /> <br /> So why did I see it all? Because these people had so darned a lot of fun. I had the idea that the firefighters were firefighters, the businessmen were filmed in their own offices, Priscilla could live in the fortified house, and scenes of people in their yards could well have been in their own yards. <br /> <br /> They can't be great actors, but they are real people. No one is amazingly beautiful. In fact, I would estimate that four out of five adults on the screen wear glasses. As this is in the mid-seventies we see some really bad clothes and some of the men have awesomely bad facial hair. A dignitar who is being interviewed before a meeting at Ciry Hall has such a high tie and sports coat that you think he is about to play Marcellus in THE MUSIC MAN. <br /> <br /> And that made the movie two more stars. Zero for the story. Two points to the sometimes decent special effects. And two points that people in society actually came together and did it. They can actually say that they have performed in a movie; Despite lots of scene experience and work behind the scenes in live TV, I can't say that and I'm happy about them. Remember the great old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland? At some point someone would say, "Let's take a show! Aunt Edna has all the old clothes on the ceiling and we can use Uncle Ned's barn!" Then they would make 'neighborhood shows' with sets and costumes that would cost well in seven figures if they were duplicated today. <br /> <br /> It is the spirit that Milpita's good people had for this project and bless them for that.
