Director J.S. Cardone presents something a little scary and a little scary, but no more. A widowed mother Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) inherits a home in Pennsylvania mountains; so she takes her two daughters and moves into the scattered estate of what seems in the middle of the sky. But it is somewhere, somewhere in ninety some odd years ago, requiring a tragic mining life for a number of children forced to work in the dark and thank you. The area and especially the Tunny property seem to be haunted by the small little evil souls. The legend is that the screaming children come out into the moonlight to seek revenge; And you think better. Also in the cast: Ben Cross, Scout Taylor-Compton, Chloe Moretz, Julie Rogers and Geoffrey Lewis.
