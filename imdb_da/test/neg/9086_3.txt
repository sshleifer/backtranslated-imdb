Originally, the spiders were scheduled as a four-part series and it shows. I don't like series; they are typically ridiculous, awful and banal. This is no exception. In the first part of the spiders, 'The Golden Lake', a rich adventurer fades the plans of a gang of criminals - the spiders - to steal gold from the Incas. A silly love triangle follows with some cowboys and Indians action. Sensationalism and exotica of it did not tell me. <br /> <br /> You can legitimately track them from this two-part series to later, much better work. And the film production is better than in other series I've seen from this time, including 'Les Vampires' (1915). In spiders, the camera is not so static, and this movie is fast paced, fortunately. Dyeing and lighting are also appropriate. None of that is remarkable. It is almost unlikely how closely this series resembles Louis Feuillade's series; the criminal gang dressed and behaved like those in 'Les Vampires' - only the names and to a lesser extent the situations changed. <br /> <br /> For more comments on The Spiders series, see the Internet pages for it.
