It is extremely rare that I see a 1955 movie that I do not love. Noir, JDs, Sci-fi, Drive-Ins; I dig the most. Robert Aldrich is a director who has done a lot of excellent work, and most of this cast has good performances under their belt. So what went wrong? <br /> <br /> When I used to work in the Independent Film world, we used to talk about something called "actors". Actors are movies that cannot be downloaded to anyone other than other actors. Actors as "actors" because they are going to watch ACTing - that is, over-the-top melodrama. Actors love to get the chance to completely lose "give everything they have" and they get great satisfaction with seeing other actors do it. In many interviews with actors, they say, "He was a great instructor, he never disturbed me in any way." In fact, the opposite of good direction, because the whole POINT having an instructor on the set is to keep the actors from fooling themselves (as given the chance they will always do). <br /> <br /> Apparently Robert Aldrich forgot about this project. Or maybe he was sick. Or maybe he thought there was no hope of saving the script in the first place, so what was it? Whatever is here is an example of a lesser-known movie that is best forgotten. The signs gesticulate, pontificate and generally ham it all the way through. One thing I can say is realistic: it's set in Hollywood and everyone seems like their petty problems are the most important thing in the world. Doesn't make it fun to see, but it's realistic. What is not realistic is that a manufacturer who is so desperate to keep his star under contract will go out of his way to counteract him in almost every way possible - including having to engage in illegal activity. But this and other plot contradictions carry only the melodrama, which increases the possibility of twisting and shouting accusations. <br /> <br /> I managed to get to the end of this movie, making it no worse than a "3" out of 10 in my book. But why test your own endurance when there is so much else to rent?
