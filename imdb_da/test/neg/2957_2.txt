This movie is too long. I lost interest about an hour into history. Saratoga Trunk tells the story of Ingrid Bergman, the child of a prominent New Orleans man and his mistress. After her mother dies in Paris, Bergman returns to New Orleans to scandalize her father's "legitimate" family and extort them. She meets Gary Cooper, who also seeks revenge on the tycoons railway, who cheated his father out of his Texas country. She pulls him into his arrangements and the movie climaxes at a Saratoga resort. Far and boring, but worth seeing if you are a Bergman or Cooper fan. The Midget Cupidon provides the only bright spot in this chronic story.
