See, this movie is horrible ... "the plot" involves twins who are neglected by their self-absorbed parents and leave behind a number of nannies and babysitters, where all the children run away by being completely unpleasant. Finally, the children's engineer ex-convict Beverly D'Angelo to their new nanny, don't care why? And D'Angelo sees a TV talk show about selling children and decides she'll try to sell the twins ... and, okay, you won't know. It's all very unpleasant and not fun at all. In fact, the advertiser knocked out this movie before it came on the TV channel I was watching! Just don't waste a single moment in your life on this pile of complete waste, y'hear?
