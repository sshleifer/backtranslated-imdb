I saw the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death. So I jump forward all the way through the end. This movie should be the worst of all in the low budget sci-fi movie category so far. Bad play, cast, directions, Lara Craft custom imitation, story, plot, everything! Throughout the film, I think there are only 6 to 7 people in the entire cast, but only two of them started throughout the film. I was expecting something like Starship Trooper, but it was nothing close to it. I was fooled by the movie title and the picture on the DVD cover. Don't waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. Come to think of what I'm wondering, why do they even have to put bad movies like this?
