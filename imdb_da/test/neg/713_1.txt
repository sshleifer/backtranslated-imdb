This is not a movie. This is a collection of random pictures taken in a fascinating part of the world called over with a random text. The recordings are not that big, and the text is not that great either. The end product is tirelessly boring. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, there may be some entertainment value when the director makes a minor argument that this is a sci-fi movie. It is also fascinating to read about the exceptional risks and hardships that the crew was gathering this recording. Too bad it is nonsense. But I think "Making of Fata Morgana" would be a fascinating movie, black-like "Ed Wood" was.
