This movie gives new meaning to the term "uneven", giving us a few exciting characterizations set off by an uncanny plot based on a few well-placed stingers to deliver the bulk of the tension. <br /> <br /> The plot relates to a group of men who have a secret that has caused a curse to be visited on them in the form of a ghostly female device that causes death. She can also seduce her sons. It is a sight to have all the remarkable veteran actors together in a movie, but unfortunately they are not very convincing, especially the scene where Melvyn Douglas goes out the deep end begging the others to listen to him. It's no shock, as the actors who play the same characters in their youth are horrible, especially the giggles Ricky. They deliver the worst "ugly" cycle I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The movie has a few sparse graces, namely Dick Smith's great ghost makeup (though misplaced they are in this movie), and Alice's fascinating performance as Alma / Eva. I have never read the novel that this movie was taken off, but I intend to read some of the other reviews on this page. You don't have to read the book to realize that this is just a shadow of the original story. There is a good story here, but it seems to be lost somewhere in the middle of an exhibition that shows the men having nightmares over and over and making unrestricted references to the secret they all share. <br /> <br /> As it stands, it looks as if there were about half an hour of recordings removed from this print, especially near climax. After all ... how is it that Fred Astaire manages to mount an excavation of the pond so quickly? What does Gregory Bate and the child have to do with Eva? And while we're in it ... what the hell was she anyway? Why did she get out of the car because the device disappears? If it was a little, how could it have sex with two men and not make them know? <br /> <br /> These and other issues will never be answered, at least not of this movie. Unless some recovered footage is discovered somewhere, it will probably remain a curiosity with some oars of makeup, bizarre sex scenes and nudity and a few attractive performances.
