Amnesiac women who remove their clothes on the drop of a hat (or a blouse?) Are about the only stand-out points in a movie that is otherwise slow and futile. Although history's basic achievement provides a wealth of opportunities, they are never developed to any satisfactory degree and the exhibition is almost non-existent. Much of the film is just wandering through the corridors of a multi-store clinic / hospital. The overall effect is gloomy and sterile, a la THX-1138.
