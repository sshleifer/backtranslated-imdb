Oh, I'd better where to start ... First of all; This show is just another stupid American non-fun so-called comedy that has pathetic plays and very bad humor. The American way of living on the track makes it all the worse. How am I going to hear laughter, but nothing funny happens? Absolutely stupid, eh? This show is only for those American people who have never ever heard that there are much more fun, better and more precious comedies - not just in the UK, but also in America (The Simpsons for example). I simply can't understand what's so good about "Reba" that it has lasted a long time on television. It has nothing new to offer, it underestimates the (possible) viewers in so many ways, and that is simply not fun. I could have lived with the fact that there are such bad shows as "Reba", but why the hell they had to run this in Finland. If I see a few seconds of this horrible show, the rest of the day is ruined for me. Take my word and believe me - this show sugar ass even more than these kinds of American "comedies" usually do. This is simply terrible. Do yourself a favour; Never see this peace of sh * t. <br /> <br /> I leave the comment for those who now better this language. Thank you for your (possible) interest.
