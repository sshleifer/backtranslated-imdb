"Paranormal State" is an interesting show for most paranormal believers. I enjoy seeing what the "team" has to say and what they "find," but I know that the whole show along with its builds and stories is completely created. They go to real haunted places and I suppose they are talking to actual witnesses. I feel normal when I see that I don't see non-fiction, but a real movie that is contradictory to reality. Personally, I would not recommend or recommend anyone to see this show unless you are a basic scary search engine. <br /> <br /> Interesting show. Stick to "Ghost Hunters"
