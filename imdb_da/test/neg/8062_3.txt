Like everyone else who bought this, I was chopped by "20 pieces of extreme gore" and "banned in 20 countries" or what it says in the box. I have to admit I'm a big gore fan and I'm always amazed when movies can put it on thick and convincingly to do so. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are some of the best in the industry. They revolutionized makeup effects in the 80s. Today you do not need them since everything is done on the computer. But computers cannot compare with the visual wizard that these three men could evoke. But I go down. <br /> <br /> Watch amazing gory movies like Fulci's Gates to Hell or even Savinis crowning performance, Friday the 13th chapter, you can appreciate everything about making a fantastic gory movie . You can't tell the difference between reality and magic. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine another reason why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox, but the one that seems to be almighty in this movie. If that is why you are looking for this movie, you are wasting your money. As many other reviewers have noted, most of Gore is a demand. You can't see the torture, or the bloodshed as it happens, you see what it looks like the afterwords. <br /> <br /> Gore? Well, it is here, but not as much as one would hope or expect. A man becomes neutered and a woman is hanged by her breasts, but other than the two scenes, and one involving a scalping; There is nothing much else about this movie. The actors' scenes even in the said three are still rather tame compared to what you had hoped for. Maybe it's just me and my sick and winding experience in the horror and gore genre, but I expected a little more. Call me sick or twisted, but isn't that the only reason people watch this movie in the first place? I honestly have bored me in many places. <br /> <br /> Cannibal Ferox is just another movie trying to exploit a craze for a superior movie. While the cannibal holocaust isn't exactly a good movie, it's much better than this tripe. If you go out of your way to buy this for $ 20.00, you will feel cheated. <br /> <br /> 3/10
