I want to dispense with the obvious review of factual inaccuracies. They are too many to mention. A much shorter list would be what they got right. 1. Dude by the name of Noah. 2. Sheet with animals on it. <br /> <br /> If you want a much more accurate depiction of Noah's Ark and the destruction of Sodom, hire "The Bible" (1966). It depicts the history of creation through Abraham, who tries to sacrifice his son, Isaac. It's a much better movie, and it may be that the abomination called "Noah's Ark" (1999) drove you to seek just such a movie. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I really couldn't forget watching the whole movie. From reading other comments, I can see that even the atheists found it grossly incorrect. As a Christian, it was unacceptable to me. Maybe the worst movie ever made. Not really the point of this movie, except perhaps showing their sub-pair of computer animation. <br /> <br /> Was it a complete waste? Maybe not. God can use evil to work well. <br /> <br /> Romans 8:28 says, [28] And we know that everything works together for the good of those who love God, to those who are called for his purpose. <br /> <br /> Genesis 50 says, [20] But as for you, you thought evil against me; But God meant it to the benefit of providing, as it is today, to save many people alive. In the second example, Joseph's brothers meant to kill him, but God turned their evil into a very good god. He may have done the same with this movie. People were so amazed at the lack of biblical foundations that they probably broke out the dusty old Bible and read the story for themselves. To find out about Lot and Sodom, they should go right up to Genesis 19 before God destroys Sodom and Gomorrah. Then they read almost half of Genesis so they might end. The next book is Exodus, on which the film "The Ten Commandments" was based (and much more precisely). If they have watched that movie, Exodus becomes an easy read. So now they have read at least two whole books from the Bible just because they saw a pathetic film about Noah's Ark. I'm sure it actually happened to someone out there. God works in mysterious ways.
