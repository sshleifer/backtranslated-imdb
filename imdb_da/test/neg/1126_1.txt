OK ... this may include Spoilers ... but who really cares? Do not, if you appreciate seconds in your life, waste your time on this pile of waste. There is not a redeeming quality in this movie ... and I say it as a full fan of Vacation Series of movies. I LOVED the cousin Eddie's character from the other holiday movies ... but he only works well as a supporting sign. Do I owe Randy Quaid for the mistake of this movie? Not at all. I think he's a great actor ... but this movie lacks cohesion ... the pacing is off ... it's simply involuntary. And the actor who plays "Third" ... Jake Thomas ... was just awful, more likely due to a real lack of direction. I don't know why ... but his whole character scared me out. <br /> <br /> Some people say this is a horrible movie because Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo are not in it ... it has nothing to do with it. The script, director, acting ... special effects ... everything is a train wreck. With orphans. And kittens. Oh ... and the train also ran over some old people. <br /> <br /> Whatever you do, stay away from this filth! I call it bad because it slips the name of Vacation Franchise.
