SPOILER !! Terrible camera work, horrible writing, non-existent plot and many plot wholes. Wonderful plays! Except for Julia Roberts. Who badly plays a person who offsets Julia Roberts badly. Catherine Zeta Jones is adorable in this movie. <br /> <br /> During the movie, we zoom repeatedly on each of the twelve (!) characters. Twelve are too many, even for a classic like 12 Angry Men. And the problem is that when we are all in the same room, we are boring dullly on the characters doing the same thing. <br /> <br /> Yep, Clooney eats. Yep, Pitt eats. Yep, "the Jew" eats. Yes, nerd eats. Yep, the bodybuilder eats. Yep, Mr. Sensitive eating. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep - Yep. Yep. Phew! This happens at least three times in the movie. Yes, they are all in cars, bored. Yes, they are all arrested, scared. Yes, they are all led out of a prison, depressed. <br /> <br /> But it was not until I was home that I realized how badly they had "got" me on this one. This is a hoist movie, right? That was what I went to see, right? But when I went in and put my car keys in the shifting pot, I only understood: NO WAS ACTUALLY PROUD IN THIS MOVIE! It is true. It's a heist movie where nothing is stolen. Oh, they are trying. They go to try to steal some boring document or something from a guy's house (anything) and it turns out that it has already been stolen. 20 minutes of my life, wasted. Then they try to steal some eggs from a museum (YAWN!), And they screw it up and are arrested. <br /> <br /> Then we see how an adventure French guy stole the egg even before they did, and we get all the joy of "Entrapment", except this time the person in the tight cat dress dancing about them fake lasers, a ... a nasty lean French guy. Um. <br /> <br /> But it turns out he doesn't actually steal the egg either. In fact, our hero stole the egg, ever since, in another movie completely, which would have been a great movie to see if they had made that movie. <br /> <br /> Instead, we see a 30-second clip in black and white about how they robbed some college students of their backpack. You've heard me ... the bold caper, the ultimate heist - building this 2 and a half hour of dull crap - is stealing a backpack from a college student by creatively entering a baseball match and distracts him and replaces his backpack with an identical backpack? What?? <br /> <br /> Ugh. I tell you it was so bad I didn't even understand how bad it was - just how badly I was robbed - until I got home.
