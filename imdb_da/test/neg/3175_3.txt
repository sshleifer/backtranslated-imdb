For me, this is not a good TV show, animated or otherwise. However, it is annoying for nth degree.there are some reasons for this, in no particular order. First, the intro to one of the most pointless, and annoying characters ever, Batmite.this character serves no purpose for the show, no matter what it is. But it is intended as comical relief, but it does not work that way. Sometimes it seemed Joker.I was really ridiculous to have his character loose with the ridiculous laugh after almost every sentence.talk if repetitive.this gets old really fast .. also do not think it had the right actor to vote character. it just doesn't sound like joker should sound.last, they made Robin look like a complete dork.other than these issues, the show is not that bad.but these are big enough issues to drastically lower the equality factor.for me "the new adventures of Batman "a 3/10 at best.
