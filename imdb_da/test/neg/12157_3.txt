I waited for this movie for a while. In the first day in the air in Turkey I looked at it. It was quite a disappointment to me. I was planning to watch a historical movie, but one on the screen was a fictional one. First of all, the main character of the film was Cengiz Han, the great conquest portrayed as a soft, calm, even a loser. You can't feel the power in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created has conquered (even more) the world by in those years. To do so, Cengiz first unites the Asian tribes. But in the movie, this loser man in a scene is poor-only man, and in the second scene he is commanding armies. War scenes were incredible week. In the final battle, the Mongolian rider used double swords on their sides and cut the enemy. :) As consequences, laughs me and my friends just by those scenes. Mongolian Army Mongol Archery Rider You can't see it in the movie. Another bad thing was the use of amazing elements in the movie. I do not want to enter the scenes that were portrayed Cengiz as a prophet. We can say in the integrity of the movie, that is acceptable. But the scenes when the old monk saw the future and went to find the wife of Cengiz Khan after Cengiz gave him a mission is really fun. When the monk died in the desert, Cengiz's wife feels this dead and she finds the body on the continent. We're talking about Asia ?? Again we laughed. There are many more things to say, but I do not feel that this movie is worth talking to.
