I can't believe I actually sat through the whole movie. A friend rented it because the jacket did well. In the defense, the jacket was correct; there was a supposed haunted room that someone slept in the night. From the jacket it sounds like it was on par with Freddy, Jason or maybe "The Shining". It couldn't be further from the truth. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of minimalist and / or surreal movies, you can enjoy it. If you're looking for a good scary movie or a couple of tensions, hire Jason vs. Freddy IV - you'll have a much better evening.
