The movie was half over before I managed to figure out what was going on. It's a dog's breakfast with a movie about four family Thanksgiving dinners. The cliches and stereotypes tumble over each other. When it is over ten hours later --- well, it seems like ten hours --- you're amazing what it was all about. I do not want to see a movie about table setting. There is plenty of it in my own family. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me indigestion.
