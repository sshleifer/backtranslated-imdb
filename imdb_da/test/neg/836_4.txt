Without a doubt, the smallest among the spaghetti westerners, I have seen lately: basically, a low-brow rip-off of Leone's "GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY" (1966) with three different characters leaving each other (and occasionally forming shaky alliances) in their search for hidden gold. Leonard Maltin has rated it a BOMB; Although it is harmless enough, it is also routine, and the three main roles are stereotypes, that is, uninteresting. Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee with ideas that his shipment is transported by train; Gilbert Roland is the "legendary" but aging Mexican bandit (his frequent expiry to Spanish when it is tense, is quite corny!) Apparently still irresistible to women; George Hilton as an enigmatic bounty hunter is trying too hard to imitate Clint Eastwood's husband with no name figure. Director Castellari - as I looked at the Italian B-movie retrospective, held during the 2004 Venice Film Festival, where he came out as the most pompous of the film movie directors present! - shows a little true feeling for the Western (due to two overall Franco Nero bets in the genre, I commissioned his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976] ... I keep my fingers crossed now!) and the movie's tongue-in-cheek The approach is just as regrettable.
