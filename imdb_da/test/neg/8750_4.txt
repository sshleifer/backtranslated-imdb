For all its many mistakes, I tend to be charitable to "Thing". There is a nugget of an interesting, eerie, claustrophobic Hitchcock style story here. Put this in the hands of a writer like Theodore Sturgeon or (if you prefer British perspective) Robert Bloch or the guy who wrote "Triple Day" and you may have had an unpleasant, disturbing little ghost story that was the best thing in a book anthology of horror and tension stories. But someone chose to tell this story as a movie of their own length and a cheap, 2nd rate on it, and then most of the potential is wasted. A story like this really needs a voice like Sturgeon to produce interesting character characters in a better light. His classic story "The -widget-, the -wadget- and Boff" is an example of how he can gather an isolated group of "ordinary" characters and in the space of 40 pages can make them the most entertaining, sympathetic and fascinating people you've ever met. A good author can, with a few select words, make the reader "see" some of the most vibrant and memorable events ever touching his emotions. <br /> <br /> Instead, we get a movie where some of the most annoying and unlikeable characters ever made are lumpy and made to interact in the convincing "Where did it come from?" moments that are just there. (The blonde psychic girl states that "You are all evil and I hope you are destroyed!"). We get the lead pacing and slow motion blocking and boring sets and stiff actors. I blame the director for the 'rigid and superficial' part. These are all 3rd grade character actors who never made the big time, but they are also 'real' actors, and a good instructor could have gotten better ideas out of them. We become inevitable for lesbian overtones that make the captive dissatisfied and exploited without providing any kind of payout. (If I want to get my basics exploited and feel guilty of it, I'd like to do it with things that are staged better than this). And we come over an hour with ghastly construction diffused in about 35 seconds in one of the worst anti-climaxes I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Good things about "Thing"? Um, well ... some of the nearby shots of warlock head silent conductor its directives were pretty effective. The miserable and sharp widow rang true to life (though I wanted to put a sock in my mouth). The first scene, in which the big "simple" ranch hand is silent on the oil-bearing cowboy and kills him, had a bit of shock value because the plot had taken it to create the great guy as a rather sympathetic character. And, as I said earlier, the idea of ​​a passionate force of the past that makes the members of an isolated society against each other is a good one and can hold interest far beyond the real merit of a poor performance. <br /> <br /> As it certainly is. <br /> <br /> But as I said, I tend to be charitable because the director probably worked under a penurious budget, breakneck time constraints and the best actors he could find for the money. Heaven knows how future generations will judge supple crap like "The Cave", "Wrong Turn" or remake of "House of Wax" 40 years from now. I hope they are beneficial to our own tastes to support our generations of waste film stores.
