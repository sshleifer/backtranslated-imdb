Drug runner Archie Moses introduces his friend Rock Keats to his chief drug kingpin Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually an undercover cop. During the bust at Colton's factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in his head. He survives the wound and later arrests Moses. Dodging Colton's hired assassin, the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive. Adam Sandler's films are usually a hit-and-miss affair, with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone. This one is not as stupid as his other movie, but still cannot overcome a lazy script. The direction is incredibly patchy, with fast action sequences that allow for slow comic exchanges between Sandler & Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes ?? flying a plane without engines, a car hunting at night through a forest ?? is completely absurdly constructed. The actor is the standard for this genre, with Sandler & Wayans making a good pairing. In short, the movie is stupid but fun to watch. <br /> <br /> Degree: C + Review by M. K. Geist
