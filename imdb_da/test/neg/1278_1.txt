Are you the living one? OK I think I'm an intelligent, educated, liberal, and really into movies. I really like and have a good sense of humor. I was under the impression it was a gloomy painful comedy. They were paid to do this, gasoline was used, electricity burned, food was consumed, put the building ........ why? I blame the current state of the world on this movie, and I will even include all the people who are associated with it. We are all guilty and deserve what comes. It's not fun, not much happens, everyone thinks it's bored or boring. There are no conversations, communication is minimal. There is no reason as far as I am aware. In fact, I just lost 89 points a few minutes in my life. I will never get that time back. The only message I've got away with is maybe life is too short to sit and watch movies of people who don't do much ...... and then you die!
