(Spoilers) <br /> <br /> Oh, it's based on Moby Dick. Completely obsessed and it destroys him. It's a total foolishness. The movie starts quite well, but at the end of the movie everyone else is destroyed and the mind of the main star is empty. <br /> <br /> The supposed half-sister is never convincing. Some very bad lighting effects. Music is interesting. But a little bit different. It took me over a month to finally finish the darn thing. I suppose if you like being John Malkovich, you like it here. But where as BJM was a great movie that I just didn't want to see again, Pola X is a movie I just hate to hell. The only possible excitement in the movie is the gratuitous incest sexual scene at the end of the movie. (Hopefully you also don't think of Catherine.) <br /> <br /> This movie is seriously boring, depressing and badly directed. Not highly recommended. If you like French movies. (go see Crimson Rivers instead) <br /> <br /> 4/10 <br /> <br /> Quality: 5/10 Entertainment: 1/10 Replayable: 0/10
