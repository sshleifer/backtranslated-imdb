Volcano is set in Los Angeles, where a minor earthquake is hit, O.E.M. Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to end his holiday card and enter when he sees that everything is okay, but then runs out to the epicenter of the earthquake, where seven underground workers have been killed by a fire or intense heat of a kind of. Mike is not sure what to think so he brings the geologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche) in order to try to explain things. Unfortunately, an enormous underground river of molten lava has been released after the earthquake and eruptions at La Brea Tar Pits lava, which stretches into the city streets, scramble everything it touches into flames. Mike, his men and the emergency services have cut out their work and are trying to stop the lava flow and save as many lives as possible ... Directed by Mick Jackson, that was the second major budget catastrophe flicking on the idea of ​​a volcano in 1997 with Dante's Peak (1997), released just two months before Volcano was & while Dante's peak is hardly any kind of masterpiece at least, is a little better and more plausible than the volcano. The script here is totally nonsense and is not at all based on reality, underground lava values ​​that appear to appear and disappear just as quickly, different characters standing inches from a low river but not hit by the heat (when that guy is on the train the metal seats around him begins to melt, but he remains perfectly fine as far as I know that human skin is not as heat-resistant as metal, is it?) and it is constantly happening that helicopters flying are ash clouds real would it be impossible) , a single block at the end of a street stops the floating lava (what about the other streets and other directions?), being able to blow a perfect ditch into a street and then blow up a large building to make a massive dam, and when Kelly sees lava heading for her car, she comes out like everyone else, but then for some reason just stands and sees two firefighters being burned to death and waiting for her father to save her even though he stage has her legs got fire, despite the fact that all the concrete blocks are placed together to make a barrier in less than twenty minutes, the guy does such good work, not a molten lava manages to seep through and puts more than the massive building that falls on Tommy Lee & his daughter yet so both are fine afterwards. The character is also horrible, even though they were not as cliché as usual without any romance flourishing between Tommy Lee & Anne Heche & minimal city officer trying to close Tommy Lee & Anne Heche before the event marks them scaremongers. There are a couple of poorly written and sometimes embarrassing moral moments that Los Angeles pulls together, the black guy and the semi racist policeman who heat each other and at the end wish each other well and the little child in the end when he says' everybody looks alike Out 'are cringe worthy and are definitely a hamstring attempt and are trying to say what color we are, we are still people, and we can all get together in the time of crisis as it brings people together. Having said that I think the volcano is one of them so bad, it's good movie, it entertains and it moves along with a decent pace, but just don't expect anything due to reality or anything human drama either. <br /> <br /> I suppose a movie like the volcano can be seen as an update of a 70-disaster movie like The Poseidon Adventure (1972) or Earthquake (1974), but on a large budget with modern effects. Talk about the effects, they are okay, but no one stands out so much, and the set pieces are also surprisingly forgettable, sure there are some impressive explosions and a few OK low tide flowing through the Los Angeles effects, but little other things. In general, the volcano is not only very exciting, and while it is occasionally unintentionally fun and completely ridiculous, it does not work in the way the decision makers intended. With an assumed budget of approx. $ 90,000,000 it opened for just under $ 15,000,000 at the cashier's office, it looks great, and there's lots of fire, but nothing stands out & Volcano is a beautiful forgetful movie overall. Filmed in Los Angeles I think most of the places that are marked here were shot at their real-life places. The cast goes through the movements with a terrible dialogue and ridiculous set-pieces to fight, Tommy Lee Jones deserves better than this. Volcano is a bit of a disaster in both senses, it is a catastrophe theme movie that ended a bit with disaster itself. Appreciated it for a couple of unintentional laughs and the ridiculous of it all, but it's nothing big and I doubt I'll ever see it again.
