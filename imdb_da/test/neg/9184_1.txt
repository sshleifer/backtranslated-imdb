"Wagons East" is known as John Candy's last film when he died on the set. It's just what makes it so sad: Not only did Candy suffer a fatal heart attack, but it was on the set of such a curly film. Seriously, I don't know what they were thinking when they came up with this piece of shit, but the girl has no redeeming qualities. It's as if they took each unused script to stupid westerners and just mixed them together and filmed it. No wonder John Candy didn't want to make the movie; Perhaps his contractual participation was what made him in. Anyway, the point is that Candy did much better than this throughout his career. To be sure, he had already completed Michael Moore's "Canadian bacon", where the United States declares war on Canada. Just stick to the one and you can say that Candy ended his career honorably. As for Richard Lewis - who had previously co-starred with Candy in Eugene Levy's absurd but hilarious "Once Upon a Crime" - he did this piece of shit when he often appeared on "Countdown with Keith Olbermann" in recent years.
