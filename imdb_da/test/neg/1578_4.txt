After I began to look again at old Columbo movies, I thought they would all have the same voice from me (6). But apparently I am now beginning to see differences in the films. It happened in some just past episodes that showed some beautiful genius directions, and it turns out in this one but in the negative way. <br /> <br /> The movie was so boring that sometimes I found myself excited to be topping in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away. The management seems too pretentious. The scenes with the "oh-so-mature" neighbor girl are a misplace. And generally, lines and plot are weaker than the average episode. Then the scene where they debated whether to carpet the trumpeter (which was falsely accused of the murder), became scary, really stupid. <br /> <br /> However, some applause must be given to "prelude". In this episode, there is a lot of focus on how the killer tries to secure his alibi and hide evidence, etc. I really liked it. But unfortunately, no focus on how Columbo reveals all this. And the "evidence" that ultimately leaves Columbo victorious is the silliest ever. <br /> <br /> Rating: is between 4 and 5
