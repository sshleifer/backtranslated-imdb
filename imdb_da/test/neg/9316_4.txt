As long as you go into this movie with the understanding that it contains no historical fact, it is not bad. It is on par with Sam Raimi's "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys", as far as plot, action, humor and production values ​​are concerned. You can see the similarities on several points. However, most battle scenes are not so good, and the film suffers from it. Jack Palance commands the screen as well as ever, and at no time do you have the impression he gives anything less than his level best. Same for Oliver Reed. The problem is that their strong performance makes the square diamond Don Diamonts less than the star's acting skills seem even more awkward. The perennial bite player Cas Anvar was also very good and played a character much like Salmonius in the previously mentioned Hercules. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the low-budget swords and sorrows of the early 80's, you're likely to enjoy this show too. It's actually a shame that they attached the Marco Polo name to it. It really has nothing to do with Marco's life, as opposed to the expectations of most people who want to watch the movie.
