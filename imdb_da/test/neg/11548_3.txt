This unintentionally fun mid-80s movie is based on the premise that the sex bomb Donna Mills (in a most awful wardrobe throughout) is a neglected housewife looking for his sexy past as a cheerleader. She escapes her empty life by fantasizing about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she comes across, finally giving in to her fantasies and indulging in the side, even though everything she really wants is to regain the flames of passion with her boring husband James Brolin. There are many ridiculous aspects to this movie, Mills' first co-producing foray (later after her departure from Knots Landing, she found great success as a trashy television movie starring in most melodramas during most of 90's the eres - she usually played a sacrifice of some sort, clearly determined to wash the hands of the wonderful evil and entertaining conniver she played so long on Knots). The funniest are the drawn fantasy sequences, filmed as if they were supposed to be softcore (wind and smoke machines, backlighting, porn music), but since this is a network TV movie, the scenes are all very caste and ultimately not much sexy at all. The most entertaining (and bizarre) scene has the Mills take a ride on the wild side downtown among the nailed punks (complete with Robert Palmer soundtrack). <br /> <br /> Less ridiculous is the dreadful dialogue that carton characters are forced to express (seventh poor Cicely Tyson as the mandatory psychoanalyst or Veronica Cartwright as the mandatory best friend or even pre-Bab's James Brolin with the daily soap style of crushed fist anger.) <br /> <br /> Of course, as in all these kinds of movies, we learn that all problems can be solved through psychotherapy and then the movie just gets silly as we briefly examine the causes of mills. "shocking" behavior (as if it just might not be that she wants a good shag!) <br /> <br /> Vacuous.
