When this film was made in 1980, I was a teenager in the football stand playing as part of the audience. This was done at Mooseheart, Illinois. The capital letters that spelled out "MOOSEHEART" at the top of the stands were covered by a banner in the movie. The director would tell us to cheer highly on certain points as if a touchdown was being made. St. Charles Juvenile Correction Center is a real place less than 30 miles from Mooseheart, though I think it may be closed recently. During a scene, they show a black woman and a white man in the audience watching the game. Just below them you can see my sister Noel's head (she was 11 at the time). In the VHS version I can only see the top of her head, but when I saw it on television in 1981 I could see her entire head and my sister Jacqui too. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie itself was ok for a television movie. Since there is already a description of the movie here, I don't have to repeat it. It is worth seeing at least once.
