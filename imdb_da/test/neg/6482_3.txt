Rollback remake of 1942's "The Major and the Minor", Jerry Lewis enters into the part that was originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately this anemic outing lacks much more than just Ginger. Lewis tries to pass a child on the train; he succeeds, but fraud leads to a series of comic and romantic confusions. Sidney Sheldon adapted the manuscript that ran into musical moments for Dean Martin (playing another one in his second banana stable) and an underground underground subplot. Diana Lynn, who played the evil teenager in the original movie, plays Lewis's love interest here. She is cute; Jerry is not. * 1/2 from ****
