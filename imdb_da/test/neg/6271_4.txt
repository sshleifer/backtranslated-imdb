One of my favorite "bum" actors, C. Tom Howell, stars in this weak remake of WOTW. He runs around a lot while a CGI-generated spider-like machine walks around and kills everyone. The budget for this was of course quite low. It was also one of the Asylum productions. Have you seen any of them? Yikes! I'm not sure why anyone would have done this while the big budget Spielberg version hit them at the box office. And if the truth is told, each version is not so hot. The George Pal version from the 1950s remains the best representation of H.G. Wells short story, primitive special effects and all. Maybe because Gene Barry was much more convincing in the lead than Howell or Tom Cruise.
