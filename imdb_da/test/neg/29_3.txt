Like 'Singin' in the rain, 'Cover Girl' has a trio of two guys and a girl. In 'Cover Girl' Phil Silvers (Genius) is the comic relief. He responds to Donald O'Connor's fun man's part in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain' it's Debbie Reynolds. This is where the comparison ends. "Singin 'in the Rain" is a classic American movie musical,' Cover Girl 'is mediocre incarnate. The story is not very complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a dancer in Danny MacGuire's night camp in Brooklyn. Rusty decides to participate in a Cover Girl competition sponsored by a wealthy publisher John Coudair who made a failed game for Rusty's grandmother many years ago. Coudair introduces Rusty to Broadway producer Noel Wheaton who makes her a star. Danny feels weak when Rusty begins to show up late for rehearsals at the night club and decides to shut down the club and go on the road entertaining the troops with his sidekick, Genius. At the last minute with Rusty at the altar with Noel, she understands the error in her ways and goes back to Danny. They live happily ever after. Gene Kelly has the least developed role in the movie. All we find out about him is that he owns a nightclub and is crazy about the law with rusty Coudair and Wheaton acting as obsessed teenagers against Rusty and Phil Silvers providing some thoroughly greasy but unfunny shtick. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene where she becomes full. This foreshadows what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will learn that she did not like Hollywood, pined away for a normal home life, which she could never reach, but eventually started drinking and ending with thoroughbred Alzheimer's during the last years of her life . <br /> Almost all songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful. Gene Kelly has only one really excellent dance number and it is the scene where he dances with his 'alter ego'. Previously, the trio has another number, which is a pale precursor to 'Make em Laugh' from 'Singin' in the Rain '. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way Rita Hayworth is put on a pedestal. A few decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their career would always try to find writings that showed their plays. They wanted to be known as 'actresses' and not 'pinup girls'. Unfortunately, Cover Girl is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.
