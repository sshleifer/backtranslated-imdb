I watched this movie for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and it was possibly one of the most boring, unfunny movies I had ever seen the accident. First of all, Matthew Modine is a terrible actor and destroyed most of the movie. Besides that, the plot is just too stupid. The only reason to check into this movie was due to Alec Baldwin, and his character was eliminated quite quickly. Unless you're a fan of Michelle Phiffer, you should probably avoid this movie like the plague. Many people can't praise this movie enough, but I just can't figure out what people find so great about it. If it were the black humor that makes this movie so great, then I think something can pass for comedy these days.
