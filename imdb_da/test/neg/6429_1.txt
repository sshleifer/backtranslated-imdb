What can you say about such a pathetic movie? <br /> <br /> - Very bad play! The main actress seems to know only one facial expression: fear mixed with weakness. Like a badly beaten dog ... The other actress (the one who plays the evil) looks like the female double of Ozzy Osbourne, with a horrible red wig. The other actors are so graceful that they are not even worth describing. <br /> <br /> - There is absolutely no plot. The story begins with possibilities, but nowhere does it go: we know nothing about the meaning of "11:11" and who Rayden really is, except the simple "she is evil" or "she is an apocalypse child" is not an explanation . We do not know why the parents have been killed, what danger is there and why Sara was chosen. As the film continues, we just see pseudo-scary scenes, with a bad music. Finally, the end does not tell you anything: we see only two options as if one of them was a bonus scene or the director's cut ... There is no plot, so no possible interpretation. <br /> <br /> - "11:11" is just full of clich√©s! It is so obvious that I couldn't help laughing. For example: the desert library or the bathroom scenes, the ghost silhouettes go with a blast of wind, ... there is even the fashionable "little scary girl" as in "Dark Water" or "The Ring". Of course, the protagonist is bullied in school and looks like a stereotypical gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, thin, black clothes). Is it an obligation to make her credible? I do not think. Sara's psychology is so few developed and so typical that it does not make her credible nor. <br /> <br /> - Horrible direction: As I said, nothing original, everything has been seen a thousand times and used here for no real purpose. <br /> <br /> - There are some funny inconsistencies. For example, I do not know about "ghost science", "paranormal course" or what is taught in American universities ... In Europe, this is not really the case: Teachers talk about negative energies or using "unmaterial" creatures sensors. .. ridiculous. Also: how do you watch a movie in the 60s with a Super 8 camera on a computer screen without spending time on your digitalization (in the movie they see it instantly on the computer screen) and how can you isolate on this old movie a little detail and zoom in and see a perfectly identifiable face? I wonder if the instructor has ever tried to digitize an old analogue movie ... Finally, "11:11" is just worth watching if you like to laugh at silly movies or maybe if you want to fall asleep on your sofa ... But it's an expensive way to fall asleep!
