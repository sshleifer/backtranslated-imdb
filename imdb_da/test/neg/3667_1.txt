<br /> <br /> In Japan and elsewhere in Europe, new technology allows filmmakers to bypass the closed store in Hollywood mainstream and avoid Ed Wood as visible low budget production values ​​to produce compelling films. What a shame that in the UK we can find examples like "Avatar" (the name of many a video game), where the brain baptist tries to imitate as many movies - and console games loved by loveless teens - that they themselves are cheap photocopies of clichés abound as testosterone burned kangaroos. Check out a bit of synopsis: <br /> <br /> "Seen in futuristic London, 2024, it tells the story of a team of Virtual Reality Virus Exterminators faced with the ultimate internet virus." <br /> <br /> Go back and read the quote again - avoid guffawing - and try to find a single original idea in it. This should have been a tired, boring concept in 1993, not against 2003. Oh, but there is more - the "ultimate virus" has already got planes to collide, infect the air traffic control center, etc. It has been developed by a "child genius" 'and manifests itself as a lightly dressed, athletic, crossbreeding discount Lara Croft imitator who makes a good line of snarling and cod martial arts moving straight out of the playground - the living product of youth fantasy. Oh, and she is accompanied by 'Predator' as sound effects to emphasize her remarkable powers. The whole thing has a "futuristic" vision of great originality - the Lloyds building filtered with After Effects to look a little green. The budget really shows - which today and age should not. Overall, an infinite root of cheese, ham and cliché, which Roger Corman would have left on the cutting edge in his most shameless, desperate moments. Shame that such an alleged love power gave 9 minutes of wasted celluloid. <br /> <br />
