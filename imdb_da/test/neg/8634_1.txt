I know it's hard for you Americans to find European movies on video / DVD, especially from the 80s, but please look for the original version of Vanishing - Title Spoorloos (1988) - and you'll see why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screws up bigtime, especially in the final. I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and especially Jeff Bridges, but it is just as lame in relation to the original. What do they think? Can you imagine seven having a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow running happily into Brad Pitts' arms in the final? The whole point of the original was such a great international success was due to the shocking final. So why do you accept this kind of shy remake? Really, avoid this and get the original one.
