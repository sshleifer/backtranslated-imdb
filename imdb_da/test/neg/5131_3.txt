Of course, this film had good intentions. In the end, there is a dedication to a person named Kellie, who, as a viewer, can only expect to find himself in a situation similar to that which the film depicts. Maybe she made the "wrong" choice. This dedication is the only redeeming quality of love and suicide. <br /> <br /> The movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence. When the viewer is already so annoyed only about five minutes in the movie, it will largely go downhill after that ... as it was. I know the movie was low budget, and the camera's shot was actually pretty good ... unfortunately everything else was angry. The action, the plot, the sound quality, the picture quality ... the actor. I'm sorry, but the play is terrible. Beyond horrible. It's as if the actors are trying to act like people acting. That's the only way I can think of describing it. As I looked at, I actually pictured the script with the scene direction in my mind. None of the movements were natural and none of the signs' reactions to each other fit. In short: the timing is WAY off. The timing of the whole movie is far away. I am no director so I know the limits of my knowledge, but I really feel that there should be some way to pass the time. Until they explained that the exam was not too far away, I was under the impression that the first part of the film had taken place within a week ... a month at most. <br /> <br /> All that is said is really a shame. This movie could really have been strong with a little tweaking. All the moments in the movie where we need to feel something are obvious, but only because the setup is obvious (which is a bad thing). The moving scenes fell completely flat. For example, when Kaye's brother takes her head on her hat and puts it on her, we must feel the understanding he has for her, the innocence and the protection of his brother's love ... somehow it just doesn't come. There are so many more scenes like this (for example: ALL fighting situations) and all they do is take away from the movie. All these things put together, love and suicide come as a long, cheesy, low-budget commercial.
