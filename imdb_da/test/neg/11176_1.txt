I admit that I was shot by Charlotte Lewis provocative stills from this movie, as well as a comment on the IMDb notice board dedicated to her, and call this picture a "great undervalued movie". And then I got with great difficulty my own copy of "Dial Help". <br /> <br /> No waste. Nothing but a cheaply made blood and make movies with a ridiculous assumption that I will not even repeat with several telegraphed sequences (for example, when we look Lewis lovingly feed his fish, we know immediately what will happen to them later). Not even Lewis, with his beautiful raven hair, big and luminous brown eyes, full and pouty lips and amazing figure, can save this movie. Lewis fans would be better off with "Just Essentials", "Sketch Artist" or even "Golden Child".
