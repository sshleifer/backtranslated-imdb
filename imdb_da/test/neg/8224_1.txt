OK, so I have to start this review by saying that I really expected to see this flick for months I use to watch his trailer and think it really cool .... little did I know that the only cool thing if this cliché-driven turd was just his trailer. In the cinema I saw the first 3 frames of this movie and even to myself "no way this movie is so bad, do not be an idiot, give it a chance! You have only seen 3 minutes" while I rolled my eyes in shame . All these frames showed .... get this .... a guy with a poker face (because he doesn't feel anything .... it's deep) looks right on the camera in the middle of the frame. In the second or third he keeps himself awake in his perfectly made bed (because he sleeps like a dead guy ... because he doesn't feel anything) and his father calls and says "John Garden State, you are your father". ... oh, come on! I've seen a little more than a few flicks to hate clichés like "am I yours (insert parent)" how in hell should I respond ??: "Oh, he has a hard relationship with him" .... uh. ... yes, that's exactly how to react .... <br /> Man, it's a crappy movie ... <br /> <br /> Anywho, as the girl continues, learns we do things about his friends, all of whom are an ALTERNATIVE EMO WALKING INDIE MOVIE CLICHÉ. For example, one of his acquaintances is a guy who works in a medieval restaurant that speaks Klingon (Bizarre characters + Pop culture = Your standard American indie flick). Then we know Natalie Portman's character, a copy of Alissa Jones (from a movie kicking GS's butt, Chasing Amy), Amelie and the chick from Eternal Sunshine ... you know, smart, original (not really), grown, beautiful and ... in contact with her sexuality (!). She listens to some 70's band with The Shins and gives ... what? they are from this damn decade ?? So why do they sound like that? Oh, they have no personality, ok ..... so she handles her CD player to John Garden State, and he looks at her with a stupid face (you know, love). As the song played, I heard their lyrics say "you will love this soundtrack, it's so alternative and cool, you will love this movie, it will define you and your generation, even though it is an ideological photocopy of The Breakfast Club, Ghost World and any other smart teen movie from the last 20 years, you will drink coffee and read books you do not understand "... Today really unoriginal sh! T to happen. ... he doesn't care if he dies in a plane crash (because he's already dead ... and he feels nothing) and he lets us know in a scene page taken directly from an unknown movie called FIGHT CLUB ! !! It's a cool scene, but oh, did I say so in the trailer? ....... so in a party, and just when you think this guy is really deep and asexual, he makes out with a bimbo .... so oh, he is not such an emotional zombie . A smart character development or just a shty-t movie? ... Well, let's analyze that scene, it gives him a motionless move in a coup ch with everyone else moving in really fast speed ...... scene idea taken straight out of an unknown movie called REQUIEM FROM A DREAM! ...... so just a sh! tty, sh! tty movie ... <br /> Then they meet more eccentric (cliches, actually) characters and finally one who lives next to a huge hole in the ground. John Garden State says something screaming as "good luck exploring your endless abyss" and the guy says .... and now I would really shock myself "You too" ............. And then we are gently told that Neo is Jesus .... Oh no, wait, it's from another stupid, obvious, repetitive, overrated and cliché piece of crap. Finally (finally !!!!), a bit more crap, and he goes into the big department store's showdown to cushion the bombs. He must talk to his father, whom he has not seen in the last zillion years, because he (FINALLY COOL SPOILERS) killed his own mother ... (you see, he killed his mother so he is also dead ... .... and feel nothing ... it's deep). Now I really just expected a smart and moving Magnolia-like dialogue between a father and a son ...... but this is Garden State, so it's pretty much that: -John Garden State: Father, I forgive you, you did not I do not know what you were doing when you dragged me for a zillion year, but I know you love me -Crappy instructor father: No !!! None!!!! I want to say a few simple things because I'm not so deep of a sign anyway, like this whole movie really, so no! -John Garden State: No father, we have to get together because we are just individuals ..... I mean different individuals -Crappy instructor father: No !!!!! No !!!! ............ OK, you convinced me. <br /> <br /> And he gets the girl (because he's no longer dead, you know it) and the movie ends and I go and eat a piece of chicken that makes my day .... <br /> <br /> This movie for the trailer sugar
