This should not have been made in a movie. Everything about it was idiotic, and I don't think I was even laughing. There were bits and pieces that were okay, I guess, but it's about it. Many parts were strikingly similar to a lot of other movies which made them a hell of a lot better. There were some famous actors / actresses in this, but no one did a good job, they just didn't care. This is one of those movies trying to have a "sweet" end, but it was so idiotic that it literally had no redeeming values. Carrot Top is probably the worst comedian out there right now. Do yourself a favor and remove it here! <br /> <br /> Final Decisions: <br /> <br /> Movie: NOOOOO! <br /> <br /> Buy DVD: Absolutely not! <Br /> <br /> Rental: Only if you've seen everything else and have a free coupon, but even then it's still not worth you.
