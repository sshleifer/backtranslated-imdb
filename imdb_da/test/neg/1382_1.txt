Okay, I like to take advantage of the doubt. I saw his show. <br /> <br /> It's not fun for me. All I remember was a lot of "strange" sounds and shouts. I don't think I've even cracked a smile. The only thing that looked like some humor was his Anjelina Jolie / Jennifer Aniston bit. I think you can get stupid at the moment that sees it. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with "Ask Whitey?" section? Is it a ripoff of "Ask a Gay Dude? / Black Man?" from Chappelle's Show? Isn't that clear? But when Chappelle did, he exhibited the ignorance of the subject. Like Borat. But what happens to picking random white people and shouting at them? It's not fun, it's just stupid. <br /> <br /> And I'm quite sure I've heard some "jokes" from him somewhere else ... it seems like he's "tormenting" bits and pieces, throwing in some "loud" yells. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it wasn't fun. Seriously. Don't waste your time.
