I had great hopes for this until they changed the name to 'The Shepherd: Border Patrol, the worst movie name ever, which was wrong with just' The Shepherd '. This is one of the action-flick numbers that punches its hat on many classic Van Damme movies. There is a good action in a bar that reminded me of hard target and universal soldier, but directed without intensity or flair, which is a shame. There is a big line about being "the dot and wearing a rabbit" and some OK action scenes failed by the fairness of it all. Many times the dialogue is not consistent with the sign's mouth and the stuntmen fall down dead a split second before they are shot. The final match is one of the better Van Damme matches, except the director tries to go a little for John Woo and also fails to introduce flashbacks that no one really cares about, just getting in the way of the action that is the whole point of a of Damme film. <br /> <br /> Not good, not bad, just average generic action.
