too predictable for spoilers, but I won't be cagey below, so don't read it if you break. <br /> <br /> A couple of boring scriptwriters together in half an afternoon, and even then they run out of ideas. So let's start with a criminal demanded by all of France ... doesn't matter what he's done, we think about it later (they don't). Some seconds of excitement, but not too much, and nothing unexpected, because it requires art. half an hour was needed to finish the movie; I get it: get them to rob a jewels, and take a lot of time to avoid alarms, etc.; Everyone robs jewelers in movies, just do not do it, it's bound to work (it doesn't). no humor, no character (ok, yves montand makes him cut it), and get everyone to talk in a silent stem of death that should make one think of noir, but just make the actors sound depressed. If they are silent, it will make them seem ugly - but also save us from writing their lines. we would rather add something to the stay at home women who want to see these things so let's have something to empathize with her hubby (we forgot to put some women in the movie). got it: a son of (gypsum) marijuana - oh, and get him suicide attempt for no particular reason (shame? his father is a mafia chief to cry loudly, but the audience will feel his dangerous care and if not, scare them) . Oh, the crooked cop was a classmate of the guy who eventually gets him; wrenching, eh? Let's get them all to die in the end, or we'll never finish those things. is it in the can? Right, it's over with then, thank goodness. who should we get to the director?
