Well, artyfartyrati in Cannes might have liked this movie, but not me, I'm afraid. If you like the type of movie that shoots kills so long that you wonder if the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch, then it may be for you. Much of it is such with short stays in the unpleasant area. I didn't find it shocking or disturbing as some other reviewers have - simply a little uncomfortable and pointless. The only reason I didn't give this one star is that the play is legitimate and the movie is pretty well shot. The reason, however, has little to recommend. Much of the movie just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano, which can appeal to some people. But not that you think this is harmless enough, be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth. Not recommended.
