What can I say when I say a line map. Sandra does a credible job, but what about the bad direction and the story line cannot save it. Too much pre-occupation with guns. How can the Hollywood types crawl the need for gun control in our community and spend so much time and film shooting focused on weapons? It's just worse than expected.
