This must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen! Cast is an international one - Australian pretend-to-be-British, American scene and a sign with an English name with an irreversible "European" accent. What passable efforts to act from this modley crew are completely undermined by a plot and script of special inanity. So brief was the shot of this movie's budget, and the overall production values ​​are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition. For the past twenty years, we have seen horror movies and stalk'n slash thrillers of extraordinary (but not necessarily "high") quality that are made in no budget at all. Recent examples are the poorly crafted but utterly scary "Blair Witch Project" and of course - the latest - the low-budget winner, SAW, with almost unknown leads (Gary Elwes is just one you can't remember even if you've seen him before) . In DARKHUNTERS it is shocking to find a well-known character actor, Dominique Pinon and Hollywood, who have been struggling fiercely by Jeff Fahey to save the movie. It is embarrassing to see the once beautiful leading man (Fahey) in corny makeup bearing out bizarre bad lines. I would have rated this movie 0 out of 10 if it was possible!
