By-the-numbers, Oscar-hungry biopics about the late, great singer Ray Charles. There is one - exactly one - big scene in * Ray *. It happens during a feedback to Charles's youth after the boy becomes completely blind. Running into the sharecropper house he shares with his mother, he travels over a chair and sprawls on the floor. He cries for his mother; She, according to her philosophy that a person should "stand on their own two feet", observes silently and neatly from the kitchen and waits to see if the boy can fall back on his own resources. The boy turns out to be the challenge of using his ears and memory to find a boiler on a stove, a nearby fire pit, the grass blowing in the wind outside a window, a crossing of a cricket across the plank word. <br /> <br /> The movie breaks, here; It expands the breathing - even if it is only 40 seconds. The scene is a much needed deadline from Taylor Hackford's otherwise noisy movie. By "noisy" I do not refer to the music, which of course is excellent. I refer to the sound effects (big BOOMS! Ahead of another flashback) and the inane dialogue ("I speak to you as a friend, Ray", etc.). On the visual side, Hackford is straightforward and effortless: Sepia-colored filters over the camera lenses during flashbacks; whirling-dervish 360s from the camera crane, etc. etc. All the modern conveniences. What a horrible movie style is shown in * Ray *! - A style all too often in will-be "important" films from the last decade or so (Scorsese's * Aviator * is stylistically very similar to the movie). These gimmicks are employed to confuse the clich√©-ridden manuscript. Some of us won't be fooled. <br /> <br /> Also, some of us are not quite ready to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as anything more than stunning imitation. The proof, Foxx seems similar to Ray Charles: he goes like Charles, speaks like Charles, and even moves like Charles. Foxx's imitation of the singer during live performance is technically perfect. I'm not begrudging Mr. Foxx his Oscar; he deserved it. (It was a rather weak field this year though.) But you wonder if Foxx really understands Charles. The actor achieves a good moment when he insists on trying the smack that his bandmates shoot up: he records, only for a brief moment, a disgust at the injustice that he is blind and the life of darkness. The film seems to dramatize the struggle in Charles between the bright salvation of music and the forgetfulness of heroin, with its blindness as the battlefield between the two compulsions. But the damned movie just doesn't take time: it jumps together from triumph and triumphs, and never keeps getting any insight into the man. You have to STRETCH to find the dramatic tension; one must supply the drama to the film. In other words, you have to imagine a better movie than this one. <br /> <br /> In its bustle towards a brilliant conclusion, * Ray * introduces several great ideas for a movie: his early days at "Chitlin Circuit"; his bold musical innovations for the Atlantic label; the problem of his addiction to heroin; the inevitable artistic compromises accompany overwhelming success; Man's significance for civil rights struggle (touched in the movie to, oh, about 3 minutes of screen time), and more. The filmmakers are too lazy to focus on one of these elements. Two and a half hours watching a man overcome a hardship after another can make us feel good, but such a movie is not necessarily a great work of art. This kind of approach certainly gives no deeper insight into the subject of the movie - and shouldn't insight be the real goal of a movie like this? If I had wanted a laundry list of Ray Charles's performances, I would just have Googled him. <br /> <br /> 3 stars out of 10 - the extra 2 stars strictly for the music.
