Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast, Ice Scream is more like a sincerity character. <br /> <br /> The ground opens with the dream of Ali, a traveling ice cream vendor in a western Anatolia city, where he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods for large ice cream companies. He dreams of playing in his product's TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis and dancing about him. When his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gigantic wife who refuses to make sex with him for 6 years without any apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful in his job? Apparently, because he says he sold better in the old days, as there was no pressure from global ice cream companies. But this is what he says; we don't actually see him suffer so much: he still sells well, raises the surrounding villages, while his apprentice stays in the store and sells ice cream to people in the city. Ali accuses large companies of using sweet and dyeing while using genuine "sahlep" (powdery roots of mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorcycle with a bank loan to be a travel provider and gives ads to a local TV channel that prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect. His wife is not fond of his business ways of doing business, they always struggle and Ali threatens her to do very bad things in a moment of madness. <br /> <br /> On a very successful day, his miserable bike was stolen by the bad little boys in town. In search of his stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for theft, but of course, nobody takes him seriously. He gets annoyed by his wife, and Ali goes to an inn and gets drunk. One of his friends at his table, a wannabe socialist in the city, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism, and without any real connection jumps to the subject of global freezing. Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. An old neighbor takes him to a night tour and advises him on life. According to him, Ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world is facing global freezing. When he returns home, we suddenly see that his wife understood his worth, treated him like a hero and praised his crew. Meanwhile, the thief's boys were sick and eating too much ice. They admit the doctor that they stole Ali's bike. Ali forgives them and there comes the happy end. Although the plot may look promising in some way, it is the story that makes this movie endless and cheesy. First, the director does not show much of an attempt to visually tell the story; everything is based on dialogues. And the dialogues never stop showing us that the cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's problems aren't convincing, because we don't see it, we just understand it from his words. The director markets his film as Ali's fair fight against big ice-cream companies, but nothing in the big business movie. We don't see their pressure enough. The film actually charges Ali to believe that big companies are behind theft. And when his motorcycle is found, it solves all the problems: Ali becomes a happy and powerful man. Not a real criticism of globalism. <br /> <br /> Second, the movie is cheesy because of the raw humor. The people of that part of Turkey may be cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily lives, but vulgar language and raw humor are not enough to make a movie fun. I may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and "clever," but they are not wise jokes at all, they are just cheesy. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe American people might like Oriental version of American Pie style humor. But American Pie has never claimed to be nominated for the Oscar, or to have a political message! If you think you can laugh at just seeing a man's big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) Or an old village woman who said "f ** k you" then you can Find this movie fun.
