In the animated series: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux was an amoral rebel that was completely detached from everything and everyone. She was cruel, selfish, loving, unpredictable, witty, caustic, confident, sarcastic, deadly, unimaginable, ambiguous at once. The original Aeon had layers of layers of depth. She almost never got her personal feelings to appear. The original plot was deliciously ambiguous and thoughtful. You could never tell what Aeon's motives were. Aeon was a militant anarchist, while Trevor was a radical idealist, because of this they could never have any kind of stable relationship. <br /> <br /> In the movie: <br /> <br /> Aeon Flux works for Monicans and her political motives and personal motives are very clear. She was beautiful, loving, vulnerable, easy-going, emotional and very predictable. The aeon in the film had at most a layer depth. The reason was obvious and constructed. Everything is completely laid out for you from the start. There was almost no conflict between Aeon and Trevor, at least as far as personal philosophies were concerned. The only conflict between them was that they were on different sides. <br /> <br /> The movie was a terrible disappointment to me. I felt betrayed. They took the idea of ​​one of my favorite animated characters from all the time, squeezing the whole depth and personality out of her and pumping her full of Hollywood clichés. The core of the animated series was completely lost in this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I didn't give this movie a "1" is because visual images were incredible. It was nice to see some of the well-known animated scenes flying in the eye done with CGI.
