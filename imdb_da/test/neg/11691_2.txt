A moderately interesting start, some beautiful scenes in the sixteenth century Japan, and a promising idea. But the performance? The comparison that jumps in mind after approx. Fifteen minutes are "cannibal women in Avocado Jungle of Death". Really. An "Oriental History" specialist who doesn't speak any Japanese goes on tatami without removing the shoes and is generally stupid as celery? Please. It looks like a student movie: The sets are risible, it appears (except perhaps for the title character) close to wood, the plot is completely arbitrary. At least "Cannibal Women" was fun! This is best seen with someone who knows something about Japan, just to see infidels repeat repeatedly across their face.
