Tediously long dreary cinematic waffle. I couldn't believe how bad this movie was. I just saw it because of the many people who gushed about it on this site. Do I watch the same movie? The whole episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps' past hit the future of his (or others) and no one was influenced by their past. I think it was Socrates who said about games that if a scene can be removed from a game without having any effect, then it shouldn't be there. Of course, the director did not know this rule, and then he stuffed his work with a sharp scene after another. Even the plane collided into the house was unexpected, it was not a surprise, but it was unexpected! It is worth mentioning that at the time of writing this (Dec. 1, 2002), although many people say it is one of their favorite films, no one has bothered to add a memorable offer. The reason is that there is simply no. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time watching this, see a plank weapon instead.
