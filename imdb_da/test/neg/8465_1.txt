Five Fingers rely heavily on barbaric, shock-value Hollywood tactics to induce a seemingly positive film-like answer. This is where this movie fails throughout, primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was dismissed and stunned that Five Fingers themselves were made, and essentially had to force me to continue to see it. Torture itself is cruel. Even the sounds come from a room where someone is being tortured, is cruel. But of course decision makers of this stink of a movie felt it was not enough. It had to go far beyond what was necessary and simply and effectively destroyed any chances this movie had to make some kind of valid point. For this reason, this film came over as nothing but being self-satisfied. Five fingers are indeed rejecting a B-film status solely by their indulgence of time manipulation. In other words, we show the present, and then the past is revealed in excerpts. This is a bit of a twist of the normal Hollywood manipulation of time. While the viewer usually appears on page 95 in a 100-page script like the beginning of the movie, and the rest of the girl essentially explains the end, Five Fingers are dedicated to blinking back, which becomes quite tiring at the end of the movie. Overall, Five Fingers made me feel stupid for watching the whole movie, because torture is obviously obscene, and it was certainly not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to do this. I'm surprised that Dick Cheney didn't make a guest comedy at the end as a kind of torture. This movie is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy, mindless dolts.
