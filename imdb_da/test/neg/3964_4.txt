Loved the tale of "Benji" ("Higgins" dog), there are many different things for many different people. In his busy day, "Benji" breakfasts in two children's homes, has a chat with a lawyer, chases an old-fashioned cat and reminds of an aging cafeteria to start the day special. Helper to some, rides to others, he is a companion for everyone. <br /> <br /> Problems arise when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to the abandoned mansion he is calling home. From here we only know that "Benji" can save the day. Plot is routinely from author / producer / director Joe Camp, and he tends to over slow-motion effects. However, the audience will find it hard to resist the lovable little pooch, and children of all ages are sure to love him. Cast would never be anything other than the background of "Benji". <br /> <br /> Not what you would call inspired but fun family fare. Academy Award nominated for "Benji's" theme, "I feel love". <br /> <br /> Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video
