Very silly high school / teen flicker about geeks trying to prove themselves better than the rich brats. Sounds good? This television movie from director Rod Amateau ("Uncommon Valor" and some "Dukes of Hazaard" episodes believe it or not) says nothing, does nothing and will certainly entertain few. <br /> <br /> Notable for its "who's there" of TV casting, including Michael J. Fox, Bob Denver ("Gilligan") and Todd Bridges ("different lines"). This lame effort barely over the line. Also stars Anthony Edwards ("E.R."). <br /> <br /> Saturday, September 5, 1998 - Video
