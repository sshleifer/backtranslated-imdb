I love Sandra Bullock-She's one of my all-time favorite actresses - but it's a movie she should have paid long ago to be a bin. I realize it's nearly 20 years old - but my dead grandmother can do better than these people did. Beware - it's not even worth the $ 5.50 WalMart racket ... You know that when the play stinks badly, it's not even worth a few bucks - the sound quality is horrible - there is no closed caption for even hearing the horrible dialogue, and it looks like it was budgeted at $ 1.98. I thought I'd like to see Sandra in an early role to see how she developed as an actress, but YIKES is kind enough to use a word ...
