Honestly, this movie is weak. Very weak. Only capital ratings can matter. She works as a supercharger on a bad engine ... so if you like red-haired Valkyries - see it. But better find the picture of Brigitte as Sonja and put it on the desk. It will save disappointments. Well, Arnold also makes his deal ... but it's certainly not his best. Other signs - bad is not the word. Swords fighting? Monsters? Ridiculous. The reason is really shame. Why was she needed rape? In particular, we do not see it. <br /> <br /> In any case, the movie is weak. Although there are worse movies ... Without main characters it would only be ******. And if anyone even discusses it, maybe ...
