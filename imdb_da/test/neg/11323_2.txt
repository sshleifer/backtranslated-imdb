Tired and tiring, the one-lines almost made me cry. My 4 year old left the room and ended up making a puzzle. I don't know what age group this was written for, but the author himself didn't even want credit. As for the song, it is mildly fun. At least it was a decade ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I have seen many many times more than this, they are still fun. When this comes on, I try to encourage my child to see something else. A positive note that allowed a vote of 2 instead of 1 is that it encourages good moral values. It would have been encouraging if someone looked at it.
