"The Italian Job" is a caper movie made by the numbers. Riding on the back of each clipper clip, it rises to no particular heights and will be a movie footnote around the month. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is that "The Italian Job" has no imagination at all. I've seen it all before and done better then. The play is fine, the picture is quite acceptable, but this movie absolutely does not break new ground. Let's cross the clich√©s: <br /> <br /> "old-school" criminal grandfather and his protector <br /> <br /> - another band member jealous of the protector <br /> <br /> - a double cross <br /> <br /> - Only bad guys use weapons while the accuser does not have to <br /> <br /> - good criminals always overlook the evil ones. <br /> <br /> It's about the first fifteen minutes. Everything is so predictable. Although heist and car hunting scenes, apparently the highlight of the movie, seems quite commonplace. This is especially true when they appeared in the trailers for the movie, so I already knew what to look for. <br /> <br /> For me, a hijacker's movie only works if it has an element of realism - maybe it might just be pulled out without relying on a deux ex machina or "just because" moments. Parts of "The Italian Job" just throw it out of the window, where computers make things that computers can't do, the good people don't hit anyone with their drive (especially down the stairs) and not a single police car corresponding to street explosions, innocently driven minis or even a low flying helicopter. Must be a dunk of a city for these things, not judging an answer. The play is acceptable, with the crew (Seth Green, Jason Stratham and Mos Def) at least having fun watching. Mark Wahlberg is just for smarmy as the "nice guy" hero, while Charlize Theron is about the only actor who is encouraged to show some sort of assortment. Donald Sutherland is a classroom as always and shows Wahlberg's missing every moment they are together. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a pretty uninteresting movie. In the light of the IMDb ratings, the girls really love this movie, which I can understand to some extent, but there is so much better film out there - although the newer "Ocean's Eleven" is vapidness outshines the non-event that is "The Italian job". <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER *** <br /> <br /> Finally, consider what will happen to Norton's character. Shall we cheer the good guys to cause his death, especially as it seems to be long and painful? He did not deserve it, and simple creeps as he was. <br /> <br /> *** END SPOILER ***
