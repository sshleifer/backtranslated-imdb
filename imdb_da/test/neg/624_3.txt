I can't understand why many seem to hate this. <br /> <br /> This film links many of the overlapping settings of the 50's historic and biblical episodes, using sets of pieces, props, and costumes similar to those seen in other films. Here, however, history is trying to run through the whole of human history, with a narrative story that humanity is in trial, with a guilty verdict, meaning that h-bombs will go out across the world. The prosecutor is the devil who is played with the prison joy of Vincent Price. OK, so it's a little hokey calling the defender "The All Men's Spirit", but I think it's one of those things that gives this movie a sense of period charm. Spririt of Man is randomly played by Ronald Coleman in his last film. It is also the last film in which Groucho, Harpo and Chico Marx all appear, but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Minuet, who buys Manhattan from the Indians, in a scene played exclusively for campy humor. Chico is not funny at all as a monk who thinks the world is flat, and Harpo we are told is supposed to be Isaac Newton and discover gravity. However, most of the other performances are well done. <br /> <br /> Other hokey things are that the experiment is allegedly taking place in outer space, depicted as an area of ​​clouds and blueness. There is something called "The Great Clock of the Outer Space" which, when it strikes midnight, can signal the end of the world. <br /> <br /> But in his heart, the film addresses the problems of WMDs and the eternal question of whether man is really good or essentially evil and constitutes what I think is an interesting way. Also, anyone who likes the look of costume epics from the fifties would like to see the look of this movie.
