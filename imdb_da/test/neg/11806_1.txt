I think many friends of people who have acted in this thing must come and judge it because I tell you, it's just awful. The action is worse than soap opera bad, the effects are like something you would see out of a 1970 episode of Doctor Who, the story is, yes, there is no story. And they continue to use the same 2 minute song again and again and again. And werewolf? Its like the muppets they used in Wing Commander, the giant cats, remember how bad they looked? Werewolf is so bad. Seriously, the guy who has instructed this thing is horrible and should never do anything else, except perhaps his son's school games, but even then he must pay the public to see it. Ghostwolf is nothing but a bad joke.
