I don't know if this exceptionally boring movie was intended as an unofficial successor to 'The French Connection', but it has many of the same drawbacks: The scripture is so confusing that the viewer remains uninitiated and feels out of the picture and the direction is so cold, so lacking in energy that even the big chase sequence cannot experience things.
