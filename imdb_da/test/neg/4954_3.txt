Although a fan of shock and do, I found this movie disappointing to say the least. The effects and puppet work were impressive, yes, and humor was well timed, but ... something was missing. See, the movie's first act is used to establish the nuances of Jack Brooks' character, despite the fact that everything we need to know about his aggression is delivered within minutes of the first title cards. As for the narrative and many of the flashbacks: unnecessary. The pacing during the second act was boring. Most of it is focused on Freddy Krueger eating, then vomiting, then eating a little more, then flailing his arms and saying something snappy or rude. Still, the schlocken is drawn with short scenes by Jack, who discusses his rage problems with a therapist. (Definitely the entertaining scenes in the movie - excellent dialogue worth lots of laughs.) So, without warning, Jack decides to kill a few monsters. And then it's over. <br /> <br /> All in all, like Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer, as a return to the 1980s horror movie, has plenty of potential but is futile and plod without conflict or appropriate resolution. <br /> <br/> Hopefully, these issues will be addressed before Jack Brooks VII: Jack Goes to Hell or Jack vs Ash goes into production.
