I realize it's very hard to live up to the first The 10 Commandments movie (which was grandiose and personally not a Charleton Heston fan) but wow ... this movie / mini series was disappointing. Even the animated Prince of Egypt was better. <br /> <br /> The only thing that struck me was Ramses. Compared to Yul Bryner's version, Paul Rhys's version seemed as weak and un-Pharoh as. The action was really not that great. For a modern fit, I expected something better. It did not look as fantastic visually as the first. I suppose they were running on a tight budget or something. There is an occasional speech narrator that I found strange and unnecessary. It also broke up in history. And um ... God's voice / lines were a little weird.
