I was looking forward to spending part of my Independence Day weekend and watching a good movie about Jefferson. This movie was not. It was quite long, pulled out, boring and unbalanced. Too much time was spent exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway, and not enough time was spent on his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was horrible. Her acting was so bad that it was like seeing an A1 airplane trying to recite Shakespeare. Her constant whining voice cracked her nerves! Nothing accentuated Jefferson's sound as an ignorant man, rather than a genius. Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and their feelings of slavery was also underdeveloped, but his eldest daughter's rebellion (Patsy) is an important event late in the film. The film was too long and the manuscript lacked energy and excitement. On the positive side, the costumes were quite beautiful, and Greta Scacchi played part of Cosway well. If you want to see a movie about the revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, then see 1776, it's much better than Jefferson in Paris.
