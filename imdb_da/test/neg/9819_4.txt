Disappointing movie with Walter Pidgeon as a hunter who goes to Germany to kill Hitler. When discovered, he is forced to sign a document that says he was acting on orders from England. His refusal to sign the document brings us to the movie's plot. <br /> <br /> Pidgeon is pursued back to England by the evil George Sanders and his cohorts, John Carradine, who speaks a little, but is again, as always, personified in the execution of evil. <br /> <br /> On the way to being persecuted, Pidgeon meets up with Joan Bennett, the latter showing a wonderful cockney accent. History is being knocked down as love develops between the two, but again as we approach World War II, realism becomes the goal of the day. <br /> <br /> The almost final scene in the cave between Sanders and Pidgeon is nicely realized, but we know where that arrow should go. <br /> <br /> Very interesting that while Pidgeon flies Nazi Germany, he again meets with a young Roddy McDowall, one of Pidgeon's many co-stars that year in memorable "How Green Was My Valley." How green was "Man Hunt?"
