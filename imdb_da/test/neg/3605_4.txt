It may sound strange, but I only got to see the first movie (The Emperor's New Groove, yaddayadda) a week ago and only because of an episode of the TV show. I just love the character of Kuzco, but not Kronk. Anyway, in the end I decided to watch the other movie, so I would have seen it. The hope it would be as good as the first, but ... I'm sorry to tell you this, but the more humor became American, the more I yawned. I agreed with Kuzco when he began to cry and see all the cheesy recordings. <br /> <br /> Still, younger children and probably veterans will also love this movie to bits (if they like the old school moralizing Disney it is), but I had equal expectations that was a unanimous teensy little hell much higher than they should have been. Kronk is a nice character who is good heart and stupid at one time, but it was Pacha and Kuzco in a row that woke me up at the end of the movie. (I will ignore Rudy ... for as far as possible). <br /> <br /> Anyway, great movies, just not my style, and as they say, always be true to your groove.
