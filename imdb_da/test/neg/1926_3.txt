To be fair, it has been several years since I saw the crazy obligation to celluloid known as "Here on Earth", so forgive me if my memory of the movie is a bit dirty. I hold onto the most important points that plague souls of the unfortunate seer. Scene One: Chris Klein, after being thrown out of prep school (because he looks like a seventeen year old-- yes, very credible), gives what I assume is his valedictory speech ... to a field. Let me repeat it for you - a field. I think we should be moved by the combination of shame and eloquence that he doesn't express. Klein has delivery and facial expressions of a cardboard cut. He is a decent looking piece of cardboard, but a little more. Scene Two: After some joyriding and teenage pyromaniacs haninks, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett do some damage to the local dining room, which he is forced to rebuild. Of course. Because who could better help with construction than some random moron that crashed into it / burned it in the first place. Even better, let's say that random moron moves into Josh Hartnet's girl, Miss Sobeski, the girl he wants ... her straight wooden line delivery? <br /> <br /> Scene Three: Chris Klein's character elaborates on Leelee Sobeski's character and decides to name his various body parts after the states on the east coast. My soul is crying. Really, how can this scenario prove good? Surely you must alienate several million people if you think their home is similar to Miss Sobeski's more ... erm ... feminine areas. Secondly, naming her breasts after New York and New Jersey calls for some confusion as to whether Miss Sobeski is actually freakishly disproportionate. Scene Four: Leelee is running. She falls down. This gives her ... crack cancer. "We always knew it could come back," says her father (?). Right. Knækræft. From tripping. Maybe I missed something. As I said, it has been a few years. I certainly missed something. Didn't I do for God's love, tell me that the girl had no contract for KNEE cancer from falling down. <br /> <br /> The cry you just heard was dying my soul.
