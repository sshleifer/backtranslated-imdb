I saw this on the Sci-Fi channel so I knew it would be bad to start with, but I was surprised at how much worse it was than expected. The CG effects on the dragon were terrible, even for the Sci-Fi channel, and the writing was pathetic. I couldn't tell if it was to be as stupid as a joke or if it just came out that way. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it's so horrible that it's almost fun, especially the part where Patrick Swayze's knight character goes home to his knightly father who has retired after losing his legs and is now deceived in his armor for the sole purpose of letting the audience know that he was a knight. The majority of the film focuses on a huge dragon egg that closes into a not so huge baby dragon with some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. This was just awful.
