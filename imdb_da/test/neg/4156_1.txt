Many times, the description is "full of sound and rage that means nothing", used and is right on target. Unfortunately, "Code 46" lacks both sound and rage. A little rage would have been much appreciated. Tim Robbin's character (William) is so lacking in passion that the idea of ​​falling immediately in love with Mary (Samantha Morton) seems almost absurd. These people are so passionate that you start wondering if perhaps the water supply in this future world has been dosed with thorazine. There is a "Brave New World" kind of atmosphere for the movie, which is helped along with each scene being shot about 2-3 stops overexposed. Unfortunately, this technique becomes dull and rather hard on the eyes. The sparse mishmash of language also grows dull when apparently there is no apparent reason for its existence. Many futuristic, scifi movies are criticized for being all flash and no matter. This movie has neither flash nor fabric. It's a code 6 all the way.
