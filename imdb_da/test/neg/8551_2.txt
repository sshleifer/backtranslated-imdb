Many actors have many good movie roles in their soul. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple. <br /> <br /> There is Linda Blair. "Dj√¶vleuddriveren". That is it. <br /> <br /> When you see "Chained Heat" and see Linda Blair in it, wonder what at least drives through her mind. "Oh boy: Oscar for the best actress, here I come!" Just another woman in prison movie that they used to make for the cheap in the 70s, this actual name you might recognize. John Vernon plays the dean ... I mean, warden (with a hot tub in his office, wondering what he told the contractor?), Stella Stevens pops up, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how badly they needed the job. <br /> <br /> And especially if of course for our heroine Sybil Danning as a bisexual prisoner who puts the moves on poor Blair. Rewriting, Sybil is as Sybil does, and everything Sybil does is done perfectly. Forget what a horrible movie you see. <br /> <br /> Almost. <br /> <br /> Two stars. One for Sybil and another for trying to pass Linda Blair as a gender symbol. What could have had them (get it?)?
