This movie was not very good in my opinion. Though it wasn't completely a waste of an hour and a half (luckily I didn't have to pay $ for it), it just wasn't very scary. There were parts where I jumped and a couple of minimally violent / gory scenes, but in general only anyone who easily scared could consider this movie scary. The overall writing and acting was very weak. The characters never developed or grew as humans. Even at the end, the manager, regardless of his name, was not met and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute. The reason also had inconsistencies. The police officer, who was killed, was NOT murdered the same way he died in the game. The girl October mentioned that to kill the evil demon lady you had to read something from the correct text. Fun how they never bothered and still managed to escape. Malcolm-in-the-Middle Kid died in the game, but did not die "in real life." Also, playing the game alone was very weak in writing. It would have been okay for brother's death just to make them play again. But you have to play a video game and stay alive and 3 people die before you play again ... why do you need the game? If you like movies like Ring and things are scary and fun, watch this movie. If you know someone like that, you can laugh at it, do it. If you like horror movies that make you laugh aloud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do it. Otherwise, far far away.
