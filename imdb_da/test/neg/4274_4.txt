This film is about a young girl who goes to live with her rich cousins, falls in love with one of her cousins, and rejects the progress of an amorous seeker who brings problems into the family. After seeing the version 1999 and reading the book, I decided to see the older version. I found it was true for Fanny character in the book, but it was also boring sign. The Fanny character played by Sylvestra Le Touzel was lackluster; she often seemed to be failing. I also didn't like Robert Bourbage, who played Henry Crawford. I couldn't imagine he was interested in Fanny or her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood who played Mary Crawford was okay, but the wig she was wearing was so nasty. I lost interest in her plays and I continued to stare at her wig. I expect it would fall from her head. I could also see a slip of her real hair under the wig.
