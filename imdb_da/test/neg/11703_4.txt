Ghost Story has an interesting feminist revenge story premise, A-list veteran actors, colorful flashbacks with nifty look-a-like youthful colleagues of the old men. scary staccato music heralding the nearby horrors, atmospheric New England winter weather, and an excellent charismatic actress in the title role. Ghost Story could have been much more effective in black and white and in eliminating some of the more lurid special effects and presenting a more compelling script (we shouldn't have to wonder why the two trailer-parkish acolytes is in the script) The biggest damage to the movie is Craig Wassan (definitely separated by the birth of Bill Maher) who may not edit or just badly act, is totally ineffective. He seems to "specialize" in wide eyes, broad mouth reaction shots; not a lot of personality here. However, the revelation is Alice Krige, pale-faced, enigmatic, frightening under the quiet outside. But her Eve Galli is scary even before she meets her destiny; I mean a young woman who says things like "I want to take a bite out of you" or "Dance with me, your little toad!" are not already in the living. Ghost Story would have been much better in a low-key, Val Lewton mode. The exaggerated special effects completely suppress the chill factor.
