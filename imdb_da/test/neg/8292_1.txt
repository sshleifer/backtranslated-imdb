While I'm a Shatner fan for a long time (since we used to see Trek again at noon in the early 70's), I can't think of any reason why he would make this movie, whether it be was personal development or business reasons. Has he lost a bet? <br /> <br /> As a movie fan, I like to appreciate the bad movies with the big ones. But "shooting or being shot" has no flair or funny bits, unintentional or not. <br /> <br /> Though it was not rated, there were no objectionable scenes (blink or you will miss the nudity, cartoonish gunfire "violence" with the endless bullet gunfights), leading to the belief that the producers are just wanted to save the fee required to get the MPAA to judge it. This will make way to cable with barely 10 seconds edited out. Of the eight people in the theater with us, four of them went midway, mumbling statements like "This is stupid". <br /> <br /> Shatner plays a escaped psychic patient who has been denied release because he sees himself as a screenwriter. The investigation committee stamps its request "INSANE". He enters a group of Z-grade filmmakers who "shoot at video because it's 80% cheaper than movies" and decide to force them to shoot his script at gunpoint. There are a few minor subplots that develop some of the secondary characters, but mostly it is the whole movie. <br /> <br /> To spend 90 minutes on a Shatner "art" movie, see "Free Enterprise" instead, it's a much better movie.
