Franco Zeffirelli ("The Taming Of The Shrew", "Romeo And Juliet", "Jesus Of Nazareth", "Othello") third staff on Shakespeare's transfer to the screen works very well, with the casting of Mel Gibson ("Mad Max," Lethal Weapon "and before" The Passion of Christ ") in the role previously owned by Sir Laurence Olivier (and rightly see my review on his" Hamlet ", no doubt the best interpretation of one of Bards timeless (and most cited) tragedies) and redone 5 years later by Kenneth Branagh as a full blood treatment explaining his 3 hour 22 minute maturity combined with a dream casting (and many small additions that were well-chosen and expert by contemporary William Shakespeare's master , Kenneth Branagh, director of "Henry V" and "Dead Again." He is in the star "Lethal Weapon", Glenn Close ("The Big Chill"), Paul Scofield For All Seasons "), Alan Bates, Ian Holm, Michael Maloney (who would be cast as Roderigo opposite Kenneth Branag h and L aurence Fishburne in Oliver Parker's "Othello" (see my review of Olivier's "scene" version of the tragedy, even though he only starred in it) and who Branagh would throw as Laertes in his 3-hour version of "Hamlet" sincerely to Sir Laurence Olivier and his classic version of the play; Also see my review about this 5 years later), Nathaniel Parker (who would be cast as Cassio in his brother's version of "Othello" 4 years later) and Helena Bonham-Carter, who would be thrown into "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" 4 years later. <br /> <br /> Zeffirelli intended this film as a tribute to Sir Laurence Olivier (who was dead 2 years before this movie) and it seems pretty good, for the most part. What I was a little uncomfortable with was Zeffirelli's misplacement of many lines and in one scene he gives one of Hamlet's lines to the Ghost. Also, Helena Bonham-Carter did not convince me as Ophelia. She was too boring and unreal, while Jean Simmons (who had immortalized the role of Olivier's version) and Kate Winslet (who did an acceptable job in Kenneth Branagh's unknown epic revisionist recast of "Hamlet") were good in the role of Jean Simmons is it best Ophelia ever, so she was nominated for best actress in 1948 (she didn't win - what a pity). Ian Holm said his lines too quickly, not slowly as I had expected him, in a scene with him, Laertes and Ophelia. But then again I am more accustomed to Felix Aylmer and Richard Brier's interpretations of the role, and I think they did better jobs than Holm in their respective versions of "Hamlet" (both made by great directors, actors, text editors, producers and stars of all their versions of Bart's work) like Polonius. <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the throw was excellent. The scene where Hamlet confronts her mother was very well done, but Olivier and Branagh increased the stage to better lengths to create even more emotional intensity and excitement as the scene required. <br /> <br /> I recommend this version just to pass the time, but it is ideal as a teaching tool for English speaking English teachers (I recommend showing Olivier's version first, then Branaghs and finally this version). Despite the movie's "PG" rating, there was really nothing offensive in the movie. Only what the play required. <br /> <br /> The best versions of "Hamlet" are: <br /> <br /> # 1 Sir Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh. Both were so good that I couldn't decide which one was the best. See my reviews on these versions for more information. <br /> <br /> # 2 Franco Zeffirelli. This one was okay. It started okay with a scene that was not in the play, but should have evolved into the real beginning of the game, where a guard cries "Who's there?" "No, answer me. Stand up and unfold yourself!" That scene scares hell out of you because you sit still and then bam !!, you almost jump out of your skin. In short, that scene sets the tone for the rest of the game. Huge blinds on Zeffirelli's side to omit that scene. It has also misled many lines (and cut others that I think should have been put in), like the line where Hamlet tells Ophelia "Get yourself a nunneri, why would you be a breeder of sinners?"; This line should have taken place in this scene, NOT where it was placed in the movie (after "Being or not being" soliloquy. This version struggles to cut too much or too little of an excellent piece of literature. Kenneth Branagh would remedy it 5 years later with its eerie version of the tragedy, making the HIS version a more appropriate greeting to Sir Laurence Olivier, as several actors (except him) had performed "Hamlet" on stage or on film many times on different occasions. But Zeffirelli's recording on "Hamlet" is faithful to the game, and that was what I was looking for. The setup for the final action duel was the same as in Olivier and Branagh's versions, only that the denouement in Branagh's version was more violent than the breakdown of The two previous faithful versions (more in line with the drama, Olivier tinted it down ... and it worked just as well) and stuck closer to the game, with Branagh throwing in a few harmless see hand his own ... to very good effect. <br /> <br /> This version is not rated.
