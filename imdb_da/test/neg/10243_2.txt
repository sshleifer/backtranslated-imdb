This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. I didn't feel I wanted to remove my eyes with power after seeing the Galaxy. It's just not good. The jokes are almost funny, but fall short. Everybody. The few gags that come close are knocked down again by repeating them again and again. The production values ​​are good, non-existent. The sound is bad, the lighting is poor ... it just seems cheaply made; All too so. The dialogue ... well, often lacks it - many awkward voices; They are all just around, and it seems that someone should say something. The film even seems to be ambivalent about what it wants to be - it is not always clear that it was meant to be a comedy - as perhaps what developed after the start. It feels like a person's film project that they threw together the night before it was due, and if they had put in two weeks into it, it could have been good. <br /> <br /> And I'm easy to please. I thought "mom and dad save the world" was a hoot. I like "Pluto Nash". "Mystery Men" is one of my favorite movies. "Spaced Invaders" is close to a classic. This turkey does not. "Space Truckers" were more credible. <br /> <br /> Avery Schreiber, who can be very fun, tries too hard. His part requires a straightman and he plays it leaning against sitcom. Dorothy Stratten is ok in her role, but not very remarkable. Oh, yes, "my watch is always slow." the line was fun. I want to give this movie all the kudos it can get it needs. <br /> <br /> The spacecraft models are not bad, but they are few and are not used effectively. The room scene is vague. No sweeping passes, no dense detailed fly-bys, not even appropriate action scenes when they dock. (Infinity collides land very strange at some point.) The flight dynamics are horrible; worse than anything you have seen, they are jerked, not slippery. The original battle is stolen and static; Though the two ships have just shown that they can maneuver in their jerky fashion, the (slow) shots act in a way reminiscent of a 16th century sea breeze, except for not so exciting. <br /> <br /> Foreigners - imagine if all Star Wars was the cantina scene. That many rubber masks could become boring rather quickly, no? A few are used as synagogues that work OK the first time, but not fifth. Mercifully, if you try to see the Galaxy, you will probably fall asleep. (I was busy doing something else and missed the last ten minutes and didn't feel like it was worth playing it. If it doesn't say "It sucked", I don't know what to do.) Unfortunately, there is a lot of potential, and it could easily have been a good movie. It would be easy to restore this and get a decent movie. <br /> <br /> MadKaugh
