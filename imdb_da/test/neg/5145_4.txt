This well-intentioned movie just falls a bit short and unfortunately in too many areas. The scenery is beautiful, with views of North Central Vermont that provide the setting for this mid-century story. Quebec Bill strives to go back to his whiskey-running past to save his farm. <br /> <br /> Moving back and forth between scenes of magic realism and straight-forward action, this movie rarely hits its step. br /> <br /> Kris Kristofferson as Quebec Bill seems right, otherwise it is his lines; otherwise his cross of Yankee and Quebecois accents. Anyway, he just comes out like a low-key blow-hard. His dialogues with Gary Farmer's Coville character, however, sparkle. William Sanderson's Rat Kinneson is solid. Charlie McDermott shows some real potential as a young Wild Bill; but his part is not big enough to carry a scene, and he never steals one. Luis Guzman shows up on Lake Memphramagog (with a fine stand-in performance at Lake Willoughby) as a monk with a boys and hood hood: who knows? And then there is Bujold's Cordelia: an oracle like her namesake, she channels Yoda, as she looks like "You want to marry a Quebec woman!"?!? Just too strange and not far near enigmatic. The end is really rude. Again a bad mix of magic realism and concrete. And Yoda never gives an answer we can understand.
