Where do I start, it's one of the most frustrating movies I've seen because it makes much sense to the point, but it comes out as seriously stupid. A movie about a ghost inhabited bed ?? The first 2 minutes of the movie show a black and white flashback of a strange-looking bold dude that goes dominatrix on a Fabienne from the Pulp Fiction lookalike contest wins and strangles her with her tie. This is supposed to create how the bed is part of the story. Nevertheless, if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early, this is a way of making a perversion. Fast forward to today, a couple moving into an apartment with a friendly landlord and starting to unpack their stuff, so far everything is normal. Then they realize one night while making the heather unit on a single mattress, they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things get fished, why didn't they bring in or buy a rubber boot before they got there? We learn that the door leading to the ceiling where the first 2 minutes took place does not open, but as soon as the couple realizes that they need a bed frame, the door opens magically. They go up to the ceiling and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs, and their beloved days are saved ... or they thought. The rest of the film centers around them both being haunted by the bedspread. The woman is an artist, so she starts drawing the ghoulish images she dreams of, and the cock is a photographer so he starts to have his models as if they are tortured or tied up (one of which has gray hair and is shown over 50-year-old, yuck) The woman is becoming increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a serial killer and murder paradise creating the end of the movie. They find the friendly landlord murdered (it makes no sense since ghosts must take a human form to kill) and decide to get the hell out of avoiding. While unpacking, the man goes moronically up the ceiling, obsessed with the crazy fat guy, and the woman bases her skull before the police show up and takes her to a mental department where she kills some guy trying to turn on her. <br /> <br /> Well, if you've read it so far, think one thing ....... WHY HELLEN DOESN'T DEAR, DRIVE AS BEDFRAME FROM THE WIND ???? Seriously they never said anything about the real house being haunted, just the bed .... so why not get rid of the horrible thing and move on? Therefore, the movie is so frustrating because it is actually a good plot and the actors follow suit, but there are more gaps in it than Sonny Corleone at a residence. The couple tried to leave the city unlike any other movie that has oh "Oh lets give this place a chance honey" scheme goes, so props to it. Still, my friend and I, who watched the movie, beat every 5 minutes .... why didn't they just knock the bed out? Especially when they learned it, it was haunted, it would have been a good time to set it on fire or something. All in all, it is an approachable movie with lots of porn like bed scenes and a credible plot (to a degree), but the solution is so simple that you scratch your head at the end of the movie and wonder how stupid a married couple can be ? The highlight of the movie is when the man tells the 50-year-old model to spread his legs and his assistant tells him he can't shoot her like that. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 (a low budget porn The Man Show would love)
