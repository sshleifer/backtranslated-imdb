This was a horrible short film trying to be fun in a dark way, but it wasn't fun at all. Say a movie festival in Chicago. It really is what the title says and I was simply not in it at all. The bad story was what did it. If you wrote it again and shot it again, it could "work". This attempt fell into the "hole". Terrible movie creation.
