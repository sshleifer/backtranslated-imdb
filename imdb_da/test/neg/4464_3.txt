In this desperate and thoroughly stupid attempt to keep Hammer's Dracula franchise alive despite having already lost most of his power already, our legendary vampire is revived in swinging London in 1972. Exactly one hundred years later, he was destroyed by his raising Van Helsing, an occult disciple named Johnny Alucard (get it? Get it?) gathers his flamboyant friends in an abandoned church, among them Van Helsing's great grandson Jessica, and performs a satanic ritual that revives Dracula in a jerk of smoke. Dracula's only mission is to destroy the entire Van Helsing family, and fragile Jessica is the ideal victim to achieve this. This is probably the only 70 movie that goes immensely over the top when trying to look like a 70's movie! Considering the previous six Dracula films were all set in the Victorian era, director Alan Gibson will really emphasize the fact that we are in the 20th century now and thus he wastes his movie with creepy hippie characters, hideous 70s fashion trends and terrible 70s music. Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing seem hopelessly lost in this setting and their performances show it regrettably. The opening order (a flashback) and the showdown climax is pretty entertaining, but everything between them is painfully boring and the complete opposite of scary. The biggest elements of this series of films have always been Dracula's dark castles and the exciting train trips, and of course this submission lacks all that. Fortunately for the fans, Hammer Studios released contemporary vampire-related films that are much better ("The Vampire Lovers", "The Twins of Evil", "The Seven Golden Vampires' Legend"). Not recommended.
