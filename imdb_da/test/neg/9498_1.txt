Apart from the smooth appearance, this show had a little to recommend it. Scripture was patronizing and apprehensive. Without exception, the characters were superficial and unsympathetic. The female characters came out of the worst ... reduced to spoiled, selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and stilettos, and try to bag a man. This aspect of the show is even more curious as the series was produced by two women! The action was mostly boring and humorous with the cast plays one-dimensional characters that attack each scene on the same note. This is not entirely the actor's fault. Had they spent more time developing the characters and storylin and adding a small injection of style and humor, the MVP could have been a hit. What we are left with is something flat and vague uncomfortable.
