The prerequisite for this movie, by a comedians' talk show host, who runs for president as independent, just to shake things up, is fun, entertaining, brilliant and even a little inspirational. (thought of the west wing debate when Tom Dobbs leaves his podium, thinking of Steven Colbert announcing his candidacy, good times) The first 15-20 minutes of this film is therefore very much entertaining, especially the debate. When he is eventually elected, it is a pity that it is because of a computer error that you want him to win fairly (even if it is unrealistic). But then this movie goes all the way downhill. I thought we were going to get a great movie like "Dave" (1993), seeing how it would be if a comedian actually drove the country. Instead, the movie from comedy to a thriller, a romantic comedy and a drama and does not do well. Computer glitch becomes the main story that really sucks. Boy is this disappointing. I give it 3 stars just for the premise and because I have actually managed to watch this movie from start to finish without stopping it, which is usually a good thing with me.
