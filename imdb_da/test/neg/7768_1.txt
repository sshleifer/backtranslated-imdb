Appalling, low, materialistic train. How women (and gay men?) Can enjoy this nonsense is over me. No self-respecting man would ever be with one of these neurotic gold diggers. What is even more so is that so many reviewers say they relate to the women on the show. If it's women's future, Lord helps us all. Showing your independence and being respected as equals with men should not be about spreading your legs every other second with another man. I believe that these women's women and not do them justice. But this review is not against women. Fans of this show say it's "hilarious" and "rivoting", but every time I've seen this show, I've just struggled to keep myself awake. In spite of the narrative of the storyteller, at some point there is nothing near something that could be considered a rational thought. So it's not entertaining and it's not informative, so why would you bother to see it? One in ten stars.
