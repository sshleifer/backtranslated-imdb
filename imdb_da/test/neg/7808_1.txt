This movie made me so angry because of its stupidity that I felt the need to create an account on IMDb to share with you my opinion. I liked Ashton Kutcher in "Very Like Love" and therefore I would still watch this movie despite the current 4.2 rating. It's very over-rated. I trusted that an actor (any of them) would judge the script and would not accept participating in such low / now quality production. It is very disappointing. The theme of the home was much better used in "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo". Things that didn't make sense here: Whole nose, the homeowner leaves his precious pet with someone who doesn't know anything about taking care of it. Secondly, the rule is not to let anyone in the house, but the housekeeper fails to follow this simple rule. The door is not locked?! Etc..
