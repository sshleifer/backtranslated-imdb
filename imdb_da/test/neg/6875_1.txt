In this movie everything was wrong and I don't know why I was bothering to see it to the end. It would have been more fun to see paint dry. To cry aloud I even liked D-Tox and it was much better than this. Here's the basics for you: A redneck is bitten by snakes that hold the evil to 13 killers and become an undead kill machine that kills teenagers who have zero personality. During the film, I lost hope as it didn't scare me at all, as the killings were bad, and there were BAD CGI blood and CGI snakes. It got worse with cardboard thin characters killing their friend by keeping her from the legs and not dropping so she was impaled by a tree and when the bad guy moved underwater like the shark in Jaws. I'm still worried why I was bothering myself. I'm guessing I'm a horror movie fan.
