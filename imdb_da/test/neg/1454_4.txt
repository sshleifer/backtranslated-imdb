Prior to international recognition with the Silence of the Lamb, director Jonathan Demme cut his teeth, making quirky comedies. This was one of them and as a pair of Oscar-winning American comedies I could mention, it has a fine concept, is well-paced, has good performance, a complicated romance. But it is simply not that fun. Pfeiffer is the mob widow who moves to the city's backwaters after her husband (Baldwin) is murdered. The crime chief, who killed him (Stockwell), wants Pfeiffer, his wife (Reuhl) is furious and complicates matters. Pfeiffer also falls for the policeman who mimics her. All this should have been a laugh for a moment. Pfeiffer, sporting a great gem is excellent as the widow, just as the hyperactive Ruehl and Modine are also good as the cozy policeman. But the manuscript is simply devoid of one-liners, wit, humor or punch lines of the verbal or physical nature that this kind of movie requires. The result is that it promotes smile at best, rather than guffaws. It oozes charm, but is boringly short of humor.
