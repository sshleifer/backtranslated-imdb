It's just a bad movie. Not as bad as R.I.C.C.O. but bad. I got hooked on beginging, so completely lost me after that. The action was far away and then went very far away. Don't watch this movie at all costs, believe me with my whole heart !!!! The executives, who are brothers, are not the next HUGHES BROTHERS who made really good films such as DEAD PRESIDENTS, FROM HELL, AMERICAN PIMP and MENACE II SAMSUNG. The only person who made me see this was Paris Campbell, who will be a great actor one day if he does better movies than this. Christina Caparoula also did a good job for what she got. I hope the best one is 10 times better than this piece of shit!
