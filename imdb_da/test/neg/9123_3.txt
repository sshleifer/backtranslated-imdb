I really don't think producer George Lucas really set up to make such an awful sequel as "More American Graffiti" appeared. But gradually, it was the first crack in his apparently impenetrable armor. Coming straight from the great success of "American Graffiti" and produced essentially simultaneously with "Star Wars", this movie was the first that Lucas successfully took away from Coppola without having to bother himself. The result is typical Lucas - far more interesting in terms of its structure and the way it is edited than the material itself. Author / director Bill Norton has been allowed to use a variety of screen ratios and split screens to produce odd associations in the images. While it is interesting to see the ironic parallels of the 4 stories, the style ultimately reveals only the broken nature of the movie. Lucas' brilliant original film was about a group of friends on the archetypal "last big night" before the end of the school, and Kurt (Ron Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) have to go to college. One thing that made the movie work, even though it is very episodic, is that you had the core features at the beginning and they come back together at the end. There is a disposition of time, as in Nick Ray's "Rebel Without a Cause", where a certain period becomes very elastic and makes more sense than such a particular time would really in real life, but everything happens in a static space. "More American graffiti" is basically the opposite - space is very dynamic, with Toad (Charles Martin Smith) in Vietnam, his former boyfriend Debbie (Candy Clark) partying with hippies in San Francisco, Steve and Laurie (Cindy Williams) involved in student protests in Berkeley, and John Miler (Paul Le Mat) towing on semi-pro circuit. In a compound meeting early in the film, all the principles are gathered together to see John race, but after that the threads do not come together again and weave each other as they do in the original. Instead, they are split and we follow the signs for about 3 years, and we just see different events on New Year's Eve in what seems to be 1967, 68 and 69. It's easy for the audience to get confused and I think it's fair to Say we do it. While the original film seemed to condense important events and rites of passages into unreal theatrical times, which produced an experience of nostalgia even for those who never experienced these events, this sequel draws and stretches the few plot points from the epilogue. to make them a coherent film. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the movie for me are those with Candy Clark in SF and Charles Martin Smith in Nam. Some of the jokes fall flat, but the style of these sections is interesting and they make a nice contrast to each other. A good movie might have been made if those parts were a little better and if the other parts were not such a move. Talking about towing, the whole plot with Milner speaking to a foreign student was really paralyzed, unfunny and throwing in Mackenzie Phillips for a cameo, didn't help at all. It was just another distinct moment, as when they briefly explain why Curt is not in the movie because he is already in Canada. Instead, Laurie has another brother who is largely identical to Curt but has a different name and is now played by a very boring actor. There is a sort of satire to some of the Vietnamese things, much like what I could imagine that Lucas and John Milius's original idea of ​​"Apocalypse Now" would have been like. And there's some of the manic fun in San Francisco scenes that made the first movie fun. But still with the fun stuff, you have the rest of the movie pulling it down, as if anyone would see Steve and Laurie argue in their horrible suburban residency, as if they were auditioning for a Spielberg movie on divorce and child abandonment . I think that even though those parts of the movie were not so painful, it would still not be comparable to the first movie because there is no closure and no sense to get back together or someone has learned anything. It was just a kind of end at the time when they ran out of money or something, a cheap freezer frame of "Two-Lane Blacktop" and so many better movies. <br /> <br /> As the original, however, this movie has a fantastic soundtrack of period hits that are probably worth owning for their own sake and almost making the movie itself taste. The performances of Country Joe and Fish are amazing, and Scott Glenn all duded up as a hippie in love with Candy Clark's sight to behold - I wonder if even when he had to use a wig? I couldn't possibly recommend this movie, and yet it has a little bit of love in my heart because I love the original so much. Every few decades, I think I have to try this movie to make sure it's really as worthless as I remember. It's a party killer, but it's something that any fan of "American Graffiti" or George Lucas will generally see at least once or twice. It shows how a lot of effort can go into something and it can still turn out pretty half baked. It makes you reflect on how much of a miracle it is that Lucas actually made such a good movie as "American Graffiti" in the first place, as if all the elements were in place and all the appropriate gods had been plagued. Unfortunately, this was not the case for this movie or for Bill Norton.
