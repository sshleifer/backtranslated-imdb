I like to think I can appreciate a movie that is a bit out of the ordinary and I certainly love a good movie that makes me think. <br /> <br /> If you like the ordinary movies that make you think, look elsewhere. This movie is so bad and so inconsistent that the only thing you think it is over is how it is possible that you waste 90 minutes in your life and see it here. <br /> <br /> A movie of this kind needs a driver to buy from the viewer. Why are we interested in the main characters? What motivates these characters through their existence? Why do they make the decisions they make? This film makes a very weak attempt to do these and fails in the process. There is no chemistry between these two actors, both are excellent in their ability to be comfortable in any role. So why did they fail here? I strongly feel that they did not know what their motivations were, and when an actor does not know, their audience cannot follow. Overall, I've seen macromedia flash videos being offered more in the way of provoking thoughts, at least I'm more interested in the morphed hamster who likes the moon than why this married family man would risk it all for one " Code 46 "violation.
