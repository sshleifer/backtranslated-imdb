I didn't like this movie. I rented it and hoped it would be something like the 10th kingdom. I was disappointed when I discovered that it was not. I also found it just plain nerve-wracking. The action was bad, the signs how incredible and the time jumped were crazy. I only recommend this movie if you are in the mood to see a crazy guy running around, but I'm sure there are better movies with the same thing. I can't believe I wasted my time on this one.
