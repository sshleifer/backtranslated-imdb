This movie is anything but the true story of Phoolan Devi. Director Shekhar Kapoor's claim is counteracted by the fact that he made the whole movie without even meeting Phoolan Devi on whose life this movie should be based! The excuse to meet the woman would have interfered with the director's perception of history! The film does not allow the community to be sensitized by the situation of low-cast women in Indian society and ends up as a stereotype depicting Phoolan Devi as a sour woman whose only motivation is revenge. No wonder this Shekhar Kapoor's movie was successful in the west, as it was catered for by their non-bollywood taste!
