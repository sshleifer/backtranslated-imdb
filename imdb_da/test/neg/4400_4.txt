The Palestinian situation is fertile and yet largely background soil for film production. "Divine Intervention" is trying hard and giving us an insight into the almost surreal life of those who are afflicted by the problems, but the film represents a little more than a handful of (admirable) visual jokes thrown on celluloid while the links between them becomes increasingly unclear as the film progresses. A missed opportunity to say something more coherent about a very topical problem.
