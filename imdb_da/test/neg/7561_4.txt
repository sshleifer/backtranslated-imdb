A better movie could have been made to portray Bosnia's tragedy. Some parts are very effective, and the film does well to give an idea of ​​the people's suffering, especially the children, but generally it looks like a movie and more like a documentary. Woody Harrelson is very good but the rest of the throw has worked well without being extraordinary. Should be monitored to get a rough idea of ​​what the war did for the children in Bosnia. If you expect a big and moving movie, Welcome ...... will be a disappointment.
