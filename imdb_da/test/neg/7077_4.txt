STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very good *** Okay ** You could go for a meal instead * Avoid at all costs <br /> <br /> The story of the titular Adam (Mark O 'Halloran) and Paul (Tom Murphy), two heroin addicts in the slum districts in Dublin and their daily amblings about in their senseless lives, searching for the next solution that will make their day. Along the way, they try to unite with close family and friends as they have managed to let down and destroy over the years. <br /> <br /> I know that many Irish people like to drink, but it seems to have some of the problems with heroin also in the appearance of this movie. I know that there is a bit of a drug problem over there, as if there are many places in the world, so another humorous takeover of the subject is not a totally unexpected thing. <br /> <br /> I don't remember the last Irish movie I saw (the movie is shot in a style that makes it stand out from any movie I've seen lately!) And I'm clear that I not as enlightened on their humor as I could be. The movie is pretty funny in some parts, but of course, it's another comedy that's not afraid to travel close-knots. The scene where the mentally handicapped boy is robbed behind an alley is certainly true of what a couple of junkies can do to feed their habit, but it is still despicable and I am not sure if it was meant like dark humor in any way, but it certainly didn't make a smile on my face! It is also in stark contrast to their previous actions, where they are seen, and show their soft side rocking a baby back and forth. In light of this, some may find the end sad, others may see it as just desserts. Overall, I just failed to see the point on the film. I saw no motivation in the "story" as it tells. It seems to struggle together without involving the audience in any way. Unlike Trainspotting (which dealt with similar themes!) It is a failed effort for the most part that had me on the verge of sipping, although it is very short 83 minute run time. Really no more comfortable than following two real junkies around in one day. **
