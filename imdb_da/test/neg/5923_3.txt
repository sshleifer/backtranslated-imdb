I really liked the idea of ​​traveling between dimensions and I even liked the Wade / Quinn thrill of early episodes. Some of the worlds they created gave the protagonists extremely interesting backgrounds for their stories. But when the show took place, there were more stupid disputes among friends and less of a true band. There was less wonder and excitement as they were involved in other worlds and more discouraging. And every world had one of the characters in love. The script was just boring and everything was too over the top. Too bad it would have been nice to have a close band of friends (a la Star Wars) traveling to different dimensions on TV for years, rather than a tired band of knit pickers.
