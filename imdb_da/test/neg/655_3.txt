I was pretty excited to watch this movie when it came out. Advertising for that made it look, and I generally think of Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock, and the combination of the two seemed to be an interesting idea. Unfortunately, I was terribly disappointed with the nurse Betty. Personally, I have usually found that graphic violence and comedy do not go so well together, and the only directors who have ever combined the two successfully, in my opinion, are Tarantino and Coens. There is not so much violence in the nurse Betty, but what violence is in it made me feel weird when I was laughing. Of course, for me, part of the problem was that there weren't many places where I was asked. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't seem like a drama either. Renee Zellweger's Betty, the protagonist of the story, is clinically insane and impossible to relate to in any real way. I would say that Zellweger works quite well, and Freeman, Rock and Greg Kinnear all do good jobs as well. The problem is in the writing; Freeman is the only person who gets an interesting character. It's really bad. 3.10
