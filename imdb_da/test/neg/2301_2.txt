This movie is the last straw in a list of movies I've seen this week that has pushed me over the edge and forced me to join IMDb and spread a warning to the public. It was terrible. The film was pulled out and painfully boring. The sound, the effects and even the picture quality seemed to come from Willow (1988) or perhaps even Conan the Barbarian (1982). The battle of Bannockburn was absolutely absurd. This "biggest filmed reconstruction of medieval struggle ever staged in the British Isles" made me snicker. There was not a continuous formation at all, just a few guys with spears and horses running right through them. Douglas scenes, especially in the last match, were simply horrible as most of the film was.
