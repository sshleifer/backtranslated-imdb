The seats lied to me again. <br /> <br /> The marketing of this flick was deep in contrast to the content; 'explosive'? When I read the synopsis for this movie, I expected to see a city life of grotesque, every man-jack of them blood pressure and the flare of alcohol, whipped by heroin needles and bent double with chronic masturbation; into such a "dim" would come the sharp heroes, shining Gabriel. Instead, the movie was the complete opposite of what I was expecting. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie showed us that Middletown is a simple little place full of poor people doing the best they can whether we do a little bit to get the ends to meet, drink to forget about the pain or to see cockfighters (chickens, not penises) to remove the boredom. In other words, the cities were desperately common. The only (conscious?) Grotesque in the play was Gabriel, the brainwashed presbyterian preacher played by the Macfady whose face is built in such a way as to suggest a permanent air of confused rage. If I were kind, I would suggest that the Preacher's Paisleyite ransom was a witty commentary designed to make us despise Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is unfortunate a filmmaker that you quickly despise everyone in the movie, giving the audience the opportunity to pursue their way through thirty-eight minutes of dark, hackneyed tedium. My only respite from this waste of celluloid was a game of "guessing the accent" broken up with rounds of "spot spot." Are we surprised that Gaybo ends up stealing his brother's child and choking his father? Of course not; He is a bible-bashing preacher and therefore psychotic. All citizens are standing around looking shocked at the end of the movie, but I suppose they have just understood what a turkey they have put their names on. <br /> <br /> The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission has a budget to use, but there are better projects than this weak company. The only kind of thing I can say in favor of this movie is that it has managed to replace "Superman Returns" as the worst movie in 2006; a hell of a performance. <br /> <br /> v1: 20061114 v2: 20080107
