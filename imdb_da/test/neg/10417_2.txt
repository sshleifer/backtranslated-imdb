I like Steve Buscemi. I like her work a lot, both as an actor and an instructor. You can say I'm-non-Steve Buscemi. And Steve Buscemi freak. I shit Steve Buscemi. <br /> <br /> I remember when I first saw Buscemi's full-length direct debut, "Trees Lounge". I enjoyed the movie, even though it wasn't as good as it could have been. It was - on the other hand. It scared almost the itch, the gap in seeing "small" movies about "small" people in "small" bars that are in "small" cities. It was close enough to where I would say it was a very good movie - one that with a few tweaks could have been great. But it's okay. I like the movie and I've seen it more than once. <br /> <br /> But this review is not about the Trees Lounge. It's about "Lonesome Jim." When I saw the film's description, and then I saw who was the movie, I was thrilled with the prospect of finally watching the movie, as I knew Trees Lounge could have been. But what I actually experienced was not, unlike leaving one of those smalltown bars with a belly full of cheap whiskey and an armful of cheap floozy, heading back to your apartment with a mushy brain full of exciting prospects that inevitably dissolve in fact, alcohol-induced impotence and head spin regurgitation. In other words, this movie left me flat and unjustified and apologized for wasting the time and money it took me to get to the state - the movie equivalent to wake up next to the cheap floozy the next morning or if You happen to be floozy, waking up next to the smelly and farting and unheard of imbecile. The film had all the contents of an obsolete white bread sandwich (with the shop noticing white bread, no less) and the feeling of a carcass. I'm not sure what the meaning of this movie was, and having a kind of point and not an exercise in abstract surrealism that can come without without one, this lack of a point is a sin of neglect. Sorta like the new cars that don't come with ashtrays anymore, although there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them, but hi, I can sympathize). All in all, it was a boring movie about boring people who bored things and had none of the gravel and credibility that can carry and store such a movie. I mean, Trees Lounge was about boring people who bored things, but it was interesting. <br /> <br /> I owe much of this on Affleck. Why do people casting these Affleck keep up? They suck life out of something they are connected to. One Affleck was in a decent movie (and it wasn't even the reason why the movie was decent) and suddenly every butthole called Affleck is stinking as many movies as possible. And Liv Tyler is not better. Being a daughter of a rock star does not necessarily make an actress. She is as lifeless as Affleck. These people simply do not travel from the flat side of the script. People pay to watch movies, and they deserve to see actors and actresses with a little charisma - these two duds together have no spark from the old guy who handles shopping carts at Wal Mart. I always thought Steve Buscemi was the kind of guy who would rise above this kind of guy, but oh, Steve, you let us down. This movie makes me want to get into another chipper.
