This movie is so bad that they have to burn the master. You can't ruin the plot because this movie doesn't have one. The graphics are less than false, they are terrible. Then you have fallen through the landscape star gazer work-a-holic, jumping between its own lunacy and the crazy preacher's crazy rites. & when he finally makes it to DC, they don't even have a decency to kill him; the monster (which you do not know at that time) already dies, but how ... who knows and of course has the ultimate juicy end ... everyone else on the planet is dead or dying, but his family and a handful of stragglers survive. Imagine it! This will be the movie that C Thomas Howell will go to his grave and regret that he has ever played. It gives him enough nightmares.
