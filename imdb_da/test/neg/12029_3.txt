Detective Burt Williams has been on the trail of the infamous Poe killer for almost three years. Burt's daughter Kris Williams, a murder ban for the FBI along with his partner, Sean Michaels, takes over. Burt reluctantly retires and retires. next seven months, "Poe Killer" continues with his murderous rampage until Kris discovers that the killer is using internet chat to seduce his prey. She logs in as Annabel Lee and quickly gets caught by Poe killer. It's time for Burt to find a sadist and release his daughter before it's too late. A moratorium and at all braindead horror flick without excitement and a little uncomfortable doing. The act is hilariously horrible, the characters are painfully stupid and the killer is not threatening. I have seen worse indie horror flicks .3 out of 10
