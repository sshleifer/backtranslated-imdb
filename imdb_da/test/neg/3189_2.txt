One night at McCools you want to believe it's a hip and smart black comedy. It pushes its "quirky" characters and "outrageous" situations on the viewer as a crack dealer doing overtime. The principle is about a gold digger named Jewel, who kills men to make them steal and sometimes murder, so she can get all the worldly things she desperately wants. You know it wouldn't be a bad strategy if she was chasing after rich guys. This movie will really have one to think that a foxy con artist would waste time dating bartenders and Andrew "Dice" Clay. Please. This big mistake in Jewel's scheme is really the only entertainment that exists in this stink (and it is unintentional). To see it, it's not hard to believe that there might have been a good movie inside it somewhere. One night at McCool just couldn't decide which direction it wanted to take, so sat in the middle of the road like a dead armadillo. It tries to be sexy, but no clothes are removed on the camera, and the few scenes in the body head are terrible pedestrians. There is a recurring scene where a hitman asks the protagonist (played by Matt Dillon) about how sexy Jewel is. It seems that Matt doesn't even know the viewers. Why did he meet her anyway? One night at Mccool will also be fun. Sorry, bizarre coincidence and misunderstandings didn't even work at Three's Company. What's worse is that this movie really seemed like it went for a dark atmosphere to accompany its comedy. Kind of like a sophomoric Coen brothers movie, but its shallow script couldn't play subtlety, nor could it be its lightweight dirction sledge hammer in any shock. What the audience is back with is a movie that seems to be busy trying to please everyone and just drop any appeal along the way.
