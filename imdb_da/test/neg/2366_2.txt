A good ol 'boy movie is almost required to have moonshine, car chases, a story that has a vague resemblance to "plotting" and at least a very beautiful country gal, barefoot with short shorts and a low top. The beautiful gal is here (dressed in designer jeans) - but the redneck conditions stop there. Jimmy Dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman, but as a hard guy former sheriff, he comes up short. Big John is great, but he's not convincing with the "bad" part of his moniker. Bug-eyed Jack Elam is a ticket as always, and Bo Hopkins has played the same role for decades; Down Beatty also does his role in a small role ... but there is no history. It smells more like an episode of In The Heat of the Night than a feature film. Cornball cornpone with slightly predictable mood. Perhaps the most brilliant problem with this movie is Charlie Daniels, who sings the theme. You know one; It was made famous by ... Jimmy Dean.
