I just saw today you die. It's bad, almost very bad. <br /> <br /> 1) The direction and editing are horrible, just awful. Almost made me turn off the movie, Fauntleroy (the director) has no idea what he is doing, he seems to film things randomly and some scenes make no sense. I also hate it when the same scene is used again in the same movie, in this movie some scenes were used 3 or 4 times. Very bad. <br /> <br /> 2) The dialogue is sometimes good, sometimes awful. I like that they wanted to get Seagal's character and Treach's character to seem like they were in a similar relationship to the signs of deadly weapons, but it didn't just work because some of the dialogue didn't make SENSE and I speak English a lot Well, it's not that I didn't understand the words, it was the fact that the jokes and dialogue lines didn't make any sense. <br /> <br /> 3) The script is pretty bad. Why are they always trying to complicate DTV action movies? Seagal's wife in the movie has psychic abilities, why? Is it helpful to film? NONE. Seagal eliminates a whole lot of people working for the guy who betrayed him, and he knows these people without ever meeting them in the movie. STUPID. The story sometimes goes and jumps back without any reason. The story is messy and pointless sometimes. They should have kept it simple and it would have worked. <br /> <br /> 4) In some of the action scenes, it's not Seagal, it's his stunt double. You can tell because they only film him from behind and never show his face. He also beats the guys with video-fighting sports, not really like aikido Steven. The stunt doubles using cheesy kicks and blows. <br /> <br /> 5) Steven is good at the movie. 90-95% of the lines are said with their real voice. The rest is copying, but it's not that bad. This was good. Also Steven seems to enjoy himself in the movie and is more in the act he was immersed in. He likes Treach as a partner; at least he does not seem to like him. He also seems to have been in better shape than in some of his latest films. I hate the fact that he wears clothes to hide his body, but in the same clothes he wears on the DVD deck, he looks more than OK, and he should have used these clothes for most of the movie, not the stupid long leather jacket. <br /> <br /> I really think Seagal was willing to make a good movie. The fact that he arrived late and departed early from the sentence ON TWO MOVIES directed by Fauntleroy does not look like a coincidence to me. I think he realized that the crew was amateur or just in it for a quick buck, and he gave no more despair. <br /> <br /> In the hands of a better company and crew, this could have been an amazingly good action movie for Seagal. Something like justice or the law. I believe it honestly. But the people who made the movie are not very good at their jobs, or they didn't have enough money to do the job properly. Too bad when I liked Steven in the movie and Treach was also cool (Ice Cool), but the rest was bad. Hi, at least it gives me hope of the black day and shadow of the past. I think Mercenary might be just as badly handled. But hey, Steven seemed to be back in the same mood he was in while making his better movies and at least that's enough reason to watch the movie. <br /> <br /> I liked it, but it could have been so much better. 4.10
