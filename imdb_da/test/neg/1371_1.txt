I'm sorry, but this guy is not fun. I swear that I heard heard that 4-year-olds come with better jokes, then some of his. For example, "Dee dee dee" is the worst catch phrase I've ever heard. It lacks any creativity whatsoever, and making fun of mentally challenged people once you have reached the level of having your own show is incredibly dim-witted in the Mencia's part. <br /> <br /> Although everyone compares this fool to Chappelle, theirs is no competition. First they had very different shows. I think all in all, Menica's show on average only had about 2 short 5 minute sketches between his 10 minute rants that God knows what. Chappelle's show came out more like sketch comedy, with 2-4 sketches that occupied the whole show. All the chappelle did was a brief summary of each shit before and after each one. This is where Mencia fails even more. What would make Mencia seem to have a show consisting of the same standup comedy that he talks about on his standup specials would be a beneficial idea? Has anyone really wanted to listen to a little George Lopez, who was pioneering years before Mencia, but just knocked over the point where it was dead? Snowflake is chance in hell. My point is, although most people hate this guy for his rascism, I just can't hold him for his imcompetence. Comedy Central was looking for a minority that they could feel as "controversial" and then let him follow Chappelle's path. The problem is that this guy made it very clear that he wouldn't be Chappelle. So instead, he performs his villainous show as a burning railroad straight into the ground. Do anyone want to see a weekly standup about the same things every Thursday, I certainly know as hell, I don't. <br /> <br /> I cannot express my gratitude to Comedy Central though. This idiot's show is complete. Personally, after seeing his standup, I don't know how he got his own show in the first place. There are so many more deserving comics like Jim Gafigan, Zach Galifinakis, etc. In fact, someone is better than this fool.
