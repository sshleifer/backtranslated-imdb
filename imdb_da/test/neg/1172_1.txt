The story of Ed Gein is a disturbing and scary story. Ed was really a shocked character, and his legacy continued to inspire such "greats" as The Tooth Fairy, Norman Bates and Leatherface. How is it that such a fascinating man has inspired such a boring melodramatic piece? Ed Gein made belts out of nipples, bowls out of skulls, lamps out of the skin, danced around under the moon in suits of human skin. None of this made it to the movie because they had to give us a fictional story of a ridiculously horrible substitute and his rather homely, sex-hungry girlfriend. This movie seemed to go out of its way of forging the story. What confuses me is that most movies are removed from the path of truth to exaggerate the story; This seems to do so to minimize it. I just don't understand that.
