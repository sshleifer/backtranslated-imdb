I must say I'm not a massive fan of Troma movies. Allowed, I've only seen three of them (or four among them), but two (Blood Sucking Freaks and Mothers Day) are reputable for being the best, making me believe that all the others are not worth seeing . It would certainly seem to be the case with Graduation Day, which is a Troma take on the over-popular eighties slasher. While the film is never particularly bad (given the movie), it is also not very good either; and at the end everything I could think of was 'why did I find it difficult to see this?' Nevertheless, the plot looks some girls die on a race track, and shortly thereafter; more people are starting to die. Of course, there are a few possible suspects; But it is hard to really worry about something that happens. Of course, in slasher terms; That's the most important thing, and given Troma's track record where the red stuff is worried, I was expecting it. There are some decent sledding scenes, and some of them are gory; But it is never very shocking, which really just makes this second boring slasher based on a festive event on the American calendar. It is worth noting that there is a small role in this movie for sleaze queen Linnea Quigley, but the rest of the cast is not worth mentioning. The direction, the plot and its execution are all very secular; and I want to say, unless you are a big Troma fan or someone who wants to track all the slasher ever made; Don't bother with this movie.
