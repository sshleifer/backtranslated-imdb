This movie is available as a special "bonus" feature on the double disc of Horror 101 & Horror 102: Endgame. It has nothing to do with these movies unless it shows that producers / directors Dudelson and Clavell are in a rut. Like the other films, this young young people who go to a building where they are trapped and run down the hall have been picked by one after another. Ultimately, one or more characters are revealed to have a different identity. This is by far the worst of the three. Here people are invited to a Halloween night only opening of the Museum of the Dead. The museum does not have many exhibits and they are all kind of old Central American related. There are also meat-eating, infection-spreading zombies in the museum as well as an old cannibal warrior and two female warriors. <br /> <br /> The movie is very repetitive. It kills people very quickly, until the time you wonder who they should have left to kill - at which point more people appear without explanation so they can be killed. <br /> <br /> Amazingly, one of the characters has a cell phone and can actually call the police, who actually take it seriously and appear at the museum. When trying to select the lock to enter, the other tells that it would be "forced entry." If you've got people trapped in a damaged building, I think it's irrelevant. The police are also stupid as they shoot a zombie in the head, it goes down, but then the other zombies shoot in the chest and they do not go down. They happen to shoot another zombie in the head and it goes down. They continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest. Stupid. <br /> <br /> The opening credits and a nightmare sequence are done in a kind of animation effect over video, a wretched life's kind of thing, but not so cartoonish. It's interesting, but parts of some of the attacks are done the same way, so there's no logic to it. <br /> <br /> Terrible.
