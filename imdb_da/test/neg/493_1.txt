This is the movie based on the end of Rob Halford of British Metal's 'Judas Priest' and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to present a priest-tribute band. Originally the title Metal Good this movie could have been something good. Instead, someone in an office has a place that knows little about nothing about metal music, decided to wander it down. From the title front of Metal Good to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack, this movie plays hard. After spending most of my life in a professional metal band so I really look forward to seeing this, I was very disappointed with several points in the movie. The soundtrack is very NOT metal for one, and the end of the movie is also lame. The film has a few bright spots in the writing and the action, but on the whole it fails at last because ... 1) A movie based on a metal band must have a metal soundtrack. 2) There is no metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of ​​'heavy metal', watch this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio & Black Sabbath is your idea of ​​metal, watch this movie for a good laugh.
