If you described any of the scenes; nightmares of children murdering you in your sleep, your baby daughter talking to ghosts and searching for your lost child in an abandoned mine at night, so appalled for fear that you cannot move even if the blood of a killer kills on you from the floor over ?? Then I say you had a horror movie. But some how 'evil little things' were just not scary. I am a horror fan and I loved the location, the reason in the principal and I liked the three leading ladies. I didn't want to see them get hurt, I wanted the "bad guy" to get his just desserts, the rest of the casting is always simply gun food, so I didn't care about them and it played out every clich√© in the book - right down to the torch battery that runs out into the pitch, just as you start here whispering voices closing in on you. I still recommend that you see it, but unless you're new to horror movies or under 12, you've seen it all before.
