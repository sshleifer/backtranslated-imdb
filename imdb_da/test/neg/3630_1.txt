Blonde protagonist, always believe in everyone, and when you stick together you can do something! Shy guy best friend with curly hair (rip off of Gordo) wants to be a movie instructor having a secret in love with zoey. Spanish best friend (rip off of miranda) oddly smart girl quinn (rip off of larytudem) and the popular stock up prep logan (rip off kate) and zoey's little brother max, annoying (rip off of matt) <br /> <br /> Zoey is the semi-popular girl, with 2 best friends. The only thing missing is the fun little sacral cartoon Lizzie Mcguire, and Hillary Duff was very cuter. Jamie Lynn Spears looks more like a toothpaste in a tube top.
