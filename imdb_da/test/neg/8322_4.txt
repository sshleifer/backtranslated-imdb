This movie is horrible and does not blame Jesus Franco because it is not his fault. <br /> <br /> This movie was shot quietly for many years by Welles as he made the money bring a crew and the actors together to make some shots. How much movie Welles has actually shot is not clear, although not all the movies or all the sequences are here, as several "key" sequences, such as Quixote in a movie theater, are in the hands of collectors or backers who would not give them up. The movie here is just under two hours and I would be hard pressed to imagine that it ever really works in any way. I am of the opinion, based on several comments that Welles made before his death, that he never really intended to release the movie, but put it together as a personal toy. <br /> <br /> What is here is mostly beautifully shot, but dramatically dead. Very little happens for the first hour, except for Quixote and Sancho, who wander around the country. Sad would be a friendly description of the material. In the second hour, Quixote ends in modern Spain and in a number of non-good sequences deals with everyday life. This is not to say that there are no good moments, the windmill and the chicken sequences are pretty good, but it is largely a big waste of film and time. <br /> <br /> "Completed" by Jesus Franco, who was Welles' assistant director at the very superior Chimes at Midnight, we have a bunch of movie fragments that have been put together as well as possible. Many have crucified Franco for the reason that the film stinks, but honestly you can't make a good movie from crap material. A critic has gone on record when he saw another piece of the movie in the 1970s, which meant Franco made this version on his own and destroyed it. Though it may be true, I have been driving stories about Welles cutting and circumcising the film many times over the years, as he could never get it right. <br /> <br /> This movie is horrible, no matter how you cut it. <br /> <br /> In the end, I just fail how good a film producer Welles was. Except for Citizen Kane, almost all of his films have been plagued by a lack of budget or disturbance, so we are left with the excuse that many of his films "would have been better if only ...". How do we know that? How can we know that? Maybe Welles was a man with less talent than we thought, and many of his borderline movies are just not that good and would never have been. Although this is no place to argue for Welles' place in film history, it is surviving material in Don Quixote, assuming it is approaching what Welles intends (I think so), a good case to rethink how we sees the man and his work. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for the good sequences (although 2 out of 10 are probably closer to reality)
