I've had more boring 80-minute stretches in my life, but no one is going to think right now. Hell Ride is based on the retro cult 70s theme that Tarantino brought back and did right in films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is, unlike PF and RD, the story is garbage and so is character development. How many movies does Bishop think he can blatantly steal from? The brief case in Pulp Fiction, the air gun in No Country etc. Etc. Talking about Bishop What the hell is he doing in this movie? I couldn't help laughing at the scenes where he stood with the pelvis despite, desperately trying to act as a hardened biker. Nothing in this movie is credible. And why Dennis Hopper? Do they really need the Easy Rider motif too? I blame Larry Bishop for his horrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his failed leadership role attempts. Don't watch this movie, it's a waste of time.
