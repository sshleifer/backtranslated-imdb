Buddy Ackerman's role is not stretch for Kevin Spacey. He has played the version of the character many times other, better movies. This is fortunate because it gives his performance some resonance without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as any other sign in this pointless little farce. The script leaves some time for plot or character development that resembles a porn flip in its bustle to get to the "good things". The difference is that here the "good things" do not please people, but cause pain, making it appropriate to look for young adults. Of course, there is nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to see people who have sex and I do not think there is anything wrong with "shark swimming" if you want to see people going through physical, emotional and psychological torture. But if you're looking for sharp satire, interesting characters, or anything else that even tries to engage you more than your basic passion, you should look elsewhere.
