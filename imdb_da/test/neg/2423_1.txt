Coach Preachy or Straight Sappy. It's bad to write combined with even worse acting. You can choose to drink the Gatorad of this after school special, but I didn't even do that, it was the 20th Toby Robbins / Islander philosophy, motivational moment. It's too much to be entertaining and not content enough to be informative. I have respect for the coach and the program this movie is inspired by, but the move itself is horrible. As one who has played rugby for almost 20 years in the states, I had hoped for a better rugby movie (even the one who has something to do with rugby). And I can tell you that Haka performed by a bunch of Haoles and Islanders is not scary (like when done today by All Blacks, serious boys, everyone has seen it is time to remove it). If you want real intimidation, you need to lens up against a bunch of South Africans (the real rugby scouts). This is a fake and badly made movie about being a true and good person.
