this movie was not good. I thought it would be a cute Disney movie like in the original. wrong. It was awkward for Christina Ricci, who I expect so much more than this, you could just tell by seeing. I think Doug E. Doug did the best he could. Sit 5-year-olds in front of this, all the elderly, and they can start to fall asleep.
