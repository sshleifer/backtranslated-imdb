Up until around 1970, Lucille Ball was a great comedienne. She was such a perfect clown I just want more people to have seen her with Bob Hope in "The Facts of Life" because she could also make dry deaths. as well as slapstick .. Yep, Lucille Ball was wonderful. . . until "Mame." <br /> <br /> Trying to see Lucille Ball in "Mame" is physically impossible because there is so much vaseline on the already filtered lenses that you want Windex to see Lucille Ball in some scenes. So even if you see Lucille Ball in "Mame", you can't really see Lucille Ball in "Mame". It's a blessing. It's about the best I can say about "Mame", the movie of the film of the film (this could continue, but it started with a very funny book called "Aunt Mame"). Giving this a bad rap is like beating a sponge. So it doesn't matter that the music is croaked rather than sung. Most songs were not much, anyway. There is no difference in the first three. "It's Today", "Open a New Window", and "We Need a Little Christmas" are all the same songs. Celene Dion has to make an album with them, they are so big and boring. The killer ballad "If he entered my life today" needs a confident, gorgeous voice (Edyie Gorme won a Grammy to do so in 1967) that the bad Lucille Ball did not have when making this movie. (True, Elaine Stritch also can't hold a tune in a bucket, but at least Stritch can transmit a song.) <br /> <br /> If you still feel your life doesn't become complete unless you watch the movie musical "Mame", note how dancing in it, but when Lucy / Mame starts doing something beyond a palsied shuffle, the camera cuts off, returns straight when the number is over and the star stands with the dancers. Again, it's just as good. Jane Connell had to reproduce the role of pathetic Agnes Gooch after Lucille Ball had Madeline Kahn fired to make sure no comic originality would upstage the star. Connell is a stage performer who, like Carol Channing and Ethyl Merman, cannot scale down her screenings for movies, so she stops Lucille Ball being embarrassing, but for various reasons. The sumptuous dresses are by Theadora Van Runkle (Van Wrinkle?) And they lack color in all along with one of the moldings. <br /> <br /> Bea Arthur as actress Vera Charles, Mame's best friend, ignores everyone and does her own fun thing. If only she were in several scenes. She is too old for her role too, but at least she didn't get it.
