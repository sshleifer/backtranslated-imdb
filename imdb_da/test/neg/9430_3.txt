It may be, although there are still two or three that I have missed. This film builds an interesting nocturnal cityscape reminiscent of so many foggy scenes from Sherlock Holmes movies, and populate it with eerie, Kafka-esque characters. In their midst, the movie Mia Farrow, which sounds like she's still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, seems to be repeating her nebbish role from Play It Again Sam. Should we laugh at his stuttering and twisting? I suppose I would if the rest of the movie was clearly a comedy, but it's not. At least I don't think it is.
