Not just why? But "what did they think?" This must have been some kind of payback to Gus Van Sant, because this is one of the odd films <br /> <br /> that should never have been (re-made). It aims to be Hitchcock's movie <br /> <br /> frame by frame, but without the magic or excitement or the big movie <br /> <br /> does. Rent the original instead, save yourself.
