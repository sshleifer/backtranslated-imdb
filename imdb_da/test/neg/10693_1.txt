Odious Chuck Norris decided to put a final nail in the coffin <br /> <br /> containing his film career before going to CBS 'safe world <br /> <br /> Saturday night celebration with this hysterical bad supernatural <br /> < br /> action. <br /> <br /> For such a silly movie, this thing is surely plotty. Norris is Chicago <br /> <br /> Crimean Frank Shatter. First, what kind of surname is "Shatter"? <br /> <br /> Have you ever met any Shatters? Genforum.com has no listing for <br /> <br /> surname Shatter, which opens any half-smart viewer to <br /> <br /> replaces "a" in Shatter with a "i." He and his partner, Calvin <br /> Jackson, make the same old companion routine you have seen <br /> <br /> before: make fun of pimps and make their captain angry. <Br /> <br /> Jackson looks like Whoopi Goldberg's theoretical love children <br /> <br /> and Rick James quickly bears on his nerves with his constant <br /> <br /> complaints and Eddie Murphy's patented facial expressions . <br /> <br /> Shatter and Calvin get involved in a Satanian envoy, <br /> <br /> who we've been introduced to in too long opening scenes. <br /> <br /> Prosatano is a demon locked in a king Richard crypt <br /> <br /> Lionhearted. The demon scepter, from which he gets his power, is busted in nine and hidden in nine different parts of the holy men of the world. In 1951, some diggers let in accidentally <br /> <br /> Prosatano out and he starts collecting the nine. He pamperes himself as an antique professor named Lockley and <br /> <br /> is always a lecture where a holy man is killed <br /> <br /> and a piece of the scepter is taken. <br/> <br /> Norris brings his "Walker: Texas Blunder" cohort Sheree Wilson, <br /> <br />, which plays Lockley's assistant. She helps Norris with her <br /> <br /> study, they make goo goo eyes on each other and our <br /> <br /> intrepid investigators travel to Israel after a rabbi is killed in <br /> < br /> Chicago. In Israel, Calvin is even more complaining <br /> <br /> about: the heat, the lack of restaurant accommodation, the miserable <br /> <br /> drivers and the fact that he lacks the Chicago Bulls playoff <br /> < br /> games. Norris even manages to work a cute Israeli child in this <br /> <br /> nightmare. Bezi steals Calvin's wallet and hangs around the men, <br /> <br /> directing them around Israel and not raising any kind of suspicion. <br /> <br /> Finally, Lockley (Prosatano) gathers all the explosives <br /> <br /> but needs the blood of royalty to finish the ceremony <br /> <br /> and call the devil. Where to find royal blood? Well, Sherees <br /> <br /> Dad is a Duke! She has an American accent, but she is the practical method of forcing this monstrosity to its inevitable conclusion. Of course, this minion of Satan can have killed countless hundreds over the years, but how will he <br /> <br /> turn against a good old-fashioned American buttock? > <br /> After Prosatano has been defeated, killed by his own burst (I <br/> <br /> envied him, he didn't have to see Bezi stealing Calvin's wallet <br /> <br /> again) being treated to a horrible coda that involves a bearded man <br /> <br /> who's been watching Shutter, I mean Shatter and Calvin on their quest. You see, it was predicted ... somewhere ... that two <br /> West / West warriors would defeat Prosatano. The quiet <br /> <br /> bearded man who looked over the couple was none other than <br /> <br /> Jesus ... I don't ask you. He is listed as "Prophet" at the end credits <br /> <br /> but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle Christian <br /> <br /> reference filmmakers are trying to exhibit here. <As in "I use a Walker: Texas Ranger," Norris is aging and cannot <br /> <br /> get into his fighting scenes for much more. He kicks a lot and <br /> <br /> people fly over furniture in slow motion, and then Norris gives all his lines in his monotonous voice. Oh, what real <br /> <br /> instructor might be able to get out of him! His brother, Aaron <br /> <br /> who has also directed him in other movies, has no meaning on the story <br /> <br /> or momentum. Scenes are thrown for ego, not <br /> <br /> entertain. The scenes when the dynamic duo first meets Bezi pulls <br /> <br /> again and again, Bezi is not so important to the rest of <br /> <br /> the movie. The movie was shot on the spot in Israel, which means that Americans could offend the Israelis personally. There is not a glorious Israeli character here. The Israeli police captain is a jerk. <br /> <br /> Police officers don't know English, and Calvin convinces him <br /> <br /> that the word "sh * tty" is a compliment. Nothing more fun than <br /> <br /> tricking the stupid aliens into their home, especially <br /> <br /> when all this racist humor comes from a US minority <br /> <br /> who would have been more than offended if the tables were reversed <br /> <br /> and the Israeli policeman mocked the African American policeman in <br /> <br /> Chicago. <br /> <br /> This movie is poorly written, badly acted and badly directed. It doesn't <br /> <br /> like work, cop drama or even horror. It just shows that <br /> <br /> the now rejected Cannon Studios were willing to throw their money <br /> <br /> into anything, no matter how badly it was planned. "Hellbound" is another most appropriate title. I didn't like this movie intensely. <br /> <br /> This is characterized (R) for physical violence, gun violence, strong <br /> <br /> profanity, some sexual references, and some adult situations. <Br /> <br />
