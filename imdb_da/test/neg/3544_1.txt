While watching this movie, you immediately see the cheesy items in a standard TV movie ... but through the picture, the plot changes (if you're fat enough to say that this movie has a plot) is at the book and unoriginal ... and with all the movies KEPT GETTING WORSE! <br /> <br /> Candace Cameron Bure, famous for its role as DJ Tanner on the hit TV show Full House, is not very convincing as a possessed thief. trying to avenge Posser's death. I think she's a fine actress .... just not in the excitement. <br /> <br /> The movie was trashy, and as I said the plot was outdated ... even though I saw it, I knew I was in for automatic cheese, I had no idea how much worse this movie could get. .. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend this movie ... unless cheep Filmaking and bad writing are what you are looking for
