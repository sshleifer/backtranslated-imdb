Watch this movie ..... just to really appreciate how good the original is. I'm not really hard to please, but it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> It hurt me deeply because I like Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason and Dyan Cannon. The script was just awful! I thought Chevy would at least have some better things than he did. There was hardly anything to laugh at in this movie. I went into it and wanted to enjoy it. I would laugh, but almost crying. <br /> <br /> Initially, credits read the Special Appearance of Chevy Chase. This worried me from the start. Chevy is actually more than I thought he would be. It is more than a "special look". Too bad the look was not special. Mason's character would have been a good secondary character, but grew old as a head. I'd rather have seen more (much more) of Dyan Cannon. At least her character was fun, if not well-written. I also missed gratuatis teen sex scene. Mr. Gopher went from being sweet and innocent to an annoying rodent who deserved to be blown up. Jonathan Silverman is the only character who interested me and we didn't see enough of him. <br /> <br /> I'll take it back. Try to see half of this movie, so remember Alamo, Maine and CaddyShack I.
