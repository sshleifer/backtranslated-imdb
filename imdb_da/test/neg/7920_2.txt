First, they destroy it with the uniquely bad animation quality, so get the voices that don't sound like the original. They make so many movie errors. When Sasha sings in the Count Me Out, the drummer disappears and then again, Itchy's shirt keeps changing color, his hat is changing, one of the bridges is white, everyone in the background seems to be fat, halos change colors and appear and disappears. Even the sky seems different. I do not give anything wrong if this is a low budget film, they should not cut corners on animation. They completely destroyed the first ADGTH. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
