I have to say I am a big fan of these "last houses on the left", even those who most people think hate are often kept in high regard by me; but one of these kind of movies that I didn't like much was Aldo Lado's 'Night Train Murders', and unfortunately it seems that trains and The Last House to the Left do not mix, as Terror Express is another missing rip - of. Something that this kind of movie really needs is a stubbornly unpleasant main character; And while Terror Express offers three potential candidates, not one of them goes up and becomes this villain who leaves the lack of the main area. It actually comes to a good start, as three young men on a passenger train begin to annoy the guests on board a little. This leads the audience to believe that there is more in the store, but unfortunately it never goes right when the stage is set. Then the trio ends up taking over the train and using their new found power to terrorize the guests and rape the women. <br /> <br /> It has to be said that there is a lot of sleaze in this movie that will be pleasing to many viewers; but there is hardly any blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think he could get away with replacing the blood with sex scenes, and he could also get rid of it too; If he could shoot a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men have taken the train with power goes out of the window when it comes to the flesh, as the people you expect to be powerful and powerful seem too eager to show their women a good time and, despite a very tame 'sandwich' sequence, none of the gender aspect is particularly interesting. Since many of the film is recorded by these sex scenes, this becomes a huge problem. Movies like this often lack style, excitement and credibility; But you know you see a bad when bored. As you might expect, none of the actions are up to now; and especially the central three stand out to be bad. The direction lacks style and there is very little tension or tension; makes it difficult to take care of what will happen. All in all, this is a pretty crazy example of a movie and I can't recommend it.
