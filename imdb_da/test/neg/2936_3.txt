The basic premise of this movie is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay apart from the person. And it's a man who likes to show tunes, has good taste and is nice-looking MUST be gay. Yes, the movie is fun in parts, but the basic premise is to be homophobic and insulting that the whole movie crumbles into something that is quite painful to sit through. The performances, especially Joan Cusak and Kevin Kline, are very good.
