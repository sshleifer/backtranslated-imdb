I know it's quite unreasonable to comment on a movie without seeing the complete piece - but I still want to! I waited for a laugh, I tried to give it time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait in a comedy for a laugh. My laugh never came, so I gave up. <br /> <br /> It's silly humor, not so stupid that you should laugh. It is not anywhere near the high class. Let me correct it, it's just * stupid * - not stupid humor. They might have been destined for certain scenes to be fun, but they weren't. I suppose if you really get bored you could somehow mix the movie with a hallucination and end up with a mildly entertaining experience. A very pathetic effort.
