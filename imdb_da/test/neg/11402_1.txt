One of the movies I just didn't want to see. I got it in sneak preview, but the hell, the actor was very bad! At the end of the movie (I'm still surprised, I saw the whole movie ..) I wondered why I saw the movie. Also here in Holland, the author of this movie (it is filmed from a book by Giphart) thought it was very bad and was disappointed that his movie came out like this. Next time he wants a role in choosing people for the cast.
