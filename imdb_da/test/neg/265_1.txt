Ocean's Twelve: Just stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. <br /> <br /> A mere thrush. 10 known actors, at least. A weak script and very slowly developing idea. That's why I characterize a movie, I only saw at least 20 minutes of it. Don't make me wrong, you like that. But I only like the Ocean movie because of the Heist theme. If Ocean's 12 isn't about Heist, what's the point of seeing it? Glad Soderberg saw his biggest mistake and redeemed himself by making a movie far better than the first. Kudos for that. <br /> <br /> Steven Soderberg is not really a good director. Apart from his hit "Sex lies and videotapes" ... nothing else happened so well to the career of this director. Shame on him. But only his fault.
