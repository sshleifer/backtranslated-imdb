Looking back at the year 2006, one of the things I will most remember is "Snakeamania" on the Internet for a movie called Snakes on a plane. But unknown there was a straight-to-DVD rip-off movie called Snakes on a train! After seeing this, I feel at best a sub-par B movie. <br /> <br /> The Reason: <br /> <br /> A man and wife come on a train to go to Los Angles for help to be the husband's uncle who is a shaman. It is because the wife's family does not approve of her marching him so they have cursed her that snakes are "her". Think of a sixteen hour drive to Los Angles and a group of passengers that include an ex-drug addict and some drug dealers. Will they get there in time before the snakes take her over? <br /> <br /> Watch the movie: First the effects: I have to say, while some scenes with the smaller snakes look good in a gory way, the main power shots have to wait for eight minutes to watch! Unfortunately, it is so bad that they completely kill any good memories from the movie. (The movie makes 198os video games look like T2 beside this!) One of the things I noticed is that there is no script credit on the movie! And the directors make the film so anti-climatic it destroys the whole movie. Final view on the movie: <br /> <br /> An under-pair B-Movie, with an incredibly poor ending.
