I saw the first house of the dead and expected a root canal to be more comfortable to participate in, so as it was not as bad as that, I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I got my hope that the other one might also be okay ... and I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I'm apparently one of the few people who saw this movie, which thinks it was bad. <br /> <br /> I don't know if I should see it again and force myself to see what all the people who gave the good reviews saw, or wonder if I saw the wrong movie. <br/> <br /> Ed Quinn like Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra 'Nightingale' Morgan did a great job in roles far below them. They deserve to be in better movies. <br /> <br /> The special effects were okay and some of the characters liked / had a stand and that made it an acceptable watch, but for the most part this movie was just a waste of time. Oh, and I have to ask this because I found myself setting it high all the way through the movie ... did anyone know how to close the doors behind themselves, so zombies wouldn't just walk into the rooms? Only once did it happen (zombies walked in) and I found out that a little comfortable ... soldiers go into a room, let the door open, pay little or not pay attention to the same door, so the zombies can just go in if they feel like it (with the rude "livings" being the corner without the opportunity to escape) and yet only once did zombies follow them. <br /> <br /> Nitpicky? Maybe but honestly ... if I fought for my life, the last thing I wanted to do would be to go into a room and leave the door open so that zombies could swim in and eat me. <br /> <br /> It's really the only thing that bothered me * throughout the movie, and just the movie was mostly a bad sequel to a not completely eerie original.
