<br /> <br /> After the white and lively of Highway 61 and Roadkill, I expected this movie to shine, but it was so soft and self-falsified as the hard rock star parodyed. The pace pulled, not helped by an overcrowded hallucination sequence, the characters were flat and immense, and Art Bergmann is no Jello Biafra. I had to throw myself to stay awake.
