This is a really mediocre movie in the vein of "Buckaroo Banzai." The casting runs around like "Mad Max" wannabes, and they seem to share a joke they don't want to share with the audience. Wheeler-Nicholson is one of the guilty new actresses you are happy to stumble upon in movies, but she is not worth the price of rental. Space Maggot starts an electric fire and burns a voice of 4.
