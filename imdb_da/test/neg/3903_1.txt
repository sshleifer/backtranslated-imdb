The only reason I rented the movie was to see Jeri Ryan in it! OMG it was the most boring, meaningless movie I've ever seen !!! WHERE LAME !!! I really mean, give me a break! After Voyager I would hope she would be offered better roles !! <br /> <br /> If I were one of the last people on earth, I would NOT still stay in a travel trailer in the dessert !! It's just such a bad movie !! Things about the Indian tribe and how he compared it every 10 seconds really became really old. Bad Jeri, better luck next time!
