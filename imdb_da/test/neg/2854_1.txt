Before we watched this movie (at a screening attended by the director himself) we were informed of having won the short film award at Galway Film Fleadh. Surely this result will give filmmakers hope, everyone can do better than this! <br /> <br /> How anyone can feel the blatant rip-off of Donnie Darko in this, I will never know. The movie is pure drivel, the play, the dialogue ridiculous and the end is just flat! The only crumb of comfort we enjoyed after seeing this rubbish was to loudly comment on how terrible it was in front of the director! Yeah, it was mean, but liberating! At least Irish filmmaking can't sink any lower!
