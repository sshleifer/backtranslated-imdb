Okay, this horror movie was supposed to be a joke, right? Tell me it should be a joke, so I understand. <br /> <br /> A great cawing bird with giant claws - or a claw, anyway - swoops down on unsuspecting people on earth and gobbles them up. Mara Corday and Jeff Morrow overestimate enough to keep things interesting, but at least you will enjoy a solid snicker when you see the "monster". It looks like a cross between a fake chicken and Mortimer Snerd. Neither director Fred Sears has just made this picture in a hurry and knew that the bird was quite ridiculous, or he really believed his film and being were really scary. I prefer to think - and hope - it was the former. <br /> <br /> P.S. The bird needs a haircut.
