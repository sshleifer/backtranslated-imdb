I put this vehicle down from Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy, and especially Murphy, for the first time, but after seeing it again, recently, I can see that it has some very funny pieces. <br /> <br /> This is by no means that this is the greatest buddy comedy all the time, but what can you really do with the already exhausted subgenre? What director, Tom Dey, has tried to do is turn it into a satire of the clichés from buddy comedy and the media. Early in the movie, the cabinet manager asks: "How does this differ from Cops?" When Chase Renzi beats the idea of ​​a reality show dealing with the character of De Nros, Mitch Preston (hilarious boring name by the way). That was when I saw it in a new light that I had not noticed before. <br /> <br /> The idea is to show all the elements of the buddy's comedy and put a twist on them. De Niro's reluctance to steal in the show and to collaborate with Murphy is just out of every cop movie you can think of. You can say that De Niro actually plays himself and asks, "Why should I make another movie playing a policeman?" Chase Renzi is portrayed as a Hollywood fake, but if you look at her opening scene again, she just does it to save her job. She somehow sees the ridiculous of what she does, but she will succeed in spite of that. One line says it all: "Who won't be on TV?" Perhaps this reads too much to what is essentially a lightweight film, just set to entertain, but it does give it a little game that I hadn't noticed before. <br /> <br /> As for Murphy. You must applaud him to look ridiculous. Trey wants to be a star so bad that he is willing to sell everything he comes into contact with. Murphy was a big star, and maybe it hit a nerve that it is all so volatile. The plot with the gun is of course quite boring. The action sequences are nothing special, except for the end, which required a lot of effort from both the crew and the crew. One thing I noticed about the villain is that he is dressed as an 80-year-old pop star. George Michael will think about it and it adds to the whole media spin. <br /> <br /> So I threw it first time, but what heck; If you want to do that, why not point out how ridiculous it really is and De Niro and Murphy took a great chance to do so.
