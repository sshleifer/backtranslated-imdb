Since MAGUS is a confusing puzzle that really has no solution, you have to sit back and enjoy nature. Seen on a "remote Greek island", it is a very busy Michael Caine as a teacher working at a school for boys who become aware of games with the local wacko / mysterious man Anthony Quinn and his daffy girlfriend Candice Bergen. Quinn, similar to Pablo Picasso with white hair and striped sailor, is actually pretty good, but Caine looks like he's ready to explode. The mountains, though stunning, should NOT place a UK accent EVER. She is not very good at such things. Guy Green's direction is fine, but unless you have endless patience with the film's circular logic, you won't enjoy it. A really sour note is the casting of the roaring Anna Karina in the completely joyful role of Caines girlfriend. Having seen her in a woman is a woman and a band APART, her presence here is pretty crushing.
