I usually seek to find good in movies, even the bad ones. Unfortunately, this movie is one that I miss unlucky - and the fact that there is only one positive review on this card shows many IMDb reviewers who share my pain. <br /> <br /> I don't usually see successors, but I just had to watch this as I love "Rosemary's Baby" so much. What a mistake it was. It simply confirms my belief that most followers are miserable - but fortunately, very few are as bad as this. In fact, in my heart, it's not even a successor, it's a satire on how bad a successor can be. Movies are highly recommended not to see - anytime - ever.
