The story of "The Stranger" reflects the 1969 movie "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun" (made by Gerry & Sylvia Anderson from Thunderbirds and Space: 1999's fame). A parallel universe Earth is the prerequisite for both films. But there is a difference. Where the world in "The Stranger" has a totalitarian regime out to squash the citizens' freedom, "The Journey to the Sun's Most Side" showed only a true mirror world where handwriting, roads, houses, machines of every kind and of course were internal organs in reverse order (or the mirror). Thus, similarity between parallel soils is the only connection between both films. Similarly, the television series "Giant's Land" came before both films, which run from 1968 to 1970. It highlighted a world that was almost parallel to the earth except that the planet was populated by giants 12 times the size of the people who collided there. The idea of ​​a totalitarian government looking to intercept and contain the "little people" looked more than the performance of "The Stranger" than the premise of "JTTFSOTS". Perhaps because of the same as "LOTG" became a series for "The Stranger" shelves. Had it turned into a TV series, it would have been a sci-fi version of "The Fugitive", with the star Glenn Corbett being chased by evil from week to week, hidden in various places, etc. BTW, a stronger script could have helped this movie together.
