This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen, it did not exclude a single clichee one could imagine of a Hollywood-so-called Thriller. The protagonist is a loving father and a private investigator involved in a particular task: to find out if a suspected snuff movie is genuine. He certainly gets deeper and deeper, smart porn jokes (run by mexicans) and six theaters are his field of study as he searches for the woman's killers in the "snuff" movie. Assisted by a "smart" (he reads a book) sex shop employee, he is engaged in a murderous bondage film producer and his personal perverts who are responsible for the movie ... ... and what do you expect? They are portrayed as the simple evil, no reason for explanations, backgrounds, history: they are the bad ones and he is the cleaner. Boom. The murderer of the murderers. The movie's end. Is that so bad? Yes, I'm afraid. <br /> <br /> Ironically, "machine" (the mega-pervert who killed) points to his ridiculous character: In the final scene, our hero "machine" strengthens to cut off its leather mask (yep, of course he wears one) and Recognizes that "machine" looks like the normal 08/15 guy from the street. So say "machine": "Blablabla I'm not a monster, my parents never abuse me, I had a nice childhood, I just love doing what I do!" <br /> <br /> I just love killing people. Yes, surely, "everyone loves to kill people" (Bender). It's not just the total lack of character that made this movie so boring, it's also the ugly "I'm gonna kill those people" attitude that makes you sick. On one scene, our hero tied one of the guys and tries to shoot him ... but he can't. So what does he do? He calls the mother of the killed woman, saying her child is killed and asks her that she loved her child so much that she wants to see the murderers dead. The mother is crying, she will love her child, he goes back to the connected killer and beats him. <br /> <br /> To get to the point: This movie breathes the evil air of the lynchmob supporters police do not matter in it), moralizes in a ridiculous form of pornography, does not take its characters seriously and waste your time with a stupid plot. Probably the only good thing about this movie is that it doesn't try to pseudo-psychoanalysts ... even that would be too much plot. Don't waste your time with this. /> <br />
