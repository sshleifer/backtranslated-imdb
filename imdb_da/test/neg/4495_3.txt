I am ashamed that I actually went to the theater to watch this movie when it was first released. Although I suppose its thinly blurred depiction of Aristotle's Onassis and Jackie Kennedy story is well done, it's a movie that should never have been made in the first place; thus my low rating. The film chronicles the story of a wealthy Greek business market called Theo Tomasis, who woos and wins the lovely young widow, Liz Cassidy, by a beaten American president. Sounds good? Yes, everything except the names. <br /> <br /> The molding must not be spoiled. Anthony Quinn plays the Greek tycoon to perfection, and at least it is somewhat comforting, having just read that Ari himself asked Quinn for the role. Jacqueline Bisset is of course beautiful and sophisticated in that part of (for all intents) Jackie, and James Franciscus has the entire American good looks of the president. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie since it came out and I don't want to see it again. I seem to remember quite a bit of bad language and a general roughness. Otherwise, I assume that it is a sensational and seemingly intimate insight into the radiation setting life of the rich and famous, aboard their yachts, beaches, pools, etc. Yes, the Greek oyster landscapes are spectacular, the best part of the movie. <br /> <br /> It's kind of okay, I suppose. There is no end to television films about Kennedy, which I admit to occasionally tuning to and not to my credit. This is basically just another. Much better to allow Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to rest in peace.
