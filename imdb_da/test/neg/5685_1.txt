I have no idea what these people thought when they made this movie. No plot, very limited action, and what's with the 3rd person comment throughout the movie ???? Instead of driving around on the planet to shoot at all these sites, they should have spent some money on manuscripts and actors. What was acting there was miserable. This was 90 minutes in my life, I will never be able to come back. I had to count the director on the cost of renting this movie. To the director and the authors of this movie .... please quit now. This movie should have a mark on the front of it and say beware of boredom. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the computer generation. It's okay as the generation is. This movie should never have a sequel .... ever.
