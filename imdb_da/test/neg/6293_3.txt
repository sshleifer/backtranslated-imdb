1. watched 1/1/2003 - 3 out of 10 (Dir-Henri Verneuil): Sober drama about a charity doctor having trouble managing a relationship with a younger woman whom his family brings in to live with them and getting married to another in the same household. His quest for happiness is not clear, but they bring forth the cause of his dissatisfaction quite well by showing the women's indulgent traits in his wife's line. Well played, but predictable drama.
