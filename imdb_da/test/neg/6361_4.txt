Basically, the first two Critters films were already stupid, but in a good and entertaining way. This movie is much more of a B movie that is silly, but for all the wrong reasons. This is the first sequel that doesn't really follow the plot of the first two movies. Basically, all the letters are new and there are no bounty hunters this time (well as good as none since bounty hunts in this movie show up too late) and the budget for this was obviously declining again. To save even more costs, the movie was shot backwards with part 4, which I picture will be just as bad, as it directly follows this movie and is made by the same people involved as with this one. <Br /> <br /> It's just a typical B-gen movie that doesn't really have originality in it or brings entertainment. It makes "Critters 3" a real superfluous sequel you can easily do without. Admittedly, things could have been much worse for this movie, but it's not exactly a good one either. The movie just falls flat like a science fiction / horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> Also a little strange to see how Critters has suddenly changed in this. They are about their normal size, this time without giving an explanation for it, and they are even more Gremlins as in this movie than it was in the previous one. The film is only interesting because this was the feature film debut of Leonardo DiCaprio. He was about 17 in this movie and of course sees baby-faced as he still does now. I like to watch these well-known actors in their early roles. It is fun to see how they shop and if their style has improved and changed over the years. Of course, DiCaprio only got better, but he was already able to deliver his lines the same way he does these days. <br /> <br /> Really a stupid and lame movie. <br /> <br /> 4/10
