I just saw this on TCM tonight and was shocked by Jean Arthur's manager. Her eyes opened in surprise and at all, everything was not in the style of Dietrich and Art Lund. Dietrich was wonderful in his restraint and comic timing. She is the best thing in this movie. Wilder gags were flat and honestly more like something a freshman in college would write trying to "get away" w / be wicked, witty and dirty, but just sounded boring and not fun at all. It seemed that humor was pushed too hard to be fun. The finish was completely constructed. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AHEAD: Never for a moment did I think Art Lund suddenly fell out of love with Dietrich and then suddenly was crazy in love with Arthur. Oh, Billy. Stay true! 3 out of 10
