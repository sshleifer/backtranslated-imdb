This movie is horrible - honestly. The play is terrible, the manuscript made me scratch, the effects are quite miserable (which I usually don't mind for older movies, but it was only made two years ago), and everything knows it's just annoying to me. A couple of friends go out on Halloween in the woods and meet a witch and her cannibal son. Of course, before it has the clich√© "You really believe it? Ha ha ha, it's just a story" routine pulled out for a while. The witch's cannibal son was made retard (I don't know if it was for comedy or to make it scary, but this movie failed in both). It has minimal gore and no nudity, which made a bad movie even worse. Heck, the only good thing about this movie is the bone etching scene, and even that could be better. <br /> <br /> Honestly, don't even waste your time watching it on cable, and certainly don't consider buying or renting it, otherwise you'll kick yourself to waste time that could have been used to Do something more constructive or entertaining.
