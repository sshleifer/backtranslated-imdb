The first thing to know about "Zipperface" is that it was shot on video so it has the peculiar "home-video-ish" look that is terribly distracting and makes it hard to take this seriously as a "real" movie . And "Zipperface" actually looks like a bunch of amateurs gathered for an attempt at a "real" serial killer thriller. It's not quite that, but it's not as bad as it looks. Having a woman as one of the two detectives on the case puts a spin on the exploitation genre. Dona Adams gives an appealing amateur performance in the role - her obvious inexperience in front of the camera somehow works for her. Plus, she puts a big fight against the killer at the end. The red herring only seem to be ridiculous, but in the end they work - I guessed the killer incorrectly. And you have to wonder if Tarantino might have seen the Zipperface guy when he came up with the idea of ​​"The Gimp" for "Pulp Fiction". (* 1/2)
