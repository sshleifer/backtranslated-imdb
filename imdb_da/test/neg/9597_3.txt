Although many Billie Dove fans are happy with her work here, I have to pass. As a socially prominent member of the British chic set, her British accent is basically non-existent, and her line-up sounds like line readings and her feelings seem trance-like and dizzying. Basil Rathbone, usually a fine actor, seems uneven everywhere and also speaks with a strange black accent - in his case something like Italian, although we cannot be sure of it. Scripture manages to keep its precise ethnicity a secret. He is further hampered by the manuscript, which gives him one of the old film diseases, something to do with nerves, which requires surgery. The only real entertainment is provided by the famous Kay Francis, who carries a lacquered bob with side curls in his role as a depraved countess who shamelessly devours men, including Rathbone, and then spits them out. She pulls it off with her unique aplomb. She is the only living thing in this dead sea of ​​a movie.
