"The Foreigner" is a tale of foreign intrigue with Seagal in the center as a deep cover operative that has a package that everyone wants and is willing to kill to get. The flick is uninspired with less of the usual types of action that puts Seagal on the film card (fire fighting, hand-to-hand combat, pyrotechnics, stunts, etc.) and more of a story that is horrified, uninteresting and full of pointless filler. Which actions seem to seem token and free, while Seagal looks more and more like a pork chop, winds its way through this creepy flip without expressing itself and being bored, while there is no improvement in reality. Somewhere around "The Glimmer Man" or "Fire Down Below" Seagal flicks took a nose dive and "The Foreigner" is just a continuation of this trend. Nothing here worth seeing except for the most deadly Seagal fans. (C)
