This movie tried, but in the end it was a waste of talent. It was hard to be "sexy". I do not put down the works of such actresses as Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who will find something beyond TV's "Le Femme Nikita" which is worthy of her talents.) I did not find even in Mrs Wilson's so-called near-seduction place with Mrs Barkin, any real feeling, even though I know that the thespians were trying to make the scene work. If the sexual elements of Wilson's disturbed sex victim did not touch our heart (which it did not even end with, it did not deserve it), neither did the murder element in the plot. Maybe it was the script or maybe the direction, but I didn't feel for anyone in this movie, and without this feeling, a movie doesn't work for me. If you are interested in a movie about lesbianism, there are at least two movies on each side of the spectrum to check: 1.) The Gulity enjoyment of "Bound", which works well in a noir setting; and 2.) The more honest and touching story of a lesbian growing up in hell kitchen called "All Over Me." It is a well-defined indie from the mid-90s that handles the coming issue of feeling, not forced sexuality. Both would be a better rental than "Mercy", which has almost nothing.
