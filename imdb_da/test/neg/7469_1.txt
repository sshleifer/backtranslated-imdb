I watched this movie at the New Festival in New York. It was by far the worst movie there. It is the use of uncircumcised full frontal nudity and a wishy-washy script and direction that neither commits to recreating 'Maurice' or deciding it's a Neil LaBute flip, leaving me feeling 'Why would anyone ruin a perfect good throw like this? '. It lacks irony and fills the vacuum with emotions, causing the times when the movie turns itself on to make you dry your face as your mind and heart look for what could happen in the movie, but it is not. I wish the director and editor had edited the movie again because there might be more history that could be released from an otherwise unpleasant experience.
