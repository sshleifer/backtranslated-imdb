I do not know why all the previous comments are the approval of this movie. It is not far, but ... THE BEST MOVIE, HOW IS LATEST, full of clich√©s, bad plays, actually no ... very bad acting and has a stupid plot ... If I would have seen it you cinema I would have gone out after the first 20 minutes. I f you hate somebody, let him / her see this movie ... it's so bad it is. A girl who has an imaginary boy / friend who gives a relationship to a real one because her imagination is jealous .... but I think it shows ... she takes after her parents who also have some mental problems .. plus the sign to be, I think it's ridiculous, what should make you laugh, Cal's room mate is a serious distress and just makes me sad ... and the whole movie
