"Black Friday" made this plot so much better why it is remembered and "The Man With Two Lives" is just a forgotten pot boiler. "Shed No Tears" was the working title and it would have been a better one as he was a thoroughly evil character for most of the movie. <br /> <br /> Philip Bennett is recently engaged when involved in a traffic accident. Dr. Clark (Edward Keene) has been involved in some experimental animal operations - bringing them back from the dead. His colleagues urged him to try his operation on Phillip, who is dead. When he works, a dangerous criminal, Wolf Panino, goes to the electric chair, and there is trans migration of the soul. When Phillip wakes up from the operation, he has the soul in Panino. He is a changed person, he is rude to his family and begins to hang Panino's old haunt. He takes over Wolf's old gang - under the name of Philip Bennett, he is also Roman's former girlfriend - who smells a rat. Bennett, like Wolf, is determined to even score and start removing his enemies. Lying up, including the boyfriend and a policeman, his own family begins to fall victim. <br /> <br /> But - I hate the "bad dream" movies - you always feel disappointed. This movie would have been better if he had stayed in character like Panino and had a final shoot. Eleanor, his fianc√©, would end up sad but wiser with his brother. <br /> <br /> Edward Norris, the star, had a great career mostly in B-movies. <br /> <br /> Not really recommended.
