Chupacabra Terror: 2/10: It was the Navy Seal team that tipped the balance from bad cheesy movie to just bad. Until then, there was very poor movie storage, but the seals ?? They have bicycle helmet painted black. You know them with air holes that make every adult wearing them look like a complete tool. Of course the bass fishing boat they took to greet the cruise ship could have been another clue (it wouldn't do it across Tampa Bay let alone a sea) ?? and their tactics would not pass patterns on a 3rd installment XBOX game. <br/> <br /> Does John Shepphird have pictures of John Rhys-Davies in a compromise position with a Hobbit? Because I can't think of any other reason, he would be in this movie. The other players have a big excuse. They are talented unattractive hacks that could not be rented to an infomercial. The plot is that two men try to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra (Love says this name) aboard a cruise ship and it gets loose. The sets are made up of horrible cruises (complete with air axes the size of a small apartment); Of particular annoyance is a gigolo character from a 60-day Doris Day movie. <br /> <br /> It blew soft ketchup while Chupacabra blisters day, green soft in the dark blood. (Why a goat eating Mexican mammals will soften anything other than red is beyond me). Every B movie has a tip point that makes it fun (Hi it's a lesbian shower scene, OMG that guy just ate is his own eyebrows) or not so much fun (did they just call the forty something overweight boys with clothes and bicycle helmets Navy Seals?) Chupacabra falls into the not-so-fun B-movie side with a spout.
