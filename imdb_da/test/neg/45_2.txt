This was a decent movie in the first half. Too many cheap BOOs! moments, but the tension builds, the evil ones are crazy and everything seems to sit up nicely. The kids are not very deep, but hey, it works for teenagers. <br /> <br /> It just gets ridiculous and tries too hard - "why in the world would he / she do it?" moments overwhelm everyone's ability to suspend disbelief, the twist involves too many ridiculous coincidences, and the title comes from a delayed attempt to philosophize a certain meaning in the film that does not go down and has rapidly fallen. There was laughter in the theater in moments that should in no way be fun. <br /> <br /> Great prerequisite but only poorly written and does not coincide. Some very nice shots, but they are hard to enjoy while rolling your eyes.
