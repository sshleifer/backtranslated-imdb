I'm the kind of guy who loves New Jack City hoodie film for Baby Boy for Killa Season, from the b-degree to Hollywood. but this movie was somewhat different. I'm no hater and this movie was a little fun. but some were just weird. Well the play was not good compared to Silkk The Shocker's performance in Hot Boyz (pretty good) and Ice-T in New Jack and SVU (great). the scene where Corrupt (Ice-T) kills, he will be a Jamaican guy he says something and burns in a fire that burns both Ice-T and the other guy, this kills the Jamaican, but Ice-T is unlucky, very similar Ice movie Urban Menace (which stars both of these actors) was Snoops character is supernatural, but after this nothing suggested that Corrupt is like a demon. When MJ (Silkk) gets stuck in the first place he fights, but after that he usually fights and was stabbed in the thigh - WITH OUT BLOOD. and when MJ admits to killing a policeman, the police with his friend Benny were strange, Benny was not introduced to this movie and the scene is not in the movie. It keeps an eye on why Corrupt wants to kill MJ, but still makes you scratch your head. wen jody writes a letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords does not mention what happens 2 other protagonists mj and lisa. the movie showed the ghett's horror and poverty - which plagues latino and black word's broad life - was a good part of the movie, even though the project's clips were reused thousands of times. and the scene where Miles kills the Latin brother by throwing his bike at full speed (not wearing a helmet) and running into my latino brother's car would have killed him. the movie resembled the movie Urban Menace, and half of the actors were in both these films and the production team. it was ok tho. but I am from poverty, I love hooded films, but if you don't love them like me, then don't see it. The only thing that saves me from going out reminded me of the first movie I made that was made with $ 100 and my love for the genre. <br /> <br /> Nathaniel Purez
