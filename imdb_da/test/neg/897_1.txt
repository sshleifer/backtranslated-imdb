A long time ago, right back in the early 80's, a television show "Fridays" came to ABC, and tried to steal the spotlight away from NBC's poor "Saturday Night Live" listing. It didn't, but it introduced some conflicting sketches and semi-talented "comedians" to the world. Like Mark Blankenfield, for example. <br /> <br /> Which at roundabout brings us to "Jekyll and Hyde ... Together Again". Which is contradictory in ways all its own. Blankenfield is about as subtle as a pew full of whoopee pads that go after Communion. And so tasteful. It's just his drug-like drug character he played on the miserable "Friday" show stretched out to length. And if you didn't like him there, why are you reading this review? <br /> <br /> Every time it takes more than one or two authors to write a movie, it's a bad sign. Then, when it comes to jerky jokes that throw you out of every stage of improvisation in the Western Hemisphere and replace gags with rough out, it can only get worse. A comic takes a Robert Louis Stevenson story? If just as good an idea as making sitcom out of Poe's "Fall of Usher House". <br /> <br /> Apart from a few (very few) gags that give a little smile, this whole movie is an exercise in waste-wasted actors, wasted film, wasted opportunities. No wonder they showed the original author Stevenson, who turns in his grave. What more attention a review could they give themselves? <br /> <br /> No stars. No, not even for Armstrong, who should have known better. <br /> <br /> "Hyde" from this.
