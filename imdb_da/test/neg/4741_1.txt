Ed Wood rolls over in his grave. He could have made a hundred cult classics for the price of this waste hole. The worst script in memory (it makes "X-Men 3" sparkle as "Citizen Kane"); the most amateur director of pre-K film; the cheesiest "special effects" (I'm talking about "Friday the 13th" successor territory); and throw in a meaningless, rebellious, deeply disturbed, maternity ward. The lack of talent or sensibility that puts this garbage on the screen is amazing. That the "industry" can reward anyone involved in this celluloid cess pool with future projects should be the cause of serious alarm.
