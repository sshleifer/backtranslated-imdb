Now the television schedules (in England at least) are stuffed with home improvement, bargain hunting, house hunting and afternoon dining experiences, the chances of any of the terrestrial TV stations excavating a complete blur like this to occupy a pair of hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are slim, to say the least. But back in the eighties, the BBC did just that and guess what I saw it. And it is a testament to the overwhelming innocence of this Hungarian-American co-production that I can still remember large clumps of it, over twenty years later. Initially, the eponymous briefly appears below the opening titles, only to disappear again for at least half an hour. (Imagine an American TAIL being edited, so Feivel is nowhere to be seen and you will appreciate how confusing this is.) There is an extremely bizarre animation where one of the characters gets their elaborately grown mustache customized and stretched, complete with a boingy sound effect that makes him go boss-eyed. Probably fun if you're stoned, but for a child, totally disruptive. Mentioning, the infamous "hippopotamus" scene is represented in an abstract way - clouds in vague hippo shapes are hit by lightning strikes - but it is still quite unpleasant. In fact, this movie is pretty cold and engaging throughout, a sad state that is hardly helped by the strange production design, all the muddy colors, wobbly lines, inflated shapes and the unique European gloom that resembles Jan Svankmajer, as so convincing . Then, to pay tribute to it all, we get songs by Osmonds! This is not so much a horrible movie as a deeply rude, not so much phantasmagorical as a pretty bad trip.
