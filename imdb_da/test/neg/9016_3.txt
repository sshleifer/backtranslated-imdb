WARNING: SPOILERS Dear Roger, <br /> During your distinguished career, you have made a wide variety of entertainment, some good, some notsogood. The "blood animal's night" falls into the latter category. It's not as incredibly horrible as saying, "Phantom From 10,000 Leagues" or maybe "The Dunwich Horror." Nevertheless, one of my biggest criticisms of this movie is that I could have made it faster, better and cheaper for you. <br /> <br /> Let's start with foreward and titles. Roger, the rocket sequences look like something from Disney's "Man Into Space", not so good, of course. The futuristic rocket game resembles nothing in the present 1958. Why didn't you just use a Vanguard, Atlas or even a Viking launch? Even better, why not completely dispense with the launch and start with a shot of space and the capsule floating in it? I would have done that for you, Roger. Secondly, why did the spaceship crash after reentry? Even a middle school student could have told you, your astronaut would have come to the ground extra brittle and pretty much boned. I would have shown that your astronaut was "obsessed" by the monster (perhaps using the big "negative / positive" things you used in "Satellite War") and you lose contact with the ground and the landing in the desert. It would also explain how you "blood animals" could impregnate your astronaut under the enormous heat, but still be destroyed by fire. Even with these stupidity. The first half of your movie is pretty good. Had you spent some money on decent music, it would have been as good as a mediocre episode of "Outer Limits". But once again, your author describes Ed Nelson as a landing designer and gives him a silly dialogue on magnetism. The biggest problem with the second half of "Night of the Blood Beast" is Michael Emmet. He's horrible as the convicted astronaut. You should have fired him on the spot and replaced him with Ed Nelson. You could have combined Nelson's responsibility with John Dunlaps and saved yourself on the price of an actor. I don't know if you actually paid any of these people; But at least you would save the cost of catering three meals a day. I had also killed the "scorched parrot" costume and spent the extra money using makeup to get the astronaut to become the "blood animal". Maybe it was a little too close to "The Creeping Unknown" for you, but it would have helped the pace of the other half immensely. If you want a "blood animal", would it not be a good idea to show some blood? Yes, I know the title comes from the embryos of the astronaut's blood, but Kowalski could have done much better work for you if he poured a small chocolate syrup around. After all, it looks like blood in black and white. What has it cost you, maybe two money? I would also have used some close-ups. For some reason, insipid dialogue and poor acting do not seem so bad in close-ups. Look at nearly 70's TV shows and you will see what I mean. Oh, finally, Roger, a note to your author. You can't use a fluoroscope to show some poor schmuck full of foreign embryos when you have no electricity. Remember that you fried the generator in the first reel? Oh, and I almost forgot. Roger, couldn't you afford a false knife? You know the kind where the blade goes into the handle. I had one of them when I was 9, which also happened to be the year "The Blood Animal Night" was made. It might cost another two bucks. I think I knew enough to make you a better movie. I know I know enough now to do it. So, Roger, if you decide to rebuild the "Blood Animal Night" or if you're looking for a writer / instructor to work with you on any other project, I'm your husband. I want to work cheap because I really want to make a movie for you, Roger. <br /> <br /> I give "Night of the Blood Beast" a "3". SPECIAL NOTE: If you like to watch kitschy movies like "Night of the Blood Beast", the DVD I bought for $ 3.99 was very good quality. You can also get "Night of the Blood Beast" along with a lot of other horrible horror / scifi movies in places like Bestbuy for around $ 6.
