I just watched National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation 2 on DVD, hoping to see something at least close to the original, big holiday comedy, 'Christmas Vacation'. I didn't see anything of that kind. You can tell right from the start that this movie just wasn't measuring up. It's too bad, it has a title that connects it to the original Christmas holiday. It's really sweet. The movie cannot stand at its own merit. I think too many people will see this movie on the title's strength, and it doesn't come close to that level of comedy. Apart from the title, there is little to link the movie to the original 'Christmas holiday' and even less connected to Christmas for Christmas. The comedy is very simplified and the plot is poor. Children may find some humor here, but most adults will only get a chuckle here and there. This movie is a flop. Don't waste your time with it.
