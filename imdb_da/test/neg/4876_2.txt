This movie features several well-known actors that I usually like, so I had at least modest expectations when renting this on DVD. I was very disappointed. In fact, I went for some snacks somewhere during the last half hour and somehow I ended up in the kitchen rather than going back to the TV. The actor performances where poor virtually everyone across the board and none of the atmospheres in the film felt very convincing. Almost all scenes had the "just a movie" feeling for them, I was sitting there waiting for the director to call "CUT!" followed by the crew have a little talk about the scene before we move on to the next. Since the movie is about mobsters, most characters are hard and mob-like, the problem here is just that this badly-bad attitude is played so badly that it just feels like a joke. The constant guitar drilling soundtrack really tries to emphasize this atmosphere as well, but when the same track is played on the 18th, it just adds the already strong sense that the whole thing is just fake. Maybe it was just a really really bad script, maybe it was just badly executed. I am not a film critic, in fact, I rarely mean to see something that is really good, but it was just pretty bad, no matter how objective and forgiving I am trying to be. NOT recommended, not even as a rental!
