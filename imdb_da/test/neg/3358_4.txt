Under the average blaxpoitation action / melodrama, where the lovely wife Grier plays a private eye that comes to the aid of her father (Rudy Challenger) and his partner (Austin Stoker of the original "Assault on Precinct 13") whose lending business is threatened. <br /> <br /> I want to be honest - I agree with the few others using comments on this movie. "Sheba, Baby" has a less than satisfying script, direction that is not particularly prominent, action scenes that are moderately entertaining at best, and one of Mrs Grier's more indeterminate support casts (although there is an important supporting role for D 'Urville Martin, also a known name in blaxpoitation). I get the feeling that this routine magazine might have been put together quickly just to get cash for her so tremendous popularity. It was probably cool to see Stoker again, although Mrs Grier does not have such a good role - or dialogue - that she has had in other films, even though she does what she does best, and it plays a sassy, ​​sexy sister on the revenge mission. <br /> <br /> Non-stop soul / funk soundtrack is fun, at least. <br /> <br /> Most recommended for those who want to see everything in the Pam Grier movie repertoire. <br /> <br /> 4/10
