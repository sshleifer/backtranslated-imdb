Empty shortening of John Irving's novel strives for boldness, but ends up being absurd. It is a quirky, goofy and bittersweet cut of sketches that try to explain a person's growth from birth to adulthood, and how he deals with the lust and fanaticism surrounding him. Garp is born of a formidable unmarried mother, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close. (The various stages of Garp's childhood are played by three young actors before Robin Williams takes over when Garp reaches adulthood.) The story follows him through the childhood of a boys' prep school, where Jenny is the school nurse, through her colleges, passions-wrestling , writing and sex-to-marriage with his high school love, children, marriage problems and a writing career. Jenny meanwhile has become a famous feminist, suggesting an unorthodox cause. The plot describes an abundance of comic and tragicomic episodes and outlandish adventures. Williams gives a cherub face performance. This script was not appropriate for his savage and anarchy, and his talent was thus wasted. He is like an injured bird poisoning out of control. John Lithgo's role as a transsexual father gives wisdom, doesn't make sense either. This movie was able to attract some sensible attention in 1982, due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new film footage. Williams had recently cast his Mork and Mindy pursuits and focused more on stand-up comedy and movies. The audience was confused by this movie, especially at its arbitrary and inexplicable ending.
