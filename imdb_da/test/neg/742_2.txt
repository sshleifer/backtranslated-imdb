I'm afraid I didn't like this adaptation. When I started to see it, I had a strange sense of seeing some 70's television series because of the filter and the musical score. I didn't like the final scene. Sir. Tilney seems only dressed in his vest. Jane Austen would never have a gentleman ride without a fur coat. It seems that the manufacturers made a modern misinterpretation of a romantic girl's dream. I appreciate the more modern YES adjustments much more, showing the eyes of these details, making the BBC series so worthwhile. Sorry, I'm looking forward to the 2007 adaptation. I hope it will improve and will show you the benefits of 20 years of Jane Austen customization.
