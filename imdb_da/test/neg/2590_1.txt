I couldn't believe how bad this movie was, and believe me, I don't expect a masterpiece from a low-to-cable movie. I just lost it because I liked Jane Seymour. I've seen her enough to know that she's definitely a successful actress, so I just don't know what happened here. The characters were superficial, the dialogue stilted, the actress, and yes, including Seymour. It was great to see her play against type, but not in something so bad. I have noticed that she carries a credit for the managing producer so that she cannot escape the blame for the master of this movie. And oh yes, they had Barry Bostwick who played the male management. "Nuff said.
