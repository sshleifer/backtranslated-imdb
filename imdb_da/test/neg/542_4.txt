First of all, I just want to say that I'm a very big Naruto fan. I love anime and many stories. Also, the first movie just confirmed that Naruto is about fun, good action, good story, but then came the other movie. I was very hyped because the first movie turned out great. But it didn't satisfy me a bit ... The story was paralyzed, action wasn't that great ... especially in relation to the Anime series ... the same goes for the quality of animation. I found it very bad ... Could the story get any lamer ... NOW ??? Where is Naruto kyuubi? Not even turning his demon ... I mean ... COME ON !!! My advice is ... see the series (until episode 140, then it's just fillers) and then read Manga because it's still great. Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future ... All and all I gave it a 4, just because it's Naruto ...
