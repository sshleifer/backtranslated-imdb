I've seen every episode, and the characters are all the same self-absorbed whinny little brats thought out, there are no signs of development for 5 years (getting pregnant is not developing if you're still the same daddies girl, only now Delinda whines to Danny because papa is not around) Sam never changes or grows, making her boring, repetitive and just as annoying as her illness after season 3, Danny is a typical soft character who is arranged by everyone in his life (he has no main characters own morality) especially Mary and Delinda. The old boring clich√© will the care they become and from the relationship gets boring very quickly. <br /> <br /> James Cann can act and his character is ok to see, only he is just another hackers wet dream, an ex CIA man who has great contacts and training etc so he can stop any thief or cheats known to men, although the cameras cannot do half the things they do for a while, but in 5 years the authors seem very stupid, why? Because they have all this expensive and advanced technology, but no simple walkie talkie (communication is fast and easy), you never see security on the floor, only when there is a situation, and all of a sudden, everyone is right there. <br /> <br /> Plots move very quickly from cheating and stealing the casino in some way to horrible typical American boy-girl-related ships, as is the death material seen all over the world, they have sex, but I hate you I have always loved you, I think I do, but I love her / him instead, but what if, maybe one day blah blah blah. <br /> <br /> I would recommend '' Hotel Babylon '' to people who like Las Vegas, it has so much more to do for it simply because the characters are interesting engaging and not forced into our throat for 6 months by the year. I'm happy to be British ?? I'd rather see the same actors in 5 different shows instead of 5 years getting worst in the same.
