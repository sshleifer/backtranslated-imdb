Movies just won't get any worse than this. Terrible plot, terribly timed, pathetic signs and effects and yes it uses "B" standards. <br /> <br /> And for the boys: Nothing, this movie is a terrible disappointment, some scenes that could have been good but you get nothing but build without delivery. <br /> <br /> This movie appeals to no horrible movie, it was bad; plot, acting, "B" taste, special effects and everything else. Plus no nudity or eroticism for men or girls.
