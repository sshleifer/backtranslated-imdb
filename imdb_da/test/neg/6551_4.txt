Another of these flimsy stories combined with most forgettable songs. Powell and O'Keefe who fight for the public are completely forgettable. However, there are two shining moments. Hubert Castle is the most incredible sneaky walker you will ever see - his "drunk ride" on the lead must be the most spectacular piece of balance ever recorded on film. He must be seen as a believer. The other is Sophie Tucker, who makes a trip near the end of the movie. Her magnetism, her professionalism, her pure talent of being herself - well, charisma is not taught - you have it or you do not. A good lesson for everyone would be cabaret artists. A sad note: W.C. Fields in his last movie cameo is completely forgettable.
