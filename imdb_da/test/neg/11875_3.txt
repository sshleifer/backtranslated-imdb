Unlike some of the reviews written here, I didn't hate this movie. It's a movie that could have been much better than it was. Not Oscar material, true, but much better than it was. <br /> <br /> I thought the plot had a good hook and through the line. Granted, this movie was poorly written. And TERRIBLY directed and produced. I mean how many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? Why were we there? What is the accuracy of the opening sequence? It seems that the producer (s) looked at American Beauty a couple of times too many times and thought 'I'll use it in an action movie!' I thought the movie wasn't so badly acted. Wesley Snipes did a credible job, he just ran afoul of a bad direction. And when this movie hit the production room, it just got worse. The biggest actress had the same problems. Some of the other actors were suspected, yes, but it was a low budget flick. Again I would say that it is the director's job to pick it up and correct it. As an overall recommendation, I agree with the first review I read that this movie is not worth seeing. Or maybe it's worth seeing if you're a film student and want to see what I'm NOT going to do. <br /> <br /> 3/10 and that gives it praise.
