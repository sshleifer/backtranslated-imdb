I did not leave IMDb comments about movies but this .... this movie was bad. very bad. I quickly jumped through most of it and stopped where I hoped the play had improved since the last scene, just to continue with the fast forward. Formula Plot - when the obvious murderers were discounted, there was only one left. And it was in the first five minutes. Scene after scene I felt that I had already read the script before because there were no surprises, no mystery. Tori character ... bad bad play. A real waste of time on DVD and a certain 'let's go to bed early' if that's the only thing on TV. If you see this movie, you will find yourself aware that you will never be able to return the time you have just wasted.
