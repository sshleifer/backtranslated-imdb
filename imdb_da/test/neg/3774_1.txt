I participated in a screening of this film. Travolta made a Q&A after the movie ended. It was a small screening room in Tribeca. Out of courtesy to him I didn't go out as I wanted to do. This is movie production at worst. To start the script was poorly written. The author writes in one voice. The dialogue was set and clipped. How this writer / instructor got Scarlet Johansen, John Travolta and Lions Gate Entertainment to pick her up on this is the only brilliant thing she has achieved in this failure. In fact, I recommend this movie to all aspiring screenwriters, directors and filmmakers. Because when you're told you're wasting your time, it will be impossible for you to reach your goals. Hi ... just look at this crap and tell yourself ... if they can do this then something possible. <br /> <br /> PS-Travolta did a good Q&A though ... he was calm and spoke freely and was a good guy in the earth. The director / author was on the sidelines. When John tried to engage her in the conversation, she stood back as a piece of wood and never came in. I looked at her and I was thinking ... how could this person successfully "pitch" for agents, studio experts, top talent ... when she can't open her mouth by screening her own movie. The conclusion of a couple of us present was that she should have strong family relationships in the company. <br /> <br /> When you see this, follow it with Guy Ritchie's starry masterpiece "swept away" with the most unintentional fun and worst performance of wife Madonna. She is so bad and looks so bad in this movie. I expect it was her way to get back to her for all the abuse he was taking from her at home.
