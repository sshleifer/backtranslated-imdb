Wow, I haven't seen a movie so bad since "Fire Down Below". Wait, it's also a Seagal movie. Like "On Deadly Ground" and "Fire Down Below", Seagal centers the film on its environmental awareness message, and how the military, FBI and CIA are incompetent idiots. The problem is that both reality and a reasonable plot are secondary to anything gobbleygook social comments Seagal is trying to get across.
