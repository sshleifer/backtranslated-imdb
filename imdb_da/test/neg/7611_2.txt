I haven't reviewed IMDb before, but this documentary is so overrated that I felt compelled to air. I wouldn't even have finished seeing if I hadn't been a guest in a person's house. The film was poor at many levels: First, Treadwell's video recordings were constructed. The more I saw, the more he seemed to be someone who was desperate to be famous instead of an act that was convinced. <br /> <br /> Other - The others in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the airline pilot, were as constructed and corny as he was. God, they seemed artificial. <br /> <br /> Third - Treadwell's mission to protect the bear does not even make sense when he did more harm than good by making the bears accustomed to human presence. I think Treadwell really loved the bear, but there is a lot of research that suggests his efforts were misunderstood. Sometimes we have to sacrifice our enjoyment of wildlife to really help. <br /> <br /> Fourth - The movie's entertainment value was not half of other wildlife films such as "March of the Penguins" and "Winged Migration". The film authorities, in my opinion, seemed to have a bad job of sequencing scenes and gave little incentive to watch. As a person who loves Alaska, bears and other wildlife, I would love to see more people dedicated to the preservation of our wilderness. Hopefully their efforts will be less people-centered.
