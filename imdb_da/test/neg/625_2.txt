When I was 8 years old and went through my Marx Brothers phase, my father read on the television guide that they showed Marx Brothers movie "The Big Store" late on Friday night and put the VCR to tape it for me. When I woke up Saturday - undoubtedly a bug in the guide - my father and I discovered that "The Story of Humanity" had been recorded instead. <br /> <br /> "The Big Store" was probably one of the least fun of all the Marx Brothers movies and yet it is one of the finest cinema works of the century compared to "Human History". I can almost justify the TV Guide's mistake because Marx Brothers - Groucho, Chico and Harpo - appear in both films. Although in "History of Human History" they are divided into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho plays Peter Minuit, Chico plays a guy talking to Christopher Columbus and Harpo plays Isaac Newton ????? Harpos scene lasts approx. half a minute; Chico has only two or three lines; Groucho's scene is at least fun, but terribly racist insensitive to today's standards. The rest of the film does not bear to mention. They trotted out some of today's finest actors and made them recite total waste. What a disappointment. <br /> <br /> TV Guide, I sent you a good letter, I'm still waiting for an apology. <br /> <br /> For the post: "The Big Store" has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with Marx Brothers on roller skates and a few songs by Virginia O'Brien. I was really looking forward to seeing it.
