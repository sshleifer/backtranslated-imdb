CRAP! I accidentally watched this movie thinking that it was the swim upstream that was released in 2003. I seriously regret wasting an hour in my life that sits through it. Shame on the one who gave this junk a prize. I thoroughly mocked this movie - in fact I didn't see it through to the end. After an hour I could no longer stand. I am appalled that people are entertained by such a miserable script - which tries and fails to tear off a dozen other human interests and such a BA-AD action. PAINFUL. I rate it 1 star out of 10. An amateur could make a much, much bigger movie.
