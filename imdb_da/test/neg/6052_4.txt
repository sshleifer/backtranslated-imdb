The problem with this movie is that it tries to compile a 6+ hour movie for 2 hours. The result is clear. It seems too forced, unclear and too simple. <br /> <br /> The only plus side is the beginning. It explains well why and how Hercules was born. The rest of the movie was ... just the mumbo jumbo that's put together. It has the potential to be a great movie like LOTR if it is only forced into 2 hours. <br /> <br /> The action is also not convincing. Ok not everything is bad. But most of them are. Special effects are stupid and look like it was made ten years earlier (although the first monster is pretty good) Generally, I give it 4 out of 10 for the reasons I have described above.
