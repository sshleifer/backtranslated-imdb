Feeling Minnesota, directed by Steven Baigelmann, and starring Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio: The strained relationship between two brothers, Sam (D'Onofrio) and Jjaks (Reeves), is pushed to breakpoint when Jjaks arrives at Sam's wedding and goes off with the bride, Freddie (Diaz), a former stripper, married Sam to repay a gambling blame to nightclub owner Red (Lindo). Baigelmans writing and debut debut is a frustrating mess, full of hateful characters and inconsistency. To put Keanu and Diaz in the same movie must at least provide some eye candy, but Baigelman even challenges out on that score, counteracting his actors with a little positive effect. Very bad.
