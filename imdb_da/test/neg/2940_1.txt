Keep the hell away from this one ... No, I'm really serious - I know you might think this is a fun, campy, cheesy Hong Kong action style B movie. I did, but trust me, it's not. In fact, the only thing that is exactly with the description is the words Hong Kong, and only used in a strict geographical sense. Yes, Donnie Yen has co-directed it. Jackie Chan has a cameo. The guy Ekin Cheng, from Storm Riders plays the lead. It has vampires. It must be good - or at least fun, charming and action-packed. Once again - it is not. <br /> <br /> I could sail on why this movie sucks - I could dissect it, hacking it into small, shaky pieces. But where to start? There is so much to hate ... To make it easier, and to give this hate party some credibility, let me say that I am usually a big fan of Hog Kong cinema. The heavier drama things as well as the easier action and / or comedy. The really good movies and the really cheesy ones. I can sit through many hours of poor subtitling, the jokes are paralyzed enough to get the first sort to roll their eyes. I can handle lovers as caste and celibacy as a conference of nuns, it and just about anything else, the average movie boys would smash their metaphorical toes against their path between action sequences. Also, Hong Kong or another origin - I love it when a movie goes from just being bad to bad enough to be good. But this - Arrgh! It's just awful, STUPID, unwatchable garbage. So far from being fun or charming, it is actually painful. Thus, derived from action, it makes a Bergman movie look like the Texas chainsaw massacre. <br /> <br /> Why?! Why waste such an opportunity? This could have been so much fun!
