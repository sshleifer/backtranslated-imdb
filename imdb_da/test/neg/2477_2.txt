This is a comedy / romance movie directed by Andy Tennant, with Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Kevin James. <br /> <br /> It's about a professional dating doctor - Will Smith - known as 'Hitch' who helps men land with the women they are interested in. He is currently helping with a well-meaning, clumsy Albert occupied by a very strong, famous and rich woman named Allegra. At the same time, Hitch has become interested in a gossip collector, Sara, - Eva Mendes - who has been assigned to write about Allegra. When Sarah's best girlfriend has a loving disillusionment with a man whom Sara thinks is a Hitch client, she discovers a revenge on Hitch and the misconception leads the two couples into a conflicting situation. This movie is not one that men should see as it has a lot of male bashing and both subtle and blatant male hating. There are also double standards that you must be blind to not see. Hitch and Sara are both closely guarded around the opposite sex, Hitch still loves women despite her burns from them earlier and teaches men to make them happy. But of course Sara is a sexist bigot who often makes sexist comments as "men want sex with something that goes." She is self-confident and knows that she looks like a goddess and knows that there are no 'real men' out there. What annoyed me most was the 'bad' guy who wanted a quick fumble with Sara's best friend, who is the classic example of a defenseless 'victim' and even after being dismissed physically by Hitch, he receives as a blow on pills from Sara, then she says, "I'm happy now." In addition, the "women are still oppressed" vibes you get from Allegra, not allowed to spend their own money after requesting permission from a table of men. In spite of all the fragile assumptions and generalizations - can women always tell when you're not right with them? - This movie has the right point that in America, love simply does not exist. There are some fun parts in this movie, such as Albert and his dance habits, but this movie generally only beats the horrible movie Honey of a marginal amount.
