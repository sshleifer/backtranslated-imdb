Terence Stamp can carry something, but it is still a low-dimensional film. It's nice to look at - so are the actors - and if you are in dragon drones, I think you might like it a lot, but the plot and the characters are as thin as cardboard. It is one of the politically correct films that reject everything else to make a 'minority lifestyle' seem warm and fun. It gets very mileage out of the bitchy dialogue, which is entertaining in this sanitized form, I think. <br /> <br /> Seventy percent of the action is parading around in bubbly costumes in scary situations. The dramatic content is a token appendix - they hardly try to make you take it seriously.
