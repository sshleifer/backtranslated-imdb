This 22 minute short, short of a precursor to the later much better "Rock and Rule" contains two folk songs that don't go anywhere. The female mouse, Jan, writes an agreement with the devil to become a hit rock star. So it's up to Daniel Mouse to save his soul. Made in the late 70's, this has all the years of the decade (crap music, crap clothing and hair style, horrible folk music). This comic book is highlighted on the second disc by the 2-Disk Collector's Edition of "Rock and Rule" it also comes with a representation of it running almost as long as the show itself. <br /> <br /> My character: D +
