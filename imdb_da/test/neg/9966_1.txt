I heard legends about this "movie" (quotes used not to offend movies) for a while, so when I finally got the DVD with it, I began impatiently to see it. In the end, I had to jump forward through just a few of the most moronic, inappropriate, unclear scenes of this pointless childish mess to make it end faster. <br /> <br /> This may be the worst movie I've even "touched" - and I used to be associated with Troma for a while. "Manson Family" makes the bottom of Troma's records look like bold and groundbreaking art house films. I could go on and talk about the syphilis skeleton of a "plot", it has the outrageous bad "spectacle", the painful, inappropriate "governance", sets and props with their "dollar nineteen and" look (I especially "beloved" plastic toys guns used in the Tate murder scene!) or the nauseating look and feel of this whole sack of garbage (I think it should represent a drug-induced hallucination; I have absolutely no idea how a drug-induced hallucination looks or feels and I nor will I find out - but I think drug dealers with burned-out "brains" will love this "movie" (they seem to be the ones who made it). I've seen many movies from different "worst 50" lists which was traditionally opened by Eddie Woods - and Eddie Wood would be horrified by the sheer obscenity and the unprofitable of van Webber (or whatever he called, I certainly will not remember it.) I have never seen "Superbabies" or its successor, but I would like "Manson" to join them in IMDb's assessment. Fortunately, this unclear garbage is not likely to be seen by enough viewers to justify enough "1" votes - and so much the better!
