Suk? The stupid government again tried to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier, and of course, the experiments went horribly wrong and charged us with half a half a mutant, snatching a horrible mass and squeaking like a little girl when he is sad. Lance Henriksen stars as the honest scientist who immediately ends the experiment after hearing it was a military project, but he returns (brings the whole family with him) when he finds out that his beloved guinea pig has been killed . "Mind Ripper" is definitely a watchable horror movie, but it is very unoriginal and has virtually all the lame clich√©s you can think of (including the alien father / rebellious teen son subplot ... gab). The characters are like wooden dolls, the stupid things being said and done, and there is a completely meaningless dream sequence ... coming from the monster !!! There are a handful of interesting gory scenes to enjoy, and some of the isolated desert sites are effectively scary. Lance Henriksen is suitable as always, although this is yet another subordinate production, he stars, and Giovanni Ribisi deserved a better movie to make his debut. For some reason, this anonymous 90's thriller is also known as "The Hills Have Eyes Part 3". Is it because it's about members of the same family being terrorized in the desert? Is it because Wes Craven was again involved as a producer this time? Or maybe it's because the monster gets bald at the end like the freaky Michael Berryman in the 1977 original? Who knows ... Who cares? Wes Craven probably funded this project because his son wrote the script together and it always moves to discover that your offspring is as unlikely as you are. Not recommended!
