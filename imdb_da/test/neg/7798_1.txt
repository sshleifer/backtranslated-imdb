I saw the example in the Femali and thought it could be a tough movie. It turns out to be a terrible garbage. There is not much nudity in the film, not to mention having a lot of sex either. There were just some stupid and corny dialogues along with some non-interested dance you usually expect to see during audition. In our case, you can even see it in the current movies. Conclusion: I have nothing for it. Just leave it alone.
