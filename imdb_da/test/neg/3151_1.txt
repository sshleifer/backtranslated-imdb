Barney and Friends are probably the worst kids show I've ever seen. It teaches the children nothing, the songs are corny, it is not educational and the characters are simply agitating. I'm not one to disagree with those who hate the show. Honestly, I've seen more negative than positive reviews for this show. 75% of the reviews are negative and there are some really mature people. This exhibition contains no educational value or age-related teaching materials at all. More reasons why I do not like this show are because of crappy plots, cheesy dialogue, horrid special effects and the unpleasant story lines. In addition, it says that you should eat junk food if you are sad and that strangers are your friends. To say that it is a "model of what kindergarten television should be", as expressed by Yale researchers Dorothy and Jerome Singer, is a lot of shit. They don't know what they're talking about. I would never recommend Barney to anyone. The reason why some children continue to cry or become addicted to junk is because of this show poisoning children's minds everywhere. For people (parents / children) seeking true preschool maternal, change to Nick Jr. and see "Super Why!" instead. It's far better than this turd, and five TVs once had the nerve to put it on "milkshake" but luckily took it off. I highly recommend everyone to stay far away from this show as possible. I highly recommend parents to keep your children as far away from this show as possible. They will thank you later. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: Don't waste your valuable time with this stupid show. It's Utter Garbage. -10000000000000/10. Degree: Z. Avoid like the plague! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
