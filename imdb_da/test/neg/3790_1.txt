I think I've finally seen the worst movie ever made and it hurts me to say it. As a big fan of indie cinema, gay or otherwise, I had great hopes. Several minutes in the movie, however, the sheriff showed my voice to the worst actor of this or any other century. His performance and dialogue he was forced to perform caused me the extraordinary step of stopping the DVD in its tracks. Hours later, when I turned up enough courage to press the play button again, it was no better. <br /> <br /> Apart from the sheriff and his cartoon racist deputies, the film has an attractive cast for whom I felt genuine sympathy since they had such a miserable script. The idea behind the movie is fine - using the lynching of gay men in "New South" just as it was used on black men in the old southern area, leaving "strange fruit" hanging from the trees. <br /> <br /> With a performed author and instructor, we may have had a movie. Instead, we get false detective work, discussions on homosexuality and a clich√© with the one good white man trying to save the day. I have no doubt that racism is still flourishing. The FBI is currently investigating a white school bus driver in Louisa's backyard forcing the black children to get to the back of the bus. But this city is a cartoon, and it's hard to believe everything you see or hear. <br /> <br /> There are some subplots in a weak attempt to try to make the main character three-dimensional, but to mostly they also fail miserably. <br /> <br /> For the real masochist, the DVD contains some deleted scenes that make you cover. <br /> <br /> It's probably the first movie that makes me think the author / directors need to pass a trial and get licensed before they can make a movie. Although I would look forward to seeing more of the cast members in better movies, I would be hard pressed to witness anything else from this director.
