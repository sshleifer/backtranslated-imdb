a very mediocre film based on a fantastic series of stories and novels. I hope someone someday will be able to film it in the right way. Meanwhile, look for the books (by A. Sapkowski), a very inteligent, post-modern fantasy. Now there must be a translation in English, there are probably translations in German.
