This is a snus movie. I am shocked that it is even considered to be in the IMDb library. And Bill, Julia, and all other "professional" actors involved should be ashamed of being part of this sick flick. I thought I should see a somewhat classic horror movie with a creative ending that authors like to find out .... it is usually nothing when writing a horror movie, but as a viewer, we try to rationalize and understand. This end was not creative. It was sick and has all the ear tags of a snus film. I am shocked that it was edited to this end and more shocked that it will be out for distribution by the end of June 2009. It should not appear in a theater. It is detrimental to innocent minds on many levels .... see the movie, the end, and you will understand this statement. Plus, included in the plot is a cute little girl "not yet 9" her character says. She is not in the snuff ending, but she is an integral part of the movie. Why do leaders feel they need to shock with a sick girl for recognition? The director is in the wrong order if she thinks this is an art movie.
