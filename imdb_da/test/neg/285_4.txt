Each James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Like all Indiana Jones movies, ITS has its own set of rules. And the fact that scriptwriters do not break these rules maintains the characters' integrity. With a completely unnecessary plot twist, the integrity of both Ocean movies flashes somewhere between Airplane 2 and a Roadrunner cartoon. <br /> <br /> Imagine what would happen while counting on the rope bridge outside the Temple of Doom if Indy told Shorty and Willie not to worry, because throughout the first two films he has secretly had super powers and can fly them both for safety. <br /> <br /> Entertaining? Safe on a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never have done so because it would have destroyed the integrity of the movie. More importantly, it would have ANGERED the audience. They had already put on the edge of their seats for 3 hours worth of Indiana Jones movies, and they counted on Indiana to get them out of the bridge in a credible way. If he were to fly away? People would have gone out of the theater the same way people did during Ocean's 12. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS <br /> 1. Julia Roberts'character, Tess, infiltrates a museum by pampering even as ... Julia Roberts?!? A wise twist? By breaking the fourth wall three hours after we were introduced to these figures? Is it the naked gun 33 and 1/3? It is a textbook example of how a cheap laugh can destroy a whole movie. But wait ... just if you haven't gone yet ... <br /> <br /> 2. The suspension builds the whole movie's last hour - how do they get out - there are only 10 ... 8. .. 5 ... 2 DAYS LEFT! And then in the last 12 minutes of the movie, the only entertaining part of this movie, we see that the hoist was made days earlier and took Matt Damon every 30 seconds to pull off. The last 10 days? A complete waste of your time. BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON THE ROPE BRIDGE ... "Just relax, Willie! I stole the REAL stones back about a month ago! I also convinced you that you were Kate Capshaw!" <br /> <br /> If you haven't already seen it, cut your losses and go to Polar Express. I don't want to ruin the end for you, but there really is a Santa Claus. Most importantly, you do not feel cheated and leave the theater.
