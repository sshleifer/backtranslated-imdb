20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only pretty stupid, but is an unbelievably unmitigated drill of a movie. Full of convincing cardboard characters it is gently written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco, from whom one would expect quite a bit more. Miscast is Ida Lupino's leading role! Lupino, a lady who was able to radiate as much sex appeal as a blood orange, is here during the illusion, she is Rita Hayworth, who plays part of a sexy bar-room-torch singer. Stylish Cornel Wilde as her lover is like wood as usual and totally wasted is the talented Celeste Holm, whose role is a little more than a bit. Then we have Richard Widmark, who has the most ridiculously written part in the picture! When we first see him, he is a lovely O.K. guy running a thriving road house. So suddenly - and for reasons that are not sufficiently clear - he becomes sindssy jealous of his manager (Wilde) when the latter tells him he is marrying Lupino. You see that Widmark would marry herself, but - 1) He never suggested to her - 2) They never had a relationship (they don't even have something like a love scene together) and - 3) without telling anyone ( including Lupino) he has got a marriage permit. Wow! So how Widmark was to achieve something like outdated bliss with Lupino after such a "marriage proposal" is a person's quess. Huh? Well, when Widmark breaks down the whole thing, the film I make sorry to say. This makes the Widmark character unintentionally comical! He loses his marble so early in the case, is completely unreliable and convincing. He finally goes over the edge, becomes completely confused, and with a few Tommy Udo snails, he goes ridiculously to poor Cornel Wilde before he even bites the dust. <br /> <br /> And if that's not enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred by a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. There is not a single outdoor shot in the whole movie! Added to this - 95% of the movie takes place at night. <br /> <br /> In addition to an interactive press book and a photo gallery, the extras also feature a featurette "Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox". Whatever is asked for such a documentary, I'm over! As far as I know, they were never together in a movie at Fox or anywhere! However, this featurette has been of such heavy hitter know-all as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer, and a few others who praise this weary and cringe-inducing affair. All I can say is that I guess. But "Road House" so far was a forgotten and buried Noir, and as far as I was concerned, it should have remained so. Fox would do better if they released DVDs of superior and so far-off Widmark films such as "Down To The Sea In Ships" (1949) and the colorful "Red Skies of Montana" (1952).
