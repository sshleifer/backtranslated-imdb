OK, I read the instructor's comment on this movie (highlighted as the "frontmost comment") and I must admit that I can identify with his position. <br /> <br /> Micheal, I hope your career has come back from this special setback and you went on to other, better things. I've seen this movie in the MST3K form. Even with all the chopped continuities and snotty remarks that were thrown out of the robots, I saw a potentially decent movie with an ambitious set of ideas that attempted to struggle under the limited budget and limited actors available. And it's one of those movies ("Mitchell" is another), where the MST3K crew took many cheap shots on the protagonist, even when she actually deserved better. You know they had a little unfair fun at the actor's expense because it made it a livelier episode. <br /> <br /> The IMO, the fact that the movie was actually trying to be about something, had a few decent, effective moments here and that has to keep it out of "bottom 100" ("Tangents / Time Chasers" is another movie with a plot and a heart that doesn't deserve to be there either). <br /> <br /> But it's still not a really good movie. I do not blame the author / lead actress for being who she is. It was just that her acting and writing skills needed a few years to mature before she could draw a vanity project like this or wear a feature film. The printer and characterization are amateurish and slapdash, and the dialogue is often hardly up to ABC Afterschool Special standards. It cast sincerely giving it their best effort, and the play generally is certainly head and shoulders over abortion such as "Future War" or "Space Mutiny", but there are no really professional level performances here except for "Big Joe" Estevez who is hammy but appropriately intense. I have never seen the full original cut, but MST's "Soultaker" sampling was representative enough to clean these facts. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the movie has Robert Z'Dar in it. It's the IMO, a true 'Kiss of Death' for any movie that hopes to be taken seriously. Yes, he is big and scary looking in his role, but I just hate the guy as an actor. (In fact, I wish him well and hope he is financially comfortable). <br /> <br /> There were little things I liked about the movie. For example, the companionship between the male leader and his dead friend added some warmth and humor to the movie and made it much more visible. The thought of a lift in the hospital that opened its doors to the afterlife was an inspired way to invoke some ghostly vibes without jumping to special effects, and I respected the one who worked it in the script to keep the budget manageable. It didn't work right, but it could do with a little more customization. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Mr Rissi, good luck with your other projects - your engagement with this misfire wouldn't keep me from seeing anything else you did if the buzz was good. And Mrs Miller has nothing to be ashamed of - she was young and ambitious, and the film was not that bad.
