The 3 stars are for Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Nothing else, and no one else in this movie even deserves a little smithy of a star. Well, OK, Amy Adams deserves a little smithy, but the blacksmith does not seem to work, so I stick to 3. Tom Hanks ... nothing. Julia Roberts ... nothing. Mike Nichols ... do you see a trend yet? Aaron Sorkin ... OMG, not a chance. <br /> <br /> I could go on for more sections on how Charlie Wilson's war is about history, morality, legitimacy, etc., but I don't think such a rant could offset Aaron's Sorkin fans. The rest of you beware. Replace your movie money elsewhere. <br /> <br /> Still, if you're looking for a pithy comment, here's mine. You can put warm fudgesauce on a pile of garbage, but it doesn't change anything. Waste is garbage and it's also Charlie Wilson's war.
