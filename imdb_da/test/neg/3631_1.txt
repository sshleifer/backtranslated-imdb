I first looked at this show and hoped for a few laughs, good plays and good plot. Unfortunately I didn't get any of it. <br /> <br /> First, this is completely unrealistic. How can anyone go to a boarding school that is super-hip, great location and hardly any rules? Plus a sushi bar. A SUSHI BAR. No school has a sushi bar. And what about the huge, ultra cool, ultra hip dorm rooms? This does not happen in boarding schools! Everyone in this show seems to be perfect. Zoey looks perfect, has the perfect friends, never does homework and is super popular. Sounds more like a villain for me! I hate how they use so many cliques in this show, Example: Dana the skater chick. She is completely ignorant and wears "edgy" clothes. The wit is old sooo old too! I didn't want to see this show if I were you, it's one of the most horrible shows I've ever seen, and I hope it's canceled soon! Rating: 1/10
