As a sci-fi and casual Angelina Jolie fan, I thought this obviously low-budget movie might be worth a visit ... maybe it had some scenes or a story that would make up for all its other mistakes. Plus, it can be interesting to see Angelina as she started her star-bound career. <br /> <br /> How wrong I was. One thing I learned - at 18, Angelina Jolie couldn't act. So, to make her comfortable, the producers threw this movie with people who couldn't trade. Seeing this, Jack Palance (who can actually act) decided to overtime. Seeing 10 minutes of this happens enough to burn your eyes out. <br /> <br /> To the horrible acting and overactive add an indecent script, insipid dialogue, bottom-of-the-barrel cinematography ... actually add the bottom of it all. <br /> <br /> The story includes Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate overlords as an assassin. She escapes the company's HQ by using her combat instructor. The company sends bounty hunters to them. Stupid things happen. The end. I want to tell you more, but I wouldn't waste my life and look at this boy. I ask you to do so - it's not worth seeing. It is not even worth considering. Save yourself the pain and continue.
