Few movies have gloomy expectations and disturb me as much as Fire has. The film is pretentious waste. It achieves nothing at artistic level. The only thing that managed to receive is a ban in India. If only because of the poor quality of film making rather than the current controversy, the ban would have been more justified. Now that I have my turmoil out of my system, I am more able to analyze the movie: <br /> <br /> * From the start, the movie is unreal, especially when the protagonists start speaking in English. Of course, the director did not make the film to an Indian audience; however, it underestimated its international audience by simplifying it. When you see the character of the home sailing conversation in perfect English, it is unreal to be true. <br /> <br /> * Next, we get regular flashes in Radha's dreams. These scenes are not very effective. They come up as crushing and prevent the film's flow. I still wonder how the philosophical dialogue is connected with history. I felt that surrealism had been lost. <br /> <br /> * Love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for the audience's titulation rather than being a powerful statement. In any case, they do not achieve either of the two. <br /> <br /> * Names chosen for the women, Radha and Sita, are names of Hindu deities and are therefore chosen to shock the audience. But when the film was not intended for Indian audiences in the first place, the shock-through name selection is not intended to reach its goal, which is absurd. <br /> <br /> * The quality of direction is very poor and some important and delicate scenes have been poorly handled. A better director could have made a strong emotional drama out of the subject. <br /> <br /> * The working filter tree, though Nandita Das had some life in it, was the other one wasted. I always thought Shabana Azmi was a good actress, but her talent is not clear in this movie. The male leaders were direct waste. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Earth and want to see more of the director, stay away from this. Please.
