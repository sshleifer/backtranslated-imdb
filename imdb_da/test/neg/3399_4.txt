This is only a long advertisement for the movie "The Death Tunnel". Although it is an interesting story in the Waverly Hills Sanatorium, the whole ghost theory is up to your interpretation. Several "Ghost Orbs" that you can copy with dust in front of a flash camera and "Ectoplasmic Mist" are just a person's cigarette smoke illuminated with the camera's flash. I couldn't see any "Shadow People" until they sketched a sketch around the blurred distortion of the image. No scientific explanations were suggested for the phenomena, only paranormal. Maybe it's just events to look to believe, so be sure to plan to visit the sanatorium on your next vacation in Louisville, Kentucky.
