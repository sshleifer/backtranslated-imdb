This looks like "amateur" hour. How this piece of waste was ever released is beyond me: the play, the story, the characters, the supposed special effects, etc. It's completely wrong. Why Lance Henriksen accepted this will remain one of the great mysteries of the cinema. Perhaps he was in need of money or perhaps was under the influence of some illegal substance. It is pointless to try to explain what this movie is about. It's about the great foot legend, but is done in the worst possible way. In fact, this stink smells like a direct-to-release. <br /> <br /> Avoid ALL costs! 0 * out of 10 *
