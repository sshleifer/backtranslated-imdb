Star Trek V certainly makes the dubious difference of being the weakest movie in the Star Trek series. Despite the actors' good acting, it has been hit by a general lack of funding from Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures was not excited about this movie at first. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with the Enterprise crew enjoying their extended beach law as a word to save the earth from the overall ecological catastrophe. Their land law is truncated when interference occurs on Nimbus III, Intergalactic Peace Planet. Captain Kirk and Enterprise arrive only at Nimbus III to have their ship hijacked by Sybok, Spock's half brother. Sybok brainwash the company crew and put it on a suicide mission to rendezvous with "God" just past Great Barrier in the center of our galaxy. Captain Kirk will then find a way to regain control of his ship and avert the company's Klignon persecutors. <br /> <br /> The only bright spot in the movie is the actor and director. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill, and the rest of the cast all give good performances. William Shatner also does a pretty good job of managing this movie. <br /> <br /> But the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. First, the part of Sybok was originally offered to Sean Connery, but he refused. So, Laurence Luckinbill got part. Second, many of the special effects were severely reduced ... reduced the film's entertaining potential. Third, the scene depicting the arrival of the Great Barrier left much to be desired. Finally, the romance between Scotty and Uhura in this film has had no meaning at all ... considering that no such romance has ever taken place before this point in the Star Trek universe, and it was never explained how such a romance suddenly realized between Star Treks IV and V. <br /> All in all, this is a very weak movie. You should just skip this movie and move on to Star Trek VI. After all, the cast and crew Star Trek VI did some to help them out after their debacle with Star Trek V.
