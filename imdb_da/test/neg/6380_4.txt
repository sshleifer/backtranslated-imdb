This show has shown that it is true colors now that Democrats are in power. It never led to the world in IQ, since anyone who believed it has intelligence has been programmed to think in a way (which is a frightening thing). Comedy Central moved this and it is back to an earlier time when the Democrats took power for a reason - now that the Democrats are turning up - which is as often as the Republicans do - Stewart no longer takes pot shots on them. Therefore, the classes fall for both this and spin. <br /> <br /> Basically, the bulk of humor is now either paralyzing or paralyzing Sarah Palin's jokes - as all of the losing comedians are now telling. Facts to back this up speak for themselves. The Jay Leno show, which has made the same kind of humor, is being canceled. Ratings for Letterman & Conan & they show that they follow them down. <br /> <br /> So Emperor Stewart is not alone. The problem is, if any of them begin to take real rips with the dangling democrats in power, they could speed up their judgments because the best humor is always at the expense of whose power. The Bush years showed it, because the ratings for this show & Colbert, & Letterman & Leno were higher there. O'Bama has done one thing, showing that these shows should be willing to take chances and rip them into power if they are to thrive. Right now, the Daily Show & Stewart is saying, but maybe they can get lucky and Palin has chosen as the first women's president in 2012. Then Lame Palin jokes become valued grabbers.
