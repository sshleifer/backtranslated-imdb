Two-sided boys working on a radio network go from trying to solve the murders to performing in black-face between shifts. Jack Moran and Sidney Miller stand in this whodunnit from 1945. Lots of quick speeches, everyone shouts at all and the two side boys call the police detective "Marty" (played by Ralph Sanford). It is a true "shortie" in 59 minutes and it has the feeling of being adapted from a game as it mostly takes place in a radio station soundstage. We don't care about any of the characters, which is likely to be almost never shown. Nothing special. It was Phil Karlson's second film as an instructor. We have no clue as to who can knock people out, so we just follow the police detector and the side boys as they all try to solve the mystery first. I'm no longer saying not to give away any spoilers.
