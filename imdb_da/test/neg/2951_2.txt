We waited in line to watch The Good Girl, an excellent movie with Jennifer Aniston, as some ladies came up with this cheapo mock twenty dollar bill advertising MANNA FROM HEAVEN. "Come see this movie!" she said. "You will love it!" <br /> <br /> She introduced us to the movie director. Now it should have been our first clue. I mean, in how many movie situations do you have the film's director standing in the lobby and begging people to see it? "Is it a Christian movie?" I asked, not really worrying in one way or another. I love Jesus. No shame on that. "None!" she said defensively. What a lot of crap. <br /> <br /> This movie is BAD. So bad. And it's not just because of the obvious Christian agenda, but because of the terrible dialogue that changes between wood and exaggerated and the obvious lack of an editor. The movie is too long. Had it been an hour and a half, so maybe (just maybe) I would not have had to visit the suicide prevention center after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, I'm lying. Look, after an hour of this waste we sneak into the SWIMFAN. At least with SWIMFAN, we know that it is garbage before we go in to see the movie. We know how to study ourselves. And SWIMFAN has warm half-naked people. The only thing that is half naked in this movie is the desperation of the stars involved, whose obvious lack of script offerings is anything but hidden. And the actress who clapped the nun? It's called a personality. Get one. <br /> <br /> The people shamelessly asking for ticket sales in the lobby told me that if I liked my great fat story, I would * love * (their weight, not my) man from heaven. Right. More like, "If you like GLITTER, you'll love MAN from Heaven." And Mariah could actually outperform any of the clowns from this flick. If it's not an insult, I don't know what it is. <br /> <br /> I've tracked enough. Go see the movie, but don't see the bad ones. This is certainly one of the bad ones. Man from heaven needs some divine intervention.
