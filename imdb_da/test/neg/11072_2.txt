What a shocker. Initially, I couldn't stand constantly screaming and noisy panic all the time. It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic to the signs; It was simply annoying. The jerky camera movements were also annoying. The reason was the same as virtually all other cheap horrors. There were some pathetic attempts to give the characters depth, but it didn't work right in the rest of the plot. And then there is the end. I'm still not really sure what to do about it. I suppose it was a wise twist, so shed light on the situation, but it was just stupid. <br /> <br /> The case had a couple of these little prize winners / nominations symbols on it, so I figured it couldn't be that bad. I was mistaken. If you see it, you should just leave it on the shelf.
