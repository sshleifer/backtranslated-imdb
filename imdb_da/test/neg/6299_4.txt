This movie tries hard but fails. Perhaps for non-Australian audiences it can be a travel explanation, but to the native it is just boring. <br /> <br /> Anyone living here knows that Broken Hill is a hard and hard insulated mining. If a couple of quoted fruits come up in a row, it is all so predictable. Where have I come across the well-developed theme before? Oh yes - Town and land mice. Save us. <br /> <br /> I was hoping it would improve, but after the Broken Hill scene I could see where it was going and then turned off the television and went to bed.
