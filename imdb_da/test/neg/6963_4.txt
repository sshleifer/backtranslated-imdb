First of all, Ed Wood is Jr. not the worst instructor ever, Plan 9 from outer space does not resist. Coleman Francis deserves the title. I present exhibition B, Glen or Glenda. <br /> <br /> The first half of the film consists of a surprisingly thought-provoking crossdressing exploration, especially since it was made in 1953. The last 15 minutes of movies are also not bad as well. <br /> <br /> This is not to say that the movie has no problems. Bela Lugosi was completely outside, intimidating odd lines. Poor Bela itself looked like he wasn't sure what happened at times. The action was decidely wood but no worse than a period Universal B movie. The long dream sequence, which is the center of the film, was quite bizarre; more like a vaguely threatening stag film than a dream sequence. The Alan / Ann story, the supposed original focus on the movie, has a clever quality of it. <br /> <br /> No, Ed Wood Jr. is not the worst instructor ever. He was able, at least for part of this film, to make a serious social statement. When Coleman Francis tried to do so in the Night Train To Mundo Fine (also Red Zone Cuba), it just ended in chaos. Glen or Glenda is at least easily accessible without robot assistance.
