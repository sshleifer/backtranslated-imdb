Parrots? Parrots? I've been around this old land longer than most and have seen almost all the westerns that have produced. Old West history is my passion. Comanche Moon is one of the most poorly produced, directed and traded stories I have ever seen. There was very little historical accuracy, but then it is obvious that you were on a budget, which <br /> <br /> played a clear role in this insult to intelligence. I'm glad I've had this show. It was bad enough to have to sit and watch the movie plus put up with the ina ads. Once again, there wasn't an actor coming anywhere near convincing. I hoped it would be better as the three days progressed. WRONG! I am ashamed to say that I wasted 4 1/2 hours of the precious little time I have left.
