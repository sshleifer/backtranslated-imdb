Adenoid Hynkel, a low soldier in the First World War, rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of Toumania. He creates an aggressive, anti-Semitic war machine and cultivates a small toothbrush mustache. Sounds like everyone you know? From Hollywood's security, Chaplin uses this soapbox to encourage Europe to take up arms and believe Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States in 1940 had more than a year of neutrality in front of it and no strong desire to commit itself to the civilian struggle of Europe (remember, it was Hitler who declared war on the United States, not the other way around) it is surprising that Chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic. The story, on the one hand, involves the vulgar and dissuasive Hynkel and the terrorism which he unfortunately presides, and the life of the Jewish ghetto where every person is friendly, humane, courageous, etc. etc. Chaplin is Hynkel and he also plays it Jewish shaves, the little hero of the ghetto (The Tramp in all but name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, controls stars, composes the music and makes catering. In 1940, the full truth was not yet known about the third kingdom, and Chaplin can be forgiven for having less than perfect historical foresight, but even to today's standards, he gets Hitler very wrong. A comedian and a sentimentalist, Chaplin tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynkel stupid and fun. All this does is humanize him. When Hynkel fools the non-warlike soldier around with the big gun and the upward airplane, he becomes attractive rather than despicable. As a dictator, he inspects his subordinate technical innovations that do not work (the parachute hat, the bulletproof uniform, etc.), and these passages are meant to make us believe that the real Nazis are incomplete and can be removed. In fact, Hynkel's regime is made sweet and sympathetic by its bumbling bodgery. In fact, Chaplin's day had already gone when he made this contemplated polemic. In the heart he was still a dinosaur on the silent screen (check out humor, with gags as frightening up and down the half-conscious or pantomime of the coins in the puddings). Quite Schultz is supposed to represent a goal of European decency with which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz looks more like a sign from operetta than a Nazi. Is it in any way credible that a Schultz figure (if it had existed) would say to the Fuehrer face: "Your case is doomed to failure because it is based on the stupid and ruthless pursuit of innocent people"? And how does Schultz come to be in the basement of the Jewish ghetto? If he is the subject of an exhaustive manhunt, why is he continuing to wear his Ruritanian uniform? Chaplin did not yet know the full horror of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka's, but the Nazi concentration camp he offers us is hopelessly out of kilts with the ugly spirit of the age. As usual, Chaplin appears in the form of "silent" comedy set pieces, loosely attached to the narrative clothing line. There are knockabout scrapping with storm troopers, shaving a man to the accompaniment of Brahms, and globe ballet (beware the segment filmed in reverse). <br /> <br /> Paulette Goddard is the incredibly perfect Hannah. Just as the ghett people are impossible to enjoy, and the Jewish port of Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, Hannah is literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is canarian of Judaism in the ghetto bureaucracy. "Gee, am I not sweet?" she asks after the barber gives her a make-over. Too sweet is the answer. She does not come close to calling true because Chaplin has made her a caricature. It wouldn't be wonderful? Speech that Chaplin puts in the mouth is typical of the author - for proper, also emotionally cloying. Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, the fascist dictator of bacteria. He brings a sling of much-needed comic brio to the case, but the film's underlying weakness remains. If Napaloni is stupid and ineffective, how can we fear him? And in any case, the stubborn stop's start-stop is a fine Chaplinesque example of a gag that continues far beyond the comic. <br /> <br /> And where did the Jewish shave buy the immaculate Hynkel uniform?
