This is terrible. No really, this is, nobody carried, the absolute worst ... worst ... I hesitate to call it even a @ & $% in '_movie_. It's a ninety minute visual root canal. The reason is almost non-existent: A crazy scientist resembling the frontman from 'The Cars' impregnates a woman in her secret lab, a grass chair in what I think can be a garage through an injection of Palmolive. Within hours she gives birth to a full-grown monster, who then goes on a rampage. It's the whole movie. Death scene: These are badly created, take _forver_, and the actor ... how can you clean up _screaming_ ?? The victims stand there while the grazing, hissing, congested freak progresses on them and continues to choke them for about three days. The sets are cheesy, the lighting for most of the film consists of a single maglite (yes, a great honkin 'flashlight), the sound quality is poor, there are only about 40 words of dialogue for the whole movie and the play is generously described as wood. Recordings are recycled shamelessly to cover the film. And the special effects would make any BBC sci-fi production shake their head and proclaim "they didn't even try". "Monster" is some nameless in a $ 3 halloween rubber mask with a few bandages turned on. In his meeting with the film's lonely policeman, the policeman burns blank, smokeless, invisible bullets that seem to travel so slowly that the monster can escape them in five steps. Don't watch this movie. No, really, it's not a trip. Don't watch this movie. The director must shoot. The author must be linked to a huge stone, where his liver will be consumed every morning by Ed Wood. Enough rental and there could be a sequel, don't let that happen!
