Well, there's not much to say about this movie. It's simply the trash. very bad acting, bad script and lame story .... Reach the actress (i don't even know her name) who played mainrol (not the blonde but latina one) worked fine but the blonde who played friend of the main character ,,, her acting is like high school games, like most other film actors. Also zombies ,,,, very bad acting too. and ,, the story itself really has no meaning at all. Well, if you are really bored and really have nothing to do but want to kill somehow somehow, you might see the movie, but there are still millions of better B movies than this crap. its total waste of money and time.
