... and that says something. No matter how bad a movie becomes, I can usually sit through it so I can judge the full movie. Through this I made it about 20 minutes. <br /> <br /> Maybe it was the DVD, or maybe it was my laptop, but I couldn't hear the dialogue even though the volume was completely up. Sound effects were fine, so with the sound up to hear the dialogue, I blasted my eardrums with the effects. As much as I would see this thing through, I would not sacrifice my hearing for it. <br /> <br /> From which little I could tell about the plot, the movie was a great feedback from the main character's daughter. It seems that the mother, a military pilot, had to flee her ship because the only person on her ship she trusted was one of the enemy, and now he is pursuing her on a desert plane. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about the movie was the protagonist's appearance; There was something I liked about her hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Well, it looks like this one goes into the dumpster ...
