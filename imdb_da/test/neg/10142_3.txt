I liked every character of this show from the start except Reba herself. She comes out like a better than you write and frankly a big bully. And it stinks because she's in every scene and every episode. In the later seasons, Van is also unlikely to be a forgery of his former self. and Kyra goes around cheating and getting miserable. The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you overlook Reba. At the end, it's pretty bleak. In almost every episode Barbara Jean goes around being stupid, but Reba is meaningful to her, but poor Ole Barbara Jean desperately wants Reba to like her, resulting in Barabara jean telling Reba how amazing she is in each episode. I think it's pretty clear to see that Reba has self-esteem problems and wants to be considered this all forgiving weekend. It's really a shame too, because other than her show had such potential.
