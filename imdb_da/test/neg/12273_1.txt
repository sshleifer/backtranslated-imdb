It was cool out of the movie sleeve, but after five minutes we were not sure if it was a gay documentary from the West without any female interest. The film quality was poor and there was hardly enough bandwidth to maintain even the darkest person's interest for long enough to watch the whole movie. May God be merciful to the souls of both the actors and the filmmakers responsible for what I can only describe as my new and sole reason why I will never see (or trust) an Australian movie again. I'll write more so I'll say again that the actors were so bad that I'm positive. I could make a better movie with fifteen dollars and a box of Trojan. Please don't watch this movie for your own sake.
