Pretentious horror movies, resembling a soap opera, have gone goth about a fabric that sends you to a fantasy world where alien creatures are lurking. The film has some good pictures, but its odd mix of what's right and what's not going anywhere. Worse, they are vague statements in the voice over from one of the characters. It seems to be a more serious and more meaningful movie, but I don't think they even came into the serious or meaningful area at first, so trying to translate the meaning comes from silly. There is not much to say, people talk, take medicine has visions ... they talk some more. It is not bad as much as meaningless and boring. The boring is the sin here and the reason you want to avoid this.
