I found the first bit of stop motion animation exciting and the mostly live action card with the girl going on in which country it was kept my interest but the other 11 odd shorts really didn't pique my interest or make me think of anything at all. The music and the 8mm recordings all seemed to be so random that it all just happened to be random. I would not recommend it to anyone unless you get to see it for free. <br /> <br /> As for the music, it is in a row that didn't come across either. I rented the DVD because I thought it was all stop motion animation or SMA mixed with live action and only the first card was SMA, the other had a small stop motion mixed with mostly live action. There were paper-cut things in one, and the rest were outdoor shots from an 8mm camera with the music's bed. I just had no opinion on it.
