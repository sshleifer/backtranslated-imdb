George Segal lives with his older and senile mother. There are many jokes about her Alzheimer's-like dementia, and most of them are not funny, although there were a few fun moments sprinkled here and there (like naked running through the park and the old homes). First, Segal tries to kill his mother because she is hard to live with and because he is a selfish guy. Make the movie kind of like a Wiley Coyote versus the Roadrunner comedy where he repeatedly tries to kill this indestructible gal would have been a hoot - too bad it wasn't the overall tone of the movie. <br /> <br /> I welcome Carl Reiner's attempt to make a tasteless film designed to offend everyone. I have a special place in my heart for movies like ED and his mortal mother, to eat RAOUL and good luck to KATAKURIS - all movies of death that dare to offend. The problem here is, however, where is there? Have some fun moments, but it also has a lot of flat and the overall product is incredibly bland. Plus, topics like homosexual rape, incest and the like are really hard to make fun. I read in "THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES" that it is considered a cult movie, though I just can't see anyone who wants to see this more than once.
