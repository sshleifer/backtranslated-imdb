I haven't read "A Time to Kill" by John Grisham and maybe it would have helped understand the movie better. But maybe not. I hear that this is the most faithful Grisham adaptation yet, and if that is true, I can see why so many publishers knocked down the novel when Grisham introduced it as his first work. <br /> <br /> "A time to kill" is one of the movies that is seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once. It wants to be an exciting crowd-pleasing thriller and at the same time a movie dedicated to exploring certain social and moral issues. Let's see, the two types of movies don't go together in Hollywood, why "Dead Man Walking" should be done independently. The story involves a young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConaughy) out to defend a black man named Carl (Samuel L. Jackson) from murdering two hillbillies who brutally raped his young daughter. The day before the rape trial, Carl forgot in a closet in the courthouse, and when the rapes were brought through the building, he charged and shot them both dead. To help with the defense, Jack accepts help from a former law student (Sandra Bullock), proving that her role in this movie was completely unnecessary and only inserted into the film for marketing purposes. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, one of the rapist's infant (Kiefer Sutherland) was angry that a black man killed his brother and decided to show revenge. All this leads to a shooting in front of the courtyard, a kidnapping, a brutal blow and race rebellion. I admit that all this kept a lot of attention throughout the movie, in addition to the courtroom scenes. What I later objected to was the film's handling of ethical issues and its use of formulas in the plot. <br /> <br /> The most important question the film is constantly asking is whether a black man gets a fair trial from a white jury. Sure they can, but that doesn't mean that the man must be acquitted for the trial to be fair. However, this movie does not seem to think about it. In addition, several gaping holes are used in the plot for amenities. For example, there is an unknown character called Mickey Mouse who is a member of the Clan, and for reasons that are not known, defense team members help escape escaping serious dangers from the other Clan members. When Bullock is kidnapped by Sutherland and company and left to die in the desert, this unknown person comes and saves her --- and we never find out who he is and why he helps those people he is to terrorize. /> And when it comes to the Sutherland character's terrorist attack, it's amazing how indecent the police and the Bullock character is to stop him throughout the movie. There is a scene when Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courtyard and tries to shoot Jake when he comes out and shoots one of the guards instead. Now you think, since there are dozens of police around, it would be easy to surround and catch the sniper. No such luck. From what we could see, no one seemed to care that a sniper was still loose. Even after Bullock was rescued by Mickey Mouse, she has never ever mentioned who her kidnapper was, nor was it questioned. Why was this simple. The Sutherland character was needed throughout the film to add continuous excitement, although it would have been logical enough to leave the picture. <br /> <br /> In addition to Bullock's character, there is another thankless character. He is Jake's assistant, played by Oliver Platt. There seems to be a reason why his character is in the movie - giving a number of one-liners to the audience. In my opinion, one-liners show a great weakness in "serious" movies when used. It shows that the filmmakers are not sure that the story and the dialogue alone are enough to keep the audience's attention, and then use them to make the audience laugh to reassure everyone that they are watching an entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> But plenty of the movie's many minor issues. What about the movie's message here? Clearly, Carl is actually guilty of murder. We saw how he planned for hours to kill the men who raped their daughter. The lawyers claim that it was temporary mental illness, etc. That made him kill. In desperation, Jake asks the jury to close his eyes as he tells the rape in detail as part of his final argument. After describing everything that took place, he added on a final line ... "The girl is white". We then see jury members with tears in their eyes. <br /> <br /> In the nearest scene, a girl comes out and shouts, "He's free! He's free!" Please wait! Juries base their judgments on their feelings or on facts? Most of all, why were there no scenes that showed the jury's considerations and what they really thought of their feelings worn out. I'll tell you why. They couldn't show the delibertion because NO JURY could release a man with such a crime, no matter how much the defense's closing arguments touched their hearts. What is the message? That someone is entitled to kill if it is a form of revenge for a previous crime against them? <br /> <br /> This movie should have had the courage to say that murder is not OK in this situation, because in fact, that would not be a acquittal. But since dollars were at stake, the filmmakers were more concerned about saving the audience's feelings than they were presenting a responsible message. If people start killing as a form of revenge, the film's decision makers should be held accountable. What socially irresponsible movie is here!
