Okay, I felt that a movie of Mormons, about Mormons, for Mormons would be a disaster waiting to happen, but little did I know how much it was so painful. One small known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. The official film campaign of the Church has produced rare and lasting pearls that transcend the Mormon community, including the wonderful short film "Cipher in the Snow," which ended up making the rounds a training film in the late 70s. Then there is Neil LaBute's disturbing masterful ouvre. <br /> <br /> However, the success of these films depended heavily on not focusing on Mormons or any particular Mormonology. Instead, they choose to focus on a universal theme and deal with it at a basic human level. "The army of God" is due to all forms of universality and is slowly entering the orthodox and myopic world. Although this may be enough to alienate others than the most devoted Mormon, Richard Ductcher's openness as the film maker and his youth approach to narration is sufficient reason to judge "the army of God" which is not available in almost any standard. <br /> <br /> Dutch's own frightening wood plays set the tone for his army of the least interesting Mormons you will ever meet. Of course, the boring performances of the cast have not helped any of Holland's pathetic script. He should be given credit not to avoid some of the more controversial aspects of the Church, but as one might expect, he comfortably hits those controversies in a sympathetic light. It should also come as no surprise that most of the answers on the darker side of the Church are treated with little more than faith. At one point, an African American missionary scolded a black couple to become a member of a separate church until 1978 (some ten to twenty years after almost all churches in the most degenerate parts of the deep south had already done so) . Instead of addressing the Church's active racist history, it is perhaps the worst place in Mormon's theology that even Church leaders do not defend more that Holland's troubled character instead points to Joseph Smith's murder - an overt and perhaps monstrous allusion to lynching. Top off this syruppy milktoast with third-degree leper jokes that pass as comic relief and you have a strong case for the revival of silent movies. <br /> <br /> If you knew a little about Mormons before watching this movie, you might be exposed to avoiding them at all costs. If you are Mormon, this movie offers absolutely nothing to be proud of.
