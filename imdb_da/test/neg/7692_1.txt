This film revival in March in a poor film industry and Saudi Arabia, I want to know how the director could stand in front of the industry's people after he made this film, the work was so bad we do not know how cinema Saudi companies like Rutana and others support not yang Filmmakers in KSA as UAE We hope in the future to flourish the film industry in Saudi Arabia But without such interference Fools traders and idiots make us bad movies not for the benefit of the cinema's reputation in Saudi Arabia is like the Roman and Iranian film At the same time please do simple experimental cinema in Saudi Arabia as Abdullah alayaf And others to achieve the dream of a good film industry to participate in festivals world away from the big companies interventions stupid
