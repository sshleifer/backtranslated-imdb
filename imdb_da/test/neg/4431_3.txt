When I think of Bollywood. I think a little feel good musical dance tracks, with beautiful clothes on men and women. And catchy tunes. Horror, Thrillers, Mystery and Suspense did not come to mind. And it is in my western eyes as an abstract comedy. <br /> <br /> I think it would have been a better movie, shorter even if the author and director had chosen a particular choice. Either gone for direct Thriller-Horror, Comedy-Mystery, Supernatural-Suspense or Musical-Romance, instead of an awkward mix of them all. <br /> <br /> I have to say more than once, I thought the director must have seen "I know what you did last summer" and tried to give it a bollywood twist. My first movie was Bride & Prejudice. As I thought was busy well. <br /> <br /> It seemed like a Western audience would consider a straight two video cheese party. <br /> <br /> The action was over the top, at times it felt like they were deliberately trying to parody Western thrillers, but when you saw them trying to inject the dramatic weeping, screaming or fear, it felt out of place . <br /> <br /> The viewer was left wondering when one of the actors would blink on the camera. More than a couple of times when the audience was horrified, we could only snicker and absurd. <br /> <br /> I see many foreign films, and even though I can't hear Hindi, I have to say they did a bad job of subtitling the movie. Sometimes it was difficult to read the white letters against the bright background. <br /> <br /> The villain was particularly entertaining, at least for me, because he brought his own mood music. The supposedly surprising twist actually seemed like a police officer. <br /> <br /> The leading couples were beautiful / beautiful enough and the musical numbers made it worthwhile to rent. I would suggest it to anyone as a musical comedy, but I'll just tell them to speed up the rest of the movie because it wasn't worth reading. If you are determined to read an entire subtitle Hindi flick then check out the superior romantic drama 'Namasteay, London'. <br /> <br /> But I wasn't scared .. it's not really what they think is terrible in India. 1 out of 10 for what it is proclaimed as. 6 out of 10, because it is unintentional speed and ability of illegal mass laugh, and it is musical / dance numbers. Enjoy :)
