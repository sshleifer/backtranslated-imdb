Big spoiler right here: this movie is B! A! D! But enjoy it is good bad. Bugged is the kind of movie you can't believe in, with dialogue, plotting and direction, so unfortunately managed to uncle the NED's Carlsbad Cavern home video similar to an IMAX experience. Since it is a Troma flick, there are lots of rough moves, but it is even more fun than normal. <br /> <br /> Most of the production money seems to have gone into buying sodas and sandwiches for the cast and crew. The brilliant dialogue is best summarized in the immortal, "% @ # $! What was it?" which is the only one until they often shouted: "What now?" Any knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien to Ronald Armstrong, the author / director. When one of the friends has been eaten alive by a grasshopper / termite / chiapet thing, Armstrong has the survivors immediately with sweet but stupid-like-a-door button, "Divine". As she is turned on, Divine boils a large steam cooker of a rat-poison / oatmeal mixed on the oven, stares, smiles, touches, smiles and never falls over dead from the vapors! <br /> <br /> Killer bugs are as scary as pi√±atas as they also look very much. The effects used to move them are to pull them over tile floors really quickly, with their legs pulling behind. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie would probably have been that the house blew up, but they were either out of cash or never had anyone, so instead of seeing even a miniature go up in flames, they just let the screen go black (eat you heart out ILM). Cast is almost all black. How can the NAACP constantly censor something really fun like Amos and Andy (which shows characters certainly no less than 99% of all white comedy shows), but says Nary is looking at something like Bugged. Oh yes it is best, they do not know how the softening of this movie is for everyone involved (as it would be if it was played by a single ethnic group, honestly). Before they put kabosh on Bugged, get some friends together and get ready for Plan 9 of Bug Exterminator movies.
