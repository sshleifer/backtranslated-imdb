Two days ago I got a chance to watch this movie on Cable (TV Asia). I've been very disturbed since then. The movie "Baghban" has been very successful in portraying only one side of real life. These are very partial parents. Have you ever thought about another (kids)? There are few parents in this world who just give birth to their children, but do not give right parenting. I'm a victim of it. Why would you (parents) have 5 children in your life if you only do Rs 2000 per. Month? I was made to work on the streets with my siblings. I have no idea how I managed to reach IIT from there. It's been a long time since then, but I still don't think so. Now I'm researching here in the US. I have provided all my necessary supplies with my two brothers who are with them. They couldn't give us basic things when we were kids. I find this movie very annoying. Its very partial. It has deeply damaged my feelings. I strongly urge the producer / instructor of this movie to look at the Indian community in another point of view too and make another movie.
