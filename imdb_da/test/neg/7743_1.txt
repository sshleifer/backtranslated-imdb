And the title says it all: a cheesy sounding title that is a cheesy sounding joke of a movie known as "Alien from L.A." Why not just call it "Alien from South Africa" ​​as this is where this movie was filmed? My advice to watch movies that have been featured on "Mystery Science Theater 3000:", don't see the original version of the movie at all! Period! Always watch the movie with the theater shade at the bottom of the screen, with a man trapped in the room with his two fun, clever cracking robot friends sitting in the lower right corner of the screen. It just works better that way. <br /> <br /> Films as it was originally seen: Horrible! Movie as it was seen on MST3K: Genius!
