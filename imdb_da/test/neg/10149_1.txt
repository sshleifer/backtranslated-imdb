I thought Godzilla 2000 was the worst movie ever until I saw this monstrosity. My friends and I went to our local blockbuster and spent about an hour and a half looking for a movie. We couldn't find one since we've seen almost all created movies. We decided to look in the low budget horror sector. We looked for the most attractive cover with tailor-made women. We finally decided on Last Slumber Party, THE. Whoops, we made a mistake. It looks like this movie was filmed with the cheapest camera that could be found in K-Mart. The actors were brought to a rescue army and to Steven Tyler. We just want to leave it for the imagination. The plot of this movie was ridiculous. SPOILER ALERT While watching the movie, there is absolutely no closure. So come and find out all the events were just a dream. This movie should also have been about 30 minutes. If the entire camera is zooming on still images and scans of walls were taken out, it would have been much shorter. All I can say is, I'm glad there wasn't a sequel.
