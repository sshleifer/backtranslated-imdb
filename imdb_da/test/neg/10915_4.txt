Don't make me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a pretty good movie over all. The healthy Cujo is very scary and the movie is exciting. But after the first few minutes, poor Donna and her little son Tad were held captive in their Pinto by the healthy St. Bernard, I began to wonder why she did nothing to help herself. <br /> <br /> She could have hung her foot out of the door and pushed the car backwards (I mean it was a Pinto for Pete's sake and they were on a downhill slope) and rolled to safety but then it would have been a very short movie. When she started to start the car, did she jump the other way around, hoping that she could at least get down the driveway? No, she tries to make a three-point swing in a car with a poor generator. She managed to get out of the car and look around for 45 seconds or so at some point to try to get to a baseball bat lying on the ground nearby - what a waste of time! I mean, if you have to run for bats, you have to do it and at least you have something to hit the dog with. But forget about bats. Was there no tool in the car, like a tire or something? I didn't see her in the car's extra tires. Really, why wait until you're bitten and weak by dehydration, and your son has a bout before you take a stand against the animal? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, she was beaten and torn, but by God she still had high heels!
