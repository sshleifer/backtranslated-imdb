First I am in the mid 40's. Have been watchin horror movies since I was a kid, so I've seen a lot of variation. IMO, this is not as bad as the quantities that gave this a 1 or 2. Yes, it's a low budget horror flick. The dialogue is social and acts tolerably, sometimes. The basis for this movie plotwise is actually pretty good. For those of you who are old enough to remember or lucky to have seen them on DVD. It's a lot like a 1970s movie this week. Just add in blood and less gore, less T & A and heavy, without big names. That's what a T. I would rather see this than Jason vs. Godzilla or anything else continuous shit out there. It wasn't that good, EVIL DEAD was a low budget movie. At least give these guys credit to try. With acouple MIL budget this could have been a pretty good flip. My score a watchable 4.
