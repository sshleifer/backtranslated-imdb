This movie, despite its list of B, C and D list celebs, is a complete waste of 90 minutes. The reason with its few peaks was very predictable. It was so silly that I can't believe I take the time to write a review of it myself. Flex, for his credit, has grown in his ability to trade since playing Michael Jackson in a made for television movie some years ago. Tangi, on the other hand, has regressed as she was more talented in her role as Felicity's flunkie some years ago. When I watched this train wreck of a movie with its pitiful production and terrible sound quality, other four book came to me to qualify what I was thinking about this movie. But in an effort to keep my writings G rated, I just want to say that this movie is another four letter starting with a L. LAME !!!
