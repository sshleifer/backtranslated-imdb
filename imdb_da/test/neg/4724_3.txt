This movie was a Mexican made horror movie from the late 60s. It's not so good, but not so bad either. There are lots of schlock, and it is padded rather heavily with nudity and violence, but it had a plot and at least tried to hold on to it (though the plot was the same damned Frankenstein inspired "don't manipulate in God's domain" b - fare). There was some padding mixed into female wrestling, but it was made in Mexico, and wrestling seems to be popular in Mexico. The reason is that a doctor wants to save his son who is dying from leukemia. The other doctors have given no hope to the poor guy, but Dad has the idea of ​​transplanting a gorilla's heart so that his son can save his life (I don't know I'm a lawyer, not a doctor). The transplant works, but sonny-boy stops being a man-monkey who terrorizes naked women and kills anyone who comes in his way. There is also a sub-plot involving a policeman and his girlfriend who is a wrestler (this did not add too much, but if they wanted to throw in some masked female wrestlers, this is a good reason to do so). <br /> <br /> The movie was a little cheap but not so bad for a b movie of the day. The plot was largely recycled, and there were a few things that weren't tied well. However, this movie is fun in its own way (I do not know why, perhaps because it is a Mexican horror movie and sticks out in my normal bad movie diet). I think it may be because it is a mix and mash of some very strange things. <br /> <br /> See if you like cheesy foreign films, nudity and female wrestlers.
