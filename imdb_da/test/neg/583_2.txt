OUR TIME got a chance on a feature film in his 22 year history, and that was the best thing to do? It's boring, forced and pointless, and I have to disagree with the other poster on this movie respectfully; 1994 LITTLE RASCALS remake was better than this. Almost everything is. The children are subject to the civil war; It doesn't feel like a VOR GANG movie at all, but as a humorous, second-rate Shirley Temple clone.
