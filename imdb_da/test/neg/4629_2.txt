Gender is a most remarkable aspect of existence. It is perhaps the most interesting activity between birth and death. LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN studies human sexuality in a dry and boring way. In fact, worse than being simply boring, seeing 40-year-old naked, it is uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I think there is some shock value by having adults as old as our parents talk about sex, but after twenty minutes it stops being interesting. Perhaps if the characters were all 20 years younger, the film would be more visually captivating. <br /> <br /> LE DECLIN DE L'EMPIRE AMERICAIN is not worth it.
