When I went to watch this movie, let's not say I had high expectations. But just that I had a slight hope that this full length feature would have at least some of the hilarity and doubt on the TV's "Da Ali G Show". <br /> <br /> But as you might expect, this can't be translated from a half hour TV show to a 90 minute movie. The film had no appeal whats ever, and went exclusively to the toilet and juvenile sexual humor. Basicaly, I should have killed it halfway through, but was silly enough to think that it could somehow improve at the end, how wrong I was. I loved the show but hated the movie. This movie is only for those who find fellatio by the dog entertainment entertaining ...
