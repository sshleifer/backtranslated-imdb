No, it's sick. It's not sick. It made me throw away because I spent 2 dollars on it. It's boring, retarded and annoying. I didn't see the MST3K version, which sucks because I bet the MST3K version was fun. It is sad that people are wasting money on these kinds of movies. I'm not surprised at the "100 worst movie of all time". <br /> <br /> TromaDude's Rating-0 outta ***** stars
