Larry Bishop, the author / actor / director, focuses too strongly on the camera, music and visuals. The film is about meaningless rambling and vulgar monologues, which apparently have no purpose other than boring and annoying audiences. The actors experience a bumpy ride from the start of the movie to the end and are trapped in a horrible smoke screen. The fuck with the trip. The movie is a bomb. The victors are presented as weathered vigilantes, seeking their own form of justice for what they see as lawlessness. They are cyclists, anti-heroes and protagonists. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is the avid leader of the package. Ghent (Michael Madsen) is trapped in his own crossing of chaos and psychosis. <br /> <br /> Comanche (Eric Balfour) is loyal but mysterious. Deuce, done by David Carradine, should have passed on the trip and then ticket buyers (if you decide to watch the movie, you will be sorry but you will find out why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is a widespread and poisonous character, completely filled with contempt. What puzzles am I, how this movie, with all its ongoing ramblings and vulgarity, ever made anyone invest in a ride that definitely goes nowhere. Ticket buyers, take my advice: don't pay for the trip. Please make the same mistake as the investors. <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes, or so, of the movie, is confusing and incomprehensible. The dialogue, which quickly becomes meaningless monologues, makes no sense. The whole movie is hell bent on going nowhere. Bad Dennis Hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess. He should also have passed the trip. There are decapitated heads, slashed necks and naked female breasts. Obviously, the bishop doesn't know where he goes with the movie. He is completely lost. But at the end of the trip you just won't give yourself a shame. Mama Mia! Stay home. And at least not take the trip. I rate this movie a 1 out of 10, but this movie is so horrible that it deserves a zero.
