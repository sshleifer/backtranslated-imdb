This is the most inaccurate and shameful biblical film I have ever seen the accident. I want to know why anyone on earth could enjoy seeing this. I am so surprised that a big name like Jon Voight would agree to trade in this disgusting piece of waste. Many people who may not have read the Bible will now mislead by believing that this movie was correct and the thought of it really bothering me. I think the decision makers have a lot to answer. The worst thing is that I think no one could make such blatant mistakes in a biblical film as they can examine the Bible for the truth, so I think the decision makers deliberately twisted what the Bible says and that is something no one right to do and I find it very offensive. There are no words strong enough to describe exactly how I feel about this.
