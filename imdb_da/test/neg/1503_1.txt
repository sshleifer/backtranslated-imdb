I love low budget movies. Including those who intentionally or not consciously are fun, excess false doings, violence, etc. However, this is beyond stupid. When you see the end, you will say what the hell was the point of all killing scenes with no one around (except in a couple) to witness them. And how did the end actually come to the whole story away for the stupid enough to actually see this? Granny is like a mental Jason. First she is outside the window with a body and 15 seconds later she is knitting in the living room. It's all a setup for a newcomer. They pull out of graphical clay scenes, the knitting needles in the eyes, which only Chris Angel Mind Freak could pull off. And again, in the end was pre-posterous. 56 my waste of time. I have seen one of the directors other films and it was almost as bad. Give me 20 grand and I could do better. This really deserves a great fat.
