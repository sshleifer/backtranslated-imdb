This movie was horrible, not only was the plot weak, but the play was incredibly bad, and sometimes pathetic. Very unrealistic dialogues people in real life do not speak like this, and there is no emotion or emotion in any said much monotone except for the almost indisputable whisper that constantly arises. Even editing is poor, the cuts are terrible. The camera's work was sloppy and shaken on close-ups, even swimming back and forth during conversations. There's nothing positive about this movie, and George Katts has to work on heavy machinery or something he doesn't need to talk to other people because he clearly doesn't know how. How to win this movie / get nominated for awards Oh my god !!
