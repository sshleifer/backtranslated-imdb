2001 is one of those films where, if you do not like it, you are told that you do not 'get it' and look at the deeper meaning and symbolism. You are told that you clearly have a slow attention span and you just want to see sex, explosions and get the plot delivered to you on a plate. Let's break down the film do we need? Three minutes of sadness, with something that sounds like a dying hippo in the background. Then we get the opening credits. One minute of fascinating shots from Savannah. Then a lot of monkeys find a black stone and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the "Blue Danube" is playing in the background. A bunch of pointless dialogue and a group of lunar scientists find another monolith. Cut for a spaceship that is too far for the crew complement - three sleeping persons, two people named Dave and Frank, who have little more personality than the founders in sleep. And then there is HAL, the "perfect" supercomputer that runs the ship. Predictably, he snaps and begins to break the first law of robotics. Now it's something that has potential. An evil, cold reckless superhero that controls the surrounding environment and can predict all your moves. And what does he do? He lets a guy float into the room and switches off the sleepers so that the three sleeping guys die, so Dave floats in a pod. He simply uses airlock, puts in a gap and turns HAL away - agonizing slowly. Then there seems to be some psychedelic 'evolution' in Jupiter. <br /> <br /> Here's the movie with the breaks taken out: Apes sees monolith, kills things. Scientists find moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave gets a pre-registered message and develops at Jupiter. <br /> <br /> It's not me who doesn't. 'This is me bored to tears of long stretches of absolutely nothing. Sure, it's realistic, but I find that I have no reason to care. No matter the message, no movie can be good without being entertaining. Frankly, each character could be replaced with Keanu Reeves, and nothing would change.
