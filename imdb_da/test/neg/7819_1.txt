Ever wanted to see how low a movie could sink? Well, look no further! This movie has it all! <br /> <br /> Racism jokes, disabled jokes, overweight jokes, suicide jokes, murder jokes, drug jokes, expensive abuse jokes, eating dirt jokes, old man young wife jokes, cancer jokes, gay jokes, crap jokes, falling flat on one's face again and again jokes, overuse of blood jokes, rape jokes, pee jokes, alcohol abuse jokes, anal rash jokes, a bunch of people yacking their coffee back up jokes, nudity jokes, see who can say the most swear words in a scene jokes, lesbian jokes, game abuse jokes, and the list goes on and on people! The worst part is: none of it is fun! (Not that anyone would find most of the fun to begin with.) It seems that when it just can't get the worst, it pushes your expectations to a whole new base as it always seems to find another to make the viewer feel worse. There was a scene that had me almost throw up and almost completely depressed at the same time. I don't think I should point out which, but then I'm sure there are other scenes that will give people the same feeling. <br /> <br /> There was a moment at the end of movies that were actually sensible and a little realistic, as one of the characters in the scene was suddenly stacked with the nastiest remnants of a bin and threw several feet on ground only to get a bunch of beer bottles smashed in the head. All this enough when he at least deserved it. So everyone thought of a 1 point redemption was quickly considered. This is actually a horrible movie. This is one that must be studied and bisected in small parts at a film school to teach students what not to do.
