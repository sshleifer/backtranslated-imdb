I'd bet on a month's pay "The Magnificent Seven Returns" (MSR) was made for television. Other reviewers testify that MSR was a theatrical movie and I take their word for it. The logical answer must assume that it was originally shot at television, and after a studio heart it was released theater-wise instead. Each actor is primarily a television actor: Mariette Hartley, Michael Callen, Ralfe Waite, Stephanie Powers ... television artists all. Lee Van Cleef split his time between television and theater screens. Stephanie Powers has only made 3 or 4 "real" movie appearances in the last thirty years of a very nice television career - correctly positive, this was shot at television. Smaller players are veteran little actors that can be seen on old reruns of "Gunsmoke", "Wild Wild West", "Streets of San Francisco", etc. are identical to the Universal Studios Tour sets, often seen in old episodic television. And editing confuses the television one or two speed of TV with limited camera movement, positioning, cutting and lighting. The soundtrack, exclusive of the original Berstein themes, is from the 70s. Yes, I would bet money, it was shot to TV. It is an important point in the evaluation of MSR. Originally I looked at the MSR on cable if it was an old theater release. Compared to the original "Magnificent Seven" it is a joke, a comic book, an amateur movie-making attempt. Action, lighting, writing, settings, action, filmography, music (except for the Berstein themes), editing, pacing, ... on and on .... all pale compared to the classic "Magnificent Seven" that is close at perfect 60's western, and one of the great action movies from time to time. <br /> <br /> However, as an early 70s television movie I suppose, the movie is actually better than average. Those unlucky enough to live through the 70s as an adult know what I'm talking about. MSR would have competed against "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" and similar intense network shows. During the seventies, "Gunsmoke" was a quality program that focused on character development rather than action, thereforephasizing gun play to two shootouts per week. The first shoot, usually a murder, sets the hour's plot in motion - the second shootout climaxes the episode by killing the guest star, his nemesis, or otherwise resolving the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon. MSR has more action than an entire season of "Gunsmoke." In the light of this - MSR is in this context a useful entertainment, a cut above the TV ticket price from the decade.
