This is a spin off of Pulp Fiction. I thought it would be good for a couple of decent laughs. Now it turns out that this movie was really horrible. The entire plot does not follow the Pulp Fiction plot. It turns to other movies like Forrest Gump and more. Some laughs came out of this movie, but all of it took 90 minutes of my life away from me. If you are thinking of renting this movie, don't forget it 90 minutes in your life. Consider renting this and continue and find a movie that actually makes sense. Please if there is a Plump Fiction 2, I will definitely not continue and rent the sequel. Just give a heads up for them out there.
