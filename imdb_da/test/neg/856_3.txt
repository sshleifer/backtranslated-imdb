Okay, now I'm pretty sure my summary got your attention and I commented that Zazu Pitts isn't Satan for no reason. Let me explain. The film initially appears to be a dandy B movie about a vicious organization called "The Crooked Circle" and their lifting laws in the form of murder of a rival organization dedicated to solving crimes. Though this is very strange (especially the idea of ​​a club of private citizens solving crimes) and could have been interesting, this film falls apart despite a rather impressive list of well-known support actors. Why? Well because Zazu Pitts (never one of my favorite actresses) spends most of the movie slipping like Olive Oyl with a bad toothache !! While murder is committed, people are kidnapped, or whatever, you can always count on Zazu whining fully - almost like a person's unpleasant 3 year old who wants everyone at a party to pay attention to her! At the same time she is NOT an integral part of the movie, but received top billing. Why she's even beyond me - I suppose it's just gnawing and shouting. As a result, I found the movie virtually unmatched, and it was completely destroyed. Now you probably know why I referred to this actress of questionable talent as "Satan"! I am sure that as the actors in this movie saw the end product, they felt almost the same as I did about her horrible overactive and amateur-effective performance. <br /> <br /> This movie is public domain and can be found for free download on the internet. I can see why.
