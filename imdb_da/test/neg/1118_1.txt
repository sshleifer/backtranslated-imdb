I am speechless. Matty Simmons has managed to do something I thought impossible. He made "The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island" look like "Citizen Kane." Painful can't even begin to describe this piece ... I don't know. Remember that the premise was fun, but now that I've seen it, it's fun that it's fun to drop an anvil on your scrap. I don't want to bother to describe the premise, as the title says it all, if you just say that I don't think there was literally a funny thing in this movie, not one, not even the monkey. How could one of the funniest characters in the "Vacation" franchise, the crazy white trash bin Eddie (Randy Quaid) be made so horrific unfunny? I have never felt so much sympathy for an actor in my life. I also pitied the other actors participating in this "comedic" cruelty, Miriam Flynn (Catherine, Eddie's long suffering, but sunny wife), Dana Barron (the original Audrey Griswold), Fred Willard and the amazing Sung Hi Lee The only one reason to watch the movie, only with the sound from), save the old Commie, Ed Asner (Uncle Nick), he had come. Alas, the audience didn't. I'm just saying "ceiling sky" that Chevy Chase, who has been in a decline for years, crashed this diarrhea splatter, it's the smartest career movement he has ever made. <br /> <br /> I don't know if you are religious as I am, but I know I will pray to the Lord tonight to add 2 hours (if not 2 years) to my life to make up for The time I spent in front of the television, which I will never come back otherwise. Hot Water Burn Baby says ZERO out of 10 stars (If you take a few hits out of bong and drink the water, maybe 1/10 of a star out of 10)
