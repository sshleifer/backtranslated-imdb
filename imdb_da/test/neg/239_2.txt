Oh, man, they probably knew how to make them again then. Hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients in poor filmmaking: cardboard steel and the god fearing scientist action altogether! <br /> <br /> This movie was so close to a masterpiece, unfortunately it was not, as it failed to have ray guns and invaders from the moon. The MST3K version tried to solve this by adding a pilot of a show called Captain Cody, where a guy with a rocket-driven jacket fights bad make-up people from the moon, but it didn't fully fill up. <br /> <br /> Like in theatrical comments was not as fun as I expected to be. All in all, a big disappointment.
