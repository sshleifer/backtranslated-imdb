This movie was nothing like the book. <br /> <br /> Everything was mixed or changed. Most of the film was something that wasn't even in the book. <br /> <br /> This movie should never have been seen. It was a big disappointment to me when I enjoyed the book so much and then to see how this movie trashed the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I would never recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Nora Roberts or JD Robb. Honestly, this movie is not worth watching with how far away from the book is.
