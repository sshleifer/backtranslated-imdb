Sorry I could not disagree more with the last comments. frankly I thought it was worse than Carry on Columbus, said enough. Last movie for the normally brilliant Charles Hartrey, who looked out of place when humor had moved on to the very twisted level of the buses, of which the films were made at the same time, was honestly more fun. Barbara Windsor was embarrassing, a character like one of your mum's flirtatious friends, who still thinks she's eighteen, on holiday with some non-unit of a Scottish, Rab C Nesbit, he's not. The series miraculously trundled on with duffers like Carry on the Bag and carrying on England. Continue Dick wasn't bad, but in fact with this movie was the end of the series nigh, a shame because up to this movie I can't think of bad movie before this?
