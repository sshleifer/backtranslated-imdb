While the prominent and overused use of the game-like format is in all operation throughout the movie, it is not this that lets this image fall down. Rather, it is the convincing female performances and rather boring writings that the film obviously relied on a little too much. With an idea that had potential, the simple plot is still diminished by Graham's lack of truly expressing the destruction of her character so it claims to experience tremendous experience. The use of improvised scenes by all actors would not be such a bad idea if only the two leading ladies could take advantage of this privilege. As Downey Jr shows as usual what a gifted actor he is, he shadows the two actresses in their scenes that can be constantly seen. The meaningless but intense sex scene seems to exist only to prevent the movie from becoming too verbally expressive, giving the actors a very deserving break from speaking. With an unsatisfactory conclusion, two girls and one guy have little to recommend other than Downey Jr's formidable if not out of place performance.
