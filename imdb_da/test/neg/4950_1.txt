I don't know why this has received any decent reviews, as it could be the weakest horror comedy I've ever seen. Englund is right in it for a cameo, and his performance is as unnecessary as most of the lame attempts at jokes (and scares). The direction is horrible, and the play is worse. It seems that every year, manufacturers are trying to make another evil death, but these weak non-original trials are just reminiscent of a real horror classic. <br /> <br /> Whether its filmmakers say, "this is not a remake but it's an 80's throwback (which is as unoriginal in my opinion - Hatchet) or people trying to join this with other horror classics, it is still misleading and usually makes up for the lack of scare, horror, comedy or even a decent movie for that matter. <br /> <br /> AVOID ALL COSTS !!!
