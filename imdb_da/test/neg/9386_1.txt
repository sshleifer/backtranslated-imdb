This show is terrible. I can't get over the complete waste of great talent this show contains. This is not entertaining improvisation, it is just a cheap attempt to throw any famous comic actors at a stage and make them perform a poorly improved scene. I actually did improvisation as an actor, and this show is not improvisation. <br /> <br /> What the audience actually laughs at (if they actually laugh at this show, it seems to be pretty fake) is the embarrassment of the guest star lost as a deer in the headlights. The stupid, completely independent stuff they come up with is what people laugh at. And if it's not part of the scene, the actors will tell them it's wrong! I find that this show is a disgrace to art and makes me cry for shows like Whose Line it is, nevertheless, who had great talent, amazing improvisation games and on top of everything else did not make me change the channel.
