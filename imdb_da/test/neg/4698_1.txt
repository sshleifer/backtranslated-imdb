I liked Half-Life. I'm still the fan. It was scary, intelligent and challenging. I'm not telling any news, it's a best FPS ever made. Maybe I'm for the hardcore Half-Life fan, but the so-called Half-Life 2 is not Half-Life 2. <br /> And I have a question: is the next chapter in Half-Life? Maybe the creators -Volve-mean it, but I don't. Where are the intelligent enemies? Where's the scary atmosphere? Nowhere. I think they wanted to do a little different Half-Life (instead of another research station story), but they didn't just do another thing, they did something about Half-Life like Quake does to Doom. The whole game is so ugly and unreal that it is almost abandoned. <br /> <br /> Although physics is really big and there were a few good levels to play, the idea of ​​making a revolutionary physically driven game has failed. When you get Gravity-gun that can move objects, you can expect with rights to use it as a weapon - that would make the schematic FPS gameplay upside down. The truth is, you can't use the Gravity gun as a real weapon. Why? Because the best thing you can do is throw boxes and barrels that don't do much damage. If you want to keep an object in front of you to protect it, it may fall from approx. 3 shots. If you want to throw an exploding barrel to your enemy, it can explode into your own "hand". Gravity doesn't work like a weapon. The best use is to solve some physical puzzles. I ask Valve: Why? The truth is, you must use your boring, schematic FPS weapons at the end (except the last level). Weapons aren't what created the original half-life of a classic. If the Gravity gun would always be like the last level - a real weapon - I would admire what Valve did. But not this. This is disappointing. <br /> <br /> So if you want Half-Life then you're looking for the wrong place. Maybe you will enjoy it, but I repeat: It's all but not Half-Life and not even a faithful continuation of it. This is the biggest disappointment of all times. Valve has shown that they can also make terrible games. They have managed it.
