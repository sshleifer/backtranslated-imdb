Wow. They told me it was bad, but I didn't know. <br /> <br /> We have started a tradition. We found a copy of this movie and we just send it from person to person. The one who has the movie looks at it and passes it on to another who is considered worth seeing this unique, creative, horrible movie. Hopefully it will travel 'around the world a couple of times. <br /> <br /> It's painful. Really painful. It's even more than that bad, it's fun. Well, okay, sometimes it's so bad it's fun. But most of it just gives you the feeling that there is something that sucks in your brain from the inside. <br /> <br /> Wow. See it and send it on.
