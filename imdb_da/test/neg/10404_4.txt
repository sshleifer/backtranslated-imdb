This rarely sweet and work-stimulated 5-reel is certainly not among Harold Lloyd's better films. Gags are sparse and mostly uninspired. Saccharine melodrama is plentiful. The lineup takes forever, like Lloyd, the unconventional but impossible-friendly country doctor to make his rounds and bring in some sunshine into children, the elderly and the puppies. It's like a 1922 version of Patch Adams. Ugh. 10.4.
