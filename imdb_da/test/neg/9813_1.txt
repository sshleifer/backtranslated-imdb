Anyone who knows anything about evolution would not even have to watch the movie say "false". "It has never been contested" is also a weak argument. Saying the universe was created by a giant hippo cannot be disproved. Although it seems to be fair, the only people who believe are the same people who open email attachments from people they don't know or give their bank details to a guy in Zambia. No bones of any primates have been found in the United States or Canada. There is also a good reason why legitimate researchers do not like to study this. The same argument applies to the Loch Ness monster, ghosts and god.
