While trying to build a larger mall or complex or the like, a wealthy country estate ignores old ancient artifacts that are buried on the ground and frees the leg bone ... a creature that walks around killing people in search of his fallen friends or something. <br /> <br /> In fact, this movie had to be a Sci-Fi Channel original. If that were not the case, the director should never rectify anything. The effects in the movie are at best ridiculous and the Bone Eater monster is nothing but a CGI animated added to the frames at a later date. The actors don't even see anyone scared when they see the case (probably because they really don't, and they're just horrible actors). It's a great comedy, even though it should be pure scare.
