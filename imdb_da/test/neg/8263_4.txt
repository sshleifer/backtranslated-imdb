I agree with most critics above. More so, I was shocked at the presentation of love scenes with the gay couple. Why? because they - the director, the producers - had no compulsion to present the various heterosexual couples in the most passionate embraces, including nudity and super close-ups of French kisses and all sorts of disturbances in the bed, unnecessarily in their length and in history, The moment came to show the same experiences with the gay couple, they dare only go as far as an eerily painful hug, almost among scientific giggles, with two very nervous actors. So in reality, the film's decision makers found homosexuality to be UNNATURAL, as one of the characters says in a scene. What a difference with the Spanish cinema !! I remember being projecting an Almodovar movie in an Italian cinema in Rome, and I'm totally amazed at the total lack of response from the Italian audience, they were afraid to get a response !! When in Spain people fall from their seats laughing at all the risqu√® situations and fabulous almodovar wit and flair. Of course in Italy there are dark forces in its history that prevent the free manifestation of some very normal and natural feelings. Pity. I must add that I was quite surprised to find that the same comment was censored by another correspondent. It is very bad and dangerous when we cannot be allowed by others to express our opinions on specific matters. Where is freedom of speech? I do not know if that censor will approve the changes I was forced to make in this comment and I hope he will not receive the same treatment from another narcotic judge. Too bad again.
