An error in space sends astronaut Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) of course and leads to something of a parallel world called Terra, which circles the sun just opposite the earth. As a weather from space would pose a threat to the order of this world, Stryker is held until it can be determined what to do with him. However, Stryker becomes suspicious of his surroundings and escapes. With the help of a sympathetic nurse and an old scientist who opposes the government, Stryker will attempt to board a spaceship and return to Earth. <br /> <br /> Stranded in space (or the stranger, if you prefer) is another of the 70's made for television movies to be transformed into a regular, weekly show. In this case, it is easy to see why it did not. First there is nothing new about the show's layout. It was undoubtedly designed to follow the same formula used by The Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or the Apes Planet. You know that a stranger is constantly on the move, going from one city to another, taking the odd job he can constantly pursue by a state agency or newspaper reporter. It is a formula that has been made to death. The second strike against Stranded in Space is its leader, Glenn Corbett. Could this guy come across something less sympathetic? I rowed for him to get caught. Without sympathy for the protagonist, this kind of show would never work. Finally, this must be science fiction. Just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three fake-looking moons on the horizon, should I jump to the conclusion that this is a distant planet? So it's just a coincidence that they all speak English, dress like humans on Earth and run Plymouth Furies? Yes right. <br /> <br /> The lonely highlight for me was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast. Of course, it's hard to see him in anything so terrible, but you know the old adage - someone Cameron is better than no Cameron (yes, I've never heard it either). As with much of these 70's television films, I saw Stranded in Space Sincerely Mystery Science Theater 3000. I wouldn't call it a fantastic episode of any fantasy, but there are some good jokes along the way. So at last, while considering the movie a 2/10, it gets a 3/5 on my MST3K rating scale.
