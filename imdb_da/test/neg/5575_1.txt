This has to be the VERY movement I have ever seen !!!!! It wasn't just boring, it was "gag me with a spoon" stupid. Where did you find the actors ... on a street corner? Who made the special effects ... Maaco? For God's sake, I could have made a better movie with my CELL PHONE. And if it wasn't bad, you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see just as stupid the actors are. Who ever made makeup for foreigners ... must have spent $ 5 at your local used costume store and called it one day. And who in the world wrote, the film must be described on the back of the DVD case. PUHLEEZ !! It is not even 1/8% of what is described as. This description is just to suck people in to buy, rent or pay a ticket to see it. No wonder there was never a trailer for it .... you would have driven them all away !!!!!!! <br /> <br /> Bad Actors ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... $ 5.50 Fake Fire .... $ 1.89 (cigarette lighter) <br /> <br /> Time spent Watching This Movie .... collected waste! (I had to sue you for my time to see it)
