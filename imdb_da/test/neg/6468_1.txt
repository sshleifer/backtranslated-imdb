I'm really lost how to give this movie a 10 (or even more than a 2!). It is full of bad lines, bad plays, bad slapsticks, etc. I never thought I could see worse acting than the targeted bad-acting scenes at the beginning of the UHF, but that was it. And just when you think it can't get any worse, it does! Over and over again! You could actually have seen this in a theater? It was not worth being free on TV! My 4 year old and 1 year old liked it a little, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on.
