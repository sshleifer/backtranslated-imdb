The most available movie in the history of the cinema? This one is a strong contender! Why waste so much money for such meaningless, useless work? The only difference between HItchcock classic and this bad imitation is color, wide screen and Leila's Walkman !! A movie that should generate excitement and fear leaves me completely indifferent. <br /> <br /> No, you want to tell I would urge the young generations to see the original balderdash! This "psycho 1998" is a huge spoiler. They could have done something else, for example by casting an actor closer to Bloch's Bates, an overweight man. They stick with an unpleasant rehash! A pox on it! And long live Alfred Hitchcock!
