... And that's a shame! Let the sun rise and burn all copies of Dracula 3000. This should be the WORST Vampire flick of the new millennium until now (I haven't seen REIGN IN DARKNESS yet, but they won't get any worse than this). Don't be fooled by the movie's cool H.R. Gigeresque cover. It's so bad, it's almost fun. I cannot describe all the feelings this movie believed. I laughed my ass out, I shouted on the screen, I sat there numb, nodded my head in disbelief ... This movie has 'cheap & cheese' written over it. The best thing about this movie is the opening credits and opening shots, which are more or less in order of CGI of two spaceships. But when Casper Van Diens voice-over comes on, you start to smell some fishing. And actually it goes all the time downhill quickly. <br /> <br /> The crew of a salvage spaceship finds a abandoned vessel, Demeter, which seems to be on its way to Earth. They enter it and thus seal their fate. This film is above all a shameless budget ALIEN-rip-off, mixed with vampires. Just down to the plot-twist, Erika Eleniak's character, Aurora, revealed that she is a robot. Coolio badly goes over-the-top like dope-smoking, bloodsucking 187 (pffff, code from the hood as a name?!?!). Casper Van Diens character is named Capt. Van Helsing (hahaha!), And he looks like ... that's good, Casper Van Dien. Udo Kier as Capt. Varna, the former Commander of Demeter, appears only on a screen, and he really seems to have difficulty reading his lines from an auto-cue (bad Udo, what should you do in this flick?). And then we have Langley Kirkwood who counts Orlock, one of the most pathetic and ridiculous Dracula's ever to (now) grace the silver screen. Just look at his outfit. Instead of some cool-looking futuristic black suit or something, he has a cheap old-fashioned Halloween costume with fringe. You thought Richard Roxburgh was not convincing as Dracula in VAN HELSING? So wait until you see Langley's performance! <br /> <br /> The set designers went overboard on this. The inside of Demeter looks like a cross between an oil tanker and an old steel factory, which they decorated with terrible light and colors like green, pink, blue and yellow. Prop master must have forgotten that this movie takes place in the year 3000, because the characters use weapons similar to today's 45th Magnums and "Prof" uses a non-motorized, non-floating wheelchair. It has to be pushed around to move. <br /> <br /> Apart from a dried corpse, there are few impalements and a dismemberment that absolutely no one does. And vampire fangs and contact lenses look fake like hell. In addition, the most paralyzed, stupid and sudden end: Humvee and Aurora are the only survivors. Instead of having a final (bloody) showdown with count Orlock, they are locked in the control room. Then Aurora explains that before she was upgraded and participated in drugs, she used to be a "Protheus 3.2 PB", in other words: a pleasure-bot. So she says "Well then what are you waiting for". Humvee answers "Don't tell me twice. Come on, girl", picks her up and ... "BOOOOOOM !!!" the ship explodes and credits rolls. No sex scene, no Erika flashin's boobies, no bloody climax, ... Just a shot of Udo Kier reads a line on the screen and it's over. <br /> <br /> But this movie is a must-see for any bad movie lover, but I have to warn them: It sometimes gets very painful. And everybody claims that VAN HELSING, UNDERWORLD or even QUEEN OF THE DAMNED is the worst vampire movie in the new millennium, is definitely crazy, or hasn't seen Dracula 3000 yet.
