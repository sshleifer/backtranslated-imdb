I have always found dilettant Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious, and I have never understood why his work attracts so much attention. Apart from his Rayographs (which he accidentally invented and which is only photocopies with direct contact), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to portray female nudity in a way that was accepted as art rather than as porn. But it certainly had to happen in the end, and there is no real reason why Ray deserves the credit. The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story of emperor's new clothes. <br /> <br /> "L'Ã‰toile de merde" ... whoops, "the more" ... have a lot of blurry photography and a recurring visual theme for a starfish that is never explained. Starfisher has the fascinating ability to regenerate lost limbs - and even regenerate whole duplicates - but if it has anything to do with the movie's theme, Ray neglects to say so. I was much more impressed with the movie's title card, which in French may contain rhymes, a saying ('Si belle, Cybele') and some portmanteaux. Like so often in Ray's work, there is actually a beautiful young woman seen in this movie. Unfortunately, the photography (largely) is so blurred that we have little opportunity to appreciate her. I rate this root a point out of 10.
