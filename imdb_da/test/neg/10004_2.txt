A funny thing has happened to me while you look at "Mosquito": On the one hand, the hero is a deaf-mute, and the director is completely incapable of making us understand why he does what he does (mutilation. .. excuse me, corpse through his pictures. On the other hand, the English version is at least very badly baptized. So I thought there had been more and less dialogue at the same time! This movie is stupid (fun, how this guy has access to every cemetery and house in his town) and lurid (where would we be in the 70s exploitation without our free lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how sweet!) ... miss it. (*)
