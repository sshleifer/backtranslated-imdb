Oh man, where do you even begin ... <br /> <br /> release your gun to get in hand to fight with a zombie while holding a bitten soldier down and discussing to shoot him b4 he turning and biting the person holding him down, turns his back on a "fallen" zombie, continues to shoot the chest and sees it does not work, so they shoot the chest more and have the idea that a child randomly at a desk with blood coming out of the mouth, it is still okay to walk along a football field, which is nothing wrong, so suddenly notice the zombie football team, whatever in the middle of the court, as if they could not have been looked up to the point .... <br /> <br /> I could go a few hours, but you get points ..... childish writing and dialogue, poor management, horrible special effects, really sad and undeveloped history ( zombie infested campus, must get the viral host so lose it .... twice), the only plus I can find is, that it does not contain clips of the current game you call "action scenes" .... id does not waste your money but id be more concerned about waste of time, i saw it on cable and wanted the 2 hours of my life back
