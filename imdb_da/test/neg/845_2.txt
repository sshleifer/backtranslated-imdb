In 4 words, Captain Corellis Mandolin was "completely out of tune" with the book. The novel gave sufficient background to understanding the relationship and personal challenges of the characters needed to overcome; The scriptwriter chose to ignore the details. By ignoring them (eg, the priest's role in the beginning as a puffer, but later as a spiritual leader, the fianc√©'s inability to read until taught by a socialist rebel, advises the bombers to Corelli and his possible ironic death), the story and the characters fall flat. <br /> <br /> This was the first movie I've ever gone through midway through. Interesting filmography, great actors do not make a movie; The story does.
