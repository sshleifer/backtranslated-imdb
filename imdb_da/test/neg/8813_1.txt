This was the most unrealistic movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> I can't believe the author and the director didn't see almost the whole movie resembling an SF. <br /> <br /> For example: <br /> <br /> 1. It is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so fast. <br /> <br /> 2. You cannot get electrolysed through a water pipe as in the film. (Believe me, it's my domain) <br /> <br /> 3. With a saw you can cut 10 tubes in 10 hours very easily. Let's say the chain was made of steel, but the water pipe was quiet and it was made of iron. <br /> <br /> 4. If you are trying to cut your foot with a saw, you must be weak (at best, it is more likely to die because your heart fails) before you get to the bone. other examples.
