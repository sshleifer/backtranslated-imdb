My wife and I watched this movie because we are planning to visit Sicily and Stromboli soon. Fortunately (or unfortunately) the landscape and seascape (complete with tuna) are the only credible members of this cast. We expected a reasonably well-written and well-behaved movie, but were disappointed. Its only redeeming grace is an extended and remarkable fishing sequence full of authenticity: thrashing tuna, nets, long-haired wooden boats and passionate if superstitious fishermen. <br /> <br /> The sequencing of the film is stagy, its dialogue stank, and the play ranges from rigid to completely over-the-top. A scene where Bergman emphasizes as his macho, native and naive man, calls his fruit on an "innocent" (but apparently already deceased) rabbit would be the perfect grin to a Monty Python rubbish. <br /> <br /> When the volcano blew we hoped for a merciful end to the suffering (ours and the castes). Unfortunately, the film continues to scare, eventually to a melodramatic and absurd ending. Unless you're really into old-fashioned tuna fishing, you'll have to post this hokey bet.
