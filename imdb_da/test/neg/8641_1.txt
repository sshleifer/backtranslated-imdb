This movie is absolutely garbage and continues to get even worse against the very long end! <br /> <br /> The reason is confused and the work, the actors have one who could not care less (maybe they were paid in advance - bad movement or knew they would not be paid), and sets were mind-boggling, boring and cheap. I fell asleep twice and actually decided not to disturb the last 5 minutes when I assumed that the actors would have fallen asleep even then. More irreversible lifetime wasted! <br /> <br /> If you want to see it, take it to the bedroom and forget about the sleeping pills once. But maybe you need an antidepressant instead! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it is good if celluloid breaks down.
