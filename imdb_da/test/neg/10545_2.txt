The first toxie film was dark, gory and hillarious. This movie is un-gory fighting for cheezy jazz music, no real gore at all, and the worst toxie mask I've ever seen! His deep voice is now a bright, happy voice, characters from Part 1 are again shown by actors who see nothing like them (Claire, Mom Junko), character names change (Claire or Sara?). It lacks all the brutal violence, dark humor and political inaccuracy in the first film. If it wasn't for nudity, this movie could have been rated PG. Really lamb. I'm a huge fan of part 1 myself, just can't stand this.
