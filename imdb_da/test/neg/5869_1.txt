Having read other reviews on this site, we were not sure if we could criticize this movie because it doesn't sound bad enough. But 2 minutes in the movie we knew we were in another flop. No summer is finished without ice, but this film served a melted, sour, cracked ice cone (you know the kind that leaves you sticky and dirty and looking for a wet lump). The biggest problem with this movie was the plot. What was it? It seemed to be a psychotic man driving around the neighborhood. That is it. Nothing else happens. First and foremost, what are the qualifications to become an iceman in this crapby? 1. Spend several years in the most ridiculous mental hospital known to man. This hospital was plagued with clowns, graffiti, fake plastic sunflowers and oversized syringes for the head. 2. Has extremely poor hygiene and a mutant face to scare the kids away. 3. Make sure your truck is full of cut body parts, cockroaches, and don't forget your eyes! <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie are pure B-Movie caliber. Mingled with a bunch of unknown is who else ... a trailer-trash version of Macaulay Culkin !! Even his sharp charm couldn't save this kick in his pants. There didn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for any of the murders in this movie. The whole concept of the movie reeked! Who would kill an iceberg in a shooting shoot? Gangsters? Devil? Vanna White? Who? We are still struggling with this issue. <br /> <br /> The person responsible for the wardrobe of this movie should immediately be blacklisted from Hollywood. Did they honestly think that a pillow under a children's shirt would make the audience think he was really fat? Forgotten the weapons, face, legs and all other body parts? Secondly, this movie was made in 1995, but the wardrobe appeared to be picked up from a lame 80's movie, which appeared on the big brother's white, scrapy, high-water pants. <br /> <br /> While we were seeing this shotty production, we both developed serious cases of ADD. We found ourselves leaving the room to walk around aimlessly. On many points that movie we found, staring at an empty wall behind the T.V. set was more entertaining than the actual movie. We were stunned that this movie didn't make it to the bottom 100. Afterwards, we took the tape out of the VCR and left it on the black top to melt like a sub-standard ice cone.
