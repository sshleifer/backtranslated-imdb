This is not a good movie at all. I can't believe that after 50 years, this movie is awarded the National Award when there have been such gemstones from the Marathi cinema that have been systematically ignored. This is a very overstated movie that was very, very lucky. It was awarded the National Award, reaped the popular opinion and now will represent India before the international audience. Anyone with even a marginal understanding of good quality cinema will know very well that this will not even be nominated at the Oscars. <br /> <br /> I can't understand where to start. There are just so many things that are wrong and lacking in this movie that the amazing thing was even considered for the National Award. That this film is being awarded as the best movie to come out this year goes to show the biased assessment of people holding the reins to the Indian movie and the little understanding of the people who blindly appreciate this movie. <br /> <br /> The chosen topic is amazing. It is important that such films be made ?? but only by people who are able to handle them. Sandeep Sawant does not measure up to the task ?? not even close. His direction is jumped, confused. There is no clear thought process. He tries, but cannot examine the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. He is unable to show the original horror, anxiety and then hopeless emancipation and yet the insurmountable courage of grandfather. He is wasting our time in the hospital as we were supposed to show the time the couple are using together. He tries to get hold of everything without any priorities. He does not properly understand his subject and it counts right against him. <br /> <br /> But that's not the case with Sawant either. Worst job ?? Amruta Shubash. She is a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any sensible play. How did she get 'Tee Phulrani'? Extremely lucky and / or extremely influential and / or extremely pitiful casting. That said, she goes out of her way to do an equally horrible job in this movie. Her act of MSW should have been to the more responsible actor ?? Sonali Kulkarni. Amruta Subhash didn't understand it. MSW's work with constant emotional stress and yet it is important for them to project a quiet, strong exterior, as this is calming for the patients. Amruta Subhash's Asawari seems even more scared and needs support than the people she works for. <br /> <br /> Other worst ?? Arun Nalawade. I have never seen a more tree view in the Marathi movie industry (it's abundant and everywhere in today's Hindi cinema). He is the producer and then he chose himself; No other thought, no consideration. Any good actor would have jumped to play this role, even though he had to pay the producer to do so, but Arun Nalawade would not let anyone else do it. Over ambitious and stubborn, he contributes to bringing the movie more than everyone else. His plays lack research and even the basic acting skills. My choice for this role would be Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> The music is uninspired. The film is technically missing. It might well have been a FTII project job. <br /> <br /> On the top side; brilliant performance by Ashwin Chitale. It is amazing that such a young boy could provide such a respectable performance. He put many of today's actors to shame. Unintentionally perhaps, but he brought his own innocence to his character and that made it a memorable achievement. Sandeep Kulkarni also gave a very credible performance. Really put in all his efforts and it shows. Scripture is also well written. <br /> <br /> The 'shoestring budget' cannot be a valid argument for praising this movie. Lack of money dogs all the Marathi movies. Cricket and Hindi movies are spamming all the money, and the rest is left to fight for the scrap. It's a sorry state, yet not reason enough to praise an immature movie that comes out. 'Doghi' was brilliant film, and it was also made on a shoestring budget. 'Doghi' was also lacking technically, but it was well researched and well made. It was abundant in detail and backed by wonderful performances by all, and it made the real cinema. Why didn't it receive the recognition it deserved so much? ?? only proved my point with biased judgment. <br /> <br /> Lack of research and not of funds is what makes 'Shwaas' such a bad movie.
