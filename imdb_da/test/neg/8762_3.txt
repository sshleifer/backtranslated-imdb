There is not much to say about this, except that it is probably the worst of the zombie film's early slate (I have to see yet another, REVOLT OF THE ZOMBIES [1936] before the month is out). For the entire star John Carradine intends to build an army in the service of the Third Reich with them, they are not seen to do much at all! James Baskett (Uncle Remus from SONG OF THE SOUTH [1946]!) Plays their leader, who also serves as Carradine's servant. Black cartoon Mantan Moreland represents his "fraidy cat" driver role from KING OF THE ZOMBIES (1941), as well as the exotic name Madame Sul-Te-Wan as the Carradine housekeeper. Unfortunately for Carradine, his highest achievement ?? the zombification of his wife? brings him all sorts of problems: Not only does her relatives experience in his remote residence / lab to ask into her sudden death (meaning he must fall a funeral service!), but she actually turns disobedient and indignant, eventually "persuade "her fellow zombies getting up against their master !! Also involved is the cowboy star Bob Steele (still known for his piece in the Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP [1946]), who plays an American secret agent who constitutes a Nazi constituting a sheriff! Fortunately, director Sekely would have much better luck with his next genre, THE TRIPFIDS DAY (1962).
