This Harold Lloyd card was not very much; not one of his more fun efforts. Of course, I never see bratty kids as something fun. That's what the bulk of this story is, Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, babysitting their in-laws two young children. One is a baby who constantly cries, and the other is a four-year terror that does anything but demolition of the house. Letting the child chaos again and again was not entertaining for me. The best part was the last four or five minutes when the couple believe that this great goon (Noah Young) breaks into their house. Half of the time is the cat cat that scares the couple, but overall it is fun with some good synagogues that reminds me of another Lloyd card, "Haunted Spooks." <br /> <br /> But the good end doesn't save the whole picture, which I probably wouldn't see again. Lloyd has done too many other good things to waste another 25 minutes on this again. It's just not that fun.
