Out of all the movies I could have chosen, it had to be that way. When I was last in New York, I went into a Times Square store, and out of hundreds of DVDs, they had selected Joel M. Reeds Bloodsucking Freaks (1976) and this on a DVD DVD that also included Seeds of Sin (1968) did I oppress it? Read on to find out. The movie opens on an island (near Milligan's Staten Island home) where two lovers join a massive parasol apparently made of paper, at one point he gives her the top of a weed as a gift. Out of nowhere Colin (Hal Borske) a retarded hunchback arises and kills them both for no reason. After the opening credits associated with some of the worst headache inducing music I have ever heard, at least it got used to it as it is constantly used throughout the film, we are introduced to three couples. The wives are all sisters Vicky (Ann Linden) and Ricard (Fib LaBlaque), Veronica (Eileen Hayes) and Bill (Don Williams) plus Elizabeth (Carol Vogel) and Donald (Richard Ramos). They each receive a letter from a lawyer, H. Dobbs (Neil Flanagan) requesting a meeting to read the will of their deceased father. Dobbs informs them that they should spend three days in their childhood home 'Crenshaw House' and fill it with 'sexual harmony and marital love' which it had never known because of the strained relationship between their father and mother. He informs the couple that the will is very irregular, but legal. After three days, the legacy will be settled. The couples are also told about the waiters Martha (Veronica Radburn), Hattie (Maggie Rodgers) and the retarded Colin, who welcome the couple by killing and biting chunks out of a rabbit in front of them. Later that night, the dead rabbit is found in one of the pair of beds with a note that says "blessed are they soft, for they shall inherit." This starts a series of events ending in cruel murder and revealing dark family secrets. <br /> <br /> Captured, photographed and directed by the talented Andy Milligan. This is a completely horrible movie in every possible way. Let's go through just some of its mistakes. The music, it is terrible and headache inducing. Sound, you can hardly hear which characters are standing and some scenes have no sound effects, and on some points you can hear Milligan shouting orders to his actors, oh, and there is also a constant lift on the soundtrack throughout. The actor, probably among the worst I have ever witnessed. The very unusual effects that Colin even speaks in the opening sequence, that is the size of a tennis ball, the part where someone is tied down and has his stomach opened with a saw, looks really awful, like the various hands and legs, cut off. Photography, Milligan has absolutely no idea how to stage or film a scene, he regularly cuts the top, bottom or sides of the people's heads and faces out of the screen, and his camera shakes and shakes as it is driven by a person constantly stumbling across. There is also at least one scene so poorly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen. The movie is often so dark that you can't see what's happening. Editing, again some of the worst I've ever done, seems to cut scenes before they're done, cut away while characters stand in the middle of a sentence. The script, if there was one, credited both Milligan and Hal Sherwood (It took two people to write this!?) Is everywhere and is incredibly stupid. There is an incredibly bad sequence where the killer follows a victim down the cellar, the killer goes right behind him, at one point the potential victim turns around. What does the killer do to avoid being mocked? They feel right inside him, the killings close enough to give the man oral sex yet, he doesn't notice them right in front of him. You have to see this order to believe it, I still can't believe what I saw. Bizarre underground just happens and disappears completely, checks the scene when Richard borrows money from his brother Walter (producer and co-author Hal Sherwood) who turns out to be a gay priest who has had an incestuous relationship with his brother before he was married! A strange scene that is without any reason whatsoever. Martha's housekeepers respond to the first murder, she is more bothered by the fact that it's thrown out of her dinner schedule! Patty and Martha also discuss Colin, Patty says "if I just didn't beat him so hard," Martha responds sympathetically to "you must Patty, you must!" Delivered right across. And don't start me how ugly the wallpaper looks throughout the house! The only good thing I can think of is that the costumes look reasonable for the time it is supposed to be set in. I could probably go all day about how amusing it is, but I think You get the idea. One to avoid unless your a serious masochist! I don't regret buying or watching it for a second, though!
