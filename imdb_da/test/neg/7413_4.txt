A plane with a rich researcher's daughter goes down in thick wilderness. He gathers a group to go find her and the others, but the rescue party soon suspects that something stalks them. Thereafter, ulterior motifs are discovered for the expedition and it is only added to the already existing voltage. <br /> <br /> The movie is a decent idea, and an excerpt on the popular Sasquatch legend was bound to shut down movies sooner or later. However, the film's direction breaks a basic rule of horror / thriller direction and it shows too much too early. Of course, the audience knows that there is something that stalks the characters, just read the title! But showing what should have been the movie's kicker, which just ruins most of the excitement and, as a direct result, much of the fun. The movie also lacks a good mood, and there are almost no landscapes depicting the spread of the desert, but there are plenty of monster viewpoints that do not add anything to it. They actually pave "Predator" completely shamelessly. The low-budget horror movie 'Wendigo' did what this movie is trying to do much better. <br /> <br /> Some of the character tensions and a non-clich√© end manage to overcome this increase over the crap pile, but it's still poor and given the premise and potential, very disappointing. --- 4/10 <br /> Nominated R for little violence and dizziness, but it is pretty tame compared to most R-rated horror.
