How was the accuracy of the films made? <br /> <br /> It is believed that the subtitles just say "horrible" to each and every frame of this really grim effort. <br /> <br /> Horrendou's acting, unhappy dialogue, and lack of talent from all those involved in this nightmare make an eerie 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall impression? <br /> <br /> A lot of exciting drama students got lucky with a lottery subsidy and continued to make one of the most painful movies ever made. <br /> <br /> This makes Hammer Horror TV shows similar to Oscar material. <br /> <br /> And don't think for a second that this falls into the 'so bad, good' category. It's not even that bad. <br /> <br /> But the speed-lighting scene is a new look.
