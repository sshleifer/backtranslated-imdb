When I saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. I was expecting some light fluffy fun. Instead, I got bored and got a little depressed. In fact, there was no chemistry between the managers at all, and the movie had a little if it was something that was fun. The little girl was lovely - when she cried I was crying - but I thought they might have used someone a little younger in the role. <br /> <br /> No matter what, the movie was filled with long, tedious voices or swelling opera music. I'm not anti-opera, but I would have preferred them to spend that time so we got to know the characters who were all rigid and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed with this movie. The whole time I looked at it, I thought about how much better it could have been.
