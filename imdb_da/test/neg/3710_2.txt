A horrible B-movie at best with video quality similar to Dead Alive. I challenge anyone who is a "Aliens (James Cameron 1986)" Movie fan to count how many times either lines or almost entire sequences were ripped from the first two Alien movies to do this classic piece of waste. <br /> <br /> Cast members like R. Lee Ermey and Ray Wise were the only two actors with some talent and the management "Jack Scalia" was really horrible. I think they are throwing him for his massive chink. I was also annoyed with the stereotype of the only black man on the set John Toles-Bey, who has to look at this movie and just wonder. Look him up sometime when he has made a lot of interesting movies. But on this movie: The scripture that I said earlier was a rip-off of Aliens tweaked and turned into a submarine "thriller". It contained such lines as "I have a bad sense of this" and "Kill me" as a crew member is infected by one of the mutants, and his stomach begins to make "alien hop" just before it comes out of his stomach . There is also a rip-off of the classic "get some!" via Bill Paxton. We also have a bunch of navy grunts running through caves with creepy crawlies popping out of walls. Even the explosions of the mutated creatures are much like the expiry of the aliens as they charge marines in the movie "Aliens". And the kicker is that some of the mutants spit acid (as opposed to having acid for blood). There are many more great examples. So if you want to see this script done well, see the first two classics Alien and Aliens (With Sigourney Weaver). You will have a more enjoyable time. The plot could have been interesting and made better if it wasn't too confusing at the beginning of the movie and generally poor editing. Camera shots were pretty dull and honestly it wasn't very hard to stop seeing it and walking around the room to get a snack or check email. Many of the interactions between characters made little or no sense and went nowhere more often than not. The entire command structure between crew and Capt. Was poorly done. I'm not even sure if there are captains in the military who have full control of nuclear customers. Generally, it only shows that there was little research done for background information to make the movie seem a little respectable, and there are many other similar examples (such as diving depth, etc.). <br /> <br /> If you're a horrible movie or a big fan of Alien and Aliens and want something to just laugh and shake your head, this movie can be for you. For me, this goes back to the shelf ... permanently.
