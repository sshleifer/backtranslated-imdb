The new WEAPON, which serves as the basis for this scary piece of waste, is one of the best techno-thrillers to come down on the pike for a long time. The character of SOLO, which should NOT look like a human, is a wonderful creation, and it was simply terrible to see him reduced to another Terminator clone with Mario Van Peebles terribly trying to "act" as a robot. There is nothing worth for this movie. Why does Hollywood insist on intercepting the right to good novels and then slaughtering them? There are so many things wrong with SOLO that listing them seems so unfair as inviting a man without legs to a lively game of Hopscotch. Avoid this horrible movie and search for the 2 novels of ROBERT MASON that contain the amazing character of SOLO. The books are WEAPON and an excellent successor SOLO. But do not pay attention to this horrible drink of a movie.
