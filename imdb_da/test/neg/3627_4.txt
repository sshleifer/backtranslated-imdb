I actually belong to the demographic Zoey 101 who is specifically trying to target, so I can see that as much as trying to be related to people of my age, the premise is simply too ridiculous for an average person to relate to. The show is about the richest boarding school that exists and the lovely, incredibly tanned and attractive band of one-sided characters who inhabit it. As is the tradition of children's networks, a number of skinny white children, with the token black guy, are of course cast. The story lines are about Zoey and her gang friends stumble upon or create a kind of minor dilemma, such as. not to go to the gym class, resulting in Zoey preparing a scheme to save the day for all his friends. There is generally a B-line that revolves around either a one-sided guest character or placing supporting characters in completely unrealistic situations, such as Having a hive of wasps in a dorm room and no one notes. These charts often play stereotypes, like any character that draws good grades in mathematics, should by default lack social skills. Most of the episodes have the continuous and overused will - they will not-they Chase-Zoey dynamic. Unfortunately, people are all incredibly one-sided; there is Zoey, the perfect girl with a solution to literally everything, Chase, the constantly lovesick but rather loving Best Friend, Michael, the token black guy (kudos to Christopher Massey to control some really fun single-liners), Lola , the theater chick (that means she dies her hair and 75% of her dialogue is about her dreams of the star, despite the fact that she never does anything in the theater itself), Logan, the female narcissist, Dustin, the spazzy little brother and Quinn, the science geek. The few words I spent on each of these figures sum up each character completely. <br /> <br /> Zoey 101 manages to be entertaining at times, but the serious failures of the system of values ​​it promotes are an important departure. Zoey, created as the obvious role model and quasi-feminist crusader and which is on the surface depicted as flawless, manages ever-greater character errors. For example, when Lola was first introduced, she was thought to be a goth girl. Zoey tried to use this as an excuse to kick her out of their common dormitory to be "freaky". <br /> <br /> As far as the play is concerned, Jamie Lynn Spears landed this role because of her name, not because of talent. Although she is definitely improved as time goes by, it is clear that she is not a born actress, which greatly affects the quality of the show, as most of the plot lines are about her character. The support molding is surprisingly good, especially in view of the material they have to work with. They supply a lot of good one-liners for comic relief, if the plot has not yet dared to obscure. All in all, Zoey 101 is a flawless prospect of high school, and anyone previously their limited for many years shouldn't expect much from it.
