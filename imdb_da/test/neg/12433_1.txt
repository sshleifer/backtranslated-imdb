There is nothing to say unless I want my time back that this movie took from me. I'm not racist against Latinos. Hell, I'm half brazilian. I loved the movie Kids. It makes no sense. These kids just walk around and do nothing. They are not even good at skating. All the time I'm just waiting for something to happen! But it does not. Nothing happens throughout the movie. I said that they suck in skating. I might make a movie called beat up rockers, and the whole prerequisite is to kick sh * t out bags of moron punks like these kids. I don't even get into it, this movie sucks. Please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you get in touch with it, so another bad soul won't make the same mistake.
