I just don't know how this stupid, crap, junk, garbage and good for nothing movie is a blockbuster. It was so boring with a very, very weak (or no) story-line and wasn't even a fun fun. The movie was about 135 minutes with only a piece of story about Prem (Salman Khan) is a love guru and helps rude and romantic Bhaskar (Govinda) to get the girl he wants. I'm not saying I didn't like the movie because it wasn't fun or anything I want to accept a movie that's not fun but has a decent story. The only two reasons I can say that this is a super hit are: <br /> <br /> 1. Salman Khan & Govinda are on the screen together, but for the first time in Salaam e Ishq, that was flopped so it can't be. But it was a really good movie. <br /> <br /> 2. Salman Khan's name is Prem, and all the movies with that name have been hit, including Maine Pyar Kiya. So it's just luck. <br /> <br /> I heard it's a remake of Hitch, I haven't seen it, and I'm glad I didn't. Music is OK, the only good songs are Want a partner, You are my love and Soni De Nakhre, but what is the use of it in a really bad movie, also if you have someone like Katrina Kaif who dances with two left feet? She's totally crap. Neither she knows acting, language (her voice is always baptized for her), dancing and always fails to impress. I don't like her little bit, she was even disappointing in Koffee with Karan. Total Partner is a one-time film featuring a one-time actress Katrina Kaif. It's better that she's kicked out of Bollywood and never comes back again.
