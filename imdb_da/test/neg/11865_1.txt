It appears that all companies benefiting from the taxes that Romania has taken for the image give the image that disappears since 1994. They almost try not to get the oldest car it had founded, but they never take pictures of Lamorghini, Ferrari, Aston Martin and all the new Mercedes are more you can find in some important countries. <br /> <br /> Another problem is that they filmed in some neighborhoods in Bucharest where they had the opportunity to clear the streets and garbage the dressing people with maybe I know about 90 clothes and make them work so Stupid that you will realize that the manuscript might have been another hand bought from eBay or worth it. <br /> <br /> I knew for the future to continue making movies in the United States and making good money there, than giving us a little and shame on our country. I have no reason to believe anyone will understand the message (beyond my English --- sorry)
