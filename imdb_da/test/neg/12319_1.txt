The cat in the hat is just a flap in the face film. Mike Myers like The Cat in Hat is not really fun, and Mike Myers couldn't have been worse. This is his worst movie he's ever been in. The story and story were just awful. I mean, how could they make the most beloved stories of Dr. Seuss made movies and be one of the worst movies of all time and such a disappointment. I couldn't have seen a worst movie than this one, maybe Baby Geniuses. But this movie is just so bad, I can't even describe how badly they made this movie. Bo Welch must be fired or the author must. <br /> <br /> Heden's views: 0/10 No stars F
