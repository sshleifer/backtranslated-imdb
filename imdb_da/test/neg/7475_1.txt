When the opening shot is US marines seriously disrespectful American flags, a movie has a tough road ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill from there. A military adviser has been credited, which apparently is a retired US Marine, making it even more amazing that this incredible breach of the protocol and the law went unnoticed. Even more confusing is the way they simply shined on how a Marine is reported to the KIA, then buried, in very short order, without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body or if there was even a body. The US government still finds the shortcomings of World War II and it takes months to identify the remains. Military shoots remain MIA for months or years and are only declared KIA when the remains have been identified positively, or after many years of bureaucracy. Here we are expected to believe that this happens within a few days or weeks. Perhaps this is happening in Denmark, but not in the United States. None of the parties involved has clearly had the least involvement or respect for the US military. <br /> <br /> Besides that, there are a number of other absolutely ridiculous moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere. There must have been some really extended meetings between author and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such fungi. Having a script that worked could have helped, but it seems to have been done on the spot working from Cliffs Notes. There is no way of knowing whether the manuscript was so terribly original, or whether it was the author or the middle-aged children in the studio who are responsible. In both cases, it's a horrible movie that should never have been made.
