Spoiler warning !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably my least favorite Cary Grant movie. I spent most of the time: ignoring him, leaving him, etc. Is he trying to kill her? Should we assume at the end when he persuades her to return home with him that he will kill her after all? I see from checking in a few books that this is a reading that some viewers / critics have taken. Post-processing early is a more sensible way to film a book than to change the end - and this is a more unreasonable change to the ending than, for example, in Altman's The Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's previous example of not killing the killer, because a star has been thrown (when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, Ivor Novello's murderous habits are not mentioned) the book's conclusion is not entirely excluded. <br /> <br /> In Robin Woods Hitchcocks Films Revisited, he writes: "As a psychic" swiches "from ending to ending, changing the meaning of each scene, the narrator's apparent solidity dissolves the illusion of fiction's" reality ", the movie becomes a "modernist" text where the narrative process is at the forefront. "I enjoy playing intellectual interpretation games as much as anyone else, but unless the film is on a light reading, it fails. This one fails. Even after considering the fatal glass of milk that repeats itself in a pair of Hitchcock films. <br /> <br /> An annoying haze. The year is 1941. Nothing in the film says it's put in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) keeps his money in a Paris Bank and goes there to do business? Doesn't he know there's a war on it? In fact, there were still some flights from Croydon Airport? Is he good with the Nazis? How will it never assume that the Germans shot him like a spy or something. A curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina have dinner with Isobel, the mystery writer and her brother, the pathologist, are a fifth person who is never explained or introduced - a woman in a tuxedo. The credits say she is Nondas Metcalf who plays Phyllis Swinghurst. Isn't this an example of how lesbians were coded in the '40s movie? Should we take her as Isobel's beloved? The books that discuss blatant and hidden gays / lesbians in Hitchcock (for example Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.
