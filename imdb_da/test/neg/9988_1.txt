For the time being, I passed through Gibbon's Fall and Decline of the Roman Empire, so I've had all things Roman on my mind. I'm not very far into it yet, maybe two hundred plus pages, but it's amazing how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I think I've read through maybe 15 emperors so far, and only Antony, Trajan and Hadrian have not been killed or at least suspected of being killed. I have also been fascinated by the horrible assaults of many of these princes in Rome. Not least exercising these were Caligula. This brings me to review this movie. I think of the film historically, as far as I understand it from Gibbon's explanation of Rome, as well as other studies from some good websites and some fiction short stories about the period. <br /> <br /> My point is, I don't think this movie is what it is meant to be by many of its advocates. I do not think that the sensation shown with this movie's gender and terrible violence qualifies it as accurate. The general ideas of the movie seem accurate. Caligula grew up on an island, confused with his family and in fear of being murdered by the increasingly angry, suspicious and strange Emperor Tiberius. He grows up paranoid and scared and can never shake the crooked nickname given to him by his guards, Little Boots, this helps him grow up, feels abused and powerless. He has surrendered the empire after Tiberius dies, the Senate hopes he will steer away from the informed squads that led the death attack of the previously inedible paranoid tyrant, and lead Rome away from the madness in which the dictator had settled. Caligula begins as a decent If hands-off emperor but gets sick, almost dies and comes back from the brink of feberous death a true monster. His perversions with his sisters begin here, if not before. He has macro killed and many others who were his original followers. The greed did not seem to be the murders of Caligula as much as his new thinking of himself as a living God. He saw that he was talking to the statue of Jupiter as a just condemned him. His violent, vicious assault would have condemned him anyway, and three years seems to have been quite a decent race for the successors of Tiberius. Now the film stinks basically to these lines, while it manages to be coherent, which is not common throughout it, it does while trying to shock the audience in every way. In each scene, the film asks you to be disgusted by the depravity of ancient Rome. The shocking scenes are what this film is completely built on and where it completely fails. It is just too much to see successive rulers have murdered, raped, tortured without reason, but desire. The depictions of the violence may be, but not enough, accurate. Murder was definitely the order of the day in imperial rooms, torture in advance was rotten. But the director's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists, while the followers are looking at nonchalance, I just don't see it gone exactly like that. The death machine, the master, is definitely something you've never seen in movies, and something you've ever seen should never forget even if you like you could. The wine that drinks while the penis is roped off is the same when you have seen this shame, it is yours forever. These things hit me the director's and the pornmagnet's fantasies. They jumped from their sick imagination and not from any evidence. <br /> <br /> The action is pretty good. In fact, I think Mcdowell is the weakest link here. Mirren is always something to see, and here in her youthful years she is formidable and beautiful. Nerva and Tiberius depictions are performed very well by their respected actors. The movie could have done so much better storytelling, it's such a mistake, that way it's just a completely different layer of what a shame this thing was. For example, it could have made sense of how and why Caligula became angry, or showed that he was sour, paranoid before his illness, and that the fever broke the mental restraint he had previously had. It could have shown Claudius' weakness, and the miracle was that he survived Caligula. It could have these and many other things, but it's stuck on it's sad nightmare. Finally about gender. That's porn. It shows that these sex acts are done everywhere in the palaces of many people. Man on man, woman on female, male on female. It is passionate, disgusting sex. Gender, if your point is to get it out, I seriously doubt. Both Tiberius and Caligula may have been sex addicts, and orgies may have been common enough, but the visions of this movie seem to remember more of a Greek time than a Roman. I do not think that such acceptance of homosexuality or orgies right into the open was common to Elgabalus' strange, corrupted government, and he was killed for it. <br /> <br /> If you are curious about it, this movie should never watch, let it go. This is something that I said earlier, if you see this, you will unfortunately keep the sick visions in your eye in the years to come. I do not think it is a precise historical picture in particular, even though it is historical in its entirety.
