Totally agree with another review. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie for approx. 5 minutes. I looked up a review on another site and found that it wasn't even a real sequel. This was after I slowly moved away from the television with the remote control in my hand, the jaw dropped down and down. <br /> <br /> The quality of the movie is beyond a low budget. It doesn't even look like a freaking movie. If I looked at 'home video' footage from a documentary, I would expect it. <br /> <br /> In summary: Avoid, avoid avoiding. Boooo Lion's Gate! Shame on me completely for 5 minutes, and I hope I've saved others from renting or owning it.
