I find Herzog's documentary work very uneven. Fata Morgana, a companion to the Toys of Darkness, lacks not only the scary play, but mostly an author's discerning eye. It is in comparison amateurish, meaningless pans left and right over the desert, what kind of you would expect from any German tourist equipped with a handycam, the camera left running from the window of a car that fetched all kinds of meaningless pictures, wiring fences, abandoned buildings and stains of dirt passing through the lens in random order are cut with dots. At one point, Herzog meets a group of starved cattle, who throw away in the sand, but the picture is presented much like you and I would, perhaps worse, peering the camera from one cattle to the next. For a documentary trying to be a visual celebration, a hypnotic, surreal excursion into unknown landscapes, it lacks a discriminated writer's visual orchestration and conviction. It is everywhere, half-hearted and boring, Mayan creation myths recited in the voice-over, so another text, Herzog, was fond of the literature. It is only until the end that Fata Morgana is alive through a number of bizarre meetings. First, with a man and a woman playing music in a room, the man sings in a distorted voice through a microphone, both of which are apathetic in their task. A man stops with a turtle. A group of old people are trying to get out of some holes in the ground. Apart from that, this seems to have very little substance to offer or visual splendor to offer.
