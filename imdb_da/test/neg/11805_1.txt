No one can say that I had not been warned when I read the reviews (both user and external) but as most of us attracted to horror movies ... curiosity got this cat. (Now we all scream at the people in the movie so as not to enter the dark room, but you know that horror aficionados are always dying to know what's there, even though we know it it will be bad). <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that this movie left me angry. Not because it's pretending to be right (who cares ... gimmicks are allowed) or because the actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) Or even because the movie is so bad (and I'm polite here). What really made me angry is that the movie is not just a rip off of BWP, but also a half-hearted lazy rip off on it. <br /> <br /> I don't believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could surpass BWP then kudos to them, but they didn't even try. The film was made with little effort or care, and it is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie!
