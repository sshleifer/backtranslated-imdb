Far Brown's thesis is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all the problems of life. A bit of proselytizing I don't mind, but it gets a little ridiculous at times. <br /> <br /> Some fine actors have played Far Brown over the years, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are two good examples. Alec Guinness plays him in this movie and gets along well with him, but you didn't see much demand for future uncle movies. <br /> <br /> I suppose if you are a committed Roman Catholic, it is perfectly perfect. It is far more important to catch the thief and convert him to your religion than to see that he has been prosecuted. <br /> <br /> But that was what was asked to accept here. In fact, there is a preliminary story before the film's main action. Guinness in office cloth is trapped trying to put back stolen articles, which one of his parish children Sidney James had hoisted during a robbery. <br /> <br /> It's the story he gives the local police and of course it's something James has entrusted to him so he can't break the confession. <br /> <br /> Now on to bigger games. Master Thief Flambeau, played by Peter Finch, has stolen a cross entrusted to Far Brown and is said to belong to St. Augustine back in the day. But Uncle is more interested in getting Flambeau to go back to his faith than to see him straight. Then he misleads the police so he can reach his mission. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, but it was just too much for me to swallow. Father Brown I would hate to say it was guilty of obstruction and should have been arrested. And he was not obliged not to reveal anything he knew about Flambeau, the man had not come to him as a punishment seeking absolution and spiritual counseling. <br /> <br /> Author G.K. Chesterton, a well-known Catholic play of his time, finds all this very reasonable. Carried to his logical conclusion, we should replace all police forces with an army of priests. <br /> <br /> Guinness borrows from his own Reverend Ascoyne D'Ascoyne from Kind Hearts and Coronets and from Barry Fitzgerald in the Going My Way to create Farbrune. Given though Brown is much sharper than the other two. There is also a colonel Nicholson in this depiction. In the bridge at the River Kwai, Guinness also played a character that is quite a strange interpretation of the rules that made him lose what was important in the situation Nicholson was in. <br /> <br /> Far Brown is an entertaining guy when he solves mysteries and makes the authorities foolish. We enjoyed the Brother Cadfael doing it in a medieval setting and American audiences liked Dowling's game played by Tom Bosley a few years back. <br /> <br /> This movie must be stuck to being entertaining.
