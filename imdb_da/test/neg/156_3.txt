Jack Bender's "The Tempest" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's play "The Tempest". Bender transports the plot from medieval Italy to Mississippi during the American Civil War. He includes the slavery problem and the role of revenge in times of war. <br /> <br /> Prospero, renamed Gideon Prosper, is not the Duke of Milan, but a landowner in Mississippi. He learns voodoo magic from the female slave Mambo Azaleigh. He saves her son Ariel, who thus accompanies him in his exile. The island is not on the sea, but in a swamp near the Mississippi. An Alligator hunter lives, a so-called "Gator-Man" who later tries to rape Prospero's daughter Miranda. In the time of the Civil War, Ariel wants to join the Union's troops to help fight slavery. Prospero doesn't care about the war. He is only interested in his personal revenge on his brother Antony. When Antony and his bookkeeper Willi Gonzo (Gonzalo) try to cross the river, Prospero raises a storm. Union soldier Frederick is lost in the swamp and finally arrives on the island. He and Miranda fall in love with each other, but Prospero will not accept it. Meanwhile, Ariel was transformed into an amber of Prospero, finding out that Antony has failed allies with the Union, but plans to betray them. Antony and Gonzo meet with Gator Man in the swamp and conspire with him against Prospero. They kidnap Miranda and Ariel, but Prospero freezes them and helps the Union defeat the southern army. In the end, Ariel is free, Frederick and Miranda are obliged to marry, Prospero returns to the plantation, and Gator Man returns to the island. <br /> <br /> Peter Fonda represents Gideon Prosper strongly and convincingly while Antony's character remains fairly flat. It was not a bad idea to perform Tempest before the civil war, but perhaps the director has risked too much. In some parts, history seems to be constructed or comical. Gator Man, for example, appears just without explanation. That it takes a kidnapping to bring Prospero to his thoughts and that he loses confidence in his power shows that Bender tried to make Prospero more human, but only made him a weak old man without his magic. Prospero's original authority and wisdom have not been clarified. <br /> <br /> ------------- End of Part 1 --------------- ---------- ---
