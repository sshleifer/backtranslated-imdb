This movie was extremely boring. I laughed only a few times. I decided to rent it when I saw William Shatner's name on the cover. It's about this little child who is picked all the time by his classmates. As he walks in the streets looking for old ladies to help, he meets a prostitute. She takes him to a club called the Playground, where he turns to several pimps. When Mayor Tony Gold (Shatner) decides to take over the pimp business, Lil 'Pimp must go to his homies. <br /> <br /> The animation is not very good at this. It looks like it was made with Macromedia, which I'm sure it was. It doesn't suck, it's just the kind of choppy flash animation that people have been used to in recent years. The humor in this is not very good, I didn't think any of it was fun.
