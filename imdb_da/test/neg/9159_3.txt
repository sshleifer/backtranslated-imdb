I honestly thought that this movie was supposed to be cheesy, even though I've wanted Alvin and Chipmunks for a long time! I was was very wrong. IT WAS GOOD!!! It's been the best movie I've seen since October! In my opinion, this is the movie, everyone should see this high season! The thrill (I thought anyway ...) was terrible, The Golden Compass was okay, but the end was pretty crazy for its dark material fans, and I'm the legend, I haven't seen it yet (or National Treasures 2), but it looks great. <br /> <br /> I'm not giving anything away, but this movie is great for everyone, especially kids!
