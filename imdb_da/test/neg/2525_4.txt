I used to work with the company that originally released this movie, Vestron Pictures. Vestron had the same problem that many small independent film companies had, they did not have much money to put into the production values ​​of their films. Not the money alone will buy you a good movie. See e.g. At Kevin Costner's Waterworld. <br /> <br /> Sometimes you can create your own new talent if you have a talented person as a acquisition or development. But at Vestron there was no such person, and they always jumped in a crucial area. In this case, it was at the director and the author. It makes it pretty hard to have a decent movie, even with the big ensemble movie that this movie has. <br /> <br /> I think the basic premise for this movie was "Let's put a bunch of naughty characters in a room and see if anything interesting happens." It's an exciting idea but not worth it to look at. <br /> <br /> Most of the Vestron movies ended up having a very distinctive look and look. My wife and I developed the ability to spot this quality, even in non-Vestron movies. Many times we could even see the quality from watching only the trailer or TV ad. We wanted to sit there and watch the trailer or ad, and then we would turn to each, and almost in sync we would say, "Now it's a Vestron movie!" This is a Vestron movie.
