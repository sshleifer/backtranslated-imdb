This movie serves 3 for miserable writing, poor technical profit and continuity problems. Some people have given this movie a 10 - and maybe it's okay if you simply score it for their fun factor. Technically, however, this is an eerie film series from start to finish - produced by 3rd-rate writers, actors and crew. It was really true for almost all series because they were meant as low-brow entertainment specifically aimed at the kids. And there is nothing wrong with it, but "high art" is not it !! Spy Smasher earns a lower than average over other series because it is of even lower quality and has major continuity problems - even for a serial. It was common for a serial to have a "cliff hanger" - that is, a moment at the end of the episode, which looked as if the good guy died but miraculously survived when the next episode began. BUT, in this movie, it is very hokies and ridiculous. You would literally see the hero die in the last episode, but in the next they shot the scene again and showed he didn't actually die (although they clearly showed him buying the farm in the last)! Again and again in SPY SMASHER he seems to die, but in the next episode they show it from a different angle and somehow he avoids death - even though he fell 1500 meters in a river, fell into a buzz saw or anything. <Br /> <br /> See this movie not for its quality, but for a good laugh or to learn how to go to the cinema on Saturday morning several decades ago.
