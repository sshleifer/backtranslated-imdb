This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thank God, I saw it for free. I would have hated to waste my money on it. <br /> <br /> First, there is no sign in the movie that likes in any way. Michael Caine comes close, but himself is pretty flawless. The rest of the "commands" consist of vile ex-cons. There are the two gay Arabs and three boys trying to rape a red nurse and the "leader" who has no trouble sending his men to be killed so he can escape. <br /> <br /> "Mission" is everything from excitement. They must blow up the fuel dump. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Now footage follows them through endless sandstorms and fixes flat tires. Yes, you read it right. The "excitement" is whether they will run out of extra tires. We actually see that they change something like 12 apartments on the way. It's so incredibly exciting that this movie is. <br /> <br /> They come to the fuel dump to find out that it is a bait. So nothing to blow up. And at the moment, the British Army is deciding for some very terrible reasons that they no longer need these guys and radiate their whereabouts to the Germans to kill them. <br /> <br /> So at least I want an exciting race for freedom? No, instead they decide to blow up another fuel dump to create a diversion. But when they enter the site, they set up a tour, and the Germans come to get them - calling their names over a speaker. <br /> <br /> Really weird. If the Germans knew where they were and where they were going, why did they let them get right into the dump before they jumped "the trap?" Instead, they wait until they enter the fuel tank and charge all their taxes. Yes. Right. It would happen. <br /> <br /> So they blow dumped, the manager sells all his men - except Michael Caine, when he's been offered $ 2000 to bring him back alive. <br /> OK ... so the men are all betrayed and killed, and Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport survive. The British troops come in with thought and they decide to be rescued. As they have German uniforms (they carried them to blow up the dump), they tie a white flag around a stick and get out of the way. A British guy goes and holds them and machine guns to death. Credits roll. <br /> <br /> Yep. The two "Heroes" in the movie die because of a random act of violence. It's almost as if the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided, "It's a wrap. Kill them and we go home." I wasted 2 hours in my life and watched this tired, imaginative and utterly unrealistic movie ending with a bomb burst.
