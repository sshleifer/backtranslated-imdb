Usually for movie reviews, I try to be constructive and objective, but there is only one word for this, uh, "movie": SUCKS !!!!!!! The dialogue, the play, the special effects, the plot, the set and the figures seem like they were made of, yes, my potted plants. Don't see this for all the good and right in this world! :)
