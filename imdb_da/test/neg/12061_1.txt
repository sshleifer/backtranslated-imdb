I must first mention that as a group of friends, we often find entertainment in wacthing movies known to be horrible for comedy value, therefore our rental of Camp Blood. <br /> <br /> Camp Blood was the first movie we had rented that had been shot at what appears to be a video camera and it was so rubbish it wasn't even fun. The DVD was returned and a refund was required with the additional suggestion Some kind of quality control was implemented to prevent such complete waste from being stored. <br /> <br /> Don't do what I did and let curiosity get better for you, it's so bad, it's not even fun.
