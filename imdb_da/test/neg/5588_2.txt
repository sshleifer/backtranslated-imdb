Wow, what is this on the video rental store shelf in front of me? Nothing but a dubious "successor" to 8MM. It wasn't a really good sequel to a movie that had a very final end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie. Basically from the plot view verbatim, an American diplomat, David Huxley and his fiance, Tish Harrington, enter the sweden's underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary to find out who detests them with a porn video taken by them with a prostitute, Risa. The whole story is based on the various characters that make up these different sex clubs and strips throughout the city. The mystery is solved when Tish finally finds out that ransom money for the video and (essentially later in the story) her fiance, who came out of her trust fund, basically goes back to her future husband as the story unfolds to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> I didn't like how this had nothing to do with the original 8MM at all. The only thing that is close to the original is the type of thriller that it was that the fact that David ended up with some kind of bondage crime over him to keep him captive resembles the kinky world of the first movie and the fact that entire movies have sex emblazoned through almost all key scenes. Otherwise, it's a completely different movie. It created a miserable love story even before the end is known, making the end more of an opportunity because I didn't believe in the words that came out of David's mouth all the time. But we were warned that he was a liar of most things that could get him in trouble. There were ridiculous naked scenes in most of the "shocking" moments in the movie, which tried to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for Tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this "hellish" sex debauchery. I figured at least 11 ridiculously filmed sequences, as there was nothing but sex to show. Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but movies with naked women on it to make the DVD seem quite provocative. <br /> <br /> David was not a heroic hero throughout the movie. You could guess he was the biggest problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me, who could explain how they got so many of them to strip down to act "respect". There were plot holes (How was David and Richard finally impressed by Tish's father by getting the lease they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this preliminary investigation to try to find a prostitute?) There were cheesy technology moments (like that The speakers' e-mail program dressed up as a bondage queen and a gay brother-character only showed how the instructor tried to get a Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character. The tagline on this profile for this video is also complete BS because it didn't even revolve around a last breath. No one really dies. But they had a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere ... but it was a good 10 seconds long out of an hour and 3/4 long movie. Go hire (and maybe buy) the original one. It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and more original films. It has everything better with it from this movie. I would not recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples with oranges.
