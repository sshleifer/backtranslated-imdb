Here's a movie that obviously knocks on being marketed as exotica to audiences who aren't familiar with its topic. <br /> <br /> An attempt on the hybrid of fiction and document, "Kadosh" clumsily falls between the chairs. As a documentary, on the one hand, it is neither accurate nor insightful. In order to realize its sloppy handling of details, one should not go further than the opening scene, where it is quite obvious that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not know as much as how to correctly put his t'filin. More generally, the dull root-style presentation of details (in this case of Jewish ultra-orthodox ritual) is the role of a manual, not a good documentary; the latter should provide an organizing principle (a figure if you want) for the viewer so that she can come up with a better understanding of the show. This obviously does not happen here, as ultra-orthodox rituals are made even more enigmatic. The director seems to have done a decent job explaining it all verbally during the film's release campaign; However, it is a huge case of tribal influence. As a fiction feature, on the other hand, it suffers from the character's flattery, simplicity of plot, and dullness of the message. At some points, I felt I saw a cartoon. (eg the wedding evening - without going into detail at angles, positions and dimensions ... well, it couldn't be a realistic depiction of human gender, missing as it may be.) <br /> <br /> There are no subtleties in this movie. The clever manipulation of hints that stimulate the viewer's imagination and thought of taking an active role in the cinematic text, which I think is a sign of good function, is completely absent. On the contrary: see the movie I felt, sometimes like being born again and again with the same already chewed and overly obvious content. In fact, as director Gitai himself put it in an interview, an architectural "shifting object in space" and then coloring the scenes with the relevant emotions as they are encouraged and promoted the plot on its appropriate and predictable track; but the spark, the creative, the pigeon-like dark, impenetrable spark (let's not forget "Kadosh" is apparently a tragedy), what casts on a two-dimensional screen, the spell that makes it an extension of the viewer's world is missing without a trace. Perhaps a work by a visual engineer, perhaps by an unsophisticated ideologist; definitely not a real movie maker. What I saw was a passion game for animated problems rather than flesh-blood-and-complexities real people. The actor has largely failed to transcend this direct flatness of an idea that was forced (sometimes even tortured) into film. A remarkable, yet relatively small exception, was that of the great lady and the mother, both played by the excellent and experienced Lea Koenig. It requires more than strict adherence to a winning formula (namely, a serving of exotica, plus heartbreaking yet simple melodrama, plus a popular agenda, preferably politically correct) to tantalize my interest buds. The main line here is easily that for a large part of the movie I was simply bored. Despite the novel, perhaps even groundbreaking performance of using an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood as a movie set, for which Mr. Gitai and his crew deserve all the price, I also found the "Kadosh" way also Nadosh (Hebrew for "trite").
