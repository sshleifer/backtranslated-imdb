After watching the movie version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel like I was wasting 100 minutes in my life. Although the book was not my favorite, I was very disappointed to see how badly Nicolas Roeg portrayed the story. Despite the fact that he omitted many bits of important information, it didn't just seem to fit their roles, and the whole movie seemed very numb. The book portrays living nature and details that are completely ignored in the film. <br /> <br /> You'd think an instructor would fit 76 pages of a book into a movie at least an hour and a half. The differences completely changed the story for me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's fianc√© is unclear that Kurtz is dead, it completely alters the end that the book had given. Not to mention the sets and scenes used in the movie, they were almost as beautiful as they were described. It feels sincere as if Roeg filmed another story with references from Heart Of Darkness embedded in it. <br /> <br /> If you see the movie without knowing the title or expecting something like Joseph Conrad's story, you can find it good. Though I thought the camera's work was poor and thrown unsuitable, it's a captivating story all the same. But if you are looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, don't look for it in Roeg's movie.
