I love camp movies, believe me, and the usual technicolorian gore by Gordon Lewis doesn't break me at all, but it's just one of his stupid movies, even more so than BLOOD FEAST, I'm not funny. GORE GORE GIRLS is about a sour person who kills a lot of go (re) - go (re) girls in a nightclub. A detective and a reporter are trying to figure out the great secret. Maybe the performance here is a little better than the usual average acting H.G Lewis movie, but that doesn't say much. The camera's work is even horrible. But at least it's easy to look at when you go, girls appear ... you want to pass a good time with it, and the killings are just absurd in a very, very bad way: A girl is killed with a wood hammering in her ass (!) and just don't let me talk about what it does with the nipples. You will laugh like someone with this. But the better of all this mess is a scene that I only love from the camp: the go-go girl before being attacked by many feminists dancing in a very American way. However, it is important to note that this was one of the first films to receive an X rating due to the violence. ONLY if you want laughter and go for a good time (but only with a lot, A Lots of beer).
