Playmania is extremely boring. This is the basis of the show. Mel or Shandi ask very easy questions that a 2-year-old could answer at extremely slow pace. This show lasts for 2 hours and they probably only play about 10 games during that time. People like this show because the hosts are eye-opener, but they are hotness totally ruined by being so friggin annoying. During the show, they mention that we need more players a million times. The top 5 studies that they do probably take approx. 20 minutes out of the show. This show is probably one of the worst games ever made. One of the reasons they are probably not inferior is because the show is so cheap with the money. Most of the money I've ever seen was $ 210. I wouldn't be surprised if this "game show" is canceled by the end of 2006.
