Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most annoying personality on the Food Network and any TV. If you've never seen 30 Minute Meals, then you may not be able to begin to understand how incredibly annoying she is. I really meant that you can't even start to be boggled by her until you've seen the show once or twice, and even then all words and intelligent thoughts will fail you. The problem is mostly with her mannerisms that you may have guessed. Ray has a foggy mouth and often mimics the parrot. If you love something or think it's "awesome" (a word she spends about 87 times per broadcast), just say it. And she constantly uses horrible, eerie catchphrases like "EVOO" (Extra virgin olive oil!). SHUT UP! What's worse is Ray has two other shows on the network! I think this is a deepened conspiracy of the terrorists to drive us angry. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray is lame.
