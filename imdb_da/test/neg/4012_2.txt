Altman is very proud of the fact that people in his film talk about each other because he says people do it in life. Well, people are also coughing, burp, going on keyboard, etc. Pointe is that just because people actually do something, it doesn't make convincing cinema. It's a problem. The biggest problem is that this is just not a very smart or direct or striking or relevant satire, in 1988 or 2004. Garry Trudeau is still living in the 1960s and everyone, except a small core of Republican elected officials, is a 60s hippie liberal. I think the guy still trusts Zonker in his strip - a sign that is a complete anachronism, but Trudeau still employs him as if he is representative of a large strip of American youth. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. I'm a conservative, but I'm not saying this is bad because it has got a liberal bend. It could take a liberal thank you and be fun and relevant, but it is not. It is essentially a vanity piece with a bunch of prominent celebrity liberalists (including the sensible, repulsive Ron Reagan, Jr.). At times it feels like the script, and the rest of the time it has a snarky air of self-meaning and "aren't we so clever?" - ness. Someone said that this show insists that it has a cult following. I think its cult status is more desirable than the real one. I'm sure there are two or three people out there who taped all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them, but if that's the standard, then each show has ever aired a cult classic to some extent. If Tanner didn't have the names Altman and Trudeau attached, it would be another forgotten HBO production from the 1980s. Instead, it is presented as hard hit, sharp political commentary by guys who are at the top of their game. The reality, however, is as far from it as possible. Pat Paulsen's president satire is more relevant than Tanner ever was and he has been dead for a decade.
