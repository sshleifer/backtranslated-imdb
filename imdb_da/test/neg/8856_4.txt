Well, this movie is really "PLUMPED" HAHA Get it? It's a bit like the attitude of this movie. The reason is just a copy of Pulp Fiction, okay it's acceptable, but to do this piece if "PLUMP" (haha)! is really incredible. The story is so pathetic, and the whole thing just gets a few laughs. It tried to make a few jokes from various other movies and it failed most times. I mean, I have a sense of humor, but it's not really the way to go to get a laugh. Most of the allegedly "funny" moments are completely ironic. The film is silent for about 75 minutes in total. They could have done a much more fun job, apparently they had fun with a movie, they were gambling and hey! I think they lost! <br /> <br /> In overall PLUMP Fiction is "PLUMPABLE", but you will not collect much at all! <br /> <br /> Worth seeing again and again?: No time is enough, in fact, it's more than enough! So is it worth renting? Ummm. As I said it is "PLUMPABLE" but you will only collect a few "PLUMPS" from it! <br /> <br /> Overall out of 10th out of 10!
