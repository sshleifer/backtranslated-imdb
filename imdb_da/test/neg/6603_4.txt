I grabbed La Bandara because it reunited Jean Gabin and Julien Duvivier if Pepe le Moko is a noir masterpiece. I will give it a few points because Gabin is in it, but the lumpy plot, cheap set and the ridiculous Annabella, who makes an Arab princess, put the movie on my `selling 'shelf. If you see it, you will ask yourself why idiots did not build the fort around the well instead of a deadly few meters away from it. And why use tin roof in the middle of the desert? But in that case, the sheer perversity of the contrivance that constitutes the script must dump you for further consideration.
