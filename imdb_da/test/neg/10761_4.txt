It strikes me how anyone can judge this movie very highly. Calling it far fetched is not an understatement. How the guy managed in such a short time to build a wooden maze of underground rooms is quite ridiculous, or maybe he was the greatest joiner since Jesus. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show, and I found the blonde female leader Jennifer Jason Leigh quite common. We have an expression here in U.K. 'sheep made up like lamb', which suits her perfectly. However, it was not that bad, I enjoyed it immensely when the final credits rolled and "The End" came up was quite brilliant for this hotch potch of a television movie that if it had been a movie release would have been put on video and in discount stores in no time at all.
