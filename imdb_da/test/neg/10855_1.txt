This is the possibility of the worst and most disappointing movie I've ever seen. I have spent four years at two universities and know that there must be a good film about the experience. It is not. The "actress" is god terrible and the plot is not present. <br /> <br /> Here are a few events from my one year in housing. <br /> <br /> 1) A posh lad unknowingly relaxed with a transvestite. 2) The best friend mating two girls - one with big breasts and the other with the nickname "brick". 3) A couple who shag too high. 4) The boy who gets all the girls 5) Boys from Northern Ireland who are very hard to understand. 6) McDonalds in bed 7) Curry every night for a week 8) Student bashing, couple of my friends joined the hospital 9) The discarded joint who started a fire. 10) River 11) The boy who wakes up on his floor to find out that every piece of furniture is taken from his room. <br /> <br /> And if I can get to the list in 5 minutes and from real life, I'm sure a couple of screenwriters can do better, much better. <br /> <br /> And for a movie named after a Sleeper song, where is the Britpop soundtrack?
