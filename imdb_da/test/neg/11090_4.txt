Julie Delpy stars in this horrible movie about a sadistic relationship between a father and a daughter in France from the 14th century. The film tries to crush the romantic knight image of the heroic medieval knight by showing a rather dull picture of the period, defined by psychological dysfunction and violence. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a child, François, growing up in the shadow of the centuries war, told by his father to keep his mother safe and waiting for his return. François takes action when he discovers his mother with a lover in bed. François murders him to defend his father's honor. François grows like his father as a son, leaving his family to go in the same war. This setting is part of an explanation of the events that are to come when we are already on our way home that something is wrong with François. The war has not done well with him, he has changed. <br /> <br /> The daughter, Béatrice de Cortemart (Delpy), is waiting for her beloved father to return from the English captivity. She is clean of heart and she was left to take care of the property while her father was away. In her father's absence, Béatrice has to deal with financial difficulties, which strengthens Béatrix's hope that her father will return to save her. But on his return, she discovers that he lost the will to enjoy life, and he tortures and humbles everything around him, even his own daughter. From these points, the film shows various ways in which François plagues his family. Beginning with the humiliation of his own son, ending with rape by his own daughter, Béatrice. <br /> <br /> Setting the media in the Middle Ages should diminish the wind which the viewer can tell himself that these kinds of violent acts were being held in difficult times. And in fact, many films on the subject of Incest, like Tim Roth's "The War Zone (1999)" which is modern, are more shocking because of it. Delpy appears in this movie in several bold nude scenes. In fact, she seems to be English and beautiful. <br /> <br /> I was annoyed when I saw some animal torture scenes. I think, and it is not confirmed that some birds were killed to make this movie, which really disturbs me. The quality of a movie falls when true violence against animals is used. I hope this movie will be re-released without these atrocities. These scenes do not contribute much to the film history. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is too long. The script is problematic. We can't see François and Béatrice before the war, we don't really get the answer, why has he changed to such extreme. I would have passed this movie, but I have to mention a few scenes that made this movie worth seeing: <br /> <br /> * Scenes about a child who is able to murder in cold blood , is really shocking. I saw it for the first time on "God's City (2002)". Here, Francois kills his mother's beloved while his father is at war. Excellent scene and very graphic. * The scenes from Béatrice are raped by her father until she finds out she is pregnant by him, is really shocking and interesting. The scene after rape, where Delpy burns his clothes and cleans herself. She asks her brother to kick her in the stomach with the hope of getting an abortion. <br /> <br /> * Brother humiliation scenes where the father dumps his son's head into the food - humiliating him and ranting about the war. Later he dresses his son with the woman's cloth. The film won César (French Oscar) for Best Costume Design, I agree that costumes here really make the movie authentic for the time period. The film site is the Château de Puivert, a true 12th century castle and a historic monument located in Aude, South Central France. Beautiful castle and mountain views really help you put into the period of this movie. The film was also nominated for 3 César prizes, but they were all shaken by the very successful French film "Au revoir, les enfants" ("Goodbye, Children", 1998). <br /> <br /> --- Published as "Beatrice" in New York City, March 1987. Only to be screened in France in November 2007. Looked at YES3 on May 3, 2007, 5:45 pm at work .
