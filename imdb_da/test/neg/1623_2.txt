This movie is a redeemable quality (besides Ator's short-loincloth) is the hilarious act of the evil guy, Zor. This wonderfully overplayed villain has a certain ... Oh, Shakespeare's presence that made this movie viable (hence 2). I just giggled every time he pirouetted and raised an incredible eyebrow to hands or completely. A true example of someone not being paid enough. (And that was it!) <br /> <br /> Now what was the 12-minute hang-glider scene? Really, really, really bad. I cannot stress that point enough. <br /> <br /> So seriously, if you yourself expect to see this movie, see the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version. With the dear silhouettes, many horrible films have been tolerated.
