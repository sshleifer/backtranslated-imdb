Yep, it's me again! Sir. 'I sit through the crap so you don't need'. <br /> <br /> What do you think it's all about? Could it possibly be a woman who calls a sex line and makes sure to meet bachelors in a remote area? Then her cross-dressing boyfriend comes along and cracks her throat with a shaver before they get along with her money? Wow, what a guess! And if I tell you that the policeman put on the case is forced to join a sexy assistant DA to spike those suckers, what conclusion would you come to? Do you think the sexy DA will go undercover with a thin red dress for an attempt to meet the dragon queen, but then end up being kidnapped and must be rescued by the maverick officer? (who has already handed his gun and badge) ZING! You get 10 points! <br /> <br /> Honestly, this movie bored me to tears. Why do people insist on making this kind of nonsense? It is a waste of our time, their time and yet they continue regardless. Filming a movie that no one gives a iota about. If it has any redeeming features, there is the fact that it has some of the most beautiful ladies I've seen in a movie for a while. I hope they used the lean wages they earned from lots of botox and colonic watering. They would look good on Vogue, or hung on top of a car in a bikini. They just have to leave actors to the professionals (like Shannon Tweed). <br /> <br /> Talking about future careers, I ran into the director today. He certainly whips a tasty chicken burger meal. I must also say that the uniform really fits him. I asked him about 'Party Line' and his eyes went to the floor before mumbling something about extra fries. Oh well, guess it doesn't really work out. Forget it, they let him take over drive-thru tomorrow !! Hooray !! 1.10
