You know, I only saw 15 minutes of this movie, so I can't really describe how big it is. I think the concept alone is so original and exciting it just didn't let me go. Then there is the mass of academically award-winning people involved here as well as the academic command nominated director. You just can't miss. I think it's mid-night and you're not sleepy yet. This movie comes on. You see it and are shocked. It is so brilliant, so original it is so good. It will feel for you that half an hour later you have turned off the screen, but when you walk in your bed, you only see it 15 minutes after midnight. Enjoy !!! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10
