I didn't think Haggard was the funniest movie all the time, I like CKY and Viva La Bam much more. I think a lot of it was just really stupid and had no plot to be a movie. I strongly recommend not paying much money for this movie, but anyone who likes viva la bam, CKY or Jack Ass should watch it. I loved many parts of the movie and then there were parts that should have been cut out. I think Jonny Knoxville should have played in the movie because he is a much better actor, so most of the Haggard people and probably could have made this movie more fun. I think Ryan Dunn was probably the best actor and it should have had more skating.
