I had to suffer through this movie three times while I was a zombie extra in the director's new movie After Sundown. The first time I saw this movie, the instructor was standing next to me and a clearly fake and cheesy look pushed out of nothing and grabbed one of the characters. I couldn't take it any more, I started laughing right in front of the guy. The movie has no direction at all, and the only thing that could make this movie decent (Female Nudity) was nowhere to be found. I'm a fan of low budget horror movies, but it was just too much for me. The worst part was that I had to see it so many times. Don't expect the new movie to get better.
