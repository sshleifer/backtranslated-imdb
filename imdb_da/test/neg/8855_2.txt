Gritty drama? Emotionally strong? Blah! The BBC has lost a lot of time to masterful productions such as The Wire, Sopranos and Carnivale from HBO. Okay, so the budget can be much smaller, but "The Street" last night was badly acted, predictable, unrealistic, stereotypical, insensitive, and a great deal of time of fat. TV (British television) is not as good as it used to be and falls further and further behind the American productions. There was no sense of brutal violence from the local gangster. There was no sign that this man was "insane" enough to beat a man he has respected for so long. There was no remorse when he did, and it should not be the kind of character that would come down when Bob Hoskins called his son a pansy, in a play of 'courage'. <br /> <br /> I wish I was more eloquent to express my contempt for this show, but I am not, and although I cannot prove my point well enough, believe me when I say it was dirt, shock TV that doesn't give any real introspective perspective on life. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
