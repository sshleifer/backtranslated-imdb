Okay, I missed the first 15 minutes of the movie, so I missed credits and stuff. So when I finally got there, I was like "Who the hell is this guy?" I found out that it was Flex like hours after watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson. Not a bit. He could not dance like he or move as he, the only thing he almost had, was the voice. People commented on Elizabeth Taylor, but I can't really comment on that because I don't know much about her. <br /> <br /> The whole movie was just plain wack. The dialogue sucked. The camera - if it can be called it-sucked. The soundtrack sucked. The action sucked. Yes, even Flex ... I'm so sorry for myself. I didn't want it to suck. I'm so sad that Flex was told he can get away with it. But it all looked like dress-up. You know? It looks like no one looked as though they were supposed to except Joseph Jackson. <br /> <br /> The concert sequences just sucked. I'm sorry, but Flex just can't dance like Michael. I mean, who in hell was VH1 thinking? The makeup did not even match the time when Michael went through. For example, he was still dark in the movie when Neverland was raided the first time. In fact, MJ was white as hell. There was some kind of stupid delay in his discoloration. <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't boring, good for me it wasn't. It was nothing. I was just as sorry for everything that was wrong with it. I wanted to see how it turned out and if Flex could solve itself. He didn't really do it. The only part I found a little interesting was the whole Lisa Marie thing. When they fell in love. That was nice. But I had to turn my face away when they kissed. Heh. And only two parts made me fall with laughter. The first time, when they were hopping from Michael with short hair, you know the Thriller era for Michael with long flowing hair from the dangerous era, and he was still black! It was fun. The second time I laughed was when they showed all the posters and memorabilia of Michael, but they had Flex's face instead! It was so funny. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie was cheap waste. It was simply two hours of dress-up and could have been so much better. But no, VH1 is cheap. See if you want it. But this movie is not fun, considering the ridiculous of it. I came out to feel angry. And when I found out that it was Flex, I just started to feel so bad. So ... see if you want to.
