This is one of the worst cinema pieces I've seen for some time. This is also my first review so you can tell that I have to hate this movie a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't make me wrong, I like my serious movies. I don't like Hollywood too much, I tend to like French, Italian, offbeat us, or something trying to communicate something sensibly. <br /> <br /> But it was terrible. Why? 1. The plot (as it was) was absolutely incredible, even though the director seems to be hanging out on a sense of realism. <br /> <br /> 2. The protagonist has nothing to recommend him. Does he smoke for cold or show us his anxiety? For the sake of goodness, this guy must be an explosive mafia lawyer. Should we be more caring because he is also one of the best unfriendly people you could ever meet? And he smokes ... so he must have deep personal problems. Pop psychology is best. In the last few moments I almost cheered as he was buried in the cement. Best place for him. And I thought it was about the only good scene. Or maybe it was because it was so close to the final credits. <br /> <br /> 3. The completely tired and incredible interest of the protagonist of the beautiful girl. She was there simply because beautiful girls always have odd sexual relationships with old, old men with a deep and meaningful personality (as evidenced by smoking). Always happen. In really bad movies it is. <br /> <br /> 4. The pace was so read. I like slowly, I think carefully. But it was just fatal. <br /> <br /> 5-50 a bunch of other things that I really can't bother writing. <br /> <br /> Awful.
