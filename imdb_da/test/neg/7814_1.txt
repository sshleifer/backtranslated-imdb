This movie has to be about one of the worst I've ever seen. The humor was raw, hardly fun and heard a million times before. The start noted especially, and it got worse and worse as it went on. I got halfway through and couldn't stand to see more of it. Fortunately, I only saw it on TV, so it didn't cost anything, but I seriously recommend that you don't waste your time or your money. Nothing in the movie was new. The signs were not developed at all. In fact, I think it would have been better as a little kids movie because it was full of stupid unrealistic "funny" events that occur ... it's like what's happening in home alone or something. Not to mean being at home alone was in any way as terrible as this.
