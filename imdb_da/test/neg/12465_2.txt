The box for this movie was completely wrong. The deck shows a picture of legs and panties in a short skirt. The title is `Tart. 'Synopsis on the back of the box made it appear that Cat, the protagonist, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but that popularity led to a bizarre lifestyle she couldn't escape. Everything the box built up for this movie was a terrible lie. I was expecting some kind of crappy, direct-to-video version of `Heathers' aimed at teenagers today. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you what "Tart" really was about. Yes, this is really the plot; so if you do not want to know what happens then stop reading. We have an unlikely boring rich girl. This unlikely girl's best friend is a shank. The shank is expelled from the school, so the unlikely girl turns to a British girl. This leads to the unlikely girl who dates this boring guy who the box refers to as "most popular boy in school". If that guy was the most popular guy in their school, I wish I would have gone to this high school because I could have kicked the boy out of him. Anyway, as any movie will tell you, the most popular guy in school is always a killer or drug addict or thief, or in this case all of the above. Anyway, everyone stops suffering from the unlikely protagonist because she is Jewish. Then the most popular guy in school beats his best friend, the shank, with a stone, because the shank caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act. The unlikely girl's stoic mother and hypochondriac younger brother are there for her at the end. Oh, and the whole movie is about snotty rich kids and their terrible parents too. Give, what's wrong with that? It sounds like a great movie! That's what I thought. But you see, there are no similar signs in this movie. The main character is boring. The filmmakers made her average, while in the film she continues to tolerate what she is. The shank is not skanky enough and has little screen time. The popular guy is nothing to write home about. The popular girls are just your giant girls. There are no moral lessons. Kat, the boring protagonist, is not a freak, never becomes one of the really popular girls, and (worst of all) after all the crap she goes through, she believes she is still too good to be kind to the only girl the bad girl To be honest I have no idea why the movie is called Tart. I kept asking who's the pie? Is she the pie? Are they all pies? In 94 minutes, theoretically, not a long film. But after I actually looked at this horrible waste of a VHS tape and didn't know who the pie was, I was surprised that the movie was only an hour and a half. The film felt that it was two hours and some change. After a while I hoped the movie would be about pop tarts. In any case, when you look at a box of pop tarts, you know what to expect.
