I would feel this show so terrible if it wasn't for the fact that it is on the same network as Arrested Development. Because it is on FOX and is being renewed while AD was canceled. <br /> <br /> It is totally out of words how embarrassing this show is. But let me try and describe it. Take an extremely low rate of Archie Bunker and make him indulge in humor that would have been obsolete if it was on married to children. So take great plot lines from AD (son has a nasty, boring boyfriend) and stupid them down so idiots who watch sitcoms can understand them. <br /> <br /> If you see this, I will completely lose respect for you, just like your family. But if you're a fan, you should love FOX's new comedy 'To Death'. Looks like real fun, exciting things. I think married couples don't come together ... brilliant.
