When I saw it, I was ready to compose a blast, lambasting criticism of this "movie" (it's actually video), but then I saw that someone was already doing. I'm pretty much in agreement with him. But then again it looks like a lot of effort, and millions of lira went into it, so I'll probably give them a credit to try. But that means anyone who does not already know the Lovecraftian world and that this is what they were trying to convey will probably think ... well, I suppose it is not only really bad, but it does absolutely no sense. Thank God I read part of the other review ('twas a little gushy, maybe?), Which showed that this guy also did "The Shunned House" (which looked pretty bad from the DVD box), so now I can avoid it and save my mind from any further exposure to such shooting of HP's gloss Lovecraft.
