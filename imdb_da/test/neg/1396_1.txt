I haven't seen this show for months, but for a while I was forced to watch it every day because I had a roommate who liked it. So maybe it has been a significant improvement throughout that time, even though the advertisements and 4.2 rating on IMDb are not a good sign. It was clearly just a quick replacement for Chappelle's Show. Even Mencia says it. And while I wasn't even a big fan of Chappelle's Show, his jokes were at least original and clever (and far edgier than Mencia ever been). Mencia jokes are completely unoriginal and outdated. If you can't see it, I think there's no hope for you. But to be fair, here are some examples: <br /> <br /> --Mencia blatantly frightens Chapels Lil Jon shit. Just take it. <br /> <br /> - "South Park" is an episode on Scientology. A week later, Mencia has a joke on his show about how offensive he is to Scientologists. Remember joke is not about Scientologists, but about how much he has offended them on his show. So far, when he has made a single scienceology joke, ever. After Hurricane Katrina, two AP pictures go around the internet and show a black man "looting" groceries and a white woman "finding" them. A week later, after millions of people have already seen this, Mencia presents at his show as if he discovered it and it is shown for the first time (The Daily Show would have been on such a day). Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Even more annoying than joke stealing is the way Carlos has promoted himself and his show and claims he breaks down a kind of PC barrier (whatever) and that if you don't laugh, you have to Be a weak bride who can't handle any jokes about race. Yes, Carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we're too offended to laugh (if it really was true, why was Chappelle's Show so popular?). He constantly praises his audience for "not getting it" if he does not get enough laughs, and often repeats and explains his jokes, a technique that most comedians stop at 14 years. The worst part is that Mencia doesn't seem to be very intelligent. It's kind of tragic that there are dozens of more fun, more insightful comedians out there trying to do that while this guy rolls in money. His show is apparently the third highest rated on Comedy Central, which is enchanting (again, it has a 4.2 rating on this site). Where in hell do they get these numbers ?? Comedy Central tries to count itself as an "edgy" station, but as long as it tries to appeal to the stupid audience possible, it will never be the case.
