The scariest thing about this horror movie is that the end refers to a sequel. 'The Cave' is really a disappointing action movie. A team of cave and underwater scientists goes to Romania (one of those cheap places to make a movie, at least at least) and after a ruined church goes into a hole that turns out to be a wealth of underground monsters . Or are they demons? The film never decides whether it will be action, science fiction or horror, it is a mix of all without salt or fun and acted in a wood way. The best thing about the movie is cinematography, but even the dark landscape of the gravel soon becomes boring, because the film lacks pace, and the characters are simply not interesting. A waste of time.
