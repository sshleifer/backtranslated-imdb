This movie was the biggest piece of waste I've seen for a long time. <br /> <br /> It is marketed as Sci-Fi, as it is actually nothing more than a Christian recruitment tool. <br /> <br /> It tells you very little about the state of the Christian church when they have to resort to deception to make you listen to their sales increase. But then again, what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths that it helps protect such a large amount of child murderers in their organization. Religion is filled with nothing but sexual departures, hypocrites, and warriors. Let's not forget, our bumbling former president actually came out and said "God told him" to invade Iraq. And no question whether he heard voices or see things? <br /> <br /> Anyway, get started on the subject here. No, this movie has nothing to do with UFOs at all, it's no more than a religious production.
