With this film directed by Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino making the manuscript, I was sure this was going to be a gem. I was mistaken. I don't hate this movie, but I don't like it. <br /> <br /> I love Roger Avery because of his great direction in the attraction rules and his screens for pulp fiction and quiet hill, but he made a mistake doing this. I really need to comment on Tarantino, we all know hes a genius. <br /> <br /> This movie is just about a gang that robs a bank but fails because of stupid people participating in the robbery <br /> I'm disappointed with Tarantino and Avery for to make this movie, but do not change how amazing they both are. everyone makes mistakes ....... 3/10 ........... j.d Seaton
