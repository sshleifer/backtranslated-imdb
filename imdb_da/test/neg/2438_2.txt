Oh God. this was possibly the worst movie I've seen this year. I mean what can be done more with the old "woman in the man's body" story? it was full of clich√©s, for example the geek came into his own order, "the boy" got what comes to him, etc. I do not call these spoilers because someone could guess what happens !! All it went for was Laura Fraser, who gave an average performance. and as for the dream boy, it was the wettest piece of play ever. even the evil boys were immediately forgettable. <br /> <br /> horrible movie.
