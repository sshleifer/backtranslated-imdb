After growing up in western and considering the current lack of westerns on television and in the theater, I really looked forward to Commanche Moon. Having seen two nights and not another, it seems to have been shot on a tight budget. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones level stars are conspicuously absent. There is Val Kilmer, but what about him? Four or five buildings on both sides of the street, plus the Scull mansion, make up Austin city. The captain is never seen, only within the governor's office. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is often times hokey, meaningless walking. The baseline is uninhibited. Completely forgettable.
