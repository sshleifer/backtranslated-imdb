During the production, this LWT series entitled 'Rocket To The Moon' became a title that everyone at that time thought was cheesy enough. Then came a word that it had been retitled 'Reach for the Moon', as if this addition of this new word would elicit heavy metaphorical meanings involving the characters' relationships and aspirations. This same powerful lack of subtlety and understanding is evident throughout the whole series of the series, and the same tired and boring love triangle story is actually stretched beyond 7 episodes! Any television program that decides to use the 'love-triangle' storylin for even a single episode pushes it, but smearing it over seven episodes is unforgivable. However, there are reasons to look at, with the Isle of Wight's scenery surely giving a beautiful setting, and the seemingly effortless performance of Lynda Bellingham hits all the real comedy brands. However, this is not enough. A number of notions are noticeable, especially when placed against the static and numb wasteland that Jonathan Kerrigan refers to as his face. I have already mentioned Lynda Bellingham in the role of "pushy mother" (yes it is as much as character development and back-story goes), but I was impressed by the actor Maurice Roeves (who is by far the most experienced cast cast actor in everything from classic movies like Richard Attenborough's 'Oh What a Lovely War' and 'The Eagle Has Landed' and TV, including Baywatch, Holby City, The Bill, Eastenders, Cheers, Doctor Who in the 80s, Star Trek, and even goes to Hollywood with Sylvestor Stallone in 1995's Judge Dredd), whose performance reminded me a lot of the real teachers I have met - often incapacitated men whose lives are provided with a very boring touch. It is refreshing to see Roeves still working as he also appeared in the British film "The Acid House" in 1998 and even more recently with the wonderful Maria Bello and Sean Bean in 'The Dark'. Standout reason to see this series, though his appearance is very few. Another actor trying his hardest to raise the program is Ben Miles, in the role of the sex cat 'typical man' brother (once again, which original character!). As with Roeves, the CV says it all. After raising this, Miles has since been featured in the Hollywood movie "V for Vendetta" and the 2001-star studded movie 'The Affair of the Necklace' along with Brian Cox, Adrien Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce. Unfortunately, the righteous actors I have mentioned have dismissed relatively small roles in relation to the dramatic driftwood that is Kerrigan and Saira Todd, both of whom appear to have been in Casualty for too long and have not yet learned to act. Even the tolerable Frances Gray is made to suffer in the presence of such theatrical fetal mannequins, and for her, the enduring memory I have of her from the set, of AD has to ask for another slice of a relatively complex shot, because during Take, she unknowingly 'pulled her knickers out of her crack!'. Well-known faces appear in every episode - children's actors from CBBC programs and dramas such as "2 Point 4 Children" and other fixed from commercials such as Mr Ben's ("they will remember me for this"), Lynda 'Oxo lady' Bellingham, and others which I will not even remember. Every episode tries half-heartedly to "solve problems" like teenage pregnancy, disturbing students and rocket building (!) ... things that Grange Hill did better when my parents were young! Overall, this series was a disappointment and a wasted opportunity to make a really interesting and well-developed drama series. Unfortunately, they took them the easy way, both in the writing and (mostly) in the casting. I would recommend both 'Waterloo Road' and 'The Street' to fans of good drama - especially the latter who managed to accomplish this. If you like the Isle of Wight, don't 'reach the moon', reach the holiday brochure instead - it probably contains more character development!
