STAR RATING: ***** The works **** just miss the mark *** The little bit in between ** Lagging behind the * Gruber <br /> <br /> Based on another of Stephen King's long short stories, This takes place in the sleepy little New England-town Castle Rock (also the name of the film's production company!), Where a new antique shop, the title Needful Things, has been opened. The owner and proprietor, Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) hides, perhaps you say a devilish secret. There is a commodity in its shop that everyone in the small town wants - a small cash price in advance is first required before a much more ghastly price is requested. As a suspect hates and madness in the city apart, it falls to police officer Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) to restore order and save the city from a frightening end ... I read the Necessity Things earlier this year and was eager to Watch the movie adaptation again to compare them (as it would be any competition!) But it had been deleted on video and DVD and I couldn't find anywhere to rent it from. So I was happy when I finally found it in a flea market while I was on a shopping trip ... It is one of the cruel irons that king short stories are generally best to read, but when they are adapted to screen nine times out of ten they are complete junk, as is the case here. The material that makes his books big doesn't mean it's a good idea to translate into a movie script for some reason. And I suppose there is always the question: Why bother to see this when I could read the book again instead? <br /> <br /> I appreciate that some are simply too long (ie, the rack) to make a full screen work with all of the included situations and signs, but there is no reason why one could not include all material from the book. As a result, many key people from the book (ie Ace Merrill) are not included at all, and we have some terrible character development, which means we don't care about the characters involved as they are so removed by depth and motivation - for example, we have a sign from the book, Danforth Keaton, who kills his wife towards the end, but we were certainly not built up of hints for any reason that he did not come with or hate her, and then it has no one Influence when it happens, unlike in the book where there was much depth invested, and it really involved you to find out what happened to the characters involved. All the material in the manuscript to fill the cracks, if you want, is really stupid and corny and the typically crap things that are included in King's customizations like this. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie's issues are so far away from the book, but there are also some horrible actions from a roll that obviously can't feel the bad stuff they're being asked to perform. In the 90s, a lot of king's work began to jump over the cinema and was only made for television / video area. Rubbish like this should be sure why. **
