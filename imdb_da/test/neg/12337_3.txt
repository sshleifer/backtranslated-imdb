One real disappointment is that the novel is such a brilliant stomach-moving journey into madness, but it is made into television movie style, is tedious and painfully slow. Stick to Mike Hammer. I find it hard to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book, Kubrick beats it on the cover, he should have taken over his toes on it. Stacey Keach is too mushy like Lou Ford, and it all has the same production values ​​as the seventy-two television spin of Planet Of The Apes. I thoroughly recommend that you go out and buy lots of Jim Thompson novels though, in fact The Grifters is not done too badly, it's one of his, starring Jon Cusak.
