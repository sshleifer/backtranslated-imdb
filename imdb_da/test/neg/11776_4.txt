Given the topic of drug abuse Down to The Bone can hardly be a pretty depressing movie. But depressing need not necessarily mean bad. Unfortunately, it's really pretty bad. The movie has some good things going for it, especially Vera Farmiga's quality performance in Irene's central role, a working mother struggling with cocaine addiction. But there is not enough good here to offset the bad ones. The film's shortcomings lie mainly in history, which does not fail and never seems to get started. Irene goes to rehab and comes home to a clueless man who has no idea how to support her attempts to kick her habit. Irene grows close to another restorative abuser, a male nurse from her rehab center. Complications follow. But the story never sparks right to life. It doesn't look like the movie really goes anywhere. You can say that it is a sharp and realistic look at the daily struggle of an abuser. Maybe, but in this case it does not make an interesting movie. It all has a very "blah" feel to it. Minimalist cinematography does not help with anything, adding another layer of killing to the incredible killings. And none of the other performances measure up to Farmigas. Hugh Dillon is OK as Irene's male nurse friend, but no one else in the cast adds anything of value to the case. All in all, this movie is a gloomy, depressing and rather boring trip.
