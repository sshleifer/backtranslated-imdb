Disappointing comedy drama with sentimental coating, Michael J. Fox has ideally cast as a former child star, now running a thespian tots talent agency; Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper are his assistants. All this sounds like it can't be missed, but too much of the scenario is surrendered to stride Christina Vidal as a streetwise man who Fox thinks will be the next big thing. They quickly lock lock heads, and the handling dialogue takes them back and forth to an uninteresting formula form. Fox and Lane are both appealing, but the energy of the early scenes allows to treacle. Slickly produced, but ultimately outdated. * 1/2 from ****
