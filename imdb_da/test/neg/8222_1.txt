Wave after wave of effortless nausea - this movie wants and initially promises to be quirky and original, but is actually obvious, solipsist and mired in clich√©-driven dialogue that builds on a crecendo of horror and cheese at the end. Throughout the film, we seem to face off-the-wall characters that are actually very boring and just don't quite work and as a clunk through the horrible manuscript of men in armor suits, driving jeeps through mansions and spouting preppy existential openness accompanied by whinings of Coldplay. The movie occasionally has funny episodes, which are often not more fun than a dog playing with its genitals, which happened twice (an index of slapstick, the film's rudimentary humor in general), but in the end the film falls into an "infinite abyss" of completely detritus and the director's egocentric ramblings that made me grab my eyes. Watch this movie at your peril.
