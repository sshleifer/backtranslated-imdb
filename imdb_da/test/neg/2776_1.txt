In the Muslim country Khalid (fictitious), his benevolent leader / dictator, Reed Hadley dies as Amir, of cancer. Amir dies and a desperate plot unfolds. His body is wrapped in aluminum foil and taken in a secret operation (the population does not know of his death), consisting of his doctor (Nigserian) and Mohammed, out of the country to perform a risky brain transplant. The operation is performed by the infamous Dr. Kent Taylor believes there is no chance of failure and has two assistants. One of them is about 3 feet tall (Master Blaster actually bore Barter Town) and the other is a mutilated and traumatized 7 foot giant called Gor. What could possibly go wrong? <br /> <br /> I forgot to mention Amir's deathbed American, blonde-Barbie wife, Tracy or Dr. Kent has a dungeon with female slave trialists and delusions? What about a brain transplant that didn't take? There is a lot of double trade in all this and people are killed, but I will no longer lie to you: MISSION CONNECTED. The ends justify the funds. If you can accept it, you don't have to waste 80 minutes. I hope it's warning enough. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you have to look, do not look alone and have plenty of medicine that stands by. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
