Why bother watching this movie? It is probably considering a price to be the worst career movement of a big movie star since Clark Gables' ridiculous game of an Irish patriot in Parnell. It is unthinkable that Bergman would choose both this movie and its director over a lucrative Hollywood career where she could choose among the finest scripts and directors offered at that time. At first, there was no script to work with except a few notes. Then we believe in the polished Bergman as a poor refugee who is willing to do anything to be released from a refugee camp, including marriage to a poor Italian fisherman she doesn't even love. I read where Anna Magnani was the original choice for this part. If so, it made much more sense than throwing the luminous Bergman into such a proletarian part. But since she was in love with her instructor, common sense flew out of the window. <br /> <br /> So she goes to live in this poor village, where the men have to manage to extract a skinny living from the sea. A place she naturally hates to be and where she doesn't fit. <br /> <br /> Her only friend is the village priest who knows that she is not fit for the life of a poor fisherman, but tells her that the love of love must suppress her true feelings of disgust and accept that poverty and despair, she meets every day. On top of all this, this volcano is always on the verge of eruptions and drowning them all in hot lava. But as a true heroine, Bergman rages against his misery by declaring war on almost everyone else in this sad movie. She even goes as far as trying to seduce the village priest in a scene that would generate laughter if it wasn't so pathetic. When her bad slob of a man has to lock her in a room to prevent her from running away, she is forced to use her body to bribe a married man to take her out of the island. For her, no sacrifice is too great; no man inaccessible if he is willing to help her escape the island and her misery. I won't bother telling you how all this ends. The end-of-script movie is just as plausible as the rest of STROMBOLI. I even remember (from seeing it on television) that it had two different endings! Then warn you if you should feel brave enough to sit through this royal turkey and catch up with Bergman. It led to her downfall in Hollywood for the next seven years, and she was sentenced to sleep with her instructor while still married to Peter Lindstrom. None of the films she made with this instructor (which she later married) are remarkable, except as evidence of a career that has gone berserk. I'm not asking you. It's pretty embarrassing. <br /> <br /> - - SoundTrack
