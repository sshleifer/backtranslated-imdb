How anyone can praise this raw film version after seeing the wonderful WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, is without understanding. MAE CLARKE's Myra is far from the role that VIVIEN LEIGH plays in remake. She plays a common American girl with a Brooklyn accent, and the "Yes" answers are a little devastating when one expects a less coarse character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in final credits as KENT DOUGLASS) is very unlikely since a soldier merged with her no matter how many times she lets him fall. BETTE DAVIS has no role in part. <br /> <br /> Their melodramatic confrontations over the last 20 minutes of the movie are convincing (extravagant bits overactive) - even though this is a commodity version of the story when the sound was just a few years old and silent plays were still rage. Just awful. And it ends up with Clarke losing his life during a bombing on the bridge. The end. <br /> <br /> It has none of the beautifully shady performances of the 1940 MGM remake, including a sterling support. Instead, this is fitted with low budget production values ​​(and I mean a shoe-string budget) without any subtlety at all. And there is no pre-code braveness in the scene where Myra tells the aristocratic lady why she must not marry her son, Roy. She simply says, "I picked him up at Waterloo Bridge." Explanation above. Nothing bold there. <br/> <br /> Summary: Once, the original is not the best version in any way. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR have never been surpassed as Myra and Roy in the offering, exquisitely listed 1940 film classic.
