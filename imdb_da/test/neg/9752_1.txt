'Get Fame' and 'You've Been Served' and roughly picked them up and what have you got? This God horrible movie tailored to stupid-normal youth. The reason follows very carefully 'You have been served.' Three ghetto afro teeners, this time residing in John Water's Baltimore ?? not far from 'Peckers' home ?? spend their time getting failing grades in high school and dancing in overdue 100-year-old buildings with hoochy-mamas. To fund their expensive baggy hip-hop clothes, do they steal cars and deliver them to the local bitch shop? Not unlike John (Tony Manaro) Travolta who worked in a Brooklyn paint shop so he could buy his polyester disco clothes. /> <br /> Tyler Gage, one of the black three musketeers, is captured on Sunday by the local Fame High School and is forced to perform duty duties. He meets Nora Clark, a 26-year-old white high school student, and discovers that he is Irish-American, much to the chagrin of his black friends Mac and Skinny. As in 'You have been served' Crime does not pay, and Skinny, the youngest member of the trio is shot by a Bad Bad Leroy Brown type, but it does not stop the music and the cardiac arrest.
