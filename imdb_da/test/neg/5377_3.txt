I'm pretty much a sucker for those Ghost Hunter shows. From the Cheesy mockumentaries that Discovery Channel's "The Haunting" to Scooby Doo Reality appears as "Ghost Hunters". When I was promoted to A & E's "Paranormal State", I knew I should see. Especially when "Paranormal State" was equated with a weak Monday night football game. <br /> <br /> At the end of the "Paranormal State" pilot, when the main "character" of this reality dance macabre gives an eerie child a bottle of Max Von Sydow Holy Water and calms him by telling this boy, that he also had an unspecified bad experience as a child with things that "came out of the closet" and the catholic church gave him a holy water to ward off the things coming out of the wardrobe I knew I should have given Monday night football another shot. <br /> <br /> Shtick behind "Paranormal State" is a group of Penn State students all together and started their own Ghost Hunting Club. Or community. Or Super Adventure Club. And they run around in Pennsylvania to investigate the most horrible hauntings and the lost plot of a M. Night Shymalan Movie. <br /> <br /> "They" are kind of misleading. Really paranormal state is about a Nittany Lion named Ryan Buell, who is likely to run Penn State's annual Anime Convention if it wasn't for this show. He is often accompanied by "surveys" of hot co-eds and some other people seen in the credits, but rarely caught on the camera. Hey, are they ghosts too? <br /> <br /> This is Ryan Buell's show. Paranormal state is his "vehicle" that we like to say in Biz. And, what a boring trip in a vehicle he can be. <br /> <br /> Have I mentioned Ryan telling the entire episode of Paranormal State in a star date-less "director's log" voice over? Almost immediately it becomes annoying, because the obvious intention is to give Ryse's ghost a lot of gravitas, but his filtered monotone does nothing but provokes grunts and laughs. Any serious intonation sounds like the radio chatter from a Call of Duty video game. <br /> <br /> "Surveys" - the plot on which each episode revolves - is interesting on the surface. No haunted inns or restaurants can be found in "Paranormal State". This is a show about fearing the unknown as a good Catholic boy and by God they give you things to fear. <br /> <br /> Small children are harassed, things awaken in the dark, voices call alive to kill, and the aleister loads in me rubbing my hands. Of the two episodes, I saw every round of violent, unpleasant haunts tied to violent, unpleasant deaths. <br /> <br /> Maybe. <br /> <br /> Maybe not. <br /> <br /> Everything in "Paranormal State" is brief for half an hour, "Dog the Bounty - Ghost," blocks. Every time there is an interesting, controllable evidence reduction - the murder of a family in a 19th century farm - the evidence in front of the viewer moves as a designer trying to convince you of a stack of papers currently under your nose is a proof that ten million come from Nigeria and then moved away before you can get a good gander. <br /> <br /> At least with the Sci-Fi Channel's "Ghost Hunters" there is a slightly over-exhausting need to expel all sorts of evidence and present it to the viewer. EVPs that could be rat fish, cold spots in a draft house and "orbs," as even Ghost Hunters' self discounts as dust. It's a kind of Scooby Doo-like approach that makes "Ghost Hunters" ... almost credible. <br /> <br /> While "Paranormal State" claims to have EVPs, the viewer gives a ten second video clip of a wave file in the Garage Band without sound. Yes, see, an EVP, right? People claim to see dark numbers in the basement ... Well, let's just go see it ... while leaving the night vision camera on an exciting stationary shot in the living room. Ryan, the pristine leader of this pack of Penn State Graduates, claims to see "visions" of a demon name he knows, and it may be involved in a paranormal ghost ... But he can't tell us, the audience or his team of gothed out undergrow, because ... He can't. You never say a demon's name out loud, Ryan informs the wide eye Co-Ed who dares to ask. <br /> <br /> Well, how very handy for you. Especially since this is a television show where the audience cannot read your mind. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal State" is all the Turn and No Prestige. The audience is told what is likely to happen, but you never see an ounce of evidence that the eerie child sees dead people. Not even the grained video of a chair moves, or a black blob runs between prison cells. Nothing. You've just been told what happened to Ryan in another mechanical voice over. <br /> <br /> If you want to try to joke me, dress it up a little. If you try to swing me, show me an orb or a blob and get the cool chick working days at Hot Topic, tell me why the black orb really is the spirit of an ax killer. And if you want me to see a ghost hunting show, give me something besides running out Lorraine Warren in the second episode. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal State" is a weak sauce. Not really worth seeing unless you have a hard time watching TV or just having a DVD collection. Or unless you want to know what really happened in that cabinet with the Holy Water.
