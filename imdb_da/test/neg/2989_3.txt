I have seen comments from Turkish people (which I don't) say that this movie is amazing and correctly portrays Turkish life. All I have to say is ... Turkey must be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world because, in my opinion, that is what this film was for me. If I was Turkish, I think it would have had a bigger impact. But if you are not from Turkey, I would advise you not to waste two hours in your life on this. <br /> <br /> "Remove" seems to be on forever. Many scenes are meticulously long with little or no purpose. I do not understand the director's goals in even including many of the scenes. It is pointed out that the director used his own car, apartment and friends to make the movie ... Well guess what? It shows. It looks low budget. The action is bad. If it's a cultural thing then be it. I just don't understand the purpose of basing a movie on this story. It's incredibly boring.
