Wow ... not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I can't believe people are digging this garbage can. Most of the TV shows are pretty bad, and it has been an ongoing trend for some time now - they just get worse, but Las Vegas is definitely going home. What a terrible show ... The actors are a bunch of C ++ losers who have never been anywhere (except James Caan ... who knows what he was thinking when he logged into this position) so it's not theirs sake, this show sucks. They just can't help it. Blame the producers and the authors. I can't believe they shot this and were actually proud of their work to fly it.
