Use your time otherwise, even housework is better than this movie. The jokes are not fun, the funny rhymes that are Dr. Seus is not there. A very miserable way to waste an evening. My kids 4-16 laugh a little at the beginning the younger ones got bored and left playing Barbies and the elderly back to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and made dishes. So I finished it alone. It was the worst "kids" movie I've seen. To watch a fun kids movie watch Shrek 2, the movie is fun for kids and their parents. AVOID THIS MOVIE. It's not fun, isn't sweet, cat's makeup is all about the only good thing in it, and you can see it on the counter label.
