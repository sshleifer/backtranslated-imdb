Give director Stanley Tong of Jackie Chans Super Cop and Rumble in the Bronx and what do you get? You get a number of Kung Fu games and a lack of Magoo-like madness. <br /> <br /> The limited plot has Magoo (Leslie Nielsen) put on an international plot, stealing a world-famous gem. Of course, he has no idea what he is doing. In fact, he has no idea that he had the pearl. <br /> <br /> Within thirty minutes you may be very sorry to see this. There are some very fun moments, but like when he makes the chicken. You want you to be as short-sighted as Magoo. It's a fun movie to watch, but it's a disaster! You must love Leslie Nielson because he was making some very funny movies. This is not his best, but he does a good job Magoo. I thought it was a fun movie, and it should be recommended for young children because they will probably think it is a lot of fun.
