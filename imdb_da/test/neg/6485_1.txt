I bought this 'movie' from a gas station in the 3.99 tray for a reason: Billy Drago, one of my favorite actors. He is incredibly scary and good, but this is where it stops. The film itself is a dirt cheap, gracefully horrible attempt at a horror of Western, nor does it control anything if a successful fusion of the two genres fails. The actor besides Dragos is so bad, I wanted to put the couch in my ears, the production values ​​are non-existent, and I don't even know where to start the script. <br /> <br /> Avoid at all costs unless you are a dead hard Drago fan like me. <br /> <br /> Terrible, shameful, unforgivable.
