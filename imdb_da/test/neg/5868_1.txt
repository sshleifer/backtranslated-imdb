This abomination and successor A MORE TIME (no thank you) and the hideous Jerry Lewis disasters that do not touch BRIDGE LOWER WATER (why not just flush instead) drove cinema owners to close their doors instead of being forced to run these movies . True: in the 60's block booking of movies was still enforced on inappropriate suburbs and land biographers ... that means to get a good movie, the cinema was forced to run illegal timewasters like these: I remember well in 1974, anxious after the screen FIDDLER ON THE ROOF or something good, I was bailed up in United Artists' booking office by some sozzled salesmen waving a flat doll in front of me and skating: "Now before we get to one, you see yourself first" . which basically means "book these duds and we will give you a tired hit". Such is why so many cinemas closed, forced to screen and annoy their diminishing audience with these assembly line errors with lame comedians and boring talent. Cinema owners, exhausted with argumentation simply closed, sold to a gas station and saw the cinema demolished. These days, the same type of movie (eg: I NOW FUNKS YOU CHUCK AND LARRY) is banished to 20-seater cinema 99 in a mega google plex instead. Not much has changed. FREDDY GOT FINGERED ... anyone?
