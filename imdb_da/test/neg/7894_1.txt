With horrible movies as if you were even considering doing so, it is very easy to see why Hollywood is in such serious trouble with bad plots and worse remakes all the time. I suppose the viewer is supposed to laugh their back ends beyond the 'black' jokes, 'pimped up' and 'bling'. It's so amazing "over the top" and so bad that it's just "so bad, it's fun again", the mark and has fallen all the way into "all embarrassing for everyone involved". <br /> <br /> I'm very, very sorry every single minute I wasted on this one. I want my time back! <br /> <br /> Save yourself the pain, DO NOT see this. The only reason to give 1 point in the assessment is that 0 was not an option.
