Leslie Nielsen hits the rock bottom with this horrible comedy, which is the worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. There is nothing to like about this movie, as it is essentially a one-joke movie, and joke is not that fun. How many times do we laugh at an almost blind man who fools himself? It's not fun, it's just pathetic. Nielsen must seriously begin to deny some of these pathetic scripts, and Stanley Tong must stick to making Jackie Chan films because it doesn't get much worse than this.
