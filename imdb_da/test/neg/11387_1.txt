First, the premise stinks ... little boy likes to dress in girls clothes. It reminded me of Norman Bates in PSYCHO or Ed Wood in ED WOOD. The wit is lame and old. You've seen them in a dozen and 60's movies. The whole cast is wasted. I bet people are signed up to be in a Shirley MacLaine vehicle. Please, would anyone tell Shirley that she made her best comedy in TO MULES FOR SISTER SARA. See it ... if there is no subject for Andy Griffith.
