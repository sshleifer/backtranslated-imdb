I happened to watch this movie on a flight from Paris to Boston, and it reminded me of the food on the plane: generic, tasteless and unclear. The French cinema seems to have lost its foot these days, and this is a good example of how a modley script can spill brilliant actors. While some might find the script's "legend" to be in line with the dictates of Euro postmodernism, the whole project looks like a post mortem about the Euro-bio's golden years of death and truly amazing talents --- one is vaguely reminded of Bunuel but without charm or joke.
