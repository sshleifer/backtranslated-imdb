Ugly women-of-the-cellblock flick rakes bound by midnight movie barrel that combines pulpy sleaze with the highest of girls-in-the-shower cliches. Linda Blair plays an innocent sent to prison (we learn offhandedly she was involved in driving over a guy with her car) who is hard at the Big House with some of the nastiest signs on this side of a Russ Meyer image. Blair is constantly pawed on, stopped, raped, humiliated and harassed. The dialogue is four letter words disgusting all the way through, and the girl does not easily give up from his barriers of violence and stupidity. But some viewers see this as a camp classic, but perhaps the tongue is not far enough in the cheek. * from ****
