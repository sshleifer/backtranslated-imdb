This movie was embarrassed. Ulma Thurman looked as if she had some form of illness, and John Travolta looked as if he was asleep. I expected this to be such a sequel to getting Shorty not a half-baked remake of the exact same movie (except that some of the characters have different names and clothes) <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this for movies to my worst enemy. I feel like I was ripped off and Hollywood has again fooled me into seeing another horrible sequel (I also suffered through Alien vs. Predator). The best thing I can say about this movie is that it has my voice for the worst movie in 2005!
