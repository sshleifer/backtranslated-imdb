Don't believe this, but when the credits for this movie rolled, I looked for the instructor's name. When I saw it, I burned it in my memory and I never forgot it. This film is beyond horrible. This makes Ed Wood's film look like Orsen Welles. At least B movies are entertaining, it was an experience of the soul. The quality was so poor I started to wonder who allowed this to happen. <br /> <br /> I hear Uwe Ball runs fourteen miles a day. That's because where his movies are seen, the people must drive him out of town with flame and pitchfork. The script was terrible, the lighting was like a high school football match, and the cinematography was just above the quality of Roger Patterson's Bigfoot video. The action was executed by people too ashamed of the production to say their lines with some credibility. In the end, a movie Alan Smithee would not have put his name on. I learned the day to avoid any movie of this man despite the circumstances. From what I hear, it's not a bad thing to do.
