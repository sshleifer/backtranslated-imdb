I usually spend just as much time writing my reviews when I watch the movie, but with Today You Die I think it would be a criminal game in my time. So here's a five minute rant about how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There was a time in the mid 80's when a single glance from Steven Seagal was enough to crack your ribs; a full on scowl could knock you off your feet. If he actually got hold of you, he would snatch you like a twig. These days, even though he is still able to do significant damage, he no longer sees that part. He's gone to seed and just doesn't know when to call it, ends. He goes as he is dumped in his pants, but somehow he manages to see the constipation and he has emphasized. His trademark long ponytail has passed, but his hair is still stupid. How this man continues to work in the film industry is beyond me. Today you are the usual Seagal mix of bone battles, car accidents, gun battles and pyrotechnics. Seagal mumbles through the boring script and delivers its lines of zero enthusiasm or credibility. In this triple action flip, he plays Harlan Banks a thief who tries to go straight, who is confused in joining a $ 20,000,000 robbery. He gets trapped, imprisoned, escapes and seeks revenge. Yawn. <br /> <br /> There are some really good car and gun battles that cross the boring stuff (much of it), but reading other comments on IMDb has shown that these were actually borrowed from other better movies. Seagal is also body-doubled a terrible mass in it. Seagal turns in one of the most horrible performances in his career, and that says something, considering the miserable "actor" in some of his recent efforts. Most hilarious is his utterly embarrassing attempt at Ebonics (African American street snake). "I mean man, for 'sho'? No, actually Steven, you sound like an ass! With a ridiculous script and plot lines that go nowhere, this movie is a waste of time, money and effort. And the last moment, where Harlan Banks stores an orphanage from closure is enough to make you blow lumps. <br /> <br /> Damn, I looked right at the clock, I enjoy blowing this steaming pile of drunk as much as I went well above my five minutes, it's time to write this comment and see something decent.
