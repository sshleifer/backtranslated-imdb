Tom is entering a delicious Jerry sandwich when a large bird of prey flies down and flies with his snack. At all happy to have his sarnie stolen right under his nose, Tom takes out the pursuit, determined to retrieve his mousy meat. <br /> <br /> As much as I love Tom and Jerry, I think this is a bit of a stinker: the story is pretty mundane; it introduces a poorly thought out peripheral character that lacks charm; and the old 'dress' cartoon character appears like a woman's hubby to death. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, 'Flirty Birdy' competes 'Fraidy Cat' and 'Mouse in Manhattan' for the title of weakest tom and jerry caper so far.
