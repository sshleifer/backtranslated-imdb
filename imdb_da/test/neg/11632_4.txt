Some changes for the better (special effects are more elaborate), some to worse (Scott Grimes, one resembling child in the original, has become a creepy teenager), but generally this sequel is roughly in line with the original - which doesn't say much. The PG-13 rating is questionable; Although the film is not scary at all, there is something short but quite explicit, and something out of place nudity. (* 1/2)
