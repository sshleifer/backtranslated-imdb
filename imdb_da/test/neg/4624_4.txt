This movie started with a promise: big name, great looks, but then it fell apart. <br /> <br /> Most of the time, it can't tell if it's a serious movie or a comedy. In one minute they talk about how there is no joy in killing, and the next there is a fighting situation that is set to fun music and fun shame. Part of the play is pretty bad, mainly from Patrick Swayze and Piper Perabo. She also gets some groan lines like: "When I marry, it will be about love." Ugh. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring. Not enough action, not enough humor, not enough plot, not much of a thing really. Just a lot of clich√©s and osteic moments. A movie with "Dragon" in the title must contain a lot more dragons than the few (and pathetic CGI dragons) that appeared in this movie. <br /> Can't SciFi channel show * any * good movie?
