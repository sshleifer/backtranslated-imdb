Produced by Nott Entertainment, this movie is "nott" very good at all. I sat through the first 15 minutes of the movie before judging that the play is bad, the casting is bad and the camera work is bad. When I hear that there is a download of this movie floating around the Internet, it is "nott," even worth the bandwidth. <br /> <br /> Until the time I wrote this review, the average for this movie was an 8.5, which made me see it, and there was an average large majority of 10's for it, of course, voted by liars and shills. This movie is "nott" for everyone. Or parents, if you want to punish your kids with this horrible movie, they have to sit through this for Halloween.
