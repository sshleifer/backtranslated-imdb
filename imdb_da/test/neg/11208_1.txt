For many years I saw this movie as a real movie of ninjas, but after studying more about this culture, I can only believe it is just another karate movie. A black shinobi and some weapons don't make a ninja, it's much more than that. Ninja is the most dangerous warrior in Japan because they are educated in every aspect of life to survive for anything and kill whatever it is that is trying to stop them. This movie is not about a ninja warrior, just about a clown trying to be something he can't even understand.
