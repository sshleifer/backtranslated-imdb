I hesitated to watch this movie when I really enjoyed the original, 'Mostly Martha'. What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress, but it was not her movie. The original had exciting moments, perfectly played with an incredible soundtrack. No reservations never felt connected. The food, the signs - nothing felt passionate. Mostly Martha became the food alive - every scene was filmed in such a way that you could taste it with your eyes - the scent, the textures. The food in 'No Reservations' was in the background - rarely did we get a close up of the preparation; The characters weren't right enough to carry the movie without it. It was hard to finish the movie - many of the scenes felt awkward. Watch the original - it's a really funny movie; the soundtrack incredible.
