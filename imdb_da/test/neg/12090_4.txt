I wanted to like this - the situation was rich and the setting unusual and interesting. But the story is flooded with childish gothic romance elements that are hard to swallow. The director has been unfairly harmed by the 'goy' characters - content to allow them to be grotesque caricatures - and inexplicably indulging in heroin's homosexual behavior. The potentially interesting power struggle between inventor and governor is not really addressed. <br /> <br /> Feminist filmmakers will gain more credibility when they stop manipulating situations to throw all the sympathy into the heroine and start acting honestly with problems. This movie looks more like 'The 7 Pieces of Gold', another serious failure, more than 'The Piano' - a true passion story.
