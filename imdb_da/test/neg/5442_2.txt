A group of people go deep into the jungle for various reasons and finally find a lost city (where apparently King Solomon's Diamonds are) and a race of supergorgillas ... Now you know you're having trouble when you're fine actors like Linney and Curry in a movie that stars ... a talking gorilla, and that's just the beginning. Okay, what more ...? <br /> <br /> For an action / adventure movie, the movie is ... and just missing it. The first hour (!) Of the movie they are not even in the jungle, just trying to get there, with subplot after subplot (something about a local military regime, anyway) and when they finally do it ... it's just not fun more. <br /> <br /> The effect of the movie is only so-and-so (and really bad compared to the previous Jurassic Park movie). <br /> <br /> Now ends ... The father doesn't care about his son's death but is just interested in the diamonds? Uh-huh ... only in the film's people, only in the movies. A complete waste of talent, this Chricton (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER) adaptation. 10.2.
