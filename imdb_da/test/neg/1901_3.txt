Sorry, that was a bad excuse for a movie. A plot line so holey it looked like a block of Swiss cheese and a kind of sign that seemed to me to be completely devoid of interpersonal relationships. Well except of course for Carlyle and Lee-Miller, whom I could have sworn, was supposed to be in love. Unlike the association of Tyler and Miller, who for the most part were like the rest of the film was totally unconvincing. Although the end product was unbelievable and fun for all the wrong reasons, the production values ​​were high and deserved some acknowledgments .. but unfortunately the end result was nonsense. what were all involved in thinking ..? they should definitely have packed up early on this one.
