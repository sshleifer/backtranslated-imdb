After seeing this show a few times; I am thoroughly offended as a woman that there are so many stupid women out there who fall for this fog. I'm a little more mature than some of the "players" in this show, but are still appalled that the entire dating game has been boiled down to a game show: where dudes can score points on their lame ass trying to collect chickens. If young guys see it here and use it as a learning manual: Don't !!! Save yourself the effort and hire a prostitute if all you are after is a piece of ass. Maybe there are girls out there with the same mind set, but some how I don't believe it.
