This hardly compares to the fairy tale of the place in its time. They are Star Wars and Star Trek. And while I'm not a fan of Star Trek, I recognize that this movie pales over the series Trekkies oozes over. In fact, I will place back to the future in better light with regard to space and travel. The story is a boy who is trapped by spacecraft (pirates). In a blatantly false and unremitting battle, the captured boy is a friend of the pirates and even helps them. And slowly, one by one, they kill the raiders. Eventually the boy comes home and the last remaining pirates escape the wound seriously. <br /> <br /> The action wasn't that great. But what is really obvious is the overall lack of interesting dialogue, effects and history. How they even got 80 minutes of this is beyond me. <br /> <br /> If you want to take a shot at it because it involves space, move on. But be warned. "D"
