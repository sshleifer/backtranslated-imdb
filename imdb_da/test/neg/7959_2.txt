I'm a big fan of Deepa Mehta's work, especially Fire and Earth 1947. Unfortunately, this movie of her _all_ lacks what is needed for a good movie. The film is trying to show the widow's situation in India in the early 20th century and the new wave of ideas about their rehabilitation around the same time. Shown with a children's widow as a key sign, although the plot is too banal from an Indian point of view, it could still have been a very powerful movie. Alas! The film lacked both the sensitivity of the fire and the intensity of emotions in the ground in 1947. Although one assumes that the story is a given, although there are hundreds of things I would have liked differently in what Now the film production is particularly unfortunate. Everything is said. Everything is shown right. Absence of sensitive implied sentences. Absence of things that are not exposed. I just couldn't believe this was a Deepa Mehta movie. There were some very standard Hindi movie characters - like an old widow with his own interests or a father who has double standards of highest quality. Can't write a script without having these old Indian movie characters in old style? <br /> <br /> Many people praised Deepa for making a movie and proving a point against Hindu fundamentalists. Well, I agree that she took a bold step, but shouldn't you worry about the quality of the movie, or is it a controversial one end in itself? It is obvious that if you start with a story like in water, you will end up feeling the pain of the widows in consideration --- It does not take a completed director to achieve it. And the movie had nothing more than that !! So where is Deepa's contribution to the movie? <br /> <br /> And talk about shopping, etc. - Pathetic !!! Lisa Ray has a beautiful face, an extremely beautiful face - but that's where it ends. She can't speak Hindi; she can't emote. John Abraham is no better. Most widows seem unnatural. The saving grace is Seema Biswas and the young girl. They are fabulous. <br /> <br /> And it was a period movie - but the Hindu dialogue sucks great time. Even there is pronunciation as unnatural as it gets. No rustic accents !!! No local snakes. No, nothing. The only real thing was probably the shooting spots. I thought the vidhwa ashram seat was reasonably real. The overall blue mark throughout the film is also suitable. <br /> <br /> But don't watch this movie. You won't get anything. There is nothing in the story or the direction. To see it, see it for the little girl's play.
