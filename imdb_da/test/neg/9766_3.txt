I don't care what anyone says this movie is fun! It combines the bleak gravity of the thread with an anarchic blend of alternative comedy, and the results are a seriously dark but outrageously fun satire on the Brinkmanship policies for both Western and Eastern blocks at that time. You have to give the filmmakers the credit for trying to overcome the true lifelessness of "Duck and cover" or "Protect and survive"! <br /> <br /> Imagine somebody making a movie based on Dead Kennedy's track 'Kinky Sex Make the World Go Around' and you're pretty close to Whoops! Judgment. Add Rik Mayall on top form as an insane OTT SAS commander, and you've got it exactly. A worthy companion to Dr. Strangelove, and that says something.
