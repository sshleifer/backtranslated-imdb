New Year 2006, and I look again at Glimmer Man. Say what you like, I find Steven Seagal's movie entertaining. Like many comments, good fighting sequences - I especially liked answering the phone at the restaurant and saying how long it would be closed for restoration. A bit like Schwarzenegger's humor in the earlier action films - though it used to be self-deterrent. <br /> <br /> But here I am Brian Cox. One of the most versatile players around. Pity on his hand and foot, but so much to withstand extended interrogation - must have flung that class on the "farm". <br /> <br /> When the movies went on, I was only wondering how Seagal's thickening circumference has affected his movement? Never mind it's entertainment!
