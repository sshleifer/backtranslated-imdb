I know many people would claim some movies as "worst of all times", but I think Redneck invokes this award. A combination of quite awful action by both Mark Lester and Telly Savales and plot progression that speak faith. <br /> <br /> At Telly Saveles: Was he full when he acted here? He seems to be playing a slurry, laughing grinning without feeling of conviction. Maybe he mixed his medicine with his whiskey, I don't know. <br /> <br /> At Mark Lester: A performance more wood than a carpenter's workshop. His cut British tones do not belong in this movie; and his conversion from protected teenager to gangster's apprentice in 24 hours is sour. And the striping scene with Mosquito has no relevance to the plot at all; Maybe the director likes this kind of thing. Plot logic: When Memphis and Mosquito back the car at first, why doesn't Mark Lester's mother or say anything to get her son out of the car before loonies drive it out? She just lets them go without saying a word !! On the other hand, Redneck must be seen - you will not believe how bad it is otherwise!
