This was a very short episode that appeared in one of the "Night Gallery" show in 1971. The episode star Sue Lyon (by Lolita movie fame) and Joseph Campanella, playing a baby sitter and a vampire, respectively. The vampire hires a baby sitter to watch his child (who seems to be a kind of werewolf or monster) as he goes out at night for blood. Childcare is completely unaware of the vampire's appearance when she first sees him and only starts putting two and two together when she notices that he has no reflection in the mirror, has a strange collection of books in the library of the occult, and hears strange sounds while the vampire goes to talk to the child. She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was. She bends out the door, the vampire comes out and looks confused, and the episode is over. I don't know what purpose it was to make such a shortened episode that lasted only 5 minutes. They should have just extended the previous episode with the same 5 minutes and skipped it. A total wasted effort.
