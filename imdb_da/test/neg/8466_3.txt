- Includes 1 spoiler, market with: ***** - <br /> Not presenting itself as yet another remake of the "Interview", Five Fingers is actually. Unfortunately, in addition to perhaps the contradiction with physical torture, it adds something that is the predecessor's performance in terms of excitement, plot, or performance. In fact, Five Fingers never reach anywhere near its level. <br /> <br /> What I thought to be particularly painful to see was not the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) carried out his trial. For me, it seemed that Philippe was trying too hard to get his accent right, and that made his performance smooth amateur, who in turn even slammed the notion of an otherwise great Colm Meaney. Phillipe's accent btw, far from anything near Dutch, sounded more like Eastern European. <br /> <br /> In addition to Philippi's play (which, to my surprise, turned from poor to actually decent towards the end), there are questions about flashbacks with the chopped Dutch nature. (If these scenes were set in Switzerland, they would have had cast cheese on mountain tops with endless pastures with grazing cows wearing expensive watches). Landscape aside, The way these flashbacks pushed the plot did not work for me at all. It made it served as french fries at a driveway and caused the buildup of voltage to the flatline. The file was, of course, easier as Phillipe's plays were improved, but I couldn't help being annoyed with scenes that were just too incredible. For example: <br /> <br /> ************ Start spoiler <br /> At one point (after days), Philippe is almost washed by the female terrorist. This should only be followed by the brutal cut of another finger. Why give the guy a wash if he's in for a torture? And yet the interruption of the last finger seemed to serve only the title of this flick anyway, he thought he almost asked to cut it off. Didn't make sense? <br /> <br /> ************ End spoiler <br /> What ultimately kept me going was the result of Fishburn, who again turned out to be a brilliant actor but also had the best part of the script to work with. All in all, you are far better off seeing the "Interview" with the second Matrix icon: Hugo Weaving. And when you do, I am convinced that you do not disagree with this review. <br/> <br /> <br /> "The interview", 1998 www.imdb.com/ title / tt0120714 /
