Poor dialogue, slow history, scenes that draw on and are absolutely meaningless. I can't believe much money was invested in such a poorly written movie. The management and the act also could not save this bomb. <br /> <br /> 50% through the movie and you're still waiting for it to start. They lay the groundwork with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes creating nothing. You see 40 minutes of recordings that are completely pointless in an attempt to do what I have no idea. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie is like watching a really bad French movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just kind of boring, lifeless and egocentrics that live without purpose or care. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. Anyone who recommends it sets you up for disappointment, and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth.
