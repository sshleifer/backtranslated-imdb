The most important word that comes to mind when considering this movie is "risky". This is a low-quality cinema of one of the most iconic artists of all time. The Gloved One deserved better. <br /> <br /> Before I get into the flesh of my thoughts on this biopic, I have to say that there are two things I found effective. Firstly, the use of actual fan footage and interviews at certain points in the film, especially in scenes depicting the first set of allegations of child moralization. I feel this contributed to some authenticity that was * seriously * missing throughout the rest of the movie. Second, the sequence was depiction of Michael Jackson's and Lisa Marie Presley's proposal. I do not want to comment on whether I think the marriage was a shame, but in many accounts it was a relationship where there was care and love between the two parties involved. It really came across this movie; Flex Anderson and Krista Rae had decent enough chemistry to pull it off. These successful points are enough to keep the man in the mirror away from 1-star status. <br /> <br /> That said ... there was very little else here that worked. Very few of the actors looked like the people they were supposed to imagine, most of them actually playing Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson and Diana Ross. Also, the absence of Jackson's music was a big loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without his music ?? I understand that they were unable to secure the rights to it as it was a low budget, unauthorized production; It seems that if you can't get man's music in a movie about him, you might as well pack it up and go home because you lack an extremely important part of his life story. /> <br /> This movie's characterization of Jackson disturbed me a little too. I would not argue that he was disturbed and might have been a few fries short of a value meal, but here he was portrayed as something close to mentally handicapped. I don't think Jackson, who is known to have been a sharp businessman, would have been so naive about how the adult world works as he was made to be in this movie. The way this movie was written was nothing short of shameful. Many lines or exchanges of dialogue were either extremely corny, like Michael and Janet's "Tinkerbell" exchange, or non-sensual, as "love of love" comments made by Michael. In addition, the screenwriters do not even have a sound for subtlety. There was a lot of telegraphing of upcoming events ("What could possibly go wrong?" Kind of lines) and extremely obvious hammering of themes and motifs in the movie (if I had heard the word "believe" once again ...). That is what ultimately hobbled the movie as something that could be considered awesomely bathed. Perhaps when we are a few years or even a decade or three removed from Jackson's death, somebody could bring his story to life in a more deserved movie. At that time, we can have a better perspective on his life, and someone will be able to present a truly thought-provoking study of who Michael Jackson really was and what he meant for the entertainment world. This very risky biopic was not that movie.
