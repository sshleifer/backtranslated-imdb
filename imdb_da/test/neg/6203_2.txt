David Dhawan copied HITCH and such an unofficial copy The movie is not even 1/2 as fun or entertaining as the original; David tries to choke drama too, but the film seems to be coherent, boring. The songs just pop in, it also makes romance and everything that excludes some fun Govinda scenes, the dance before the interval, something else worth mentioning. The last few scenes are quite fun, but there is a tendency to be too long <br /> <br /> David's direction is as bad as MAINE PYAAR KYUN KIYAA, he needs to change his style or try something good . Music saves grace, some songs are good, but situations seem forced <br /> <br /> Govinda looks overweight and seems too loud and screams his lines into original wheels, but he gets into the groove and gives his best in the office and the scene with Salman in his cabin and towards the end <br /> <br /> Salman just plays himself and his nose tone plus his fake style of acting is headache <br /> <br /> Lara is avoided, Katrina is fake as usual <br /> <br /> The child overcomes
