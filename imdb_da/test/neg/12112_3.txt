This movie is bad. I saw the classifieds and the non-classified versions. They are awful !! Now I know it is supposed to be a low budget, porno spoof of Spiderman, but Spiderbabe is just not good at being bad-good. It is not fun! Not at all fun !! I would laugh. I was trying to laugh. But this movie lets me down. At least, the non-classified version has plenty of nudity to look forward to. And is it me because Mundae is not a beautiful woman. From the waist down she is okay, but on the way up you leave much to be desired. She looks good in the schoolgirl outfit. Please, if you need to see this spider babe, you must rent it first. Rated or without rating, doesn't really make any difference, they are both bad for me !!
