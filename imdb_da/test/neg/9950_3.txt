The Mad Monster starts in Dr. Lorenzo Cameron's (George Zucco) Laboratory, when he completes his discovery of how to transform a human into a wicked wolf as a monster by injecting animal blood into a human subject that happens to be his bad servant Petro (Glenn Strange), apparently He plans to make the serum available to the War Department, who will use it to create an unstoppable army of these monsters, the ultimate soldier! But first thing first as Dr. Cameron has set his sights on some sweet revenge on the people who rejected his experiments, forced him to resign, and expose him to public ridicule. Dr. Cameron puts his plan into action and uses his monstrous creation to murder Professor Blaine (Robert Strange). In an unfortunate trip, Dr. Cameron unable to control the animal and is seen by a local farmer Jed Harper (Eddie Holden) who spread the news as a wildfire, in another unfortunate case, a journalist named Tom Gregory (Johnny Downs) fell into the history of history and begins to examine, he begins to suspect that Dr. Cameron & da Gregory goes out with his daughter Lenora (Ann Nagel) he has plenty of opportunities to sniff around ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Sam Newfield this is really low budget stuff from the 40s, yet Worse is the boring unoriginal low budget thing. The script from Fred Myton draws the extremely thin performance to almost 77 minutes, which is far too long, there is no variation in history and it is pretty much the same over and over. The character is boring clichés, the mad scientist who performs meaningless experiments that create a monster, the fragile beautiful daughter, the reporter who plays the hero, and by pure chance, both are investigating the mysterious deaths of a galician scientist. responsible for & is romantically involved with his daughter, the stupid servant, the stupid idiotic police and the stereotypical shotguns who are always accused of being full. This was probably klichéd himself back in 1942! The movie plows along with a relatively slow pace and director Newfield never manages to maintain or generate much in the way of excitement or atmosphere, which is a bad thing. Technically, the film is not great, of course, the budget was small and the crazy monster looks paralyzing like an old homeless wino who has not shaved for a few weeks and has had a few plastic toy stores in the mouth. The black and white film is basic and static like most movies from this period, while the good Dr. Cameron's laboratory consists of a sofa and a table with a couple of upset pieces of scientific equipment on top. The action is stiff & wood with Petro looks like he is dope in the whole movie, Zucco as the crazy scientist does not convince and is unforgettable. The Mad Monster is a rather paralyzing horror movie, there is very little here to entertain, although at least I made it to the end of a single meeting, as when I think about it, is a bit of a performance in itself!
