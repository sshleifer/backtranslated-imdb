Let's get right to the heart of the case ... This is a horrible movie. The story is confusing, the supportive cast is ridiculous, and the leading actors seem to be forced to be in it. The story asks us to believe that there is an underground lesbian sex cult where members are murdered by their psychiatrist who just happens to be a transvestite. Ellen Barkin examines the crimes and develops a boredom of Peta Wilson whose work it seems to be the cult cruiser. Sex scenes are similar to bad porn, and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen looks like she has pain. Barkin's Talent is totally wasted in this B-class sex exploitation piece of junk, and I hope she gave her agent the pink slip after landing her in this movie.
