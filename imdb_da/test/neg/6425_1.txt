Bad plot, bad acting, poor direction. <br /> <br /> It had opportunities but didn't achieve anything. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like someone started with an idea, googled a bit of info and then tried to meat an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad excitement music. Others had to stop watching because they were scared 2/3 of the way through - I had to take a break just because I just didn't care more. <br /> <br /> Reminded me of an episode of Days of our lives with marginally more excitement. <br /> <br /> Just bad.
