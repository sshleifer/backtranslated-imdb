I can't believe I was through this complete waste of time. I was just too fascinated by how incredibly bad it was that I couldn't move. It reminded me of the feeling when you can't take your eyes off a terrible car crash or a rotting body of a cow. You can't help but see, but you feel sick and nauseous afterwards. <br /> <br /> Let me elaborate: "Plan 9 from outer space", for example, it's not a bad movie. Not even "Star Wars: Holiday Special" is a bad movie. They are both terrible to look at, but they both have some features and at least they give you the strength to reach the "off" button. <br /> <br /> This "remake" (by name only) of the sci-fi classic left me crying on my sofa, desperately trying to express why such scripts are filmed, why anyone would remember the original classic and whether I could resume my normal life without my sudden acquisition longing for the peace and quiet of death. <br /> <br /> Although, I realized, death would not calm down the scary memories of this pile of screams, as the poor souls in hell are likely to see it again and again for eternity ...
