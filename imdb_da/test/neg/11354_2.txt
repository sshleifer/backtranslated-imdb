I was looking forward to this based on the reviews on this and the pretty good rating. This was a big disappointment. This does not hold light to contemporary zombie flicks like the dead Shaun, the death of the dead, the land of the dead, etc. Horrorflicks sometimes take a while to get started, you have to build the characters, so when they sniff what you feel a little empathy, etc. but still there are 45 minutes to sit in here, even before you sniff a body until then it looks as if you see a bad soap opera, nothing of interest or relevance happens, and if you want to see this for the first Once, you can honestly start to look after 45 minutes, you will not miss out on any plot. When things get started, it's all very sub-par things. Some of the killers and make-up are doing well, others are doing very poorly, lacking consistency here, and there are some really shocking continuity errors and some of the most wood plays I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> This could all be acceptable if you really thought that all this was happening on a plane, but with weapons being fired, firebombs were turned off, no pilots in the cockpit in a violent storm, but the plane is in the air, let's say it's not all simpletones. <br /> <br /> Oh, and really take a moment for a fighter missile to hit a plane a few hundred yards away. I know of a zombie movie, and you have to stretch things, but this movie along with the other main flaws mentioned above had no credibility. One to miss.
