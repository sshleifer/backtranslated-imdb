But I still enjoyed seeing her so I gave it a 3 instead of a 1. Her expression is invaluable. Some of the other cast members (eg Michael McKean) are really dormant too. The cat itself is a bit entertaining. Apart from that, the movie is all clich√©s that culminate in a far too long car crash. (It is also at this time that the film becomes unnecessarily raw, has been very "family" until then.)
