The German regional broadcast station WDR has shown both "The General" and ODC. On Saturday I have seen "The General" and I thought it wasn't that bad, but not so good too. But yesterday I have seen ODC, and I switched it off after approx. one hour. Although Kevin Spacey was the main actor, the film was quite confusing and restless. "The General" just told the story and ordered, but the ODC would just be cool. There is a reference to Guy Ritchie Movies "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch" but does not have the Coolness of these movies. <br /> <br /> In the end, I would rate it 3 out of 10!
