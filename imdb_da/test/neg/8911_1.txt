Stephen Seagal plays the role of a guy who is spoken of driving an armored car to a bank holding and driving into everything that comes across his path. However, the police seem to appear on the track very quickly, and Seagal smells a rat warning the police. The story comes in many terms, and the money from the team has disappeared and no one knows its new owner. Bad Seagal gets a bit framed in this team and of course he is looking for the person or people who are trying to put him away for a long time. In this movie, Seagal is trying to be a good guy, but the forces of evil are against him. Unfortunately, it's not a good movie and a bit boring and too long.
