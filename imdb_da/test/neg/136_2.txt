I'm trying to find something of value here. The best thing I can muster is that Truffaut wanted to make a movie so boring, painful, puerile, annoying, illogical and brainless as the experience of being in love. If that were his goal, he succeeded, but the solution to his exercise is really a move to see. <br /> <br /> There's a scene screaming for a spoof: Belmondo compares Deneuve's face to the features of a landscape. All I could think of all the time was "glacier", "ice floe", "two lonely fishermen carrying frogs on a frozen lake in Minnesota." The only other point of interest was the resurrection of Buffoon's theory of climatic determinism. The troops are presented as paradise, and things gradually get worse as they get colder, hell is Calvinist French Switzerland. It was fun.
