I think the problem of some reactions to this movie is that they - with few exceptions - do not focus on the main interruption, and thus the main column of the audience. On the one hand, there are those taken by the visual design, beautiful costumes and various elements that enter the film. Some children's movie fans love the color and animation, and all the un-scary 'magic' effects, shapeshifting animals, and so on. Some culture vultures as the complicated references, layering various folklore elements, and the fact that they can see Zhang Ziyi singing and quasi-mimicking in two different languages ​​in what was really supposed to be a children's comedy. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, there are those who say that a children's film should still have a point that a mix of folk tales is not a narrative at all and that it is easier to believe in magic when enough thinking and care have entered the technical aspects to make it real. <br /> <br /> In other words, ideas can be lovely; but when you put them on stage, they must deliver. Here they do not. <br /> <br /> A good folktale - from any country - has a clear history, point and character that interact strongly with each other. This lacks them all. A few sophisticated gestures for opera, western and Japanese are no substitute for a solid theme. <br /> <br /> As a fantasy fan, I have to say that I have passed some turkeys and loved a few, but this one really tries to do too many things - cheap. To put in Zhang Ziyi to try to add a little glimpse of exotic floral syndromes. The second problem is not that there is no plot; There is a half plot, which means that you keep being pulled in and then dropped again when another non-sharply performed dance number starts. <br /> <br /> The characters all seem to know that they are starring in a movie. Unless you really like watching other people's amateur video, it's not good. I would like to test this on real children; I think they would drop it to Uproar in Heaven after approx. 20 minutes.
