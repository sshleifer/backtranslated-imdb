I found this movie incredibly interesting, yet a little sad, it tells of violence and what does, I still don't look forward to becoming terrorists to stop the terrorists. We have similar people in the US and other countries who justify the use of violence and war tactics because they believe they are right. Think of the Puritans and the Christian Crusades against the Islamic people of the Middle Ages. Lots of blood and death far outweigh the violence of today, the Western world has had a negative impact on religion. I do not justify their actions, but the Western culture in the past has had a very negative impact on some. But still remember that the majority of Islamic people are peaceful! People in any nation feel a kind of patriotism, but to start a war that I'm right and your wrong one must be reconsidered. Again, I repeat that you cannot stop terrorists from becoming like them.
