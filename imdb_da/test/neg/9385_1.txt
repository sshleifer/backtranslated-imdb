THANKS GOD WHO IS HERE, is painful, positively painful. The title is appropriate if it is aimed at the large study audience paid to laugh that they saw Marx Brothers second come. And believe me they are paid. As creatively infertile as the entertainment industry has become, I refuse to believe that NBC brass really has faith in this turkey. Rather, I think THANK GOD IS HERE, what you all get that doesn't look at or appreciate STUDIO 60, which previously graced the peacock's network on Monday night setup. You'll turn your nose up on caviar, fine. Here are some lovely Alpo directly from Menu Foods for you to tow around.
