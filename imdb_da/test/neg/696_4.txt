If you like watching movies because they are beautiful, you should be okay with this. If you like watching movies starting with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy, then reveal clues to the motif of them throughout the movie, skip it. At the end of the movie, I still didn't know why Stargher killed the women as he did. When you create such a ritualistic serial killer, it would be nice to know where the rituals came from. In Dreams, a similar, beautiful movie with a serial killer was not the best, but at least he was explaining how he killed the girls. They also suggested a dark background for Vaughn's character, but did not explain why Lopez's child psychologist was so much better suited to this task than the rest of the people they interviewed, did not provide much of an explanation for the small child's problem, etc. If the rest of the story is convincing, I don't care about details like how Stargher gave all the fancy electronic equipment and underground chambers, or why the FBI didn't check to see if he owned or owned any other property. the way, while waiting to see if the whole thing that came into the killer would work, but I want a sense of what motivates the serial killer in a serial killer movie when he kills in such a complex way.
