This is a poorly written and poorly directed short film, clean and simple. What is interesting and keeps me aware of the production values. Shot on video it appears with a bad script and poor direction one would think it would also have horrible production value. That's what the viewer expects when they see a movie that is horrible and shot at video. BUT not in this case did they spend some money and it shows. It keeps me very mildly interested in seeing what was next, just to see! Probably the worst short film I've seen, so big budget hollywood, even though it was shot at some kind of video format. <br /> <br /> Instead of spending the sum of money they should have spent on some pretty impressive set of designs, it would have been nicer to see a better story with a good direction. But then again, how can we expect new filmmakers to do it when even Hollywood does not want to.
