Looking at this movie and then listening to the comment, it is clear that Michael Radford does not understand this game. The first notion that he does not fully understand the work is that he has pain by putting the film in the seventeenth century Venice. It sounds really strange, yes, the misunderstanding of the movie would mean trying to make it so accurate to its location as possible. But everyone who has studied Shakespeare knows that culture and values ​​are always contemporary England, while putting most of his plays into exotic locals. This does not hurt the movie, but it shows a lack of necessary knowledge. <br /> <br /> Where Radford kills the movie is making it so dead seriously. He manages to suck out any joke from the manuscript, so the whole production is flat. Every ounce of passion is out of the characters. Even Shylock's 'soft not' speech is a gentle, awkward ranting from a choleric that apparently only says and does what he does because he should. The lovers are solemn and overly detained (Joseph Fiennes delivers some of the most romantic lines in the cinema this year in an almost inaudible whisper), Gratiano (who has to promise to behave at some point) is more sober and collected than Bassiano (Who allows him to behave) Jessica is reluctant to leave her father and spend her life with Lorenzo Pouting. <br /> <br /> In the commentary on the dull and shaded court scene, the director sounds his shock, an audience laughed at Portia's "One pound of meat, no more, no less" sentence; In the end, it concluded that it had to span release laughter. "The Merchant of Venice" is a comedy and Radford scoffs at the idea that the most absurd and hysterical parts of history are anything but the most daring provocative drama. <br /> <br /> The film has no understandable focus, yet it cuts some of the most entertaining scenes. The characters are forced into high drama veils, so they come out that look like Ibsen characters who read Victorian poetry. And the comic end, where all the good guys go to bed, succeeds, is drowned in a dignified despair that feels as if they find stiff-over-peace with impending death, rather than reconciling with lovers. Even Lancelot and Antonio leave the film, which keeps their hats as aristocratic mourning. <br /> <br /> The movie is poorly executed because the creative forces are not understanding the script. It is strict, where it must be hysterical. It is reserved where it must be passionate. It's Michael Radford, where it should be William Shakespeare.
