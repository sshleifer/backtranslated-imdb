Stay Alive has a very similar story to some Asian horror films that include technology on the story. Some of these Asian horror films are One Missed Call, Ringu and Pulse. So the idea of ​​Stay Alive is very cliché and obvious, but the filmmakers behind it didn't know how to put something new or interesting on the Stay Alive clichés. This movie is completely crap. But a very big crap. All elements of Stay Alive belong to the worst class of "horror" movies: shallow signs, no excitement, stupid '' horror '' that makes laughter and light violence. It is easy to notice that the '' instructor '' is unable to create something original or disturbing. I will not waste more time writing about this pathetic movie. I'm just giving you a piece of advice: Don't watch this movie. I really hated it.
