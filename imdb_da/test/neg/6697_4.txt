A coach who used to be good but had to move to a new area to get away from what he once did; a team without hopes; the star player who has a series of coach assistant coach with an alcohol problem, the little guy being kicked around to score the winning basket; the whole city against the coach (all except for the leading lady). It's the old story - right out of the British comics, where a team of special nerds and fat takes the Brazilians into football and wins. <br /> <br /> This film, though well composed, is full of these clichés. The only part I didn't predict was when the star recipient suddenly next to the city's meeting decided to sit with the coach. No reason was ever given. It looked like a very strange thing to see that everything went its way until now. Maybe he just felt sorry for the poor guy. Gene Hackman plays a closet Popey Doyle. I'm sure a Dennis Hopper's caliber actor didn't find any particular challenge to his role. The same can be said of Barbara Hershey. All in all, a movie full of clichés that may have been done much better than it was.
