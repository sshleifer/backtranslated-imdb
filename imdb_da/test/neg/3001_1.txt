'Northfork' is what is wrong with indie film. For all their hard-capped comments and attacking major subjects, studying will not, it's the victim we make. For almost two hours, I was subjected to torture and pain in a movie that begins to wander like a blind man at a new place and ends up without covering any new land and happily dying. <br /> <br /> There are parallel stories describing a dying city and a dying boy. Two men dressed in black (one of them James Woods) must force the remaining Northfork residents to leave before a dam opens up and floods the city. The other story has a boy who has returned to the pastor (Nick Nolte) who gave him to the parents. He dies and is visited, I think, by angels. Among them, Anthony Edwards with bizarre glasses and Daryl Hannah in a bizarre costume reminds me of a pirate shirt from Seinfeld. Although this is "the plot", it's not about the movie. The film is about nothing. It does nothing, says nothing, goes nowhere and has nothing interesting to show. Perhaps by design, more likely an aftermath of the pretentious, surreal, David Lynch wannabe - we are an important artistic film you cannot see - directional. The whole movie is filtered through a gray, bleak background, which I suppose fits a movie about death. Instead, it simply makes the movie much harder to see. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about men in black, you can see either the 'Men in Black' movie, not too impressive, but compared to 'Northfork' they lifted to 'Citizen Kane' status. If you want to watch a movie about a boy's dying from 'Lorenzo's Oil'. If you want to see a movie that destroys a city through watery 'O brother, where are you?' If you want to watch a movie better than 'Northfork', there are hundreds. If you want to see a movie that is worse, there is only a handful. 0 * out of ****
