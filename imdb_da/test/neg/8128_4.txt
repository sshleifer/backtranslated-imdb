Sebastian Cabot is a rich jerk who wants to buy the whole country because there is oil - although none of the locals are aware of the oil. They all kill and terrorize with the help of an evil black fighter in black. When a murdered son comes, he refuses to lie back and stand up for these dark forces. <br /> <br /> Wow. When I saw the TERROR IN A Texas TOWN, I felt like I had seen this movie many times before, and would probably see something similar again. That's because apart from a few news items (like Sterling Hayden using a harpoon on the bad guy), it has a plot that is too familiar. Once again, we have a rich guy who is trying to drive all the farmers out to get control of the whole country. And to do this, he has brought nested weapons to force people to sell or kill them. Have been there, done it in just too many movies. <br /> <br /> I love Sterling Hayden in movies but just couldn't recommend this as anything other than a bad pastime.
