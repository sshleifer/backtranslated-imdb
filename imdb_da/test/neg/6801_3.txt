As an early representation of the troubles of the 1960s that followed, Diane Arbus (Nicole Kidman) can be excused as an early infant. The film itself deserves no such latitude. The lack of character development, motivation and justification for the character's behavior makes the film very disappointing. I sat watching and waiting for an explanation of the bizarre actions to find out that Shainberg lets me look at a story that must have been some sort of inside joke. The fact that the few facts that were presented did not match much of Diane Arbus's life also helped to clarify things. <br /> <br /> The leached Art Direction in Diana's 'normal' life was nicely opposed to the brilliant colors of her 'awakened' life with Lionel. And the trap door staircase was a good demonstration of Diana's attempt to inject her new life into her existing family (though I can't see how the trap door in the ceiling of her dining room could directly connect Lionel's apartment, there were two flights of stairs up from her ). Perhaps my analysis is a little too literal in looking for some character development and relationship understanding that goes beyond a sentence or comment. I would also have seen at least one of Diana's photos too. I don't want to wait for the successor.
