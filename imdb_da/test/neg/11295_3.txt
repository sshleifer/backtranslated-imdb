I'm a big fan of Thomas Harris, I read all his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal is the book I really love the most. Therefore, the movie was my biggest disappointment and I really don't understand why some people here give it a nine or even a 10.After their demands are very low or they haven't read the book or both. Although I hadn't read the book, I would still consider the movie as an absolute average and I would give it a five. The eerie, mysterious atmosphere of the novel does not even appear in the movie when I first saw it in the cinema, I fell asleep myself. Why was Margot Verger, a very important sign, completely omitted? Why was Barney shown as a stupid ignorant whose only ambition is to make money? And most of all, why was the psychological process Starling went through eventually, caused by the drugs Lecter applied to her, fell down? Not to mention that the ending was also omitted and completely changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling again is well known, and I accepted it, though I'm probably many others, I'm very disappointed because I identified Starling with her. For stories like the Red Dragon, the Lamb's Silence or Hannibal, which possesses such a psychological depth, it is very important to identify with a sign when adapted to the screen, but as the Germans say it is "snow yesterday". Ridley Scott did some incredibly good movies, but with this he does not live up to his name. Jonathan Demme had exactly the right feeling for the plot, the signs and their relationship with each other in the silence of the lamb, he should have done Hannibal as well. My only consolation is that I have only watched the movie twice, it is a long time ago and thank God for that reason, I cannot see the scenes from the film when I read the novel. I'm so sorry, but I really can't recommend it to anyone.
