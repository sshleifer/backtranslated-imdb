I really didn't want to write a hard review of this movie because I really appreciate how hard it is to make any kind of movie on an incredibly low budget, let alone try something as ambitious as a sci-fi. <br /> But this movie is really horrible. The action is among some of the worst I have ever had to endure and as a fan of low budget film, there is a rather serious accusation of doing. There are plenty of aspiring actors out there who would work on a deferred payment scheme if they believed in the movie and what the director was trying to achieve. I'm sure the actors did their best, like everyone else involved in this production, but it was simply not good enough to pull anything of this size. <br /> <br /> There is the dialogue. Very poor indeed. There is no excuse for that. I got the impression the script was quickly written on the back of a beer mat after an epic boozing session. I hesitate to use the word 'ridiculous', but that's exactly what the script is. I had no empathy with any of the characters. In fact, they tore me with the result that I wanted to cheat a few of them more than once, Mr Stirton has overstretched himself by taking over too many roles. Clint Eastwood he is not. Again, there are skilled people out there who are willing to work on postponement if they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> Much is made of special effects in this movie. For the money, they are extraordinary if they are a little overused. It's like someone said "I have aftermath and boy should I use it". The one who did the CG work was among the most talented of this crew. Quite simply, the money was not available to make an ambitious movie, as this is trying to be. Kudos to try it, but unfortunately it does not succeed in achieving its clear goals for too many ways. <br /> <br /> I welcome everyone involved in their production, I really do, but for their next effort, they either need a better producer or lower their sights to something more manageable. <br /> Finally, I cannot recommend this effort to anyone other than the most enthusiastic about movie students or ordinary insomnia. If you want to see a true masterpiece of low cost sci-fi movies, try the student to make "Dark Star" of a particular John Carpenter.
