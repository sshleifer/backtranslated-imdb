There I sit at home in the morning, suddenly my brother flips at what seems to be the stupidest movie I've ever seen. Considering it was the 70s and special effects were not that sharp, this movie almost matched the definition of crap. The stupid monsters, the stupid storyline and the stupid attitude made this the worst movie I've ever seen. So bad in fact I didn't even do it, I set it up for a certain time and continued to see how long I could go without putting a rope around my neck and hanging myself. (I'm just kidding haha) TERRIBLE MOVIE
