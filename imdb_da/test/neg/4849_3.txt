This is the type of movie that causes you to question your past admiration for a particular instructor before stopping and reminding you that there are very few people whose work does not contain a few clutches. <br /> <br /> Casting into Lelouch's films is of utmost importance because he puts the viewer in such intimacy with the characters. The actors must bring true screen magic to live up to the intensity. Otherwise, it's just hollow. <br /> <br /> None of the actors in this movie had any of this screen magic, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons and Patricia Kaas fell very short as leaders. Irons is a talented actor, but he was wrong for this part. Lovable villain does not fit his forces. His charm has also hit a false note for me here. Iron's persona is too decadence-tinged to fit into a Lelouch love story. Although I would hesitate to give up any opportunity to hear an English accent, I also think that an American actor would have worked better in this role. So many of the songs that Kaas sings are so closely identified with the special text writers' Americanism that it seemed inappropriate to have Jeremy Irons play the love interest - although logically it was not essential. It still screwed the stream of the film somehow. At least for me. Of course, it would have been necessary to be the right American. I think George Clooney would have been great in the part. And he would have brought the screen magic into spades. Brad Pitt could also have done a really good job delivering his particular combination of charming and edgy. I was also very disappointed with Patricia Kaas. By reading about her I learned that she has a tremendously successful career as a singer and many fans, so what do I know, but I found her screen presence as a singer very boring. She was actually a much better actress in her talking scenes than she was a singer in the scenes where she had to interpret and sell a song. Nothing she sang moved me. She was comfortable but bland. In contrast, a person like Kate Hudson, who is not a professional singer and only has voice-coach French, would still have handled this part a million times better. Not to mention all the fantastic French talent out there that could have been tapped in. It was wrenching to see Patricia Kaas take up the screen space when there are so many charismatic French actresses that could have been thrown instead. <br /> <br /> The music was so important in this movie, it couldn't really work without the music working. And since Kaas has delivered so badly in this respect, the film has never had a chance. <br /> <br /> Lelouch sealed the fate of this movie as he threw Patricia Kaas. JMO.
