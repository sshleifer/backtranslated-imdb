To be a fan of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Lon Chaney Jr., I had to see this. What is the only thing good about this is clips from Lugosi, Karloff and Chaney Jr.along with all the vintage clips that do not gel with the new black and white footage.not even close to Steve Martin's dead men do not wear plaid, it was done well. With all the technology we have now, why wasn't it better? If you plan to shell out 5 bucks and some changes, be warned this is really bad. but if you like Lugosi Karloff and Chaney Jr then watch their movie instead.even ed wood did better than this one.new actor mark redfield is pretty good as an imitation Bela Lugosi.the clips they use are; the monkey, Mr wong, the most dangerous game, lost the world, indestructible man. and the devil bat.that infamous Bela Lugosi classic.i believe that this production was very low budget and it shows.1 out of 10.
