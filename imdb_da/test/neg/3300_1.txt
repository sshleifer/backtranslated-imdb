There are shows and movies I've seen and then read reviews of on IMDb.com, which I disagree with, and have been happy to accept that there has just been a difference of opinion. <br /> <br /> Reading positive reviews of this filth only puts me in the mind of a creepy conspiracy involving TV networking employees being ordered to surf the internet, posting unconvincingly positive reviews for programs they themselves are responsible for. <br /> <br /> How else would one explain that this show is "safe to become a phenomenon" a whole year after it has become clear that it will not be of that kind? I will not waste words describing this mess but suffice to, if you enjoy, wives who emasculate their husbands, husbands, emasculating their sons, children, disrespectful jackasses to their parents and absolutely no one else threads of behavior or subtitle to legitimize characters that are basically only unfunny one-liner spewing machines, so see this sh ow. However, I have some Seinfeld DVDs to get through. <br /> <br /> Futurama - Canceled. TItus - Canceled. Arrested Development - Canceled. War at home - Renewed. <br /> <br /> No justice.
