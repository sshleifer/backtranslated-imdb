My mother, my cousins, and I are pretty big Jane Austen fans. We know all the words of the Pride and Prejudice masterpiece in 1995 and have seen Gwyneth Paltrows Emma an embarrassing number of times. I've read all the books and I've even put Sense and Sensibility and Persuasion a couple of times. So my mother and I thought it would be nice to watch Northanger Abbey on film. <br /> <br /> Bad idea! This is just about the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 version of Alice Through the Looking Glass or the 1939 Nancy Drew movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $ 1 (my former "worst movie".) The first thing that is wrong as you notes in the opening scene is that "heroine," Catherine, has a cruel and strange imagination, inspired by trashy novels that a Jane Austen heroine would never touch. Through the novel she has dreams (day and night), where she is carried by a shameful man with a greasy wig, drawn over a field headed for God, by anything, and suddenly saved by a dashing guy on a white horse . The other thing that anyone watching the movie will immediately notice is the high-pitched and saxophone music that should be the soundtrack. No delicious classical music or English country dances here! It is also clear, almost at first glance, that the actor (for lack of a better word) chosen to play Catherine is completely gone. First of all, she is rather uninteresting and is made even more of her unconventional behavior. Her looks and movements are just crazy! Plus, they are completely affected and incredible. <br /> <br /> This sad lack of skill affects almost all the actors in the movie. Not even Mr. Tilney, the supposed dashing young suitor, is decent. As more and more characters are introduced, a strange taste in costumes from the filmmakers' side becomes apparent. Huge, Marie Antoinette-style headgear clashes with (mostly) properly styled Empire dresses. A French woman, apparently a friend of General Tilney, is made entirely in black as a kind of old Goth nightmare - she has a striking resemblance to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is made even more sweet by a large crescent beauty mark on her cheek. I also had to think about the historical precision of the bright red lipstick that almost all women wore. <br /> <br /> Another irregularity that kept my mother and I shouting with laughter for about ten minutes was the "bathing" scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women bathed in a large bathhouse together - probably not very likely in the early 1800s. Then we saw that all women seemed to have large porcelain or plastic plates, worn around the neck with strings. The plates walked horizontally on the water, which contained some mysterious pieces of ... something. We guessed it was soap, so aromatic herbs, so finally when the mystery began to disappear between shoots, we deduced it was food. But I'm still not sure. <br /> <br /> And that's not even half of what's wrong with Northanger Abbey. My warning to anyone considering renting this movie: Hold your hand. And if anyone is considering buying it - yes, I don't even know what to say. <br /> <br /> You think that when the actors and others who made this movie got around 1/4 of the way through, they would realize what a monster they created and stopped. Unfortunately, they didn't, and Northanger Abbey was knocked out in the world.
