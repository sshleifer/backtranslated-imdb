If you tried to make a bad movie, you couldn't do the worst for this one. I can't imagine anyone paying good money to see trash can in a theater. The thing that really gets you is fascinated by looking at the whole thing just too amazed to see how miserable it could be. The redeeming facet of this movie was to see the words "The End"
