I remember seeing this at my local Blockbuster and picking it up because I was curious. I liked movies about mythological creatures. I like movies about werewolves, vampires, zombies, etc. This is based on half-caste, a half-human semi-Leopard creature that adorns the people of Africa. The movie is horrible! The actors are horrible! There is no script at all! It's all impromptu! It's all filmed at night because they say it's the only time you ever see it. It's obvious bull * blep *! The movies at night to make it scary. But they have failed to scare me. After the first person was killed, I put it back in the case and took it back to Blockbuster. One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now you're probably saying I don't have the right to review a movie if I haven't finished it. Well, it's one of those movies that doesn't deserve to be seen all the way through. <br /> <br /> 1 star out of 10. This is really BAD!
