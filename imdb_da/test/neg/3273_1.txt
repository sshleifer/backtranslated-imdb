This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. For a while, I made a habit of watching malicious movies, including "Battlefield Earth", "Delta Force Commando" and "Starship". All these films are cinematic jewels compared to Ironheart. There is not much point in summarizing this piece of junk; I think it is more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the movie, which is as follows: I get furious and I will tear the tape out of the VCR and burn it after (about) 80 minutes of play. <br /> I rate this movie a 0, but IMDb doesn't let one judge a movie less than 1. I give it a 0 knowing that I'm saying any movie that has any score over 0, is infinitely (undeniably) many times better than this - It's really how bad it is.
