I saw this movie because every review I read of it said it was one of the craziest movies in the new millennium. I really don't understand what the whole hype was about. For one thing, the dialogue in this movie was ridiculously bad ("What if something strange is going on?" ... what ????). The action didn't hit my socks either. It could have been because the manuscript almost didn't give the actors anything to work with ... the characters are purely two-dimensional for me, and I didn't give anything at all. Another thing is that the movie is extremely boring. Extremely. Sure, there are a few "jolts" here and there, but for the film's 112 minute length, it probably hasn't spent that time wisely. Most of the movie contains characters that talk about things that have almost nothing to do with the plot. What was the meaning of that? <br /> <br /> First, the movie makes no sense. Yes, I think I understood the intentions of the ghost, but how it fits the events that actually occur in the movie is beyond me. Also much of the movie is played out in small vignettes, which makes the story difficult to follow at times. And don't even get started with the end. What just happened? <br /> <br /> I can give Kurosawa credit to place some really scary images throughout the movie. There are very scary shots of ghosts and other disturbing images. If they reflected more on these images and deepened them, it would have made the film much stronger. But they did not, and instead elaborated more on social comments that were interesting but again portrayed in an extremely boring way. Yes, it's a message movie. Okay, fun. I just get the message to my review right here in the open: Find a better way to spend your free time than to look at this.
