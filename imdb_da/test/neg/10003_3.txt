Brass images (movies are not a suitable word for them) are really something chanted. Their attractive visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high-class television commercials. But unfortunately, show photos are with the feeling of wanting to entertain viewers for over two hours! In this, they fail unlucky, their undeniable, but rather soft and blabby, than steaming, erotic qualities that are not against. <br /> <br /> Senso '45 is a remake of a movie by Luchino Visconti with the same title and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells a story of meaningless love and desire in and around Venice during the Italian wars of independence. Brass moved the story from the 19th to the 20th century, 1945 to be precise, so there are Mussolini murals, men in black shirts, German uniforms or the partisan tattered garbage. But it's just window dressing, the historical context is totally insignificant. Anna Galiena plays the attractive aristocratic woman who falls to the amoral SS guy who always puts too much lipstick. She is an attractive, versatile, well-educated Italian actress and clear about the material. Her wide range of facial expressions (signaling boredom, disgust, joy, fear, hatred ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to see this image and appreciate two stars. She is basically scary with an amazing amount of dignity. I want some really good parts to come together for her. She really deserves it.
