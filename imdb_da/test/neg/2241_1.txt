Countless historical and cultural errors 0/10 <br /> (1) A Jewish guy named OMAR !!! Hahahaha (2) Brilliant Detective took out the smallest intelligent guy in the movie! (3) Jewish suicide bombers !! It was fun. (4) Hitler and his top weapon went to see a movie downtown Paris !!! With two guards at the door. !! Shoot me. (5) Brad Pitt was overpowering and it was painful to see him. (6) Mr. QT is rewriting history, "Hitler was killed in a theater? Really!" The funny thing about this is that people "and I mean stupid people" will actually believe in this plot. <br /> <br /> And finally, someone can tell me how this movie made it to the top 250 movies at all times !!! Shame shame, still wondering how can anyone like this movie.
