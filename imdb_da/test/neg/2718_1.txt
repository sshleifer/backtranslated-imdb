As Joe Bob Briggs wanted to say, this film relies heavily on the actress's talents rather than their talent. This early 1990s show-the-babes-in-bikini party has little to redeem it, except to show beautiful women almost naked. Joe Estevez, Martin Sheen's younger brother, once again proves that his movie career is not near what his brother's career is. <br /> <br /> Avoid this unless you like to see beautiful women in skimpy clothes. It's about the only thing that redeems it.
