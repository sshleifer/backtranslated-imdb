Okay - the title "House of Frankenstein" was a reference to a line from the original Frankenstein movie. When they follow it with a movie titled "House of Dracula", which makes no sense, you know it just started to become a franchise. <br /> <br /> Without explanation Dracula is back and he's calling himself Baron Latos. He infiltrates a doctor Edelmann's home with the claim that he is seeking a cure for his vampireism. Nobleman has a hunchback nurse who helps him (what about hunchback assistants in these movies?), But what Dracula is really interested in is his second, more beautiful assistant. At this point, Larry "Wolf Man" Talbot returns (again, no explanation given) and just happens to seek the same doctor to cure his lycanthropy. And then he just happens in a cave where plants can be grown to help him, which also happens to contain the Frankenstein monster. Dear God, when will it end ... surely, the other universal monster sequels were stupid, but that's just ridiculous. First, the good things. There are some good settings and the vampire bat effects are a little better than normal. Some of the other effects are also quite cozy. John Carradine is not bad as Dracula when you are used to him, but still nothing as brilliant as Lugosi was. In my opinion, Onslow Stevens plays a much better vampire in this movie, even though he has the opposite problem with Carradine - all creepy and none of the class. None of the performances are so big, but it is due to more scary script than anything else - the female parts are particularly badly written. But stupid as it is, it remains relatively entertaining for the most part. The best thing about it is the short length. <br /> <br /> Now the bad things ... it's not scary, it's badly written and it doesn't work. I hoped the three monsters would start some kind of supernatural battle for power, but that doesn't happen. The focus is almost exclusively on Dracula, which is not particularly well portrayed. On the other hand, this is the only film in which Dracula infects another man, but it happens via a blood transfusion rather than a bite, as Universal was always uncomfortable with the possible homosexual subtitle. Larry Talbot is decent as always as Wolf Man, but he plays a relatively small part. Once again, the part of Frankenstein's monster is reduced to climatic closing moments. For God's sake, Glenn Strange was amazing as a creature! Why not give him more screen time? It is unfortunate that the series should end this note (not counting the classic comedy "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"). Eventually, it was just in the sunlight and dead, like Dracula himself.
