And I've seen many movies. I saw this in the theater in 1989 and to this day I remember the diseases that need to go out. If you like John Belushi, respect his talent, or even the cinema's sanity - this movie has nothing to offer you. It is mostly a pathetic showcase for the author of Belushi's biography, Bob Woodward. As we see the progress of Belushi's life passing on the screen, Woodward actually shows in the movie as a ghost character. The most offensive scene arises when Belushi is dying, looking up from his deathbed to see the author standing over him, and he weakens "breathe for me, Woodward." There are too many terrible things to mention to all of them, the least of which is the opening that has Belushi, jumps out of his body bag in the morning and enters a taxi driven by a guy named "Angel". I'll leave it by that.
