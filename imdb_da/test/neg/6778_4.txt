This movie describes a truly horrible event, to be sure. But it all falls from bad ideas from all the casts. It is impossible to feel the feeling of almost any character, since all emotional scenes act as parodies of themselves. For example, a character is shot at the beginning of the movie, and you get the cliché desperate, "Should I do that, Sergeant?", "Yes, it's not something," but it plays like a sketch from a movie from Wayans Brothers (I don't know if they made War Movie yet) or something with the lead role Leslie Nielsen. <br /> <br /> The Sergeant played by Sean Penn reminds me of Al Bundy from Married to Children, while Fox is the greatest self-defeating cliché, you can imagine ... God, God cursing and smoking under it. His emotional "NOW!" is definitely more suited to comedies as back to the future than so-called serious films like this. To their credit, some of the "main" scenes ... (without giving away too much, where they actually do some pretty horrible actions) ... are well done and make us take the subject seriously. But it is, despite that, not thanks to the actor.
