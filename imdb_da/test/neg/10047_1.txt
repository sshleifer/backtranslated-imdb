This failed satire or commentary on the human condition has easily earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen. I'm seriously considering buying a copy if I can find a dirt cheap, chasing away unwanted company. It is honestly so bad. I consider it a kind of anti-personnel weapon. If you are the kind of person just looking at a train wreck to witness the carnage, then this movie is a gem. Just to be fair, Kelsey Grammar has 1 line that almost works, but it doesn't. Except that everything in this film strives to be insightful, but misses the mark of approx. the distance between the ground and the nearest pair of colliding galaxies. I can usually appreciate a book or movie where the protagonist suffers from some form of existential anxiety, but the anxiety presented here is so incredible and over the top, and the film does not even indicate the nonsense it presents in any valuable way . If you are familiar with the word "word throw" then you can get a picture of kinematrocity. Oh, and the narrative structure is poorly thought out, pretentious, and amateurish. It has failed both style and fabric. If you really hate someone, invite them to a dual function in this movie and "The Terror of Tiny Town", an all-midget western from the 1930s and put them in restrictions with their eyes forced to open "A Clockwork Orange" style . But it probably violates a provision of the Geneva Conventions.
