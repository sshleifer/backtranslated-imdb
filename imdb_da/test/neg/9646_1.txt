I generally look like Sion Sono's work, but this movie was totally retarded. But unfortunately not retarded enough to make it entertaining retarded. I just sat, mouth agape and wondering when it would end. The reason only gives a certain sense. I think it was supposed to be campy. I mean, haunted hair extensions - how could it not be? But humor, as it were, fell flat. Not funny. Not scary. Not gory. I might say that Sono was a hired hand on this project, but he also seems to have written this dull trash. I still have to fill in a few more lines, what's more to say? I suppose I could finish by saying: better luck next time, Sono-san.
