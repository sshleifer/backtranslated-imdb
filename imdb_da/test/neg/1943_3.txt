Overall I would call this a disappointing performance. It tries the old "Horror Anthology" approach but doesn't fail. The action was bad and it was also the stories. Of course, any skin shown in the film was random, just to attract the R class for sex. Typically, I think, but nevertheless bad. Take your $ 5 and rent a real movie instead!
