I bought the DVD out of a big tray for $ 4.99, and thought I had lucked into a documentary bead that would actually display extensive images of the Karakoram Mountains and especially K2. Fast forwarding through the movie I reached the climatic situation where the climbers get their first glance of ---- Mount Waddington, which faces all 13,260 ft in Canada's Coastal Range. At least one of the several bozos geared up to climb K2 has no idea what the real mountain actually looks like - he must be assured by his friend and climbing partner that he would not have been brought by that person partner to an ugly mountain. Considering that one of the film's premises is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on K2, you may think that the move in the question could have taken a moment or two to look up a few basic facts, but the clown seems to think that the preparations on this scale while they are good enough for those of Reinhold Messner are under him. To be honest, I haven't seen it all. What I've seen makes me scratch. They say you get what you pay for. At $ 4.99 I've been ripped off.
