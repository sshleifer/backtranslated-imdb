I suppose the former "House" movie was a hit that made Universal twist a few drops of monster cash cow. The creative team must have been in a recycling mode that begins with the opening theme lifted from the 'Son of Frankenstein' and some of the stock footage scattered throughout the film, as an unintentional fun business where footage of Glenn Strange as the monster is mixed with clips of Karloff from 1935's Bride, and compared to how robotic Strange moved, Karloff seems to be moving like a cheetah in comparison. Former film continuity is thrown by the way around the miraculous fatality abilities of Wolf Man and Dracula, but when Dr. Edelmann & Larry Talbot discovers Frankenstein's monster with the skeleton representing Boris Karloff, recognizing Edward T. Lowe at least part of the previous movie story, although Talbot never curiously mentions having met Karloff's Dr. Niemann. <br /> <br /> As this was the last of the universe's horror cycle, the overall elements of The Wolf Man and Drac (convincing) get morphed into medical ailments. Drac is told he suffers from a blood disorder, a very rare disease that allows him to turn into a bat or vapor if sunlight touches him. >: -] And Larry Talbot has just a little pressure on the brain. Of course, all this is carefully explained with a "mass" of medical jargon that is related in many scenes throughout. This proves to be the biggest obstacle, as a place along the way, that the filmmakers seem to forget about actual horror or entertainment in favor of giving the monsters conditions that act as treatable as influenza. <br /> <br /> As a big fan of the old universal horrors, it is rare that I get bored while I see one. It all just feels like a movie made just because it could be, but if that mess hadn't been merged, monsters could never have met Abbott and Costello, so I think something good came from this.
