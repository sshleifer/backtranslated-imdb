Looked months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there. <br /> <br /> Let me say most of the other reviews are very accurate. This movie was bad writing, bad acting and poor direction. I had also seen Russell and Pare "back in the old days" and were very hopeful for them. In my Netflix review I mentioned that I lost interest in the movie and continued to wash the dishes and make a sandwich, yet watch the movie from the kitchen. When I returned to the living room, I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded. I even rewind it to make sure I didn't need anything. This film was widely used on how to make a "twist" ending. I suppose the idea was successful, perhaps the script was exciting, but the budget was so non-existent that the settlers were really lacking. And yes, I suppose all the "bad sets" were an attempt to give the viewer a clue. All that was said to me was "low budget". Nevertheless, the reason I came here because at the weekend I saw a review of Shutter Island, and with what the reviewers said or did not say, make me believe that Shutter Island is the same deal, only with a budget of 50 for 60 times more! (In fact, I have no idea how much Dark World costs, but I hope they don't spend more than 1 million!) <br /> <br /> That being said, though, I thought that if someone reworked The script a bit, got a bigger budget for a better "look" (whether it meant a better scenic designer or better after-color, just a person with a vision), they could reuse Dark World for an acceptable product. Now it sounds like Shutter Island does. Looks like they got the vision right, but scripting could still be gone. Money can't buy everything, but it has to be in Hollywood! <br /> <br /> PS My 2-star rating is for Russell and Pare.
