It's probably the worst of the big Ava Gardner movies. Yes, she's beautiful. But it can be thin over time, especially after the grainy and predictable film ending. <br /> <br /> In this turkey, Robert Walker is pretending to be Eddie Bracken (who surely embarrasses him). Olga San Juan plays Jane Powell (golly, gee) part. Dick Haymes plays a kind of weak sidekick (!), And Eve Arden plays Helen Broderick (and a variety of other clever-demanding female semi-comedians). Yes, the movie contains a great popular song, "Speak Low". But check out the other, completely forgettable pieces. Dick Haymes sings really well, of course, and also the unredited vocalist dubbing for Ava. The sets are cheap, the manuscript is full of clich√©s and unsuccessful humor, and Tom Conway looks as though he has been struggling with spirits (as he was). In short, if you want to see Ava in her prime, you need to buy a photo and stay clear of this movie.
