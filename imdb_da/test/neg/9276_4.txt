The final entry into the trilogy On the Buses sees the usual wasters about their business in Wales. I feel confident that the franchise could have continued, but Harold Pinter complained that the screens made him look bad in comparison, and then no more was done. <br /> <br /> It's actually less than two minutes before we get our first dollop of sexism - a woman driving to the bus finds her breasts fall out of her dress for no reason. Yet at least Stan (Reg Varney) laughs - but then what doesn't it do? He and Jack (Bob Grant) use the whole movie to laugh fun with little or no provocation. You get the impression that they had wet to see paint dry. <br /> <br /> As before, the only fun element is the genuinely fun Stephen Lewis, fun as Blakey. However, he is alone, with a cheesy, dated script that even wastes premium talent such as Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee. Still, it seems that only Lewis understands how to sometimes shake the material, twisting laughs out of even the weakest lines. Describe how the daughter fell into a river, Stan's mom laments "I hope it's not polluted." "Now it will be" Blakey quips. <br /> <br /> The reason - if actually one - sees Stan cheat for a young girl, but is constantly being challenged by her dominant mother. It's a recipe for side spread. I'm sure you agree, and whether it is on a storm-wave boat or swimming pool, Stan and Mavis exploits always produce the same result ... boring boredom. Later conquests include Maria, an Italian stereotype and an employee employee. Even Stan's mother gets a night stand, with Stan pointing her to "put your tin trays on." When one of the comic "highpoints" is Arthur Mullard overhearing Olive trying to find a light switch in the dark ("I can't find it") and thinking she's talking about sex, then you can see why this work reaches the upper levels of literary sophistication. In fact, why it didn't come in BFI's Top 100 movie is over me. <br /> <br /> Other rib-ticking shenanigans involving Olive (Anna Karen) break their glasses. I don't know what is more surprising, the lame predictability of the setup or the underdeveloped pay-off. The short-sighted Olive follows a man in a kilt into the gentlemen and thinks he's a woman in a skirt. Next shot sees her marched out of Blakey and diverted to the ladies. And that's it. Then she ends up in another man's bed and is handed over by his wife. And ... no, that's all there for that scene as well. <br /> <br /> When Holiday on the Buses was last screened on British television, there was a breakdown in transmission. It actually came as a blessed relief.
