The story is not very strong. Don't expect some kind of "Bourne identity" kind of movie. It started strong, Tara spoke Russian and even managed to trust it. (Not that I'm the Russian language expert.) Moscow had the dark depressing look that gave this movie potential, I still believed in it. Too bad it only took approx. half an hour to see that they really missed the place with this. Action was poor, perhaps because the story itself was not very strong. There is this part in the movie, where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) has a conversation on the phone with C.I.A. as if you're listening to a Chinese sync. W.T.F!? It was too bad that the author did not even take a little effort to give the protagonists the depth. Also a bit of a cheap and easy end. <br /> <br /> Plus point is almost every scene in which Tara Reid is in. Not that she works so well, actually she doesn't. But she looks really good in this movie. Overall, it was a bit of a disappointment. Rental material ??. Maybe.
