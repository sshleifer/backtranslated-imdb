"The Chilling" directed by Deland Nuse and Jack A.Sunseri is one of the worst zombie flicks I've ever seen. Why Linda Blair ("The Exorcist", "Witchery") appeared in this stink is outside of me. The reason is really stupid: the frozen bodies of a cryogenic lab are revived after lightning and have become cannibalistic zombies. The characters are completely one-dimensional and stupid, the zombies look awful, and there are no gamers. Develop this cheap piece of waste as a plague. My rating: 1 out of 10.
