I went into this movie with very little in terms of expectations. I went with my boyfriend and two friends and none of them could explain the story of Grudge 1 to me. Well, if the first one couldn't give an impression on them to explain the plot, then I doubted that this would be better. Let me sum up what trailers tell you about: The Asian lady is back, and it's also Sarah Michelle Gellar. Fortunately for her, she is not very long. That decision may have saved his career. <br /> <br /> The movie has three stories and none of them makes sense. And even worse, none of them are developed. You almost begin to understand, and then someone dies and the story is left behind. Okay, killing people could be scary, but I was more confused about the trial than I was afraid of. They jump back and forth between all three stories that are not related ... OR are they?!?! * SOUND EFFECTTT * ~~~ The timing of the three stories is staggered, and you can tell right from the start that the movie should be at the end. PREPAREDDD. Oh wait. Sorry, this is not a Fight Club or Vertigo quality twist you could see this coming from miles away. And probably imagined a much better twist in your head ... they should have hired me. Instead of the girl making her "surprising" look, could it have been Michael Jackson instead? That part of Scary Movie 4 scared the crap out of me. <br /> <br /> The killing sequences were terribly done. Unlike past horror movies, where a killer pops out of nothing, a closet or behind a door, and everyone in the theater jumps (and then the cool guy behind you pop pops down the neck) - it lacked a scary pop UPS. They zoomed in on where the random Asian woman or child would show up, and you knew exactly what had come. Instead of making the music really loud, so quiet, so a pop out to psyche you out, the music actually gave you timing for the scary scene. If I know it's coming, it won't scare me. The movie began by explaining what "Grudge" is; When a person is killed during anger, a curse is placed in the place where she was killed. So why does the Asian lady have cursed her mother for the sake of history? And why is anger now moving countries? This movie was absolutely horrible. <br /> <br /> All it did was let me begrudging my friends to make me go - we should have seen one of the animated Pixar movies. It would have been scary.
