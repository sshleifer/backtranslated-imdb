The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater fear. Unfortunately, it is closer to a boring adventure girl and has no real horror elements. It starts with some divers being attacked and we see some blood, but that's the only blood in the whole movie. The evil underneath is not the worst around, but for a horror movie it's boring boring. The action is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you looking at is the evolving romance between the two leads. There are some nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director didn't know what to do. I needed to sit through it all (almost), but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Horror fans may want a copy for the cool VHS cover, but it's best left behind by it.
