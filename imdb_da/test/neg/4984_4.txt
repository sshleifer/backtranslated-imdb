Starring: James Belushi; Peter Dinklage; Alex Neuberger and Jason Lee Underdog are a true hero's tale. Here is the story of Shoeshine, a regular, playful little beagle. When he is dog-fitted by a megalomaniac midget hell-bent upon destruction, something freaky happens. <br /> <br /> Our nice little neighbor pooch gets extraordinary powers. He can run so fast a cheetah; fly so fast a superhero and have thunder power. He is no longer Shoeshine; he is underdog ?? the best crime fighter in the animal kingdom. The city can't sleep until Underdog scratches the evil midget Dr. Simon Barsinister and his cronies. <br /> <br /> If you fancy some really light entertainment with all the cliches of superhero action flicks, then this one is for you. As for quality entertainment, this one is strictly for the juniors. Those of you hoping to enjoy comedy of the fast-fading star -James Belushi - a word of caution: This is not one of his finer works.
