Director Delbert Mann was a much better director than this movie indicates. He instructed EVERYONE on the West FRONT, THE MEETING OF MEMORY, and LAST DAYS of PATTON among others. This mediocre, made for the TV story of Dicken's masterpiece, is so bad, even though those who are not familiar with the often filmed story will be dissatisfied. In addition to the movie being available from only two well-known vendors (Brentwood and BCI Eclipse LLC) the poor quality of the download and the scratched and muddied soundtrack make the task of finding this movie on video not worth doing. <br /> <br /> I always thought that if a company wants to put a movie on video and charge the public money to buy it, then they should at least have a copy of the movie and make a good deal work on the transfer. Unfortunately, none of the two suppliers has such a work ethic, and the result is only suitable for the purchase in the local discount store. <br /> <br /> The story is mainly told through flashbacks, making the movie episodic and talky. Much of the rich detail of the novel is lost in this translation. The characters of Martha, Traddles and others have been cut, and the relationship between young David and Steerforth has not been explored enough so we are left over why David would hang out with the guy. <br /> <br /> The relationship between David the boy and young Agnes has never been developed and it is hard to understand why she and David eventually get married. When Martha is left out, it's a mystery how Dan Peggoty finds his niece. And the absence of Traddles makes David a very lonely guy. <br /> Some have credited this movie with a good job of shortening the long novel. I disagree, it is at best a hatchet job in the book. Anyone who has seen the 1935 George Cukor version agrees. <br /> <br /> The performances in this version of Fields like Micawber and Rathbone as Murdstone are definitely worth the trouble of seeing it. And the newer version of Masterpiece Theater (April 2000) and Hallmark (2000) are both excellent performances made for television adaptations of classic novels. Directors Simon Curtis and Peter Medak, who are responsible for these films, deserve the highest praise. My last comment on David COPPERFIELD 1969 is Don't Buy It, there are several much better versions of the movie available. If it is on television, turn the channel to something else. It is a waste of an hour and twenty minutes of your life. Excuse people, but I can't praise such a terrible movie.
