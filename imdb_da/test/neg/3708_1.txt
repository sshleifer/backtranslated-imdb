It's a pity how these things are made, but again we wouldn't see the best "Dummy scene" ever filmed. Ahhh beauty with low budget Bigfoot flicks, you lean to see the beauty the more you see them, that is if your brain does not melt first. As I said before, this has the best dummy scene ever! Words cannot express it, you must see it for yourself. Amazing lines like "Smell like Decain Meat", "Thems Man ..." (You will know this when you see it). The creature makes a Blah, Blah! sound and the scene where the child is shot, makes you cry (with laughter) you want to rewind it. Has a car hunt, snowmobile hunt, a Bigfoot folk song as well as a Disco song. It doesn't end there while you see the credits that a friend noted "Wardrobe provided by K-Mart". You ask, how could you even get as far as the credits and then see them? I could only explain this as a kind of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted, you can't move, and I also think you need to know who was behind the mess. All that said, this is a must see especially if you want to punish yourself mentally. It's a keeper!
