Meltdown opens on a scene of scientists preparing to conduct an important test on a missile system developed to divert asteroids if they are on a collision course with the earth. Nathan (Vincent Gale) mentions some concerns for his, but the test seems to be an unqualified success. Then the asteroid breaks apart and the largest piece is pushed into a direct collision path with the ground. Fortunately, the huge rock jumps out of the outer atmosphere of the earth and ricochets into the room. Unfortunately, glancing blow is just enough to change the Earth's orbit, and the planet begins to spiral closer to the sun. While all this goes on over their heads, Los Angeles Tom (Casper Van Dien) fixes and Mick (Greg Anderson) is on a stake-out. They have to collect evidence against a suspected drug dealer, but the deal they are looking at quickly goes into a shooting game. Then Tom takes a few minutes to be interviewed by a local TV rep, who is also his girlfriend Carly (Stefanie von Pfetten). <br /> <br /> At a nearby hospital where Mick is treated for a minor injury, Tom has a brief conversation with his ex-boyfriend Bonnie (Venus Terzo), who is a nurse. He tells her he is concerned that their 17-year-old daughter Kimberly (Amanda Crew) is dating a man named CJ (Ryan McDonell). When Tom explains Bonnie that he's discovered, CJ has a criminal record, she's a little worried about herself. <br /> <br /> It's not long before everyone has anything else to worry about. The temperature is rising rapidly all over the world. Carly is one of the first non-scientists to learn what really happens. Nathan, who is her brother, calls her to say he can have a way to survive. Carly calls Tom; of course he immediately contacts Bonnie. <br /> <br /> In relatively short order, the obnoxious group is on its way. However, before they can reach their ultimate goal, they have to go through ties of looters, deal with a catastrophic lack of water, and manage to travel high enough to kill. <br /> <br /> Casper Van Dien is a nice guy and I actually had him in Starship Troopers. It may be because he is good at action scenes. It may also be because he did not speak much in that movie. In Meltdown, unfortunately, he has given just enough lines in situations that are just dramatic enough to showcase his very average acting. Amanda Crew is also okay, and Ryan McDonell is not bad either. Vincent Gale and Stefanie von Pfetten are also both reasonably good, but Venus Terzo is unfortunately on par with Van Dien. <br /> <br /> What really makes or breaks a movie is the story and the script. While the story here is okay and actually has some real potential, the script is just awful. The science fiction science part is non-existent, starting with the asteroid pushing the earth out of orbit and escalating with the idea that "gravity balance of the solvency" might "pull the earth back" in its normal path "over time." When the temperature in LA hits 120 degrees, cars start to burst. <br /> <br /> Do you know what's even worse than the bad science? The poor continuity. Okay, really hot. Why do people in the film not only wear long sleeves, but also jackets? Why do people flip each other for bottled water instead of turning on the faucets at home? Why are the streets completely empty, but the highway is full? And why are the motorways full of unexploded? It is almost superfluous to note that the sets, costumes and production values ​​were good, especially when it only forced me to say that the changes were not. <br /> <br /> So basically you take a pretty good story page and combine it with mostly mediocre plays, a horrible script, low-end special effects, completely irrational plot twists and bad edits, and what do you have? A movie that is even smaller than the sum of its insurmountable parts. I'm sorry to say I can't recommend Meltdown: Days of Destruction to anyone. <br /> <br /> POLITICAL NOTES: It is mentioned here that Congress finally released enough purse strings to fund the tests that start film reel While the tests here were completely irresponsible (targeting an asteroid with a key and not knowing the composition of the big stone is actually far beyond irresponsible and approaching the insane), such scenarios constitute a very real danger to the planet. Unfortunately, we've tracked nowhere near all the nearby asteroids near the ground that could be worrying in some circuits for a few days; And our ability to spot something on a collision course with us is at best limited. <br /> <br /> When we discover we are being hit, we have quite literally no system to handle it. There are no atom-tipped space missiles we can start; The space shuttle is completely incapable of going over the Earth's orbit, and if it was, we couldn't start enough of them or launch them fast enough to make it important. I am not big on the government doing anything beyond its constitutional mandates, but I certainly believe protecting the planet from destruction that comes to us from outer space can be interpreted as defending the country, right? FAMILY RELATIONSHIP: Meltdown: Days of Destruction is rated R for "little violence". I honestly didn't find the violence here any more than a pretty typical T-rated video game. If your teens are interested in seeing the Meltdown and you can't speak it out, the R rating should not refrain from letting them see it. However, leaving the younger children in space with their older siblings is not a good idea. While the shoots are not too graphic in the head, some of the dead bodies are.
