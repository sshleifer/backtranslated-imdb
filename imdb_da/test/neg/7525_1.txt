Guy Pearce looks and works like a Calvin Klein underwear model, or one of the bimbo guys wearing Levi's Jeans and standing in front of a bunch of stamped Buffalo because they realize that Buffalo as Levi is too. In each scene, Guy Pearce looks as if he says, "Look at me, I'm so beautiful!" As a hero, his character is a whole. In every scene that requires courage, Pearce gets the short end of the stick. SPOILERS: But at the end of the movie, this wimpy book-worm character runs out of a pack of baboon-like Morlocks that can run and jump along the walls (like Spiderman). About the same time, TIME MACHINE seems to cause a Nuclear Explosion of a kind that dries out a whole valley. Strange, even though Pearce and his mad-Mumba are about a foot away from the last Morlock being killed; seconds later, Pearce, Mumba and the tribe look up the valley of the safety of their mountain. Now it's quick to drive !!! Jeremy Irons as King of the Morlocks is amazing. He makes the movie much better than it was. Mumba, the model-toured actress is not very sweet, and she doesn't do much in this movie. The scenes that take place in the 1900s lack any real atmosphere. Although the period dress and vehicles are shown, the characters act as caricatures of how they imagine the 1900s that people will go and talk. The original version of this movie was much better in this regard. The sign of the period was much more realistic and they were much better actors. The original version of this movie, which made the last one, acts as the right base for the characters. This new version lacks substance and feeling. The scenes where Pearce deals with Emma's death and then does not save her from her destiny are very good. The issue of the Morlocks that are cannibals is not very well explained, and it does not make sense that they have a large, large butchery store full of knives and cutlery, but they are never seen using weapons except a blow-dart. Also stupid is the huge pit full of water and bones. Throughout the earth, Morlocks goes around chewing on fleshy bones. So how can all these skeletons be in the cave? It looks like there are some Morlocks to Bar-B-Que their people and eat them out of the grill, and other Morlocks only like filleted meat ?? And where are the toilets for all these creatures? When I looked at the dozens of Morlocks that settled on human flesh, it seemed to me to have a very sophisticated toilet and plumbing system when they threw lots of bones. All these issues were never addressed. At the end of the movie, Pearce holds Mumba's hand, but you can see that he is eye-catching his friend Mandingo. Another very annoying thing about this movie is the non-stop LION KING music that is in the background. When Pearce arrives in the future (802,710 a.d.); The LION KING music never stops, and every time the natives are around, there is the African meeting singer (is it Peter Gabriel or Paul Simon?) Who begins to cry and moan over LION KING jungle music. I saw the credits at the end of the movie and the jungle music was not specifically identified, but I think Elton John should probably investigate this issue. Time Machine was a mediocre movie with some good FX. See it once, forget it.
