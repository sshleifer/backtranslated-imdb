An antique store in NYC, played by Joanne Whalley (Valerie Alston), is put on a US court jury on a trial by a renowned Mafioso Armand Asante (Rusty Pirone), and most of this very slow movie is about trials Pirone tries to get Whalley to free him from murder by threatening to kill his son and himself. A lot of action is involved, involving gruesome mob-rub outs, scattered with Willam Hurt as gone. Much of this stupid, inconsistent mess surrounds Hurt and Asant's obsession with Whalley, the courtroom scenes that we've all seen over and over, and an end that's incredible. 3/10 is probably easy on this waste of time.
