Rossini once described rival composer Wagner's work as "some wonderful moments ... and some horrible quarter-hours". Inuyasha, it seems, can also be described in this way. It has many good episodes, but between them are countless filling episodes. The whole series consists of about 175 episodes, of which I would say at least 125 are filler or some sort of subplot (I didn't disturb to count and I wouldn't be surprised if that number was actually higher). <br /> <br /> Some of these fake episodes are actually quite fun, though many are rather stupid or boring. Nevertheless, the constant degradations begin to wear thin after the first few seasons, as the plot ends up progressing at a required crawl for most of the series. Also, character development is slower, and after the later seasons the casting has become quite immutable, resulting in increasingly obsolete jokes (especially those relating to the monk whose ironic features start as mildly humorous, but become tedious when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedly). But all this is not to say that Inuyasha is a bad series. It's just not a good series, like the Neon Genesis Evangelion eg. Generally considered to be. As something to see at the end of a hard day, it's nice, but it can never be confused with high art.
