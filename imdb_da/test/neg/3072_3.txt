Terrible. There is no way to get around. A script on par with one of some Mexican soap operas, a choice and use of the sliders' locations that make the movie's labyrinthine and at the same time repetitive and monotonous, with disastrous notions of almost the entire cast. The references to Tarantino's work, so poorly made, are more of an insult than anything else. I suppose it was not for the shameless and plot-related exploitation of Matadinho's generous curves that no one would make an effort to watch this movie at any theater. <br /> <br /> It's the kind of movies that make me have no desire to see Portuguese cinema.
