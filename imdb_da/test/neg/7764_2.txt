I know this show gave a lot of liberation to women in the late 90s and early 2000s, but come on! You have a whiner, a buzz kill and an over-analyzer. This show really made women look bad. I can't stop Carrie's analysis of every little thing on this show, and that's what really killed it for me. Also Charlotte's whining about her non-existent predictions hurt my ears, and Miranda's cynicism was a complete buzz kill. I mean, can she not just be happy? Samantha was the only cool on the show and the only one worth seeing. There was also a good episode when Nathan Lane was on the show, but it was the only thing worth seeing - the rest of them were pretty much the same. The mood was dry than a bucket of sand, and not very interesting plot line. All in all, not a very good show and I'm glad it's over.
