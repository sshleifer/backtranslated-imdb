... in search of the cheesiest "so bad is the good" movie, I have repeatedly laughed at the first fifteen minutes of different movies, to only be disappointed and bored at the end. Not this time !!! My eyes shook, my stomach and my cheeks hurried to laugh so hard in the whole movie. Of course, Hulk Hogan is an understatement and the plot is completely predictable, but everyone dives into this movie and knowing all this - all you want to see when hiring this is Hogan breaking a can of a bunch "YEAH BROTHER "s and" WHATCHUGONNADO "fly from his infamously goateed mouth. And while Hulkster on the screen piles a bit compared to Hulkster in the ring, searchers of the ultimate cheese will probably not be disappointed with this backhand gem of a flick. A laugh lift.
