Rich vs poor. Big city vs small town. White collar vs blue collar. These things are not original themes in movies. So when you choose to involve these themes, the situational history line had better been very original or very good. This one wasn't. I never believed in the romance of the two young lovers in this movie. Neither convincing nor convincing, it just fell flat. Do not disturb even with a video rental.
