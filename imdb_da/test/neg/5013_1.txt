This movie was on the pay channels today and I had nothing to do so I had it. This should be the worst football movie ever made. This must be one of the worst movie periods. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system and they gave 2 stars out of 4. This movie is not even half a star. Bad acting, Scott Bakula sinks as usual, Larry Miller ?? Sinbad, could not act if he tried. Rob Schneider's one line came entirely. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed that he himself was in this movie. The only saving grace for this movie was the hope that you would see Kathy Ireland naked in the shower, not even close. A complete waste of time and movies. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.
