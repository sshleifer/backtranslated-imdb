This movie was so predictable and badly acted. I really can't recommend it to anyone, not even to the unintentional grin. It's just pretty bad. It's pure TV movie hell, the cast doesn't seem so bad, but they seem terrible. Just be far away from this movie and rent something more intellectually, like porn.
