I had very high hopes of going into this movie. Ocean's 11 was after all a really good Hollywood product. Its quick fire jokes, incredible star force and tight scripts made it one of the most fun movie movies I've ever seen. Of course, with all the money that was made, there was a sequel to the road, and I was too excited. <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie was completely gone. Blown away by how terribly wrong things can go. This movie had everything for it; the return of the entire original cast, the same director, news stories of crazy on- and off-set antics. How could it have gone so wrong? <br /> <br /> It immediately starts with one of the most awkward and unnecessary opening sequences ever and goes downhill from there. After fair goofy short scenes between Pitt / Zeta-Jones and Clooney / Roberts, the movie uses several minutes to watch Andy Garcia Waltz from stage to stage and tells each member of Danny Ocean's original eleven that he wants the money back. Believe me when I say these scenes are only here to throw Andy Garcia's running time, because without those ridiculously cumbersome shots, his screen time would be good within five minutes. <br /> <br /> This leads me to another great nausea I had with this movie. The pacing is so uneven that the characters are dropped completely from the story, and only occasionally brought back later. Bernie Mac's character is dropped from the script early and never comes back except for 2 short scenes without dialogue. Garcia appears in the first few minutes and returns to an unusually short scene at the end. Roberts shows up in approx. 5 minutes at the beginning and is not even mentioned again until there are approx. 20-25 minutes left. Even Clooney herself uses a large part of the film in prison. <br /> <br /> It would all be excusable if the movie was fun. Not at all. 90% of the jokes fall flat and those who work are at best worth it. The "reason" is undoubtedly worthless and lets me feel unfaithful. At some point in the film, the team takes a $ 2.5 million job of the nearly $ 100 million they have to raise before Garcia's two-week deadline. More characters even recognize how absurd to waste time doing this job, but they do it anyway! Within 30 minutes, the film revolves around this job that they do not even have to do, and one gets the feeling that this part of the plot was simply added to start the time. Moreover, the equipment they use to pull off this job actually costs millions of millions to fund. Just wait until you see what they are doing to pull this job and realize that it would cost far more than $ 2.5 million to pull off. Obviously, because of this, they have to pull more jobs to make money. The beauty of the first film was the one big con and how brilliant and intricate it was pulled off. Here they draw so many jobs in many different ways that they hurry them all because they explain they would make the movie several hours long. We all know to go into this movie that there will be a big twist in the end. Thus, the nature of the hijacker film is. The twist at the end of the Ocean's twelve made me laugh; not because it was fun but because I couldn't believe how cheated I felt. I won't give it away because I know most of you will be foolish enough to throw the money down to see this movie anyway. What I want to say is that it makes most of the 2 hours you've put through already completely irrelevant. <br /> <br /> I was thrilled to watch this movie, after absolutely adorning Ocean's 11. I left the sensation as I had been the victim of a really great con drawn by the cast and the crew of this movie in fool me to think that this movie would actually be worth seeing. I never gave a 1 to a movie on IMDb.com, but there is a first time for everything. Consider being warned .... 1/10
