Contains spoilers. <br /> <br /> British director J. Lee Thompson made some great movies, especially 'Ice Cold in Alex' and 'Cape Fear', but 'Country Dance' is one of his more curious offers. The story is set among the top classes of rural Scotland and describes the strange triangular relationship between Sir Charles Ferguson, an eccentric aristocratic landowner, his sister Hilary, and Hilary's alienated husband Douglas, hoping for a reconciliation with her. We learn that during his career as an army officer, Charles was considered to have 'low moral fiber'. This seems to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition; Throughout the film, he shows an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world, and his main sources of emotional support seem to be Hilary and his whiskey bottle. The film ends with its curse to an upper-class lunatic asylum. <br /> <br /> Peter O'Toole was, when he was best in "Lawrence of Arabia", one of Britain's leading players, but the quality of his work was very uneven and "Country Dance" is not one of his better movies. He overpowered and made Charles a caricature of the useless inbred aristocrat, as if he were auditioning for some in the sketch of Monty Python's Top Class of the Year. Susannah York as Hilary and Michael Craig as Douglas are pretty much better, but there is no really great performance in the movie. There is also a little in the way of coherent plot, in addition to the tale of Charles's relentless downward glide. <br /> <br /> The main problem with the movie, however, is neither the play nor the plot, but rather the theme of the theme that dares not speak its name. There are half-hearted hints about an incestuous relationship between Charles and Hilary, or at least an incestuous attraction toward her on his part, and that his aversion to Douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. Unfortunately, even in the swinging 60s and early 70s (the film is differently given as either 1969 or 1970) there was a limit to what the British film censor's film was willing to allow and a movie with An explicit incestuous theme was certainly without limitations. (The American title for the movie was "Brotherly Love", but it was not used in the UK; was it too suggestive of BBFC's taste?) Therefore, these tips never develop and we never see what motivates Charles or what has caused its moral collapse, resulting in a hollow film with a hole in the center. 4.10
