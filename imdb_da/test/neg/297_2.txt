I have seen the first 15 minutes and I can tell that there was no consultation with military type staff. Judith Light's charactor (an officer) has her hair down her shoulders! One of the first officials to greet her when she enters the medical facility she is working on is so overweight that his pants are empty! No - there was no military advice on this movie. Even a former military admitted could have helped here.
