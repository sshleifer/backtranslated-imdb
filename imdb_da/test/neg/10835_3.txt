What a horrible movie. The effects were bad, especially by today's standards, but it was forgivable. What was unforgiving was the horrible rehashing of every flood attenuator / steam riser movie ever made in this piece of waste. The action was horrible and I mean horrible. The point in the story where Michelle Green stops to rescue a dog from the nearby torrent was fun. They see the water approaching and running for their lives. (By the way, they had to find a very old fat dog not to make Mrs Green unsuitable). They manage to exceed the water for some time before taking refuge. What speed! Later, a speed car is not fast enough to escape the flow. God, she and the dog run fast! If you want to watch a good movie about a dam breaking - it's not. Porchlight Entertainment shows some good family movies, but this time they just missed the mark.
