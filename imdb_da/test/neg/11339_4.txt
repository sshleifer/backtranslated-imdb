Stumble upon this movie on Amazon.com. Never heard of his release, but the three reviews gave it five stars and rave reviews, so it was a lover of German movies, I bought a copy ... I must not say I was not impressed. The production values ​​are inexpensive, the story is derived, the characters are less than engaging and into a comedy, it is surprisingly short on grin. <br /> <br /> I liked this, but I just found it dark and boring. Or maybe I expected more from independent German cinema than a gay spin on The Full Monty and a cast stereotype. <br /> <br /> There are bits in the movie that don't make sense at all, like one of Leather Bear's trying to get Ecki in a sling - just like he would look at him twice? Or the avenged ex-wife turns up on the fight, but ends up cheering for her alien gay man? Bunkum is not the word! Well, that explains at least the film's British title, I assume ...
