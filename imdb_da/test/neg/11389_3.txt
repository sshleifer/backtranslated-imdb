***** Spoiler or two, not that important ****** <br /> <br /> Two things stand out about this movie. Firstly, it has been termed both "Bruno" and "The Dress Code", and if you have seen this movie, you will catch the irony of it. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, solving problems completely away from the wall. The adventures of a class school dress is not something that was a crying need for a movie, nor a subject that I think most would be interested in. to religion, which is likely to open an even thinner can of worms - what did she think of? <br /> <br /> Yes, there is some humor and it is not directly offensive, but that kind of disturbing feeling at first continues to grow. It doesn't do much except repeating the liberal mantra that "different" people should be accepted (or perhaps exempted) anyway. <br /> <br /> It's fine ---- but in order for people to live in a community, everyone has to come together. Bruno doesn't just want to wear a dress, he wants to look like a miniature Gladys Knight at the awards ceremony, and his last costume makes him look like a Cabbage Patch Cowgirl Doll. Yet all the other children dress and behave like ordinary children. So what gives? If it came down to it, we could all explain ourselves specially or differently and behave the way we wanted, and the result would be total chaos. <br /> <br /> This acceptance of people who are "different" is also quite narrowly defined, I doubt we will ever see a movie about a child who finds his true self and wants to wear overalls , chase geese and go to tractor pulls, and demand everyone else just accept him as he is. "Bruno" is a silly movie and a complete waste of time.
