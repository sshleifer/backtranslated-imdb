This was a real disappointment to me. The original Bride with white hair is a great kung fu fantasy movie, but this one was pretty weak. I didn't care about the new characters that unfortunately dominated the screen and the story wasn't well developed. While the first movie was tragic and involved, it was boring (since I only counted the time to the end when the fake lovers actually met). The action was also bad in this. The games were not choreographed very well and there was not much kung-fu at all. Just a few weak swords are fighting between the very scary Lui and one of Lin's henchwomen. Lin herself mainly uses a kind of telekinesis to throw people into walls and sometimes her hair, far from the impressive show with the whip and kung-fu she showed in the previous movie. I still gave this movie a 4, because at least it was fast and I wanted to see what would happen at the end, even though I (like most who saw the first one) predicted that it would go as it did and After seeing it, I found it anti-climactic and wished they had either made a proper sequel or just left the story alone. I really recommend the first, but as far as the successor is concerned, only fans of the genre and those who really want to see Lin as the bride are once more in need.
