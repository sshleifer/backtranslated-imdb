This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and it takes the prize of the 2007 rat movie (which is made by me), yet this film goes every single ingredient in a good movie, I think the actors had a poor performance, The story is just shed. I'm really disappointed that they could have done better things than this piece of junk. I just wasted my time and money on this movie. I want the production company to be able to return my money. In any case, I had high expectations for this movie and I am disappointed. I do not recommend anyone to see this. So if you want to waste your money on something, do it on something other than this piece of junk.
