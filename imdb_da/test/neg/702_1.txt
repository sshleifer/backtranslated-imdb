This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, not seeing it, even though your life depends on it. <br /> <br /> This Laurel and Hardy movie is when they inherit an island, become shipwrecked and set to hang. An incredibly boring movie that is not as close to fun. <br /> <br /> This was the last Laurel and Hardy movie and what a very low note to finish such a great career. The 40s films were not great, this film was made in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them in their prime, the 1930s. The short talking movies are better than the feature-length movies, my favorite is "Me and My Pal". Another reason why this movie is horrible is because it is dubbed. The actor opens there mouth and the words come out three days later. Absoulutley crap, but let's end up on a high note, Laurel and Hardy have, in my opinion, been the best double action ever.
