I went to watch this movie at the cinema because of its potentially interesting subject, good cast, a director who had previously made the highly rated "Once Were Warriors" and my taste for noir-ish movies set in LA in the Fifties and Fifties . I would argue that I am fairly easy to please in this movie category; I appreciate the classics of the genre, but I will sit through and enjoy half a decent if derived effort as well. However, I found this movie quite unbearable. <br /> <br /> Despite a good situation in which to place the story, no one seems to say or say anything externally interesting or entertaining throughout the two-hour plus of this boring mess. Good actors are wasted in endless scenes of dialogue ranging from banal to embarrassing. The story is slack and unbearable, and none of the events it portrays are handled well enough to do anything but drill the audience to death. There is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no entertainment value, and in the end I just didn't care what happened because I didn't believe in anything in the movie. <br /> <br /> L.A. Confidently came out a year later, and regardless of whether a version of the story is more true to life, the latter movie deserves all plaudits for its expertise in each department. Mulholland Falls, on the other hand, falls into every department, a fact being made more tragic by the amount of talent involved. If they ever show this on a plane, I'll still go out.
