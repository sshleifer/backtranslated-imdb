This "movie" and I use this term loosely reminds me of the first joke my daughter wrote for 18 months: "P.U., smelly poopies!" <br /> <br /> As such joke, this movie can only appeal to the very young, the very immature or the very stupid. <br /> <br /> That said, there are a couple of bright spots. <br /> <br /> The effects that the majority of the reputed $ 100 million went on are kinetic and convincing - I mean, as convincing as the kind of kinetic CGI effects can be. CGI baby effects are not good, but I imagine they are very hard to do well ... even though in a hundred million dollars could have been better! <br /> <br /> Moose, the dog from "Frasier," rang in his usual exemplary performance. Steven Wright did well with a small portion. Alan Cummings was good, Alan Cummings-as-villain, as we've seen before, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable, but fun. <br /> <br /> The actress who played Mrs Avery was sweet-as-a-button as you would expect, and Jamie Kennedy stunk as you would expect. His best role so far was in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Trilogy of the Rings) and in three kings. Maybe he should stick to more subtle forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, he's not. <br /> <br /> The script and direction were at least worse than Kennedy's performance. I remember half a smart (though the seven-year wise) line that I would like someone to quote exactly for the "Memorable Quotes" section. Something about Avery's proposed costume is the "most boring crap in Craptown", it was another class joke, but kind of fun in context. Over all, since there is nothing lower than a "one" I give this movie a "one."
