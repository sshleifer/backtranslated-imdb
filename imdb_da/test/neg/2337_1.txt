Some instructors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story, David Lynch takes 2 and a half hours to gather scenes with "tracks" and his trademark odd, but there's never a story. No plot. No progression of the characters (unless you find revealed mistakes a "progression"). It amazes me how to call Lynch's trash can "art", but if beauty rests in the eyes of the guard, be it as well. Lynch's film and television work in the 1980s came as "avant garde" and "alternative" fine. 20 years later work as "Mulholland Drive" comes out as a 2.5 hour David Lynch masturbation. It is embarrassing. I have finally seen the movie that takes my top spot as the worst ever. At least, the people who knocked out "Godzilla" and "Rodan" were not going as "art".
