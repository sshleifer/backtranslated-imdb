This was just the second version of the classic story of Charles Dickens I had seen, and unfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst. The film opens with a fast-paced live action piece, where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the story of a Christmas Carol, and then of course it goes to an animated story itself. You probably know that, Ebenezer Scrooge is the grouchy cold-blooded businessman who denies charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage) who warns him about the visits of the three other ghosts of Christmas gift (Jane Horrocks), Present (Sir Michael Gambon) and the quiet future / yet to come. After all this, of course, he realizes the true magic of Christmas and promises to be nicer in the future. The only changes I noticed in the story were that Scrooge had mice as friends (a stupid idea), Scrooge's ex-love Belle (Kate Winslet), who had to see him help at the orphanage, Ghost of Christmas Present, showing them two children "want" and "ignorance", Scrooge is still joking to be kind, and he is worried that he cannot keep his promise to be nice. Also with Rhys Ifans like Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooke's nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig. The animation is not great quality, the actors have wasted their voices for a worthless piece of waste. The only good thing that comes from this movie is Kate Winslet's good voice, and sings the last song "What If," as for the rest, it's just terribly horrible. Very bad!
