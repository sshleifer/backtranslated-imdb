I will give it another chance but was very disappointed with the first one. It wouldn't keep a light on the other series. It has a lot of meaningless dialogue that doesn't add the story at all. I agree with the others that it does not seem to develop a story that is interesting. It's slow and plodding, and I only know what the Comanians are planning to do. Maybe the whole thing will tie up in the second installment, but I have to force myself to see it and find out. I'm of apache legacy from the Texas / New Mexico area, but I don't recognize much of what happens. Maybe I'm just ignorant of facts, but it doesn't do much to educate me.
