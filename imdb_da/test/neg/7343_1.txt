Man alive, is this game bad or what? The graphics are far below par, even though it was on a playstation 1, so never remember a Gamecube. The game is pathetic and the camera's movements disorient. What a worthless game! <br /> <br /> I love Warner's Batman animation altogether and it's cool that they do all the games this way. Batman: Vengeance might well have turned out great when they got off to a good start by keeping all the gothic visual and voice actors, but they seriously stumbled upon playability and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and is not fun to play at all. I really need to emphasize how bad the graphics are. Don't let the color schemes fool you. I've seen better things on a Commodore 64.
