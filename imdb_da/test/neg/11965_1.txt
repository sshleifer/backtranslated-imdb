WEll first and for most I just want to say that I'm out of retirement from writing well-deserved comments on horrible movies. Only the movie titled "Scarecrow gone wild" can bring me back, so here I am. <br /> <br /> With that said I would like to start with this comment. OUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really awful, I think I know it would be bad. But I had no idea that I would spend 60 minutes out of a possible 90 minute movie laughing at what I thought was a horror movie. Let's start with the biggest mistake in the movie (for me it is). Ken Shamrock. Now if memory serves me correctly, Shamrock is one of the world's most dangerous men. Now, if the memory serves me again, he was also in this stupid movie that is a stupid comic relief (or so to me). I mean, how else do you explain all his lines. My all-time favorite line of his in this so-called movie was "It has been a long time to come". OKAY????????? The funniest thing about this line was that it wasn't more than five minutes before he said he was sitting on the beach and talking to the soon-to-be dead children about how the damn scarecrow could not be killed. So if he is aware of this, why in the earth would he start trying to fight it as soon as he sees it (scare it). As I said before, he must have been comical relief, except that I don't think his UFC friends are doing. <br /> <br /> Now that I've finished this well deserved section for the movie. <Br /> <br /> I admit that I can't remember many scenes, and that's not good as I just watch the movie no more than fifteen minutes ago. So what to do is list the five best things that are wrong with this movie 1. Usually when horror movie monster has their own theme music, it is not heard by the victims or even by the monster itself. So why was almost every person involved in this movie capable of this pathetic whistle. I think I saw the scarecrows face and nothing about it saying he was the whistling type. <br /> <br /> 2. Why on earth was a beach murder. I'm sorry but threw out the history beaches associated with party time and vacation type emotions. But I suppose this horror movie thought it would be a success that it would change all that. Plus it was me or the beach seemed to be the size of any living room. I mean every time an actor or actress ran around the beach, it looked like they were driving in the same place. <br /> <br /> 3. The girl runs in the gray sweat pants. It really interferes with this movie. I mean, she looks so ridiculous. Plus it didn't help as she looked like she was the youngest in the whole group. I mean what was she like twelve or something. There is no excuse that someone should be so thin on the camera. I don't think the camera adds like ten pounds or anything, so what was her excuse. <br /> <br /> 4. People are trying to get record deals on camera. Just as I thought this movie couldn't get any cheesier came out, one would be Gorth Brooks and oh, he was lame. I don't remember the whole scene, but from what I remember, it wasn't beautiful. This guy starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I mean nothing to do with what happens in the movie. The funniest part of the whole event is how everyone seems to enjoy this. I think the only person who doesn't really know how to respond to this is the "token black guy". And it is boring, because if I am not mistaken, he was the one who encourages this latest addition of American Idoal. But here's where it gets fun. While this guy is all in his new song or whatever. In the distant distance we see or crooked aka scarecrow. And boy he looks at this. I think there is actually a moment when he looks like he's really jealous of this guy. So what does he do with this jealousy, yes, I'm glad you're asking. He is waiting for the guy to finish his song, and then he refines the guy. I don't want to give away the death scene, but I can tell you this. If that scene doesn't make you laugh then nothing on this earth will. <br /> <br /> 5. This movie was far beyond what I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to pull some pathetic twist-bulls ** at the end to squeeze another 10 minutes out of this movie. I mean, I admit, I didn't argue, but it had a lot to do with hoping that the movie had finished. But no they had to make the twist s ** t. Needless to say, when I say it comes, I just went from T.V. And said it was no way the movie could have gotten any worse. Thanks to my pretty quick judgment I can say that I never know what was going to happen next time. But I promise I don't care !!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything and the whole movie is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it. Just hype it up to one of your friends and see it on that edge.
