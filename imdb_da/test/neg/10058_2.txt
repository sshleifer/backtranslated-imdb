Donald Sutherland, an American paleontologist visiting England, picks up a hitch hiker one evening. Two years later, after discovering the man's address book in his car, he returns the book to man's lavish home to find out that the man has been hanged for murder. No one in or out of the family seems to care that the hitch hiker could not have committed the murder (by his own grandfather) because he was in Sutherland's car at the time of the crime. <br /> <br /> Sutherland is the man's alibi, but he's too late. From a sense of guilt, he tracks the real killer. <br /> <br /> Agatha Christie's mysteries usually involve a variety of people, all with some motive for the crime everyone suspects, and a puzzle that depends on the construction of a strict timeline. There is often not always a sidekick with whom the investigator can talk about things. <br /> <br /> Due to the situation of the situation, due consideration must be given to explaining each element of the mystery to the reader or viewer. Redundancy is absolutely okay. We must keep the characters and timelines straight. Christie's film is of the rare kind, in which the use of famous faces in child characters is actually useful. (Jacqueline de Bellefort? Oh yes it is Mia Farrow.) But this version of "Ordeal by Innocence" is a Golan-Globus production with all that means in the way of production values, a carefully prepared script and skill behind the camera. <br /> <br /> The first few minutes when Sutherland discovers that an innocent man has been hanged is fine. Then everything is thrown on the viewer in uneven scrapers, often in sudden flashbacks or in confusing voiceovers that don't tell us anything. The script has a slapdash quality as if thrown together by two hacks overnight. Few of the faces are familiar and it doesn't help at all. Everyone makes comments on everyone else, and the names become a hopeless jumble. The musical score consists of four instruments that make annoying atonal jazz riffs. Some nudity is thrown in to awaken the bulldozers in the audience. If Dame Agatha lived, she was among the viewers to shake the wave. <br /> <br /> Dullsville.
