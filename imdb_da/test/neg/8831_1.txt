I want to make it very clear that I am not religious at all. I am an atheist, but I could see Richard Dorkin contradicting again and again. I also want to make it known that I am not the kind of person who argues for something with philosophy all the time, but I feel that when comparing science and religion, we must be philosophical and willing to question the belief on the mainstream science as well as the issue of religious belief. I wonder if Richard Dorkin ever spends some time thinking philosophically about faith, anyone who thinks long and hard about science and religion will realize that science is actually a religion in itself. Yes, there is a fundamental difference in the way scientific beliefs are compared to other religions, but on its roots it is belief in a particular human instinct. Throughout this series, Richard insists on scientific methods being the only right way of thinking and that it makes sense to believe in something only if the evidence of it is strong enough. If you dig deep enough into how science works, you will realize that it is as irrational as religion, and that it comes down to faith in the end, believe in evidence, believe in our beauty, believe in our senses, but more than anything else believe in our instinct to follow patterns of repetition. <br /> <br /> This is not easy to explain, but think about how the laws of physics were decided, because they were and still are the most common patterns of repetition we are aware of. I think people have an instinct that makes them believe that the longer something stays in a particular state or a place of existence, the more we just get out of blind faith that it is more likely to be more. For example, we do not expect gravity to suddenly work in the reverse morning, by which I mean to push the case away to attract it. But the only reason we do not expect this sudden change is because we have known so long that it has always attracted as far as we are aware. But that doesn't mean that it couldn't do the reverse tomorrow or even right now. No matter how long something can stay in a particular state or change, there is no rational reason for assuming it, but we do it outside of instinct. I want to ask you to consider what is long and short? There is no such thing, I do not know exactly how long it took for these supposed sages to decide that everything should be done out of matter, sound, light, etc. But let's give them what they would regard as an edge way ! Let's say far longer than it really was 12.00 billion years! Is it a long period? 99999999999999999 years make 12.00 billion years seem like an incredibly short period. For all we know, there can be an extreme amount of change in the so-called scientific laws within the next three hundred years. It's just about comparison, only when we compare things can we say "it's long" or it's short. It is the same with large and small, wide and thin, heavy and bright, strong and weak and others. I doubt any scientist could tell me why they believe trust in this instinct makes sense. I certainly can't see why it should, but that doesn't mean that we, as humanity, need to stop using it. With this in mind, the most frequent commentary Richard Dorkins made when he said that faith is irrational is "a process without thought," he said. If what we have in this instinct I have described and this instinct that we all possess on some level is not faith, I do not know what the hell it is. Other times, when he is hypocritical, when he talks about the religions being the Bronze Age, he says "Bronze Age Myths". I would like to point out that, no matter how many scientific methods have been changed over the years due to experience, experimentation and evaluation, the clean scientific rules are becoming older and older all the time! They could even be described as the sacred Bible of science. He continued with how he is sick of the various religions that are stubborn. "I'm right, he's wrong", but look back at how rude he was to the various interviewees, he seems to be as stubborn himself. To be fair to him, at least he does not try to bomb religious communities. I appreciate his hatred for certain religious beliefs that create war, but I do not respect his arrogance in his own conviction. <br /> <br /> As far as I'm concerned, Richard has the right to believe in science if that's his way. I am also scientifically minded, but I do not think he has the right to go to religious leaders who have unfriendly arguments, try to force their opinion on them and almost describe them as stupid. Despite all his education, experience, and discovery, he seems to have failed to question wisdom about his very own system of faith. I have read what he says in defense of this argument, as obvious atheists like my own. What he says suggests to me that he is completely missing the point. <br /> <br /> Finally, the title of the documentary film Root Of All Evil. This says that religion is the root of all evil, it is not true. There are causes of evil that have nothing to do with religion. <br /> <br /> The all-round documentary series was frustrating, narrow-minded, hypocritical and flattened waste.
