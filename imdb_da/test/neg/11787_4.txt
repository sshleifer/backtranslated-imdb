Irwin Allen, former champion of cinematic schlock, drew all the stops in VOYAGE TO THE PRAYER OF THE SEA. A bad age, Walter Pidgeon, who may actually have died when he played this role, is the commander of an atomic submarine that is to be the size of the Empire State Building. Each room is gigantic and some even seem to have no ceilings. You could bowl and hold a formal ball at the same time in some of these rooms. The bottom, called Seaview, is on its maiden run when the whole hell is lost: Van Allen's radiation belt catches fire, and the ocean view must start a missile in the belt at some point, or the world will crash into global warming flames! Along the journey is a bunch of really horrible character actors, many borrowed from TV. This makes them television hackers. The worst thing is probably the poor Stella Stevens, Barbara Eden, as a naval secretary, pushing herself into tight clothes, sporting high heels, and appearing in a beach party game. Maybe it's because Frankie Avalon is also together for the trip. A poorly-aged Joan Fontaine, who is almost unrecognizable here, plays a visiting doctor with a great bad secret, but truly who cares? VOYAGE is a really bad movie, which of course is made for small children, but which child will sit still for endless pictures of a miniature Seaview model moving again and again from right to left across the screen, what is of course a study tank ? There is no scene where we think these people are actually aboard a sub. When the ocean view shakes, the actors fly, sometimes in opposite directions to each other. Like the good old STAR TREK TV series, when the bridge shakes. If I remember correctly, a fish or sea creature - apart from an octopus that is instantly locked on the bottom - is not seen as a nod to 20,000 LEAGUES under SEA. Squid, if it was genuine, was probably a foot long and it shows. Worse, when people stand by Seaview's glass nose, it is apparently a close-up that involves an invisible air hose that sprays bubbles likely to be contained in an aquarium. You have never seen bigger bubbles in your life. You would think these bubbles alone would break the damn part into pieces. Unfortunately, an elderly elder Peter Lorre is also together for the trip. Near the end, when the missile enters the burning belt, Lorre is seen enthusiastically congratulating Pidgeon while everyone else is waiting for their cue to start shaking hands and embracing each other in victory. A one-scene if I have ever seen one. What a stink. It's not even good to laugh. Stick with SILENT RUNNING.
