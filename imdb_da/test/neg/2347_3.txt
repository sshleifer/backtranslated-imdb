"The Cellar" is an unacceptably boring and child-friendly 80s cheese parade, directed by Kevin Tenney (creating the much better movies "Witchboard" and "Night of the Demons") and starring in the incredibly numerous Patrick Kilpatrick who supposedly showing a guy with emotions. The pacing is really slow, the plot feels all too familiar, the monster effects are anything but disturbing, and the film opens and ends with boring narrative narration that somehow feels independent of the film's current subject. The mood continues to rub on wind and creatures that run on the wind, but what the hell is there no wind in the plot? Like so many 80's horror films, "The Cellar" deals with cursed Indian landscapes and far too real mythical monsters hidden in cellars and quagmires. Mance Cashen and his family move into a house that builds on what was at home with native Americans, but white people came and turned the ground into oil fields. Half of the manuscript is wasted to explain the origin of the monster, but I can easily summarize it for you: An old Indian witch doctor called the creature (resembling an oversized paper mass rat) to wipe out the white people who overcrowded his land but he buried it it again because, and I quote, SOB kills the Indians too. Mance is very annoying son wakes up the accidental animal and cannot, of course, convince her parents of the big hungry rat in the basement. The alleged emotional family situation (father constantly wants his son to love him) is very pathetic and superfluous, and the film needs much more bloodshed; children's film or not. The youthful hero (Chris Miller) is quite annoying, but we have certainly seen worse children's actors in the 80s. "The Cellar" is not highly recommended unless of course you are a fan of cheesy and typically 80's monster designs. The big risky rat thing is a really good thing to see.
