Contrary to most of the comments in this section, I have to say that this movie just escapes the "bad!" Definition. The only readers who seem to be aware of what a catalog of clich√©s is, are those who, like me, live in the Northeast and first know what the area is. I am totally sick of movies that must be 'realistic', but depict the working class (anywhere) as stupid, criminal low-living, but then excuse them because of their social background. And funny? I smiled briefly twice and laughed once, but it was in conjunction with two boy players with Sunderland accents who allegedly tried to hide their Newcastle accents from Sunderland football fans! There was only a similar character throughout the film, and it was the senile grandfather who played quietly but very competent by Roy Hudd - the only non-Geordie in the cast. <br /> <br /> As for the writing - Well, I'm just wondering which university's sociology department the author studied. He certainly had no ear for the local accent. And I have never heard the term 'Purely Belts' - and not only am I a native, I am a linguist who has written articles on the local dialect. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time and views on this waste. It's not fun, it's not realistic, it's not entertaining, and it's basically dishonest.
