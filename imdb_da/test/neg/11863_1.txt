I like dark humor and non-pc stuff but not if it is without purpose but to raise yourself. Bashing a group of people without traces of self-irony is crap. There are people who could make concentration camp jokes fun, but who made this movie unfortunately even failed in the very easy task of making fun of Turks in germany It is a very easy task, but if you are Germany's equivalent to an inbred redneck ( = inbred southern from a village where virginity is often lost to livestock), you will certainly fail at this and also in life. I have heard and seen so many fun things about minorities in Germany, but this "movie" (this work being performed here is an insult to the next worst movie) sucks like the calf that the filmmakers in this movie met for some years since.
