The first question is: How many talentless idiots it takes to screw up a movie? Answer: One is more than enough if he writes the manuscript and directs it. The second question is: Has anyone taught the actors to handle weapons correctly? Answer: hell no. I wonder if Kristy Swanson was hit over the face with hot brass - because it was so! The third question is: How many times have we got the "super secret government agency conspiracy discovered from the inside"? Answer: A great couple for many! The fourth question is: is Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman overvalued? Answer: Unfortunately, in this movie, yes. The fifth question is: Can a pair of breasts save this movie? Answer: Even three (Kristy Swanson's couple and instructor / author) did not. <br /> <br /> God ... If I see (most likely) the killer getting her weapons ready for a hit, and then moron from the prop department gives her a whole different set of the first bloody thing in the ugly movie, "suck" meter hits the top. Time from the beginning of the movie to me changes the television: fifteen minutes. Just a little more than it took me in the case of "Alone in the Dark".
