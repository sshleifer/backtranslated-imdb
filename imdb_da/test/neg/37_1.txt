The first 20 minutes were a little funny because I don't think I've seen a movie, so bad before {acting, scripting, effects (!), Etc. ....} The rest of the run seemed to pull forever with each clich√© in dialogue being used for no effect. These people didn't like horror movies or how to make them or any other movie. There is no adult language, a little short nudity and no gore except false blood smeared over no open wounds, etc. It would have been rated PG in the early eighties and PG-13 today. I'm not sure how it has an R rating or if it really did. I saw the American publication entitled Hospital of Terror. I've seen 100 horror movies in the past 12 months, and that's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here is an example of how bad it is: There is a scene where something green comes through the door. I'm not sure what it should be, but what it is on the screen is some kids' green crayon scribbles (I'm not exaggerating) super-imposed on the movie, half-floating inside the door, so it should do something for Nurse Sherri to possess her, I suppose . I couldn't believe they had the lack of pride to show this embarrassment.
