I'm really surprised to see all those positive reviews for this movie. Don't make me wrong, it's not that I don't like 'these kind of movies'. <br /> <br /> While I can very well enjoy a good mindless Hollywood action blocker like Die Hard 4.0, I like 'dogma' kind of movies or 'real-life-as-it-' movies just as much if they are well made. A good example is the party (1998): no music, no dramatic camera angles, no special eg, no fancy places. Just a good story combined with excellent acting and the result is an excellent movie. Are you alive without dramatic camera angles, special examples and fancy places? Yes. Is it a good movie? I'm glad you asked. <br /> <br /> The answer is: Absolutely not. <br /> <br /> First of all, everyone is delighted with the imagined performances. I am terribly sorry, but you can act whatever you want, but if the story and the dialogue are not credible, then the play falls on the back immediately. And that's just the case with nine lives. <br /> <br /> Not once did I have the feeling while looking at 'Nine Life' that I was looking at real people who had a real conversation. I had the feeling that I was watching actors trying to cross as "real characters" while saying that a "real person" would never say in the circumstances. You can hardly call it a SPOILER, but there are some dialogue extracts below. If you think reading ten lines of (ridiculous) dialogue will ruin your movie experience, STOP READING HERE. If you want a good laugh, continue reading. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was often so ridiculous that it was tragic. Do you want examples? Lots of them in 'Nine Life'. <br /> <br /> EXAMPLE 1: <br /> <br /> The image here. Couple visit their dirty rich friends in their new mansion. The woman sees this castle of a house and says to her husband: <br /> <br /> Woman: I could get used to this (meaning the expensive house). Man: don't do it Woman: Why not? It could be. Man: No. They are who they are and we are who we are. Woman: I like the sound of it - we are who we are. <br /> <br /> Does she like the sound of it? Her husband acts as a jerk, but she likes the sound of it. Then an elderly couple walks past them with hands. This is what the woman comes up with: <br /> <br /> Woman: Look! They are like children after school. They lived through so much. Shared everything. I love you. <br /> <br /> Are they like kids after school? And then are the most overused clich√© lines you've ever heard? Finishing with 'I Love You'? She says this while her husband is a scare to her? Yes, very logical, very realistic, NOT. If anything, this kind of dialogue has made me stifle some of the characters in the movie to say these horrible, horrible things. Example 2: Elderly mother, father and younger daughter at a funeral. Father: I didn't understand that Andrew was religious. Mother: It's for comfort. Daughter: It's too strong. Mother: Life is fleeting. Father and daughter BURST OUT LAUGHING. <br /> <br /> Yes, this one-liner jumps me up anytime, especially at a funeral! Sorry, I must have missed the joke here. <br /> <br /> And it goes on and on .... <br /> <br /> What about the camera? Don't even go there. 'Boring' would be a compliment. It should come across as "realistic"; Instead, you miss half of the actors' facial expressions (the only thing left to look in this movie) while half of the time the camera is aimed at a person's back or side instead of the face. Conclusion? Well, don't say I don't warn you! It's a good movie to rent if you want to get along with your date or something under the movie because you don't even care if the movie plays or not after the first five minutes. Overrated and more boring than watching grass grow, it sums it up a little.
