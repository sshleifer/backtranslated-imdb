I had seen the Takashi Miike movies I had seen so far, but I found this rather disappointing. I had bought it, but I will not keep it. <br /> <br /> I saw it on the Adness DVD, which has only two episodes. In the first place, a killer removes women, cuts the top of their skull to reveal the brain, plants them in the ground up to their chin and plants a flower in the brain. You can see it from the DVD box. In the film, the upper part of the head is digitally blurred by the TV static. Had you not seen the DVD box, the viewer would not know what people were watching until a young policeman produced a small model of the body. It is strange that there is also a flash frame later on the woman's head and it is not censored. Apart from this, I'm not quite sure what was going on. Some women get phone calls and a sketched animated sign cavorts around when it happens. An animated character is also sometimes displayed on TV screens. It is unclear if anyone sees it. <br /> <br /> In the second episode, pregnant women are found open and their babies are missing. Again, a policeman produces a model of what the bodies are, which is useful since the actual body is again censored. There is also a natural birth in the film, but strangely it is also the baby and umbilical cord censored! According to the DVD box, uncensored versions were not stored as this was originally made. Maybe, even if they had, if they knew they should be censored, maybe they haven't resumed showing something ...? Not sure. <br /> <br /> If I hear the later episodes, it's better, maybe I'll look for them. As it is, I won't bother.
