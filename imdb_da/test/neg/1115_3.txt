I saw Wicked Little Things as part of "8 movies to die for" Horrorfest, and that was the only movie that disappointed me. In contrast, a mother, her little girl, and her teenage daughter put themselves in an abandoned house in the Pennsylvania mountains. However, every evening the avid spirits of children killed in a coal mining run and beat those they find. <br /> <br /> I think the director knocked on his viewers, was dismissed, that children would be able to murder and eat human flesh (which is lavish close-ups, as a good tribute to George Romero) because the movie just isn't scary otherwise. In short, there are far too many to establish shots of the evil children jogging to their next homicide. If anyone wants to get it in the barn, there will be a shot of the kids coming on the barn (oh the excitement) and then moving in for the killer. Come to think about why the kids suddenly go so slowly when they corner their prey? And not that I have any experience in this, but I think a shotgun blast will throw a child much more than this movie involves ...? Nor does it help that her mother is one of the worst parents I have ever seen in any movie. "The lock on the front door is busted"? You have an eight-year-old elder in WOODS with BEARS and MOUNTAIN LIONS! FIX IT, MORON !!! Plus, mother and her eldest daughter see being too close together at age - even for a teenage pregnancy, and there is a pretty incredible death that involves cheating on someone trying to push a car out of the mud with their ass . <br /> <br /> I give this a 3 because it tried. As a splatter movie, it's not bad. But for good scares, go elsewhere.
