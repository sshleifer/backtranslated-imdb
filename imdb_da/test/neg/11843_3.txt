I bought a DVD collection (9 films for 10 euros) where this was included. It turned out to be the "unknown version", no matter what it means. Besides the low average quality and short scenes, there was one thing that was really strange - the soft sex scene. It started with a seal of 2 larger breasts. After approx. 2 minutes I had an expression on my face that had the phrase "boooooooooooooring!" Completely perfect. 7.5 minutes of not even jumping concrete as breasts (at this time the chest is a bad choice) far beyond entertainment. The rest of the movie was more like "people are not / it / stupid, are they?" <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the DVD was scratched and I got my money back.
