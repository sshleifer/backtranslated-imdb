Producers Golan and Globus should have been ashamed to release this piece of waste publicly. I know this sounds like the clich√©, but compared to this, the first "Hercules" in 1983 look like a mature and exciting epic! This "sequel" is moronic, inexpensive, unfinished, childish, false, unlucky, and badly acted. A landmark in poor cinema, and one of the few, few movies I've seen that really deserves the lowest possible rating: no stars!
