This quirky and watchable movie is the story of a deceived dentist starting on his mission or crusade to fight tooth decay in the back and beyonds of Patagonia. From New Jersey, the protagonist Fergus, New Jersey, sees his crusade as a mission of great importance and approaches it with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail one might expect from a trained dentist. That adds the hilarity when his big plans dissolve and gradually break down as he goes from disaster to debacle in the Patagonian Outback on the back of a custom motorcycle or his, mobile dental unit. We never meet his wife or the rich philanthropist who sponsors the vicious mission, but we get a solid display from Lewis. Fans of his work will not be disappointed with his very credible performance as the fake dentist who is graciously loved by the innocent but sexy 18-year-old woman leader who continues to * ahem * ride. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for everyone and I can understand why it was not pushed by the costumes. It is a low budget, sometimes charming, always disarming, mildly fun and instantly forgetful movie that shows low expectations and almost succeeds.
