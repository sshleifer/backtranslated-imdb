It's hard to tell the actors from the non-actors. Poor American movies can be seen by all the young people who predict each dialogue with "You know what?" Bad Canadian movies can be seen by all the young people ending every dialogue with "Eh?" Have we not learned anything in a century of filmmaking? Can't the whole weight of millions of wannabes descending on Hollywood with scripts and wheels in hand save us from these horrible TV movie-made-to-orders?
