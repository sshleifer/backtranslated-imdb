**** MILD SPOILERS _ BUT YOU ONLY PLOT THE PLOT **** <br /> <br /> The woman is raped and decides to take her anger out of all humanity. Oh did I say the rape victim was silent? That's the problem with MS 45, Thana, the rape victim decides she'll kill men, but is there any logical explanation for any of this? Surely the whole movie would be better if we had Thana give a voice over why she bumped any man she came across? There just isn't enough development for this plot <br /> <br /> As you expect from a movie by Ferrara, it's not a waste of time. it is far better than I SPIT on your dig, and pseudo-intellectuals want a market pointing to the irony of the woman holding a knife as a penis when Thana goes on a killing spree at the end. But the script is somewhat stupid and underdeveloped and prevents any serious comment that the movie could have made
