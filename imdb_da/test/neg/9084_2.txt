Once again, director J. Lee Thompson joins actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action. In fact, this is probably Bronson's most brutal movie (something for a man who appeared in death conditions, ten to midnight and chato's land). However, brutality does not in itself make a good movie, and The Evil That Men Do is ultimately a disappointment. If you were to take away his brutality, the movie would have valuable little other interests. The story is about a retired hitman (Bronson) who lives a cozy life on a Caribbean island. He's convinced to get out of retirement to track and eliminate a sadistic torture doctor who has had his staggering trade around various South American hell holes. Throughout the film, especially in the beginning, we are treated to some graphic torture scenes to show us what an unpleasant job he is. <br /> <br /> These topics are actually quite serious. Torture takes place in oppressive Latin American dictatorships, and everyday folk music is made to suffer some despicably painful experiences simply to express an unpopular point of view. But the evil that men do - for all their dignified positions - is not really bothered by the poor people's situation. It's bothered to give Charles Bronson an excuse to blow up some unpleasant scum bags. It's just an exploitative action that hangs its coat on real issues. The torture sequences make you, the viewer, feel like a dirty, sick-in-the-head voyeur, rather like one who enjoys watching snus movies. The scripture is full of horrible dialogue, including some exaggerated descriptions of torture acts. The evil man fails to explore his disturbing ideas ... it serves them as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. Sorry, but it's just wrong.
