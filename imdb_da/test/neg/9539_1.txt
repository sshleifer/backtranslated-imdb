.... is where I suppose this movie came from. I mean, I've seen many B movies during my young life so far, and I wouldn't even classify this as a B movie. I remember watching movies in my high school mass media class that surpasses this one. <br /> <br /> So the premise is ... a lot of dancing numbers and stupid crap happening. Women in bikinis who are not even good at first, dance in the beginning and sing. Guys with hairy coffins pop up and girls with fangs out in the sunlight. I mean, I can hardly put together a coherent sentence just thinking about this movie. According to most people on this page, Manos Hands of Fate and Pod People are the worst movies (MST3K classics :-D) ... I used to be one of them. Then I saw this movie. Usually I don't try to ruin a movie too much, but the people who did this really deserve it. It's so bad and the unbearable, and I suppose the director or an actor in the movie is the only person who has rated this to ten.
