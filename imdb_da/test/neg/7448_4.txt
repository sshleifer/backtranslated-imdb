I was a big fan of the original Robocop. <br /> <br /> But to say I was disappointed with this first sequel, it would be an understatement. <br /> <br /> The problems are many. <br /> <br /> Glossy though the movie can be seen, there are plenty of bloopers on the screen for everyone to see, wires, cameramen, etc., something I find completely unacceptable from any of Irvin Kreshner's pedigree. <br /> <br /> Robocop has become a robot. There is no human spark in the character here. A real disappointment when you think his "soul" had come back at the end of the first movie. Here his attitude shows no human side and makes him difficult to sympathize with. <br /> <br /> Caine is a bad villain. OK I know Boddiker from the first movie was better than average, mainly thanks to Kurtwood Smith's performance, but the normally solid Tom Noonan creates a sign that you couldn't care less about one or the other. <br /> <br /> What's happened to the old man ????. I appreciate that he didn't come to where he is being "nice", but the change in his character here is nothing short of dumbfounding. In the first film, it is clear that he despises Dick Jones tactics and attitude, and yet he is no better than Jones. It makes no sense. Doctor Faxx is a bad replacement for Bob Morton's charismatic, unpleasant, OCP resident genius. <br/> <br /> The action sequences, save the sequence where Murphy is stuck to the side of Caines truck, is hard and uncomfortable and is repelled rather than entertaining. <br /> <br /> And finally. What's with the musical score? Don't tell me that Poledouris couldn't have done it simply because he was working on Total Recall at the time. A series (TV or movie) soundtrack is part of its personality. Part of its character. When you remove it, it damages the knowledge of the characters we see. So that's bad enough, but shame on Leonard Rosenman. His score here is lurid, camp and even worthy. <br /> <br /> History has its moments to be fair. There is a lot of originality in here. But it is trying too many new things to take with a movie. The hob is a well-developed villain and the only truly rude "villian" in the movement, Thumbs up to Gabriel Damon there. <br /> <br /> The final showdown between Robocop and Robocop 2 is also fun. <Br /> <br /> But for the vast majority of its long running time, it's a serious disappointment.
