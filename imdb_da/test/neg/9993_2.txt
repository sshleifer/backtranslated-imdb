When I read the script online, I thought "Capote" needed a trim. When I just saw it on PPV, I can tell you it wasn't trimmed, it was slaughtered like the poor family! Example: In the script Truman Shawn doubles "Adorable One"; here he is "Mr. Shawn". <br /> <br /> Bad enough the amateurs behind this movie deflamed Capote and bash his circle (do we really think they believed so little of Nelle, they lacked their little opus as an unpleasant in-joke?) they turn Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he has shown to send Clutters. It's one thing to fudge the facts, it's another to release the ball: the executions were performed between. 12.45 to 19.00, April 14; Truman is shown in prison 22 hours later! <br /> <br /> I was totally underwhelmed by "acting". Keener doesn't even try to sound like an Alabama native. The way Cooper kept shouting "Alvin!" I waited for Chimpmunks to show up! Hoffman does not give us the charming gadget, but a pathetic sigh-up that sees a horrible act as his ticket to the big time. When Hoffman whines about being "tortured" by the endless appeals, I would give him a shotgun so he could do both of us a favor and blow his mind out!
