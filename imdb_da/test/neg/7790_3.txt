I had once had a conversation with my parents who told me British moviegoers in the 1940s and 50s, would check to see the movie's country of origin before they should see it. No matter what the plot was or who was in it, if it was an American movie, people would like to see it, and if it was British, people wouldn't see it. This may sound like a ridiculous generalization, but after seeing the ASTONISHED HEART, I understand why, in those days, people preferred American cinema to the domestic latitude. Back in the 1940s <br /> <br /> British equity was devoid of working class members and it shows in this movie. Everybody speaks in an English let the upper class accent, which makes the British royal family like working class foam, and what this does is alien a large amount of a potential British audience who undoubtedly prefers to see Jimmy Cagney in WHITE HEAT because people would have, if not related to so surely empathized with a violent gangster on cinematic terms more than some high class English shrink in 1949. It's entertainment, the reason why people go to cinemas. Even the characters' names seem bizarre - Leonora! How many British people named Leonora in 1949? And the protagonists drink cocktails. And they use words like "Austere". You get the feeling that this was not marketed to a British audience from 1949. But why would that, if the majority of British cinema dealers drove into cinemas to see much more entertaining US imports? <br /> <br /> Looking at ATSONISHED HEART in 2005, I was surprised at how dated everything was, in fact it is so dated, I thought maybe it is a spear from HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW. What did not surprise me was that these types of movies came close to sinking the British film industry, an industry that didn't go to US money invested in crowd pleasers like ZULU, ALFIE, and James Bond films
