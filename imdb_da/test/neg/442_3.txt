I was a fan of the AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON movie, and it was so curious whether a 16-year-old successor could be done with French language and locals resume large, supporting and minor characters. Tonight I looked at the "edited for the FOX Network" version, which was a kind of curious hybrid of several hyperactive followers. Screenwriters and directors pay tribute to some of the most important plot concepts: Tourist gets wolf, full moon comes out, boy meets girl, boy becomes animal, boy dies heroically death by help of ghost victims. For me, the strangest aspect of this "formal" teen horror special effect ride was the casting of schoolteacher-love interest in television comedy "ED" as one of the wolf's clueless victims who are more or less completely unsympathetic in Scripture lines gave her. I haven't seen another scare button that this movie is "sequeling" (a vampire fight called BLADE), but I think parts of its plotline should explain how villain was waving (they are spoofish) threatening it "good" werewolves during a long part of the film. There is also a final conflict in a metro station in Paris, a la SPEED. This study product from 1997 is a weird hybrid of a movie, as significant technical effects have been shown for frightening purposes, but the authentic terrors of the original are completely undermined, in my opinion. Such a weird rewriting of the werewolf and "movie mythology"!?! My suggestion to those considering this in the video store - go to a classic "top of the line" Thriller instead: Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO!
