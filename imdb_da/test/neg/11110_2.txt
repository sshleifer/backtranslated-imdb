Excerpt from TV GUIDE: <br /> <br /> This week at LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing has his hands full when a cryptozoologist comes aboard with an unexpected cargo! Join Captain, Isaac, Gopher and Julie in a fun Halloween Special. The guest starring a guy in a really bad eyelid like Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> This is typical, the Lame Sci-Fi Channel picture prize. The captain of a cruise ship, played by the once respectable John Rhys-Davies, is in charge of a carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. His daughter is together for the trip, and she serves her by being the ship's kickboxing instructor. Be aware, everyone, that kickboxing will come in handy later! It should be noted that the captain's daughter is rather uncoordinated and painful to see. It would have been good if she might have taken a couple of kickboxing classes before trying to play a movie director. Captain Stupid and his daughter conclude with Mrs Thurston Howell of Gilligan's Island, a boiling crypto zoologist and a dark, mysterious stranger at this 90-minute drive of boredom. That's right, I said cryptozoologist. He says that he has brought a lot of precious cargo on board, which he must check out. Needless to say, the box contains a Chupacabra that someone decides to let out. From this point on, a man in rubber runs Chupacabra suit around the ship and kills people. Captain Stupid is powerless to stop it. He decides to call the Marines, but tells them there are a lot of terrorists on his ship. <br /> <br /> The marines respond. They say everything that Marine speaks things like "Hooya" and "Get Some". But the stupid Marines are no match for a Chupacabra. They do not really tell anyone where they are going, so there is no help in sight. I don't think nobody really wants to miss some lame battalion of lost marines. But don't forget ... Captain Stupid's daughter is fortunately a Kickboxing instructor. Yay too little stupid! She comes right in time, she beats the blood-dry goat Sucker and saves the day. Chupacabra means goat sucker. Therefore, sugar Chupacabras. But there is no way that Chupacabras suck anywhere as much as this movie.
