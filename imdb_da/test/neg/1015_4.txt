Since Paul Kersey was shorter than the actual relatives to avenge, the third installment in "Death Wish" turns the saga upon him returning to New York to visit an old warrior. He only comes to find out that Brooklyn has completely transformed into a paced gangland, and that youthful gays killed his friend and continually terrorize all the other tenants in a ramshackle apartment building. Kersey makes an appointment with the local police officer, conquers the heart of his blonde lawyer, strikes many villains with an impressive Wildey Magnum gun and gradually trains and inspires the petrified New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Okay, it's no more defending the series "Death Wish" after seeing part three. The 1974 original was a masterpiece that dealt with the social drama as much as it did in retaliation, and although it was pure exploitation, part two still had some redeeming qualities, and at least the events were logically linked to the occurring first. above all. Number three often feels like a completely separate franchise. Apparently, Kersey is no longer an architect, he is ten times more social and talkative than he used to be, and suddenly no one, not even the police, is more against vigilant actions? All these changes and several other aspects make it clearer that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson reduced their "Death Wish" success to being a purely brainless and exploding action series with a huge increase in every episode, arsenal that grows more and more explosive and criminals who get nasties, slimmer, more profound and much harder to kill. But the gentlemen did not seem to realize that the uninterrupted spitfire of violence actually creates an opposite effect, namely, this extremely monotonous and much more boring than the two previous ones. I once read a brilliant review that referred to "Death Wish 3" as the pure definition of cinematic masturbation. This description cannot be more spot-on as the script tends to migrate from a conflicting execution sequence to the next. Especially the last 20 minutes is a complete "orgy" of gun fire, explosions and executions realized through improvised homemade measures. Yi Haaa! This entry into the series has a quite interesting supporting cast, including Martin Balsam ("Psycho", "12 Angry Men") as the fatigue next door that holds machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter ("Family Plot", "The Longest Yard") like the little unorthodox copper and even Alex Winter (from "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure!) in his debut role as one of the fines.
