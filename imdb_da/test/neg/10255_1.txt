I don't really know why so many people love this movie: maybe it's fun, OK, but it has completely ruined one of the best novels ever written. As the author himself has said, this film has betrayed the book: Not only the story is severely cut to approx. 1/3, but all symbols, all that complicated, are lost in an 80's fantasy / adventure movie for children. Today we have effects, directors, a new attention to books: I hope someday (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki ...) will one day lead the REAL Neverending story. A great writer of death, a wonderful book and many literary lovers deserve it.
