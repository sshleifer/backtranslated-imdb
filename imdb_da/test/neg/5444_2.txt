Poorly acted and poorly directed, "Congo" attempts failed to restore the feeling of "Jurassic Park". But the truth is that the book was not so great either. The film's first problem is still that Tim Curry's character was added; The second problem is that the talking arm was added; The main problem, however, is that the cast members do not create realistic characters. I guarantee that this movie doesn't make you believe there are killing gorillas anywhere on earth. Also starring Laura Linney (congratulations on the day, Laura!), Dylan Walsh, Ernie Hudson, Grant Heslov, Joe Don Baker, James Karen and Bruce Campbell; I guess they don't want to emphasize this movie in their CVs.
