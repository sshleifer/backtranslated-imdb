This movie is actually so bad in its desperate attempts to be "feel good" and relaxed it made me really embarrassed to see it. I can't imagine how the inner circle of Norwegian celebrities and the press must have felt trying to suffer like it at the star-filled premiere. Its great media reviews are a boring example of how ridiculously small and inbred the Norwegian media scene is. If a foreign film of this quality had reached the silver screen, it would have got the rain of rotten tomatoes it really deserves. <br /> <br /> The combination of literally amateur actors, homemade style visual effects, awkward dialogue, painfully inactive attempts at the working class humor and the overly cozy and pointless plot really make it a rock-bottomed movie. Stay away.
