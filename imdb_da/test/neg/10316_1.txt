I broke my own rule to buy this movie from $ 5.88 bin at Walmart. Basically, if a movie has a big star in it and you've never heard of it before, it's usually for a reason. Well, in the case of this movie, the reason it sucked! They plaster Sandra Bullock's image and name the entire DVD's cover as bait, and it reeled this little fishie right in. I was thinking of donating the disc to charity or giving it to the library, but I don't think I would like to submit anybody else to world to this movie. The worst lines: "What do you mean by your friends' arms?" "What do you mean, your father?"
