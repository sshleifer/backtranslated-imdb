I have read lots of Jane Austen in my time and approve several cinema / TV adaptations, but this one we just don't need. <br /> <br /> Rating is a 2, which I would not say, it is terrible just so boring you will feel that you have wasted 90 minutes in your life. Dull script matched with even duller acting. I've heard Billie Piper's ok in Dr Who (not a fan, so can't confirm), but in this she just sucks. There is absolutely no chemistry between the managers. This is Austen, it's supposed to be a romance! <br /> <br /> Don't let Austen or historical dramas be removed. There are plenty of better programs to watch.
