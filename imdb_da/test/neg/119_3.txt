Technically I am a Van Damme Fan or I was. This movie is so bad that I hated myself to waste the 90 minutes. Don't let the name Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II) fool you, I had great hopes on this, depending on what I saw in (Undisputed II), man .. was I wrong ?? all the action fans wanted a big comeback for the classic action hero, but i think we can't see it soon as our hero continues to come with them (the go-to-border - far-away-by-and-kill - the-bad- boys-end-comeback-home) movie I believe for God's sake, we are in 2008, and they insist on making the disappointing movies at all levels. Why ??!!! Do yourself a favor, skip it .. seriously.
