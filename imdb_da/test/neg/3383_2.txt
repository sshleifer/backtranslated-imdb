What an absolute joke of a movie. The case for this movie would have you believe it's Duel meets Jeepers Creepers meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Three good films in themselves, and you would think, using their blueprint, MM could not go far wrong. That was what I thought, and I was very, very wrong! <br /> <br /> We are following two college students as they travel miles across the desert to reach a wedding. They pick up a girl (no, she doesn't get the clothes off), then they are being chased by a Leatherface rip-off in a Monster Truck, which they appropriately name F ** kface (AKA Monster Man). <br /> <br /> Monster Truck I want to admit is a very cool vehicle, but the less-than-exciting hunting scene destroys that potential. <br /> <br /> So MM decides he has a bit of courage for these guys and chases them a bit, they lose him for a while and stop at a bar full of amputees, then they go to a motel where lead person Adam sleeps with hitch-hiker Sarah (though they both wear underwear!). Then they are caught by MM, taken to his home, where they escape death and try to kill MM, but therefore fail the setup for the successor. Except for a smaller "twist", that's it. <br /> <br /> If you can get past the first 2 minutes ?? where Adam's friend Harley emerges from hiding behind Adam's car to try to scare him, without explaining how Harley came right there, how long ago or how even Adam didn't realize ?? without believing you already hate it, you can just enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Monster Man has very poor filmography and direction, which immediately breaks. This is the kind of movie you can download as one of those movies in a box of 20 horror movies that you've never heard of. What's so annoying is that Blockbuster is making so many of these poor-quality movies shot on digital by some amateur movie students, and that's exactly what MM is (although IMDb says this director was born in 1961). movie is horrible. The scripture, which the author of course considered fun, is annoying and childish. You get the impression, only a draft was written before they started shooting. In fact, the manuscript makes it very much the film seems improvised, full of the boring, unattractive conversations that are only fun or important to the people involved. Imagine you have filmed yourself and your friends have a conversation, surely, points are fun ?? TO YOU, but mostly it's the trash. That's what the script for MM is like. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it either? It's pretty minimal and there are much better gory movies out there (Bad Taste, Evil Dead et al) Jeepers Creepers 1 & 2, even with their cheesiness and plot holes, is far better than this movie. Compare the intro to Jeepers Creepers for the intro of Monster Man and you will see what I mean.
