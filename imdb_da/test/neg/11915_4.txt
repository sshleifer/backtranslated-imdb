Based solely on the novels of Earl Derr Biggers, 20th Century Fox's Charlie Chan series showed a favorite among the audience - but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, they would fear the studios turning to their Asian hero. This was a miscalculation: The actor Sidney Toler took the role of "poverty line" Monogram Studios, where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947. <br /> <br /> 20. Century Fox had considered the Chan films as cheap "B" movies, but even though the studio took great care of them: the plots were often stupid, but the pace was sharp, the dialogue witty and the casts (which included Bela Lugosi and Ray Milland) always expert. The result was a friendly charm that has been the time test. Monogram was another matter: Chan films were "B" films clean and simple. Slightly carefully taken with scripts or cast and resulting films were flat, mediocre at best, at least almost inflexible. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a suitable casting and a few interesting plot units, SHANGHAI COBRA is one of the best of the Monogram-made Chan films - yet it is almost impossible to achieve a uniform mediocrity. In this particular post, Chan (Sidney Toler) is invited to investigate a killer who kills with what appears to be a cobra-like bite; at the same time, he decides to make sure that a governmental introduction of radium tucked away in a bank vault in all places remains safe. Do these two seemingly independent plot lines together? Well ... could be! Sidney Toler is always fun as Chan, but most of his Monogram performances seemed "phoned in" - and it's just as true for COBRA as it is by any Monogram Chan movie. As usual, the really fun performing artist is Mantan Mooreland. Change times have led us to look at Moreland's comedy as a demeaning for African Americans, but he was an expert actor and comic book, and taken within the framework of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s, his work has a tremendous charm and innocence. Fans of the 20th Century Fox series are likely to find Monograms Chan a major disappointment, and beginners who like the Monogram films will probably consider them third rate after hitting the Fox movies. Like other Monogram Chan movies, SHANGHAI COBRA is best for specific solar collectors. Four stars and it's generous. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
