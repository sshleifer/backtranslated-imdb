I went into this movie, expecting / hoping for a spinning style match in the 70's exploitation, but what I got was more of a bizarre pseudo western with too much to talk and not enough action. Obviously, this movie was made on a budget; The location is boring and badly shot, while the play leaves much to be desired as well. The plot focuses on a trio of robbers (a father and two sons) who steal a lot of gold after killing some miners. They come across a cabin, inhabited by a young girl and her founder ... and all this is told in flashbacks by the young girl currently residing in an asylum. Clearly, CEOs Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were doing something really shocking; But despite its best efforts, the South of Hell Mountain is just too boring to shock the viewer. The movie drones for about 80 minutes, and most of it consists of boring characters that play dull and prolonged dialogue. The only good thing I should say about the movie is the music; which is good in places. The end is the only other good thing about the movie; And that's just because it's the last thing to happen. I would not recommend anyone who annoys this tracking ... there was much better garbage bin in the seventies.
