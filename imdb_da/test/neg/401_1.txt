My wife and I saw this after DVR'ing it from Encore action this past week. It must be the worst horror flick we had ever seen. Predictable dialogue (my wife and I guess the lines before they were spoken), hokey special effects, a manuscript that ran everywhere. I think the part that was the most annoying was the stereotype of the different characters in the plot, not to mention the free sex scene between two heroine heroines in the movie, none of which had any purpose other than to carry certain parts of their anatomy to the cameras. This movie should be categorized as comedy, not horrible, as the villain in the movie (spiders) was stop motion animated and not credible at least. I cannot say that I would have done a better job of making a movie myself, but it was very amateurish and was not even a "B" movie, a place closer to a "d" movie or "f" if it is possible. I think even the Science Fiction 3000 should pass it on!
