By writing this review I find it hard to try to think about what to write about. Nothing happens much in this movie. The story is a South Asian woman who falls for an English Londoner. The problem is he and his friends have had a racist streak. At the same time, her friend at work is unconscious for her to have sexual relations with her brother and it escalates right from there. The problem is that this movie is very predictable. As soon as all of these things have happened, it is mostly standard. It draws a bit, although it is only about 90 minutes long. This is more of a Chick Flick than anything else. So if you're a man, I don't recommend this movie to you.
