It's not that bad, it's good. It is so bad that it violates the Geneva Convention's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Only by reading Synopsis can you even find out the "plot" of this straight to video disaster. It's a hodge-podge of grain stock footage spliced ​​with some of the all-time worst deals you've ever seen the accident. Comparing this incompetent, turgid, humorless root to "Dead Men Do not Wear Plaid" is like saying "Gigli" is like "Citizen Kane". The talentless cast is costumed in cheap, J.C. Penney "Goin to Church" clothing and there is no slightest attempt at period hairstyles or make-up. If you really want to see how this kind of "shelf" can work, check out the Cadavra's lost skeleton - It is wise, well-written and best of all, done by the actual actors who are not so painful to watch. Ultimately, search the work of Phoenix artist Paul Wilson whose Sci-Fi card "Attack of the 70 foot Courtesy Lady" leaves this film in the dust. The people in Terror In the Tropics look and sound like they were pulled out of the street and made their scripts read under one and only take. This is an insult to Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney, and everyone else involved in the movies they are cannibalized to make this schlock party! Money is not the problem - Much can be achieved with very little expense. A good script, decent actors and over Z-Grade costumes and production designs should have been a given before the so-called director created this stinking pile of film waste. Let us hope that the "promise" of a sequel does not come true - It was by far the scary thing shown throughout the film !!
