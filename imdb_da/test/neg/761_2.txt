I think South Park is fun, and I have no problem shooting people on the left, but you think after taking a whole movie to attack celebrities to risk their career Take an illegal war and then to be GASP right together, they would have meaning to start giving w. and the bastards destroy the land a shot or two. Bush seems to have a beautiful free run from these guys for as stupid and shaken as he is. <br /> <br /> Gore is a fair game, but thank you, what should the Republicans do, how badly they have to drive up the country before these guys finally appear, maybe they are not just trying to do the best they can and that they have made some true screws up ... or maybe just go after rush limbaugh ... hes a good goal ... or even just having fun with the kondoleeza rice's goosebumps.
