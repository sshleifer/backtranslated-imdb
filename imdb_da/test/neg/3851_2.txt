It is clear that this does not aim at the brain: The so-called "humor" is based on farting and any clich√© on any ethnic genre you can imagine, homosexuals included of course, as long as they are not WASP. And a latino cowrote this? In addition, John Leguizamo has talent and charisma, but in such a self-releasing movie it is a particular waste. What is the purpose of trying Jim Carrey himself? The "pest" of the title could then be this movie, almost as fun as Bergman's finest. Prepare to be annoyed, not amused
