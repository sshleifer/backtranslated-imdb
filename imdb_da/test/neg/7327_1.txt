A study in BAD. Poor direction, bad acting, bad writing and f / x that will teach you better upgrading your computer before filming. It's the kind of girl you used to do full of in your basement with dad's camera when you were young at heart. But you certainly won't show it publicly when you're enjoying again, would you? You wouldn't even see it. Avoid at all costs.
