It's hard to make a bad movie with the "underdog finally successful" sports theme, but this movie succeeds admirably. I think of how pointless and boring this movie is. <br /> <br /> I think the director couldn't decide if it was about the runner or the coach. It ends up being either. In the end, who cares? Neither character has a sympathetic personality. There is nothing in the movie that makes you interested in anyone. Even the "bad guy" is not really bad. (I think he's in two scenes, and apparently is on a kind of barbituate.) I think he asks her, once and politely, to leave the coach and train with him. Then he asks a little, 'sorta', that she should come in with him. that is it. Conflict! Excitement! What should she do? !! <br /> <br /> And what about the picture of driving? Has the instructor ever seen a real marathon? Christine's shape is so wrong, it's absurd, like the supposed "champion" she's competing with (A character without lines - maybe they could have hired you know, an actual RUNNER?) <br /> <br /> - And the speed that is driving is without understanding. Were they running or going? It's actually ridiculous. I can literally go backwards faster as they ran in the big race. Maybe it was too hard to move the cameras in real speed? Another absurdity: (spoiler, I guess) At some point in the big race, the two women in the leading edge fall inexplicably at the same time. What they fell on is a mystery. Maybe they were both just exhausted and fell down? -And then they get up, but don't start running again for maybe 30 seconds. Oh yes, very realistic. This ridiculous event does not even add tensions as the other runners are not dense, and besides this you have been numbed in a state of catatony. I especially enjoyed how all four of her male teammates, highly educated athletes all fall out of the big race because of charlie horses, or pulled tendons or something as unlikely. <br /> <br /> But who cares? This movie has almost no voltage, no resolution, nothing. Some women runners with absolutely no personality are discovered by an old boring trainer with some previous failure that is hardly suggested. They train a lot. She is not happy. They train some more. She then wins big races. Woopie. <br /> <br /> My description is actually more interesting than the actual movie. I just saved you 90 minutes. Avoid this as bothered.
