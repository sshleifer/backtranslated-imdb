The network is a movie I never saw on release, I remember giving it a pass on the mediocre reviews and since then maybe having noticed a piece here and there when it has been on TV. Seeing it now, fourteen years after the original release, I'm a little flabbergastet about how time flies. Being in my mid-20s, it made my childhood feel old. I felt like I should probably do some exercise before my body begins to fill fat in all the wrong places. Cut down on fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes. <br /> <br /> Anyway, that was the best part of this movie experience for me. I would say that the first 30 minutes of this movie really kept me inhabited with the retro sky. Look at the big cans they call computers. See, they chat in chat rooms! I remember the tops! They look .... stupid. And hey, even the stars Sandra Bullock. First billed! Do you want to have a look at it. <br /> <br /> As a movie, The Net is just an imaginative, ordinary and completely routine Hitchockian cat-and-mouse thriller. Nothing archaic about it, they made them as much as they do them now. Bullock plays a recruiting computer geek who is tasked with correcting software for people who do not get "the whole computer thing". As it does, she stumbles upon some delicate information, and after her holiday flight ends up being almost killed by a sexy play that turns out to be a killer (played by Jeremy Northam, and she should have been suspicious that They are in an American movie and the guy both smokes and has a British accent!) She gets her "identity wiped out". Her house is empty, for sale, and by checking it out it turns out that she now has a new identity. A doomed prostitute and cheat, no less. <br /> <br /> Now you can say that this is unlikely. How could they possibly do it for her? Even in 1995, it is impossible! It's true, but back in 1995, many people didn't even know what the Internet was. I can see how it is a plot hole you could have accepted then. What is more disastrous, however, is the inconsistencies that have nothing to do with technology. The movie is obviously due to Hitchcock movies (it is one of the thrillers who have a good walk around at night), but Hitchcock always made sure his movie was plausible. The characters did not act as confused lunatics as they tried to prove their innocence, and the plot did not comfortably lay down for a structure in which an obstacle inevitably leads to the other. The characters also tried a little before they entered the whole rouge hunt. Does Bullock's character really have no friends what ever? Could no old high school teacher confirm his identity? Or like ... her nearest pizza guy? Oh right, she orders pizza from the internet. Forget it. You figure out the movie pretty quickly. There seems to be hope from a former girlfriend. Do you really think so? You should always count on at least one surprise. Net offers none. <br /> <br /> The internet pose a lot of danger, this movie seems to predict. But if the movie was made today, imagine the problems that the bad guys would have to go through to ensure the identity drowning. Not only do they do all the boring literal things she still wants to have Facebook membership, with at least 100 friends or so and picture tags, not to mention that she might be on YouTube or Linked-In, and what about her video blog featuring as 150 daily hits or webcams in her house and recorded video of her in others cell phones, webcams, web downloads ... her IMDb membership?
