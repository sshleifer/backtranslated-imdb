As I lean after watching Wong Kar-wai's 1994 movie Ashes of Time ?? more specifically, 2008 will change and republish with the word 'Redux' turned on at the end of the title ?? I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the movie just didn't work. I wonder why the movie hasn't scored any important points in my book. What was it especially about the movie that dragged it down and made it the director's worst movie in his career? It's not too hard to figure out really. Let me just say that it really is a shame that Kar-wai suddenly fell into this hell hole of mediocrity and poverty in moviedom, especially considering the fact that in the same year he released Chungking Express, one of his enduring legacies and an absolutely sublime film. So ?? what went wrong? It would be appropriate to consider Ashes of Time as something of an experimental movie. Our instructor basically places his own endless style of film making and places it in a completely different setting, mood and atmosphere; What results is a disastrous film that is everywhere and simply does not pull out. Therefore, it would be even wiser to call the Ashes of Time an erroneous experiment. Bold, bold and innovative, but a failure anyway. <br /> <br /> Let me elaborate. Those who have seen the movies from Mr. Kar-wai, a Hong Kong-born film writer who has noticed the art world since its debut in the late 80s, will know that there is an extraordinary aesthetic that binds all of its films together; Important and frankly, they are all colorful, thoughtful, gracious, subtle humorous and meaningful statements of life, love and loss. The same formula is transposed into Ashes of Time; But the fixed attitude in Hong Kong has been rescued, and instead we are located in ancient China and the country where the legendary martial arts warriors and the timbres are together. <br /> <br /> The intertwined in this quasi-fairy tale / historical creator is the typical Kar-wai love story, this time with an elegant jogger who has moved to the center of the desert and performing contract killings. However, I must stop there; Description of characters is a useless thing to do. Why? Because not a single person in Ashes of Time is worth mentioning or nothing. What a boring throw and what a waste of talent (Ashes of Time contains almost all common Kar-wai partners). Not only that, but the film is essentially endless incessant walking in a horrible, almost non-existent narrative structure. One of the main reasons for the ash of time is that it is because it does not seem to have any plot at all, let alone an expression or an indication of one. You can definitely see what they get, even from the first two, three minutes, maybe less, of the movie. Perhaps it's just the atypical attitude of ancient China that is unused and inappropriate for Kar-wai's typical movie-making style. I like to think how unfortunate it is that Mr. Kar-wai just filled up great time here. <br /> <br /> One thing that a reviewer can actually compliment in Ashes of Time, albeit compliment is highly isolated, is another director's trademark ?? wonderful colorful and happy aesthetics. What a delightful color is composed on the screen, which radiant textures are painted for us, and which breathtaking landscapes and footprints are captured for us throughout the film. We can at least take this as a sign that Wong Kar-wai is still at heart and it is just the movie that is so atypical and burying its usual commendable nuance. Although the pictures are not enough for us to fully remove Kar-wai for this disastrous venture, are they enough to make the movie worth it? and at least we do not leave the film in a completely and completely cantankerous mood, now that there is something we can think of nicely. The film is essentially a "wuxia art" film that follows in style, says legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. One thing, however, distinguishes Kar-wai's film from Kurosawa's best, and that is that in the Japanese director films everything goes together and simply works. In Ashes of Time, nothing seems to work. Kar-wai's attempt to make a really deep wuxia movie, let alone an intellectual and provocative film in general, is a vain attempt. <br /> <br /> Kar-wai claims that Ashes of Time exhausted him and needed time to clear his head. It must certainly have been exhausted on his behalf, as his efforts have been covered in the film and transferred to us directly? I think just watching the movie is an exhausting effort, and now I need time to clear my head off this unpleasant movie experience.
