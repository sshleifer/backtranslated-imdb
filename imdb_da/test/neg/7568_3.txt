I like J-horror, anime and even just dig the pink movement that some have claimed this member of, but it didn't matter to me. I'm willing to go one step further and feel this one of the biggest downsides in my movie-making career. <br /> <br /> Three young rock cars go around and get their kicks out of rape girls. One of the groups begins to develop a conclusion about their access time when his child's sister almost captures them in the action. Still, the group thinks of itself once they start to fight each other's friends. It ends with a record that fits the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> Apart from watching friends shouting at each other as they do a lot, there's not much going on here. The movie is filled with LONG continuous images that only aggravate the problem. On top of that, even when the movie starts to do something interesting, it suddenly falls into the ethereal philosophy that never makes sense. For example, when one of your friends changes their minds about assaulted girls, he goes out and does it again, but then stops his friends from taking their turns. Huh? The kinematics are slow and the lighting is poor. The script is ok as it is acting, making this an under-film effort from the beginning. Mix the lack of technical skill with the slender content, and you have nothing more than a waste of time. Oh, and an extra extra note, at least one of the girls that appears in the buff does not look old enough to do that kind of thing. <br /> <br /> 3/10
