Clean crap, decent filmography ... I liked some colors. Apart from that, this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Boring, lifeless, not even did I find myself interested in any of the characters. I waited for a real plot to form and film to pick up the pace. Nothing ever happened! I think they spent too much time working on hair and wardrobe that they forgot that a movie was made at that time.
