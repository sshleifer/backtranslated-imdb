The problem with this movie is the same problem the TV series had, and that is the charity Stan and Jack. There is nothing wrong with laddish characters, but Stan and Jack are played by actors who seem to be in their late 40s / early 50s! And there is something inappropriate - not to mention the credibility idea - when they turn off girls who are young enough to be their daughters <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the HOLIDAYS ON BUSES, I found it immediately forgettable. It is basically a 30 minute episode spun out to 90 minutes of having all the action taken in a vacation camp instead of a bus station. Amazingly, almost a third of the voters on this site have given it a 10! Come on, guys, this movie deserves no more than a 5
