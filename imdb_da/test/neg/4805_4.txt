It was only the second year of the academy, but they already voted politically - Jeanne Eagel's brilliant performance in this creaking early talkie had to do with an Oscar nom and the statuette went to the worst achievement ever to win - Mary Pickford's in COQUETTE. The only existing print was a workload without music or final editing, but where it is shown, Eagels sticks and catches with its awesome, powerful performance. She is so convincing at the testimony that while we know she is lying through her teeth (we did all SEE her kills the man), we find in the audience us as the jury and believe in her innocence before we suddenly catch ourselves. IT'S GREAT ACTIVITY. The movie must be made available on video so that the world can enjoy this amazing performance again. (A style in Jeanne is available in archive print - MAN, WOMAN AND SIN - and her only other talkie, JEALOUSY, is "lost", so this is the only document we have of her. Run to see it (when it first came Out of the archives to be shown in NYC in the early 70s, Village Voice printed a full page review, worship of Eagel's performance).
