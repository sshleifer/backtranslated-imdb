Rita Hayworth is just amazing at times and for me the only reason to watch this silly movie. Despite the exaggerated 1940's lipstick, Rita was one of Hollywood's full-time climate women. In fact, for some years I can't imagine anyone looking better, except maybe Elizabeth Taylor in her prime. <br /> <br /> In any case, the co-star of the show Gene Kelly doesn't play his normal sympathy, at least the kind of guy we all know him from in "Singin 'In The Rain." Here Kelly's "Danny McGuire" plunder much of the time. Phil Silvers, whom I loved on television on "Sgt. Bilko", is so stupid in here as "Genius", you just want to listen to his silly jokes .... and they're stupid. <br /> <br /> Visuals are good with good Technicolor, which looks almost amazing. You also see many beautiful women here, not just Hayworth. Unfortunately, the story is not so much. It is centered around Hayworth, who decides on a career choice. Along the way we get the normal shabby treatment of marriage and we get an insulting stupid end. All in all, an unmemorable movie, except as a showcase for Hayworth's beauty.
