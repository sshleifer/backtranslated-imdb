This is by far the worst British comedy ever, how it made it past the first episode, let alone the pilot is past me. The act is weak from the main character, as Ben Miller played to Sarah Alexander (from the amazing clutch) right through the casting. Plot / story lines were unfunny and very much predictable using many worn out ideas. A very painful series to endure, but unfortunately put in a slot between two excellent shows. describes it as Britain's answer to "Meet the Parents" makes a misconception to "meet the parents" and is as fresh as an old shoe that runs around with the family dog. Britain should have learned that rip offs from other countries never work from looking at America's sad attempts to do so.
