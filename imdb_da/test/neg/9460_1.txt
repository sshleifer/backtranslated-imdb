Before I saw this movie, I thought there were two kinds of bad cinema. (1) Your average completely uninspired fare (ie "Constantine") and (2) the work that is charmingly bad or so bad - that's good (la "Manos The Hands of Fate"). Now that I've seen "Dr. Gore", I know there's a third kind of bad movie: the complete crap sandwich. It will be irrevocably tattooed on your memory. A job that is sensibly inappropriate. Anathema. <br /> <br /> I've hated some movies before, but I've never hated a movie so much that my fate reached its thresh and became self-loathed! Have you seen a movie that not only makes you aware of losing the hour you used to watch it, but makes you take another hour after that? Mystery Science Theater Disciples watch out for it's soul-absorbing movie theater. Get rented "Circle of Iron" or "The Killer Shrews" instead.
