Am I the only one to think this is a bad movie? <br /> <br /> I admit that horror movies often lack things like a great story or good acting or even good special effects. But the way these flaws come together in this movie is surprisingly pitiful. Miserable History: The idea of ​​a raped vagina taking revenge by turning into a man eats sounds quite funny, but what the author did It is stupid. <br /> <br /> Bad Play: The actors move like puppets. They play and look like people who are really trying hard but fail to act. <br /> <br /> Bad FX: Especially the explosion of the habit looks incredibly cheap. It is surprising that an instructor who made some fine films under his carrier switches to such messy things.
