I am a clerk in a video store, so I try to watch the movies we have to broadcast each week. I have no problem with this; In fact, I feel it's a privilege. Not so with this movie. . . After an hour and a half of our quite whining and growling his way through the scene after the scene, I really wondered if they were planning to get to that point. I felt I should be paid to see this at home, in my spare time. And if I had known that there was another hour to be endured, I could have given up right now. I didn't care about the characters, the movie was unremarkable, and Ford made kissing look like a chore. Even the score was unnoticed and crushed. What a waste.
