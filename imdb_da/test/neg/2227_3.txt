Apart from a few good moments of rather crude violence, this painful movie is most remarkable for making 68 minutes look like two hours. It starts with a tremendous introduction, introducing the Leeds family, including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister, all cliched Pa and Ma, and incredibly annoying grandfather (played by Charles "Chic" Sales). While sitting down for dinner, the family is disturbed by the sound of the purgatory and rushes to the window in time to see two men hit by mobsters in the street. Mobsters fly through the family house and leave them witnesses to the crime. The rest of the movie is made up of Walter Huston, when crossing DA occasionally interrupts long anti-crime talks to make half-hearted attempts to try to protect the family from the mob. It all comes up in a predictable way. <br /> <br /> Good points about the movie include a couple of decent shootouts and a really scary blow, Nat Pendleton as one of the mobsters and the beautiful Sue Blane in a small role as Leeds daughter. <br /> <br /> To see Huston play his early trademark crusading lawyer, try 1932's "Beast of the City." Avoid this if at all possible.
