Okay, I had reasonably high expectations for this. The controversial topic was a good concept. As a horror fan, I recognize that I was fascinated and very excited about this. It turns out they had a good idea, but it was terribly executed. Let's see. This movie seems to run in 3 modes: Happy, Sex and Dark. The problem is that the film never decides what it will be. The "happy" parts I believe were meant to be in contrast to the "dark" parts, but it doesn't work. The soundtrack is one of the reasons. <br /> <br /> The movie transitions between these 3 modes very badly, I can't even begin to say how much control and editing sucks. There is sex in the most unpleasant and unrotic way. I didn't complain, but even for Horror standards they were unnecessary and fillers. The people are all illegitimate except Paula (Potente). Her friend from Munich is a veil and possibly one of the most annoying characters in movies I've come across recently. There is a bit of a plot that I will not go into detail ... It is not stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie. There is even a good twist and a cool conspiracy is going on. Don't try to understand everything because there are gigantic plot holes here. <br /> <br /> It's so much fun that you don't care about the victims, the perpetrators, anyone. And believing it could have been good. I can say a good thing about what is, the film sheds some light on today's unethical medical procedures. With the development of genetics and controversial sciences, this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these issues. But you won't find it here, just a series of scenes loosely attached to people and things you don't care about. <br /> <br /> Skip this and go and see Flatliners instead, you're welcome. <br /> <br /> 3/10
