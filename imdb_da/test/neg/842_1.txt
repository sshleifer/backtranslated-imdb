When I first read the novel, I have nothing against the movie, how different it is written, as long as it complies or at least contains the plot. For the reasons known only to Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored and another story line is added. The reason why this novel passed the test of time is undoubtedly due to the confusion of both the characters and the plot as a whole. Disturbing this structure is destroying the complicated balance of the story line, and thus the narrative of the story counts. Although it is a matter of meaning, the stiffening of this film leaves much to be desired. Signs that are described as very obese must at least be made to look portly in order for the character to have credibility. The days of slavery cannot be over, or of course, actors of this caliber would have been rebellious at such a travesty of history. Marian Halcolme's face is described as being masculine in appearance, ... Tara Fitzgerald's very feminine appearance does not ring true. Again, Laura is fairly described as being 'fair', if not 'ethereal', so with dark hair she doesn't quite fit the impression of the novel. .... Poorly done, Hollywood! <br /> <br /> J. Hunter
