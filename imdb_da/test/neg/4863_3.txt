Would you be surprised if I told you that this movie is about a conspiracy? None? How about I told you that the protagonist was a shady doll. What? Do not you believe me? ... OKAY. Yes, I made it. It's too bad, this movie could have used a sense of humor. I understand Charlie Sheen does it at that time - another movie made more money - as for Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why? Don't even get me started on Stephen Lang. He was as fun as Party Crasher in 'The Hard Way' and now this unwanted. <br /> <br /> Ah, whatever. Everyone involved should be ashamed. If you intend to make a bad movie and succeed - it's twisted - but I really doubt it was what they were aiming for here. Flat out, the story stinks and we actually have to take this yak seriously. Make you wonder if this movie itself had a glimpse of hope. I seriously doubt it, and in an industry so close to the purse strings, how this turned green in the first place, lies beyond me. Perhaps even more frightening is how this dog's pile made it into theaters! <br /> <br /> Oh ... Sam Waterson, how big you are in law and order. Why are you here? To kill yourself for the role of president in the United States, which I can add, is shot on by a remote control pipeline controlled by the gonzoassassin. Then again, this is a masterpiece of work by George P. Cosmatos, which is "direct" credits, including Rambo: First Blood Part II among other gems. Hmm .... case in point?
