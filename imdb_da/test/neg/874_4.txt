Not quite a bomb? The only thing missing was enriched uranium. In fact, the script may have "worked" if the main characters had been thrown with younger actors, but the drama of an aging Diane Lane, which seems to be a teenager (or even fifty), was too much to stomach. Every time she (Adrienne) would jump into Richard Geres's arms and then pull both heels up behind her, you could almost see the grin of his pain on his face, as he probably thought, "Oh, my painful back ... this babe is safe However, both characters were clearly unlikeable, especially Richard Geres: a self-absorbed plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner) who was on a kind of "soul pull" after a botched operation left him dead patient (an elderly woman from a small farm). Then there was her angry man and son he had to deal with to explain what happened. Dr. Flanner is on his way to meet the angry man (at the man's request) when he meets Adrienne. She is recently split from her incredible man (shock) and helps a friend by seeing her beach rental holiday rental. Of course, this is where Dr. Flanner ends up being open, and they both end up falling in love with MADLY (especially after finding out that he is a rich doctor and a plastic surgeon). In between romantic interludes and a nauseating song / dance routine that Lane (Adrienne) performs while listening to an old LP (no CDs?), They both try to figure out how their lives were so completely turned up . Dr. Flanner was also not much of a father and has a son (who is also a dr.) Who is due to him not to be there for him while he is growing up. (Of course, Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at that time rather than raising a monstrous, distracting boy.) To make a long (predictable) story short, Adrienne Dr. Flies with his inner demons and confronts angry man and son of the woman who died on his table (after advocating a "routine" cyst removal of the face). Dr. Flanner is finally able to tell the husband (played relentlessly sympathetic by Scott Glenn) that he is sorry for what happened - even though it was a mistake with the danged anesthetist. "I told him she was too old for so much juice!" Glenn's character, (Robert Torrelson) seems to accept Dr. Flanner's apology. It's hard to tell because his emotional response is so passive at this time that you wonder if he himself hears the good Dr. at all or think of an area that he must plow. Even more carefully, Dr. Flanner that he should visit his son (who is now practicing medical pro bono in a third world country) to improve their relationship. Unfortunately, this means that he may temporarily bid Adrienne. Of course, while writing the natives of Timbuktu, he writes a love letter hourly to Adrienne (who almost sleeps as a schoolgirl every time she gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was tell her goodbye. Obviously Robert Torrelson apologized for the death of his wife was the second hardest thing. Eventually he is killed in a freak mud glass (poetic justice as in the mud package?) And she's back with just the memories of what could have been ... hopefully no more Gere / Lane sequels!
