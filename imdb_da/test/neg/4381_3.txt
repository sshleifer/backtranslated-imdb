"Hero and the Terror" is a rather boring thriller - a la: no real character fabric, predictable plot, and ... Drilling. For a thriller, I found this movie slow to work up to its pitiful climax as it just seemed to contract until Chuck's wife's baby was born ... and then pulled it from there until it reaches the end - which I can hardly remember even though I only saw the movie 10 minutes ago. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 - in the first 10-20 minutes.
