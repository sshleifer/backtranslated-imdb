OK I went to this site before I watched this movie, read the comments, was pumped - because they were all really good at a B-flick - saw it and were totally disappointed. The main characters wannabe lone rebel right out of the mid-west action were diseases of the stomach, and don't even get me started on the two police, I think there's a bloody door right there in plain view, check it out! The reason was completely predictable, editing was rather limited, I swear that the editor himself was dying near the end when he cut this movie, and the direction was overcast by poor filmography. Now don't confuse me, I love B-flicks, some are really good. <br /> <br /> Want to see a good B-rated flick ??? <br /> <br /> Dave recommends <br /> <br /> "High voltage" <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
