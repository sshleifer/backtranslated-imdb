First, I'm critical of this movie because I really had great hopes and instead sucked this movie. <br /> <br /> * possible spoilers * (if you haven't seen the TV series) Where to start ?? ? Well, let's start with the quality. The film was hardly better than the original TV series, and the two combat scenes were very well designed. But CGI was angry. <br /> <br /> There are plot holes and issues that still remain after the whole movie is all said and done. This film does not close as a successful conclusion to a very broad universe, known as the FMA, and only returns to expanding the universe until we only leave our imagination to decipher what would happen in the future. <br /> <br /> And then the stories are the biggest mistake. Adding WWII and Hitler ... why? The series was perfect ... and didn't need Hitler. It didn't even need Germany. <br /> <br /> In general, the whole movie was hard on what a real FMA movie might have been, and if I were the directors, I'd scrape CoS and make a new, more "ending" ending.
