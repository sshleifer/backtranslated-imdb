I was 12 when this movie was released and loved it. The song was inspiring and it made me feel good and watch it several times at the cinema. I actually had the soundtrack album and played the song over and over again. <br /> <br /> 26 years later ... I'm ashamed. Just sat there and saw it with my 2 daughters who enjoyed it a lot, but my cynical older adult eyes hated it. It is very poorly directed in many places, and considering it was Lionel Jeffries directing I really wanted to enjoy it. The sign animation was so rough, but the backgrounds were quite good. I remember the critics at the time and said it was a bad movie and was horrified, but now I agree. <br /> <br /> It's an old movie yes, compared to what can be achieved now, maybe that's why I thought it was good then. But it does not apologize because it is bad to act, control and snooze. The main actor's voice seems to be dubbed, which is also very distracting. I can't quite see what they were trying to do when it was made, everything it did was a weak movie.
