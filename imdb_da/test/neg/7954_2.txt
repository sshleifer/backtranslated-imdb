What about Scream Baby Scream shouldn't make me feel like a fool to buy it? I bought it because God helps me, I am a sucker for old B cinema, just as worthless as this. Nonetheless, something about this movie annoys me, it's probably Janet, Janet comes from cold and snooty, apparently for the purpose of getting out so deep and noble with a look at her face screaming constipation, she can't seem to be Agree to everything her uptight girlfriend wants. I'm glad this is her only role. What really annoys me is that this is a 1960s gorefilm that has gone terribly wrong, and as we all know, it's terrible that Floridian is "zero gore". It's like the instructor started with a Herschell Lewis style, but backed out of the acting scenes when his wife found out, so instead we end up with a boring conversation after another and basically a lot of annoying nothing. In other words, we end with Florida Bore. Joseph Adler should be embarrassed. Janet's boyfriend, Jason is almost as ridiculous as she is, this guy has something negative to say about absolutely everything, came to think of it, he's probably the least pleasant good guy in horror story. The only thing that this movie really goes on is that it carries the 60-year-old / early 70-B-gore vibe that you can find in things like Undertaker & his friends, Blood Freak or most anything from Herschell Lewis . Even though Rodney from the cruel Twosome is in this, I thought his caveman comedy routine was annoying, mostly everything from reel to roll is stupid, even the trip scene was stupid. The only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach landscapes, but most of it includes Janet who suffers from the fact that life is not perfect. In the only real ironic twist, Scream Baby Scream becomes even less interesting when the story finally comes, about 45 minutes of ground. If you don't care whether your entertainment can be seen but are offended by the color red, you can't hate this. Why does Troma distribute this? Wouldn't it be a strange video site? Scream Baby Scream very well may be the worst in Florida horror / gore in its era, but I assume that under the unlikely signs and the incoherent plot lies the potential. Screaming, Baby, Scream really just looks like it should follow the Blood Feast pattern, so stealing a quote from Janet, "If it doesn't fit, I throw it out". 2.10
