An inferior predecessor to "Who's Braid of Virginia Woolf", pulls this movie over and over again, occasionally reviving your interest only to put you through more self-immersive glare and obvious, yet overtly exaggerated plot points. It can list as 111 minutes but feels like three hours of painful wasted time.
