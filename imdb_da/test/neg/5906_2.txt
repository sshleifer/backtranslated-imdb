It was praised for being a speedy screwdriver comedy and this year's best German film, so I gave it a try, though I have already seen some films by Dani Levy - or at least some of them. <br /> <br /> I got what I expected: no comedy at all unless you think heart attacks are fun. It's a good example of sloppy screenwriting, with an unimaginable plot and character, full of clichés that can be true, but it's not fun either. <br /> <br /> The most annoying sign is Zuck's wife, played by Hannelore Elsner. She has to behave incredibly strange to keep the plot moving. For example: She doesn't know a single thing about Judaism, but for reasons that are probably not known to be herself, she gets the idea of ​​playing charade that she and her family are Jewish laws that obey Jews for their man's family who really are and of the very orthodox and self-righteous variety. To make it a little more complicated, she invites four of them to stay at her apartment complex because they arrive from Frankfurt in Berlin without having reserved their hotels in advance, something not a 60-year-old businessman, in fact no adult German would ever do. This gives the viewer much to swallow, but still has to make jokes. <br /> <br /> Zucker and his brother Samuel haven't seen each other for forty years, but it turns out that his daughter - now a lesbian - and Samuel's son - now a militant orthodox - were once lovers and he is her daughter's father. Samuel's daughter - a nympho - goes after Zucker's gay son. Should this be somehow humorous parody of Jewish incestuous tendencies? Probably it's just a thoughtless way to add some "love action turbulence" to every ballistic comedy needs. And of course it also fails to produce jokes. <br /> <br /> The praise for this movie is purely political. Therefore, only people who enjoy watching movies that must be "politically important" can enjoy this - though "Alles auf Zucker!" Clearly has no meaning whatsoever. <br /> <br /> By the way: Don't look at it without a "Fast forward" option. I really missed it.
