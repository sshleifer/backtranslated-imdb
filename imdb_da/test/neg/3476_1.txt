I just attended a preview of this movie. A masterpiece of documentary film production was not. Fully absorbed with its subject, the film becomes incapable of smoothing out any critical comment regarding Mrs Faye. Cloying and sappy, the only redeeming quality of the movie was the use of dolls in an attempt (albeit a failed one) to structure a kind of narrative. But the fateful experience arose as the final credits rolled. Audience rose and applauded. Just like flames for mills, Americans in the 21st century are still drawn to freaks shows. The story of the misunderstood monster gets a little tired.
