Kennan Ivory Wayans was so much fun in the Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to watch this one and it was one of the worst he did, and Steven Seagal didn't help much. It starts with some weird religious killings that don't make much sense to Jim Campbell (Keenan). He is surprised to see a new partner waiting for him to work at his side to beat the case, but Jack Cole does not seem to be like everyone thinks he is until Jack's former wife is killed in one of The ritual killings that end up making him the suspect too. It's the same as all his other movies: Smoke passing, CIA involvement and now trying to be a normal policeman. Why does Steven look like he's from a Western movie? And the beans on top of it make things a little confusing.
