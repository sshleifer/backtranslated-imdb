Italian film makers love to tear off American movies. All our movies and as often as possible. <br /> <br /> I do not say that as a slope against Italy as a whole, but I would like to note further that the Italian film industry is causing itself great damage by allowing transvestiers like this to go abroad to be seen of the world as a whole. That's all I say. <br /> <br /> And no more serious damage makes the Italian people subjugate themselves than by not imposing a severe punishment on those who made the world see "Shark rosso nell'oceano" - which is indeed a ripoff of the far better "jaws" (as if you didn't know). <br /> <br /> Let's dive into the plot (get it? Haw-haw ...): this A great monstrous swim that looks like a cross between an octopus, a shark and Steven Tyler attacking many innocent Americans ( ie the Italians) off the coast of Florida (ie Italy) and the pristine, beer-swilling Peter (Sopkiw) sails out with his anorexic, beer-swilling boyfriend and other beer-swilling people whose main purpose is to stay eaten by the creature, killed by mysterious forces who want the creature alone or just stand around and otherwise be useless (and swill beer) ... to be the doctor of this movie who defibrates dying patients repeatedly (20, maybe 30 times in drag) without waiting for his paddle to be recharged (must be a dew of a good battery there, doc). <br /> <br /> Then there's the monster ... brother, if you thought "Jaw's" shark was fake, look here and get your mind changed immediately. /> <br /> This is a film directed as an afterthought (by a Bava!), edited with an onion hopper traded with ambulatory (beer-swilling) pieces of driftwood and written off (PRESUMABLY beer swilling ) People who should never ever be left near a typewriter, movie studio or big city in the world ever again. If it is the case that the people who made this film think that real people work in such a situation, they have of course made too many of them zombie films. Or too much beer. <br /> <br /> Should I say this movie is bad? It is: bad as green cottage cheese; bad as a Hawaiian shirt on a formal wedding badly as "Bad Theater" sketches Dan Aykroyd used to host "Saturday Night Live"; bad as Calista Flockhart Weight Gain Tablets - Get It? Well. <br /> <br /> Mike and the SOL band released this beer-drunk beauty upside down repeatedly, revealing this "horror" movie as it is: horrible. But with a certain European charm: it is charming when seen by a European - preferably a beer-swinging. <br /> <br /> No stars for the water-blooded, dead fish known as "Shark rosso nell'oceano"; six stars for the MST3K version. ... and now, someone for a beer? <br /> <br />
