Victor Buono as the devil? Surely somebody must have been full when this decision was made. It's not the worst part of this silly mish-mash of healthy haunted house units, but it gets my voice to be the funniest part of it. While the movie is by no means horrible, it doesn't even go to other 1970's "haunted house" flicks such as Amityville Horror, The Changeling and The Legend of Hell House. The evil can be entertaining in spots, but don't expect to be scared. It is better addressed as it is: A silly horror movie made all the sillies know that it is over-serious access.
