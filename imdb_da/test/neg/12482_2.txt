It's just awful. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this boy. I think it should be a comedy, but I can't remember laughing much, except for a few blatant disagreements and even clear mistakes. <br /> <br /> An unattractive middle-aged man called Lester meets with rich, non-attractive medieval women via lonely hearts ads, and then kills them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction. It's the whole plot, and that's really all that's happening. Along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when Lester begins receiving phone calls from a mysterious stranger telling him to know his secret, but it is so poorly implemented that you may not be aware of what was really going to happen. The sequences where Lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal, but apparently dressed up as comedies. A sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then pushed into an oven. It is very cruelly depicted, but it is played out against blaring big-band waltz music, with Lester pulling faces and adopting comedies all the time. Another scene has the victim murdered while constantly singing sharp opera songs ... you have to see this to believe it! In fact - you don't have to see it at all, I strongly recommend that you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know what hat he is wearing, and there are no signs of any of the flairs seen in his previous career. A sequence stood out to me as particularly miserable: Revelation when Lester suddenly realizes that he has no shadow. Fulci does not seem unable to think of any visual representation of these phenomena on the screen, so from that time on, he just films the actor as normal shadow and all !! And thus the whole angle blows completely. Either he had zero budget for effects, or he didn't care to think of any way to show it. Whatever it was, it should give you a taste of how lame the whole project is. I couldn't even understand most of the movie, and there was definitely nothing on the screen worth watching at half the time. Even the finish was as flat as a pancake. A real dud.
