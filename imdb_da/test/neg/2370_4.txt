This movie comes from a long-standing ITV sitcom with the same name. Sitcomet lasted half a decade and moved to our screenshots Rigsby, Phillip, Alan, Jones and Vienna. <br /> <br /> Then in 1980 the movie version hit the cinema. Now that it did, Richard Beckinsale was unfortunately gone and was replaced by Only when I laugh actor Chris Strauli. I felt that it gave the film a different feeling. I would have preferred if it wasn't shot when Richard was a key person. It's like having the porridge without Godber or Mackay! <br /> <br /> The movie had some classic moments for sure, but it felt a bit De-Ja -Wu! Many parts were seen before in the TV series. Now, if you saw the movie first instead of the series, you would get a different sense of it, so the comic fan! <br /> <br /> Saying Leonard is definitely on top form and doing the movie, as in the TV series. The movie has recently had a new lease on DVD and is usually on Terrestrial over a quiet weekend. It's a cracking movie, but for Rigsby fans you can feel like you've seen the same before. <br /> <br /> Saying that although it is worth buying / looking at <br /> <br /> 7.8 / 10
