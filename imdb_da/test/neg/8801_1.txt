I don't understand how some people can play "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" when there are so many better first-person shooters available. "Counter-Strike" is a game that uses no imaginative ideas in its weapon. All weapons in the game are real weapons, but there could have been at least one cheat that allowed players to have access to a "supernatural" weapon, such as the almighty BFG in the Quake & Doom games. <Br /> <br /> Another problem is that the player must actually reload the weapon manually. This can be extremely annoying, especially in the middle of a fire when you are so close to killing the enemy. The reload delay also gives the feeling that the gun is slow to perform its task. <br /> <br /> There are not many choices of characters to choose from. If I remember correctly, there are 4 types of signs each for the terror and terrorist forces. This means that many of the characters look like each other, which really brings the game to realism. <br /> <br /> The game is pretty sexist when it comes to character selection. In the early version of Counter-Strike, there was a woman available to choose (in Terrorist Force Selection), which was good for the female players. In the latest versions, the female character was deleted and replaced with another male character. I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed with the newer versions. Finally, the cards in the game are very small. The biggest card seems to be the desert card, but it has standard details. In fact, all the cards in the game have standard graphics. In other words, nothing new. In summary, I think "Half-Life: Counter-Strike" is the most imaginative first-person shooter all the time. There are plenty of better and more imaginative shooting games to play, so why waste your time on this boring game? You better play Unreal Tournament, Quake and Doom games. Avoid this over-rated and over-hyped game. <br /> <br /> I give the game a 1/10.
