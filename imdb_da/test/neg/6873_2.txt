Here is another movie with dysfunctional main characters that are completely amoral and yet we have to root them? Not me. No character in this movie was worth despairing. <br /> <br /> Robin Williams plays car dealer "Joey O'Brien." The man has no class, a loser in any moral sense and a guy who thinks he can speak out of something. Knowing Williams' ability to speak, he was good at this role. The women in his life also run him loony. Some of them are not much better than him. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins plays a similar low life that begins to take over the film as he, fully loaded with explosives, crashes into a car dealer showroom and host people, including his wife. Robbins plays a disturbed and ridiculous character as a normal to him. I assume that these nuts role comes easily to these two actors. Gee, I wonder why. <br /> <br /> There is so much shouting and screaming in this movie that it will give you headaches. Combine these two screams with Fran Drescher's nasal voice, and you really have an annoying over-the-top cast. It's like listening to chalk on blackboard for an hour and a half. This is comedy? No, it's lama. <br /> <br /> In fact, for a Robin Williams movie to have only a dozen reviews posted here, you tell something. It's far from his best movie.
