I'm sure there is a documentary among the ruins at this Yawn party somewhere, as there is enough time, perhaps the producers could find it. I do not associate with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. This interruption is soon consolidated into a complete enmity that borders on hostility. Even because of the bad history flow, I am not quite sure what is happening to them, and what are the consequences of what they are trying to do. The story and the faces are jumping around so quickly it is very difficult to fully understand what is going on. The third founder who takes them to $ 700K is introduced so late in the film that Khaleil and Tom have to pave (fruitless) to explain "oh, this guy also created the idea". And just as I thought I had a little understanding of who all the tertiary signs were, did a crazy woman get a puppy? What happens to it? Also, has Tom really got to give all the awkward talking to the staff? I can only imagine the boredom they felt when it really happened. In fact, I think I feel for them.
