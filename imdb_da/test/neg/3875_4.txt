"Return of the Seven" has a couple of good action scenes, and Elmer Bernstein's score is as exciting as ever. Nevertheless, it is a boring movie because it simply does not involve us emotionally. Mcqueen's absence makes a really bad impression and the fact that his character here is played by another (lesser-known) actor is weird - in a bad way. The signs are not developed so we do not associate with them - and we do not usually when some of them die. This sequel is an acceptable but poor imitation of the original.
