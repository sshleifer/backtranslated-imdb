I, like many people, think that 1989's epic Lonesome Dove was one of the best westerns ever produced, perhaps the best. And to realize that most followers (in this case a prequel) are sure to disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon met that expectation with its marginal management and action, poor casting and honestly, a miserable script. <br /> <br /> Lonesome Dove created Western heroes of the Captains McCrae and Call because of incredibly strong performances by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones. Prior to living in Lonesome Dove, we thought they bravely fought to free Texas from bandits and wild Indians during their rankings. <br /> <br /> If I only saw Comanche Moon, I would think these two boneheads were a few incompetent, sweeping idiots. In Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae apparently chased the Blue Duck over Texas and never managed to catch or kill him. In Comanche Moon a shot to Call's boot convinced him to settle down and raise cattle. There wasn't a decent fistfight or gun fight throughout the miniseries. The best shot was McCrea sucker punching Inez Scull, a fun scene but out of character to McCrae. Where was McCrae's joke and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, a drunk, unobtrusive slob and philanderer was absolutely incredible. And Maggie's love of Call, a dispassionate and the sullen pay, challenges logic. <br /> <br /> The camera was excellent, better than the original. Credit goes not only to HD technology, but the filmmaker. Comanche Moon miniseries were better than anything else on TV for three nights, but unfortunately it doesn't say much.
