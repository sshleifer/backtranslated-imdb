What should I say? I only saw this flick for curiosity and it's really a shame ... I grew up in Brittany with stories of Celtic legends and spent 5 years in Rennes, the city where this movie is said to take place ... Shame not to any actor or camera from this flick ever arrived in Rennes. They could at least have chosen a probable city or a likely forest, but nothing even SEEM like Brittany or Rennes ... And call it a movie about Celtic legends really makes a fool of the audience. Besides these details, it could have been a good movie, but it's bad. Stupid scenario, stupid characters and no originality. Absolutely avoid.
