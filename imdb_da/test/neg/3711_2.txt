It's hard to find something worth praising with this movie. It's not the worst picture ever made, but it doesn't say much. The reason is rather incoherent and incredible; It appears that the producers wanted to make a space movie, but decided to do it underwater to deposit the success of The Abyss. In some scenes, it seems that history was originally set to outer space; The bottom has a landing gear, the technicians are worried about a rip in a rubber boot at depths of several kilometers, where the pressure would crush the diver and suit as an empty pitcher. <br /> <br /> The movie starts ok, with the planning of a recovery of a lost naval sub. Then the movie takes a leap with Siren 2. <br /> <br /> Effects are so-so. The navigation screen is all finished on Commodore 64 (remember, it is 1990, not 1983), the sub is controlled like no other part ever; Instead of control consoles, officers have keyboards that they enter long number sequences to control the ship's various functions. The interior of the ship is also not convincing. <br /> <br /> The final scenes jump from awkward to absurd. Welcome to the fifties, you can check your suspension of disbelief at the door. <br /> <br /> I don't see the enjoyment factor here. The movie is neither good nor hilarious bad MST3k style (until you get to the final scene), it's like eating a little bad apple.
