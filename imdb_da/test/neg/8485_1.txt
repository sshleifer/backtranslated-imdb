I can not believe it! I thought this is a good sequel when Jim carries the movie, has a baby, but instead it's a movie with crappy actors, stupid plot and stupid scenes. This should be in the 'crappest movie of sh * t in the ground'. Thank goodness the same instructor did not because this is so stupid with some comic-like parts that the foot was not fun, not peeing and not dancing! I laughed at it because of how stupid the person did what homer Simpson made a movie about a donut! I want someone to remake the son of the mask with a plot like this! The mask guy (Jim carry) and his wife have a son who is a normal baby. When the baby finds another mask, he also became the mask and the mask's guy tries to get his mask back! This is very crap, so I give it a 1 out of 10. Fu * king sh * t!
