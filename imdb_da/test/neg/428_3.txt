This movie would probably have been good if they didn't use CGI (computer generated imaging) for werewolf scenes. It made the creatures look fake and the werewolfs looked cartoonish. CGI is great for certain effects like dinasours in Jurassic Park or Twister. But when we see a movie where the creature should look just right, CGI is not the way to go. Look at an American werewolf in London. No CGI. Just makeup and a mechanical being and what you come up with were more realistic than what was shown in the sequel. This movie gave a few gags that were fun to watch and humor in this movie seemed to have drawn me in, but it's no more than a movie that I thought was okay and that's not good enough. In my opinion, an American werewolf in Paris does not hold up to the original.
