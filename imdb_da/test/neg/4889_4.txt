Ruggero Deodato is often credited to perceive the cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975. But director Umberto Lenzi, usually recognized as Deodato-rip-off, instructed THE MAN FROM DEEP RIVER 3 years earlier in 1972. Is it a worthy start for the genre ? Good .... not really ..... <br /> <br /> A photographer kills a man by self-defense and accidentally retires to an Asian country's jungle, captured by a native tribe holding him imprisoned. him for slave labor and eventually accept him when he marries the boss's daughter. Throughout the film I never felt it was a horror movie. It is more like a drama like A MAN CALLED HORSE, which I liked better. Ivan Rassimov is pretty good as the photographer, but it is Me Me Lai as the boss's daughter, who is memorable and great. I've always been a Me Me Lai fan ever since her amazing performance in JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and she never gets credit for her acting because she hardly speaks in her movies. She is still very talented and charming. Lots of real animal cultivation is the only thing about DEEP RIVER that can make it a scary movie, but even that doesn't work out well. MAN FROM DEEP RIVER is good to see for those who want to see what started the cannibal subgenre, but as an entry into the genre, is easily obscured by Deodato's records and even Lenzi's own later entries. Recommended only for completister and Me Me Lai fans.
