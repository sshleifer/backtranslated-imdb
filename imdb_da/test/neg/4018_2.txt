When you're used to Lana Turner in Postman Always Rings Twice and comparing it to this low budget, low talent, low quality movie, I was just embarrassed by Ida Lupino's "song" (more like talking) and non-piano playing scenes . When the first non-singing scene started and all people just stared at her flat, I was positive that they all rolled their eyes and began to leave or at least speak to each other (she stinks, let's get out of here). The actors are flat - emotions are deflated. And Ida is a really spoiled bi-otch all the way through - just a 100% departure. This was like Betty Boop on deliberate sedation encounters a petrol station attendant in nowhere would the United States. The story was flat, the music was flat, the play was flat, her breast was ... not against. I felt sad for the rest of the actors. Perhaps if the real actress should have been given the lead and the men actors had more emotions, the film could have had a chance. Sorry to offend those who thought it was out of this world. I wouldn't have thought if it was out of this world.
