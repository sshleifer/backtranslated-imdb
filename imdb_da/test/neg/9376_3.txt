"De Dominee" is based on the life of a genuine Dutch gangster, Klaas Bruinsma! In the film he is called Klaas Donkers! I doubt the events in the movie have anything to do with what really happened! But that doesn't really matter! Because it failed to get my attention! This movie bored crap out of me! It lacks fabric and style! The substance part could have been forgiven if the action was good and if the director tried to do something original! Without the fabric you should at least bring some style or decent actions! Shouldn't we be entertained? It would have helped if the director had seen more gangster movies! It is obvious that he did not! Otherwise he would not have done what he did! This film got a lot of publicity because of a small scandal about Klaas Bruinsma and a member of the Dutch royal family! This scandal has nothing to do with the movie what so ever! Without it, "De Dominee" would never have been successful! I'm sure of it!
