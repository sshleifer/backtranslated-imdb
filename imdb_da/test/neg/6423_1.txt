Recently released on DVD in USA; just be far away from it. <br /> <br /> I usually give room for stupidity in horror movies; I will pay for almost everything distant, supernatural, scary or even just a vaguely interesting concept. This simply stuck. I knew there were problems when Sara's "best friend" in college, having a significant screen time, was not even listed in the credits on IMDb! I was not surprised that I did not recognize any actors, but it was not even that kind of character ("Daysha" or "Day-Glo" or what she called). <br /> <br /> I'm so embarrassed that I actually paid a rent for this waste; deep, deeply ashamed ...
