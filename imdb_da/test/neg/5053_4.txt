I made it halfway through this movie, and at that time I didn't realize how it ended. It is basically a gentle teenage comedy that I only looked at because I like Helen Mirren who is actually very good as an impossible cruel teacher. <br /> <br /> The basic idea of ​​the movie (or let's say the first half of the movie, since I don't know - or care - how the other half goes) has been done before, especially in 9 to 5, and a comparison between the two shows how well Tingle gets it wrong. You must feel that things are out of control in a way that makes you feel events are inevitable, and you need well-defined, interesting characters that you are interested in, and you don't. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it never grabbed me for a second.
