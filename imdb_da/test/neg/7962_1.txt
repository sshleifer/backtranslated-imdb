This movie spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana. Plot and visual, however, are so insane that it looks more like the poster child of LSD. Plot: Michael's heroic battle as he fights for his drug addiction while being subjected to the humiliation brought on Yes, yes, there is a good message, but it is hidden by the fact that the authors have taken a rather sensible PSA idea and tried to stretch it for 30 minutes. This includes a song sequence where you are told that there are a million rational ways of saying "No!" for example, "I can't smoke a pot, I have homework!" The writers cannot do what they have to do with the signs they have made royalty-free. First, we see that they all have to hide from the human characters, but within five minutes we see them all running around in plain sight without any comment. Soon they begin to interact with the human body, and the only one who is even slightly disturbed by this fact is not the drug addicts, it is the little sister who speaks to his teddy bear (Pooh by the way). In addition, there is the little drug demon floating around. Because you know, the pushers do not give children medication. He is also ambiguous - while he may be symbolic of Michael's addiction and therefore not to be seen by other people, he goes on to pursue and pursue little Corey to get HER for drugs. So I guess he's ... uhhh ..... continues! <br /> <br /> Finally, the entire plot culminates in an insane sequence where Michael is in what seems to be Saturday morning carnival of souls, aka an amusement park from hell where the various cartoon characters beat him up and ignore him and things . For example, Miss Piggy eats him in a sandwich and spits him out. If the authors were not high when they wrote this, I recommend that they try to get high because they cannot become more discerning than this. Of course, the film ignores the fact that Michael has had highs for two years at this time, so why this tripping sequence would fear him is beyond me. I'm aware that I'm completely whaling this movie, but I actually just watched it again because I went through the trouble of tracking it on eBay because of it's sheer disgust of being a BAD cartoon. The level of accidental humor is brilliant. Take e.g. This scene - Michael's father kills through the fridge to a beer. He notes that many of them are missing and mentioning it to his wife. The always attentive mother tells him: "Don't worry, you probably just drank them last night and watch football." Although we obviously have to learn that Michael is drinking beer (besides the pot and the crack), instead we read on and realize - Hey kids, it's okay to have chemical dependencies as long as you are an adult! Scenes like this are worth the small price of this movie. Oh yea, and the fact you hear Simon Chipmunk says "Marijuana."
