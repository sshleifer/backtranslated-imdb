Although embryos could have been a potentially thought provoking study of bioethics, it degenerates into a stereotypical Frankenstein parable, putting on one and the same monotonous lesson that there were some kingdoms that man was not supposed to enter or study . <br /> <br /> Researcher Rock Hudson is experimenting with ways to prevent abusive babies from dying. After success with a dog, he immediately jumps to people - violates medical ethics and any kind of credibility - with equally unrealistic help from a hospital administrator. His experiment works too well, with some unpleasant side effects. <br /> <br /> Although Barbara Carrera is reasonably good in her role and some of the animal training is spectacular, the movie suffers from being too awesome. Although a message by the prologue ensures viewers that this represents contemporary technology, scientific work looks far-fetched in the 21st century, let alone in the mid-1970s. Moreover, the scene where Carrera is able to find a cure for side effects of bioengineering by simply writing a question to a computer is ridiculous.
