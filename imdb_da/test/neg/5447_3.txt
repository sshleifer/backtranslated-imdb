I'm really not sure why people get so free about this odd movie. When I have said it - I actually sit through the whole 2 hours and can't say that it was not entirely entertaining. <br /> <br /> I think the main problem is that Frank Marshall is not a true director and this is evident in the movie - he is an experienced producer so it will have seen a movie made many times and understand what who goes into the process. But I think it's completely different from being able to really lead a movie - the direction was competent, but somehow flat and directional. Marshall has more experience as a unit or other director, and this came through, I feel, in the finished product - it seemed to be a group set that had no continuity in its feelings or its character. <br /> <br /> Fun, tough, but good? None.
