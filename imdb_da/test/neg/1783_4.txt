I thought it would be a fun comedy without sex or nudity in it. Well, there is no sexual content, but to be a "fun comedy" I remember only laughing a total of three times under "The Green Butchers". Hilariousness is centered on cannibalism and mental retardation, which is just sick humor in a bad way. I should have gone out of this movie and I kick myself because I didn't. In fact, I shouldn't have seen this movie in the first place. The only good thing that came out of this movie was the fact that Bjarne and his brother finally made changes and put their ugly past behind them. I advise any well-meaning person to remove this rough flip.
