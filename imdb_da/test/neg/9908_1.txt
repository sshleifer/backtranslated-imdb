What I hate most about this waste is the arrogant attitude of film producers and network executives, which promotes this fog on the public because they really believe the audience is so stupid, so unworthy, so tasteful that they deserve these kinds of inconveniences. There is an inherent entertainment that sees disaster movies and with the magic of today's CGI effects, artists get powerful tools to investigate what was previously denied them. With that joy we sat down to see some chaos and destruction. Well, guess what, the only chaos we saw was in the ads for next Wednesday's episode. What a disappointment! But wait, there was even a bigger one. Scripture itself was the major disaster! And then there was the direction and the relaxed action of everyone involved in this turkey. But we knew this before right? We knew that the effects alone are not an entertainment work, but nevertheless, the Bozos network, which Okayed this television movie, did not care about, because in their mantra the eternal line is "never underestimates how stupid the audience is". These guys actually have to live by this motto and I'm so tired of it. No wonder the audience has left American drama in droves and turned their camp into reality shows. At least in these programs, no one tries to make it look like anything other than what it is: intellectual pornography. Now Category 6 is worse than that because it is assumed to be different and "original". Yes it was a disaster movie okay, but the disasters are not what they announced!
