Usually I don't like Chuck Norris movies. I appreciate his work as a martial artist, and his battle scenes are usually quite choreographed. Chuck is undoubtedly one of the martial arts greats. So in my local used bookstore I found a movie I hadn't seen before and took it home. <br /> <br /> While the actor in this movie was worse than most Chuch Norris movies, I hoped to see at least one battle scene. I soon realized that this was not a typical Chuch Norris movie; Rather, it was a Christian movie that was supposed to illustrate the "good will win" paradigm. There is really nothing on the packaging to indicate that this is a Christian movie except the label. .. Goodtimes Entertainment I had never heard of before. I will definitely remember the next time I see a movie from that company. <br /> <br /> I have no problem with Christianity ... I have a problem with creeping proselytizing. If anyone is to make a religious film, at least the good sense has to show the viewer that this is what they get. The only redeeming part about the exercise is that I only spent $ 3.25 to spend 97 minutes to see a great martial artist not fighting. At least it was in the evening meal, and I spent some of that cooking and dining. In short, if you're looking for a mediocre martial arts movie and don't hope for much, don't bother with this movie because it doesn't even offer it.
