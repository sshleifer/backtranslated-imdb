Now I know why this movie can be bought for so cheap on the video stores. I was curious as it had three big-name stars yet, was among the 'B' movies that the video apparently can't even give away! The answer is, it is a movie that would attract a very limited audience: an over 50 crowd with very liberal feelings. Who else sees Robert Redford, Willem Dafoe and Helen Mirren, essentially gives a basic message that "cheating on your wife is okay as long as you still love her." It's the lovely "feel-good message" here, especially at the end of this weird kidnapping story. Who wrote this script ..... Bill Clinton? <br /> <br /> I say "odd" because the kidnapper is the best kidnapper (Dafoe) you've ever seen except at the end. He frees his hostage (Redford) often, as no kidnappers would risk, having casual conversations about family relationships, etc. It's all ridiculous! Tja, L.A. Times says it's "an intelligent thriller." Ha ha. It confirms that as most people at L.A. Times. For those of you who believe in it and have not seen it, I will not spoil it with several of the gigantic gaps in this story, especially at the end. The fact is, it is an insult to anyone with intelligence. In any case, you can't fool all people all the time, as critics have not yet figured out. Here's another movie, the spies, who were rightly bombed at the picture office and video store.
