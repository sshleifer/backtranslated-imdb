Having had more than a few buddies, I suggest checking out Footsoldier's end, I came last night. Undoubtedly, the story of Colton Leach has to tell (and did it in his autobiography) a compelling tale of a man's ascent from the Terrace boot boy to the connected underworld villain. Unfortunately, this movie is compromised in quality by miscaster, scary accents and violent acts. Richard Harnett in Leach's lead role makes a reasonable job of transferring the transition from thuggery to serious criminal, but his accent is everywhere. As his voice gives the stories narration, it is something that after ten minutes drove me nuts. Terry Stone as Tony Tucker gave the unintentional comedy a highly appropriate wig (or worst Barnett go) dialogue that was so explosive that it was surrounded by juvenile and one over the top line of line delivery that reduced Tucker to parody. What worried me most about this movie was that the events that led to the shootings of the Court, Essex and Leach's formative years are of real interest to criminal fans and fans of football hooliganism, to get this story sabotaged by the lack of credible accents and acts left me feeling an opportunity had been missed. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper give the films only the source of authenticity. On the positive side, some of the films that paced and constructed streamed well and kept the attention. The violence was well choreographed, and apart from an over-reliance on projectile, red syrup for blood splitting was overall realistic. If you enjoy the movie, it's worth checking out the Essex Boys, who tell a similar story from the fictional point of view and also with Billy Murray.
