MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER, in the form of a novel by Kim Edwards, was a highly successful bestseller and was probably included in more reading groups than any other novel in its turn. So what happened when the novel became a movie for television? Maybe it's the mediocre manuscript below (oops!, Teleplay!) By John Pielmeier, who consistently galumphs together in an awkward pedestrian fashion removes all credibility to the story. Maybe it's the cut and paste direction of Mick Jackson who misses the pacing and character delimitation. Perhaps it suffers from films of an unredited source or "Liquid Tears' musical score of Daniel Licht. For any of these (or all of these) reasons, this novel-to-movie survives because it makes a good case for educating the public about the possibilities of those born with Down syndrome, and for that it is worth paying attention to. <br /> <br /> Dr. David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedist, is married to the beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol), and their lives are changed by their pregnancy. On a stormy winter night in Kentucky, Norah goes to work and Henry's rush to a nearby clinic where David delivers his wife (the doctor is caught in a blizzard) with the help of his old friend nurse Caroline Gill (Emily Watson) After the birth of a perfect boy (Paul), Norah continues to work and (surprisingly ...) supplies an unexpected (!) twin girl, David and Caroline immediately recognize that the little one girl (Phoebe) is a "mongoloid" (This is before the use of the term Down Syndrome) and David, who has a story of losing a little sister due to a birth defect, decides to send Phoebe to an asylum for the mentally challenged: Caroline must deliver and Norah will told that the other twin died at birth. <br /> <br /> Caroline follows instructions, sees the conditions of the 'home' where Phoebe must be deposited, shrinks in horror and decides to keep the baby. Helped by a friendly truck, Caroline changes her lonely existence and mothers Phoebe and finds a new life in her Pittsburgh truck. Norah insists on a formal burial for Phoebe - a fact deeply disturbing David's psyche, and Henry's life continues with only one child Paul who leaves immersed pain about the lack of Phoebe's presence. Norah gifts David with a camera ('people's life is like a camera, this is where they live - in a room caught for a moment') and David gets obsessed with photography. Norah laughs, drinks and loses David's attention while David tracks Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sending money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford for Jamie Spilchuk) grows up, discovers his mother's infidelity and is angry at her father's lack of communication and understanding, and decides to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician, and out to Juilliard he goes. However, Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) has matured into a very highly adapted young girl and the way Henry's broken marriage takes place and the healing atmosphere of Phoebe's and Paul's life combined with the courage that has supported Caroline Gill's struggle to win acceptance In the world for those born with Down's syndrome, the end of the film forms. <br /> <br /> The cast of famous actors is trying hard but only Emily Watson is able to revive a credible character from this squishy script. Jamie Spilchuk provides evidence for a young actor with great promise. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it hard to push empathic characters out of the corny lines they get to deliver. The movie is a mess, but the message of accepting Down syndrome children and adults is an important one. Grady Harp
