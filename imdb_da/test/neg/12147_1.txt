His must certainly be one of the worst gay-themed movies from all the time. Who told any of the so-called actors that they can act. Bad sound - bad script - gestures so overboard that they challenge reality. A nightclub scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes. After watching other low budget films in the same way, I was ready for something innovative - but not easily pathetic. Parents and friends should really not encourage anyone to make such a trip. <br /> <br /> And the DVD - no menu access; It is worse than a VHS tape. Once you have started, you have to see the whole thing through - fortunately the fast-forward button works - with this movie and DVD doing nothing else.
