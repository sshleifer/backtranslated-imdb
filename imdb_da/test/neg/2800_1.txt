Few videos in recent history have been as amateurly produced as this - at least no one has been released by such a reputable distributor. Every frame of this movie is a plagiarism of better movies from the past. The word 'clich√©' is given new meaning by a talented writer / instructor who should reserve his imagination for minor masturbation efforts that do not sacrifice to film consultants. Helping the amateur nightlife scare is a number of less than skilled technicians who contribute poor filmography and ridiculous makeup and special effects. Unfortunately, one or two of the amateur actors in the film are showing a touch of talent that will go unnoticed because of the reputation this cruelty will produce.
