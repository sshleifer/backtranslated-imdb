It sounded like it would be like Silence of the Lambs or Zodiac or something, but it wasn't. It was really more like one of the Halloween movies without all the jump scenes. It was a bit like Plan 9 from outer space in the sense that the big bad guy stopped keeping told talks that made me take a snack without hitting a break. The idea of ​​a person who is so insane that he would abduct people and torture them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea, but the performance was also for television. I must say that it was better than expected for a movie written and starring Dee Snider. A good first effort. Maybe he learns some lessons and his next effort becomes less clumsy.
