The whole set up of this imaginative Disney family movie (ad-exec gets his teenage daughter a horse because she "wants more than anything else in the world") is just an excuse to film the big climate show at the end. All other ingredients (the ad campaign for the stomach pill, Kurt Russell as a potential boyfriend for the youth, Lloyd Bochner as a potential rival for Dean Jones over Diane Baker's feelings) are placed close to the end just to show the horse. Over half of the picture is padding and worse: it is whiny and uncomfortable. The child is the ninny variety that cries on the couch with a dog in her arms and, as usual, gets her way. * from ****
