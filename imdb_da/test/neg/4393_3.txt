Me and a friend rented this movie the other day. At first appearance it seemed to be another teenage movie, which was also what we hoped for, were fans of simple horror and comedy. It seems that the film is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. It quickly accelerates to something that has many options. Unfortunately, it never leaves the ground. We had seen something like an hour when I finally managed to say, "Dude, this movie sucks" It was only 35 minutes ... Dude agreed. <br /> <br /> The problem is: the movie is simply not fun. It should undoubtedly be fun, but it failed. It failed in a way that made me sad. It reminds me of myself. I had the potential to be everything I wanted and instead I ended up seeing cheap horror / funny movies all the time. I take care of the film's decision makers from the bottom of my heart. It's so sad. All that potential .. and nothing.
