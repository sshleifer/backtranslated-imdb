This is a very bad action movie for various reasons. First of all, Seagal is terribly out of shape. He looks old and bold, plays as if he has to fulfill an annoying obligation, and his battle scenes require creative editing or regular replacement. Second, his opponent is a very weak villain. This is about a smart and average masterbrain and chestnut does not deliver. So what about the action? Now, the two parties are permanently shooting at each other in different places in Alcatraz prison. They shoot wildly and badly, because in relation to the amount of ammunition required, the body part is rather low. There is nothing to save this movie. There is not a single good line and not a single good joke. The little psychological interlude with 49er One and Judge McPherson is ridiculous. So what does it have? Well, the usual Bell helicopters, silhouettes that move in blue light and slow motion, the doors scattered with bullets and 1000 watts of light shining through the holes, signs leaping through the air during shooting, lots of weapons coming from none places, a long black coat with a bold black guy and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold. The pain continues to the very first take, a hopeless approach to easing the final credits. California beachboy Don Michael Paul wrote and directed. At least this sad boredom comes from just a simple mind.
