I saw this on my sister-in-law's house one night when it appeared on television, and my mother-in-law said it was one of her favorite movies. Now she can get it. <br /> <br /> Look, I can be enjoyed with a chicken sandwich every now and then as long as it's good. But this one is extra juicy, unrealistic, and simply predictable, despite some decent performances by Rock Hudson and Jane Wyman. It's scary how fast a woman can accept having her vision taken away from her. Oh well, they say love is blind ... The nice and tidy happy little end almost made me gag as well. And how often did we need Otto Kruger to repeat the title? It didn't happen once, not twice, but three times!
