OK, I'm usually fascinated by Z-movies. Some of the actors, directors, authors, etc. in these films have a great talent. They want to get that talent out, unfortunately for them, they have to connect with crappy people to make their movie. But some Z-movies have at least one thing that can be remarkable about them. <br /> <br /> Not here. <br /> <br /> As soon as I saw it, I thought ... "Wow, a Blade knock-off." Believe me if this movie could have lived up to the label that would have made it a better one movie. <br /> Instead, I was exposed to some of the most horrible plays I've ever seen in my life, Master Kao was bad, so bad I think some of my neurons in my brain exploded trying to understand his play, I am still trying to make sense of his termination and why he would raise the voice of speaking certain words ... to add dramatic effect, I'm sure ... but it was without apparent reason Simply mindless. <br /> <br /> Oh, and then there is the black guy in the purple cape at the end of the movie ... Little cape guy is fighting the hero for about 30 seconds, but he is so bad that it looked like he was afraid to fight, the main hero and the biggest villain did decent jobs, the main hero (Derek Washington) seemed that he actually knew martial arts.
