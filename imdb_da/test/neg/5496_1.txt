R.I.C.C.O. is the STUPIDEST film ever made. I can't believe my dad bought this crap. This film should never be made. If this movie was knowledgeable, believe me it will be the number one spot for IMDB's worst. The action is horrible, it's scary, which is why it's horror. This piece of *** had no horror at all. It's a city action that's fun because I could swear it was a comedy. When people were shot, I couldn't help laughing. I am the only one who has reviewed this and I hope I am the last one. With this vote I just hope it will be the # 1 spot in the worst !!!!!!!
