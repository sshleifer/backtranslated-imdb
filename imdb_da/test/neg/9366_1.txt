From the start, this film draws and pulls. Bloody overdubs explain the story, monochrome plays, boring sets, total lack of any humanity, enlistment or style. The actors seem to be drugged. Potentially an exciting story wasted entirely. Surely someone understood how bad it was at one time to produce it?
