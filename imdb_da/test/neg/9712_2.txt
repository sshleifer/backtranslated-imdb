As mentioned by others, could there be any other reason to watch this movie in addition to seeing former "Wayne's World" star Mike Myers play a serious role? The story is interesting but lacks development and sabotage of loose ends and bad signs. If there were any good scenic shots from Ireland, it would give it another reason to see it. But instead, it focuses on a small normal village, which is naturally surrounded by the "green pastures" of the Emerald Isle, which are often featured in Irish films. If there was any cultural "spice" to admire the "Irish personality", it would be worth seeing, but it could almost be shot in England. Too bad for Myers, but this one fails to satisfy or satisfy the heart of anyone who has ever wanted to visit the Guinea country.
