"Shadows and Fog" is certainly one of Woody Allen's weakest films, straight up with "September" and "Hollywood Ending" (though nothing Allen has done the same as for anything else). <br /> <br /> "Shadows and Fog" is Allen's tribute to the German expressionist style of film making, all sharp and stylized light and shadow and ... you guessed it ..... lots of fog. But you can tell that Allen was caught in the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie that anyone would like. Luckily, he made "House and Wives" that year, so things were gone. <br /> <br /> Degree: D
