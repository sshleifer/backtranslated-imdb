I have never seen a movie that frustrated me more than Lord Of The Dance. Frustrated because it could have been fantastic. Frustrated because the dance could have been amazing. Frustrated because the women could have been beautiful. How would I know myself? Since your eyes have moved to the area of ​​interest on the screen and focussed appropriately on the spot to be admired, the crazy editor has moved the shot! I totally agree with the other comments here on crappy lighting and terrible camera / editor work. It makes me sick, just watching ten minutes of this would be a spectacular movie. <br /> <br /> Give me an opportunity to get a live seat for the live concert and I would be in a shot! <br /> <br /> Nicholas T
