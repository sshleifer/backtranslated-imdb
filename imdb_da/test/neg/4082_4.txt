The creative team behind Evan Almighty should really have been able to make a better movie. Starring one of America's favorite funnymen and hell of Ace Ventura Pet Detective director Tom Shadyac one expects a higher laughter count than the picture gives. Hell even Steve Oedekerk, who wrote and directed scary Barnyard last year and obtained a write credit here has done better work. In fact, Evan Almighty is not the worst picture of the summer season, but it may be the most disappointing. The title and creative team behind the picture suggest that this is a successor of 2003 to Bruce Almighty. That image had Jim Carrey in the lead, and while both Steve Carell and Carrey are both funny guys, the latter is better suited to this kind of material. I heard that Carrey was offered this sequel before anyone else, but the actor rejected standing, he saw nowhere else for his character to venture. Thus, Shadyac moved to Carell, who since a funny piece of the 2003 original has asked for stardom. After Sleeping Hits The 40-year-old virgin and little Miss Sunshine has become a big business man, and then it is him rather than rubber to Jim, who leads this production to theaters. The story see Evan Baxter (Steve Carell) has been elected as a congressman, and thus he and his troops move house and state so Evan can find success with his job. His wife (Lauren Graham) and three children are in doubt, but generally show a supportive side against Evan, who sees the future with optimistic eyes. However, things start to go up very quickly, God seems that Evan says a flood is coming and that the politician is going to build an Ark. Initially ignoring the meeting, Evan quickly gives some robes a beard who refuses to be shaved and animals begin to appear two by two. Evan then begins to build the boat, but the neighborhood is not happy nor a fellow politician (John Goodman). Anyone who expects some of Tom Shadyac's other movie to scare laughs will probably be completely cold by this movie. Ace Ventura, Liar Liar and hell even Bruce Almighty where pretty much funny pictures, but all of them; Projects have one thing in mind and that is Jim Carry's presence. Shadyac has not made a worthy movie without Carrey at the helm, he has worked with Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and now Steve Carell, but only Carrey seems to be reporting to Shadyac. Carell after the disappointing Box Office and critical mauling will not be desperate to work with the director again, and with Carrey now doing more serious projects, Shadyac had better find a new comic mouse quickly. Carell herself is pretty boring here, who felt that his bit of the first movie (despite being quite entertaining) deserved a full length feature, should be taken out again and shot. I expect Bruce Almighty's Box Office to have designed it as Universal Studios itself, but you know when a quality comedian cannot do anything with a character, then Scren persona is a dud and that is exactly the case with Evan Almighty . Lauren Graham is no big shake as Evan's wife doesn't either hit the right tone. Freeman lets it all hang out like God in another fun and chilled performance, but he occasionally looks to wear the piece. In fact, the most consistent source of laughter is Evan's secretary (Wanda Sykes) and creep co-worker (Jonah Hill), both of whom made me laugh twice as much as any other character in the project. Oedeker's writing has been worse (Barnyard), but also better (Ace Ventura When Nature Calls) than his work on this production. His script has really funny moments, but it's also full of cloying family moments and humor is never weird or actually insulting enough. The movie takes quite and easily swipe on religion when it should tear the concept to strips. The open church sequence in The Simpsons Movie shakes the religion harder than Evan Almighty's entire 95-minute race. With a bit more bold and heart, this could have been a much better picture. I have no doubt that the nuclear family audience will be mildly entertained by this movie, but if they are satisfied, a completely different question is. There is a line between being attentive and valued, a line that Evan Almighty is always on the wrong side. Maybe when you're bored and the movies on the cable can afford to watch, but I can think of many better ways to spend my time and more importantly my money than tune into this mediocre comedy.
