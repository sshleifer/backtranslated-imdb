Ron Hall pulls a triple threat as he writes, steers and stars in 'Vampire Assassins'. Derek Washington (Hall) is your clich√© cop-on-a-mission that clings to the throat of an eerie vampire action. He turns away from his badge he is searching for the last vampire player (not Buffy!) To take the street back and walk the blood sugar back to the grave. <br /> <br /> 'Vampire Assassins' is a horrible movie. It rip off so many other movies (can you say Blade?) That it never even tries to establish its own identity. Scripture is non-existent. The action is horrible. Who says a micro budget stimulates creativity? There is nothing even externally interesting here. You get nothing out of this except headaches. Stay away at any cost.
