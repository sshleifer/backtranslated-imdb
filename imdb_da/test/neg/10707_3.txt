... but had to see just how bad it could be. The plot line was thin to begin with, but it just got worse. A female genetic engineering degree student uses her research on accelerated mitosis to artificially create a man because a biological weapon used in World War II killed 97% of the worldwide male population. The surviving men are either high priced gigolos in back alley clubs or crazy lunatics in run down football stadiums plan to overthrow the "Lesbian conspiracy". The whole process resembled the microwaving of a large bowl of jello. Touch a few buttons and ding you get a baby. Not only that, but he will age to mid 20 years in a month, and then begin to age normally (how practical). Finally, poor Adam gets bored with the secluded hut in the woods, where his creator had raised him and stolen his car to "see the city". This begins 90 minutes with unlikely chases, practical plot twists and more subplots that we never see resolved. As Adam quickly learns what men survived, they are treated as vulnerable / criminals because they are dangerous animals that cannot help there genetic predisposition to violence. The propaganda machines have been in full swing and scare women into believing that all men are rapists and killers. This has led to lesbianism being the norm, the fall of Christianity, only female reproduction via cloning, and oh yes world peace among other implicit results. Everyone seems unlikely as only 30 years have passed since the war. Adam stumbles from one bad situation to the next, constantly being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to really do much on his own. With the FBI on his track, Madam's looking for fresh meat, and his creator trying to resume him (by itself it seems), he learns that violence is not limited to the male at all. <br /> <br /> All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie. However, I enjoyed Veronica Cartwight's depiction of "love to hate her" director of the FBI, and Julie Bowen did not do badly as Hope the 'closet hetero' geneticist either.
