The play was terrible, the cheesy, false, CHEAP green screen effects were ridiculous, and the creatures were totally retarded. The only good thing about this movie was the concept, and the laugh I got from seeing such a bad movie - then I was pretty angry because I realized I was wasting 4 bucks to rent it. Why would a movie like this ever be in theaters? I know this movie came out almost 5 years ago, but does anyone make any effort to make movies anymore? I just write random things to fill space - because I need ten lines of text to publish this review. This next line should almost only do so. Other terms there!
