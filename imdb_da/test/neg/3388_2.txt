I want to know who proclaimed the producers of this movie to pay for its production - That perception is a genius of that kind. This movie somehow kept my attention on about two-thirds of it until I realized it wasn't going fast. I think the music managed to make it seem like something was happening, but nothing was real. It wasn't scary. The dialogue was poorly written. The first 90 minutes should have been covered in about 15 minutes. This would have been a moderately acceptable Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode. <br /> <br /> At this point I'm just angry that I spilled all the time. It's a couple of hours I never come back. <br /> <br /> I hope these comments will save someone from wasting their night. Take a nap or pull in the gym instead. Or if you want to be scared, turn on a cable news channel.
