I was looking forward to seeing the documentaries' self-inflicted mastermind behind Boondock Saints, one of the most aggravating and pointless movies I've ever seen. But makers of "Overnight" friends (ex?) Of that mastermind - must also learn how to make a movie. Different inappropriate remarks, shouting obscenities in the phone and enjoying his alcohol do indeed Mr Duffy look like a putz. But it does not shed light on why the guy got a contract in the first place, what his creative process or vision is - what is Boondock Saints about? How hard is meeting Patrick Swayze? What are these strange institutional machinations where our obnoxious heroes are captured? Because the film doesn't try to answer these questions in a coherent way, it doesn't stop having dippity-doo say about Hollywood either. So who cares?
