DO NOT PRESENT HYPE! <br /> <br /> I had to see why all the critics came across this movie. I've seen it and still don't get it. The plot is thin, very thin. After the movie was over, I still didn't know the woman's protagonists, and one of the two male characters didn't even have a name in the credits, he is credited as "the farmer". I didn't care about the characters, so I didn't care about the movie. The landscape and cinematography were brilliant, but there are also things on National Geographic or The Discovery Channel. <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
