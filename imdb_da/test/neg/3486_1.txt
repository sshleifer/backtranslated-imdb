This movie has the language, style and attitude down ... plus greats rides from Occy (a world champion) and the great Jerry Lopez. John Philbin as Turtle has surf pidgin down and surfing scenes are still the best ever. A true classic that can be seen many times. Nia Peeples is a treasure and Laird Hamilton shows the early things that have made him the world's second largest surfer.
