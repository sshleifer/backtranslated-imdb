I will not spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the hideous plot lines, I just want to say that this movie is suffering from bad animation, over action, obvious roof lines ?? These are some of the good qualities. If you are deserted on an isolated island and the only link to the civilization you have is this movie throw it to the fish. I can't tell you how much I'm sorry I saw this horrible horrible movie. Talking about, this movie allegedly a horror movie cannot be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the movie is some of the actors' gaming opportunities. <br /> <br /> Beware.
