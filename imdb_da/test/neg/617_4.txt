'Felony' is a B-movie. No doubt about it. <br /> <br /> Of course, if you look at the cast lineup, you may have some hope for its entertainment potential. This movie is filled with all the wonderful character actors you grew up with, those with the faces that you recognize immediately, even though you probably don't know their names. It is amazing that the filmmakers were able to bring all these people together on one project, almost as if they decided to make a B-movie actor reunion. The cast itself contains a few really first-rate actors: David Warner, whom most people recognize from 'Titanic' (although my favorite of his roles is Jack the Ripper in 'Time After Time') and Lance Henriksen, many of whom will remember as Bishop in 'Aliens'. These two actors have done some excellent work in their long careers and made some very fine films. But as impressive as this collection of actors, their talent is never fully manifested on the screen. The authors of 'Felony' spent a lot of money gathering a dream team and then threw their golden opportunity because of a major factor, common denominator for all B movies: a stupid script. <br /> <br /> We start with a foolish premise. The evil guys are trapped on ties that commit a cruel murder, and they effortlessly pursue the movie staff to acquire the videotape and destroy the evidence. But honestly, why bother? During the time it takes them to track the movie staff, a thousand copies of that tape could be made and circulated to all law enforcement agencies and media. The criminals do not seem to realize how vain their efforts are and they are talking about stealing and destroying one original videotape that will solve the whole problem. Silly ... but I guess if the wicked were so logical, there would be no movie. <br /> <br /> There is the dialogue. It is sometimes stupid, sometimes clich√©, and sometimes incredible ... everything you expected from a B movie. Of course, I have always believed that strong ideas can overcome a lot of weaknesses in the material. This cast contains players who definitely have a strong performance, and although a number of the cast members are not good players and have achieved B-movie status deservedly, one can still hope that the strongest part of the cast would be able to infuse some life into their parts. However, it is disappointing to see that few of the actors in this movie really seem to take the film seriously enough to give it their best shot. There is not much inspiration in these performances, but again it is an uninspiring script. Now I will admit that some of the more colorful actors in the cast are able to add a certain amount of pizazz to the delivery of their lines, but honestly, even the very fine actors I mentioned earlier seem to be most uninterested and involved with history. <br /> <br /> Talking about the story ... even though the actor had been of high enough caliber, it made the dialogue seem a little less cheesy, it would still not redeem 'Felony' from the fact that its author commits For the ultimate faux pas of low budget action movie scripts: a plot with as many holes as a block of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie a hundred times and you still won't find out how everything goes. In an effort to create excitement and always keep the viewer guessing, the author throws in all sorts of surprises and unexpected turns into his manuscript and ends with a puzzle, but when you get to the end you find that there are a lot of pieces it just fits not everywhere and others missing. I admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing, but creating plot twists that exist just to confuse you and which do not conform to the rest of the story is amateurish. There was so much that it was never explained that I felt extremely frustrated at the end. If you decide to see it, be prepared to be confused. I haven't even mentioned any other silly stuff about this movie, but I won't bother. The funny thing is that, after all, I have to admit that I can't give 'Felony' 1/10 stars. Although I can't exactly put my finger on why, I actually found this movie to be a little sympathetic. Silliness can actually be fun at times if you are in the mood for it. In addition, I like some of these character players, and although their performances are somewhat lacking in view of their talents, I still got a kick out of seeing them. <br /> <br /> Now, I realize I've rated this movie from a serious movie gallery. It is quite possible I have completely missed the point. It might be that the filmmakers' intention was to make a B film all the time. Perhaps silliness is all intentional. If so, and if I were to judge on these terms, I would say that 'Felony' is a classic in the genre of heavy-in-kind action flicks. B-movie fans will love watching all their favorite actors together in a movie, getting some chuckles from the script, and being entertained by the healthy dose of pistols, explosions and chases.
