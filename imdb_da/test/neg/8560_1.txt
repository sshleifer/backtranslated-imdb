I can't even describe it. It's the worst movie I've ever seen (I'm a good guy when I call that movie). Just another big budget-made-to-one-as-not-as-think-much. It's not even scary. It's disgusting when there are good movies that never reach the big screen, and then this ... "thing" comes to fool movie fans. I think the big producers are doing what they want. Just get a big producer, hot chicks (though horrible actresses) and a host of horror movie cliches and cook it for a week or so and you'll get "The Nun". <br /> <br /> And I thought Bad Boys 2 was horrible !!!!
