I just finished watching this movie and found virtually the waste of time with little or no redeeming factors. I really do not understand where all the positive reviews came from - the animation is lumpy and unrefined, the plot does not make any sense from an objective point of view, and there is no sense of intrigue or excitement in what is trying to pass itself as an exciting and exciting movies. I have never read the book, so I can't say if the movie was faithful, but as with most movie adaptations, it tries too hard to get as much information in the shortest time as possible. The result is an inconsistent and illogical story that does not really give you understanding or relate to the characters or actually anything. Overall, I felt completely disconnected from the characters and plotted to the point where I could not break my mind about what happened to them, and the only way I can see how this animation could be considered beautiful is, If your normal standard of animation is a Scooby-Doo cartoon.
