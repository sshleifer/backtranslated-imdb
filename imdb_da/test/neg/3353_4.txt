Cramped horror excursion has an innocent teen (Meg Tilly, as always appealing) trying to get off to a good start with the popular click in school (although they seem to hate her) and being subjected to their sorority-like dedication: spending night in a creepy mausoleum. In spite of the complete lack of originality, this low-budget thriller manages to make some decent special effects and has more good performances (especially by Robin Evans, who carries out campy evil as head of the girls). The script is not sharp, but it has enough quirks to make the case bearable. ** from ****
