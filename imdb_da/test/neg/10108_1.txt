<br /> <br /> Spoilers <br /> I'm going to be as friendly as I can about this movie (some people, including directors!, may be completely disturbed when reviewers speak their opinion) so ... <br /> <br /> There's a good car accident and the opening credits look good and ... that's it; everything else bites the big one. All the play is terrible, the script is embarrassing, the special effects look like they were made by school children on cheap computers. All in all, this movie has serious bowling shoe tendencies. As a horror movie, it's not very scary, and if it were a "thinking man's" horror movie well managed on some level, I thought the end of this movie is terribly far away. It may actually be an ironic look at bad horror movies, and I miss the point, but I doubt somehow. <br /> <br /> This is a complete car phone store in a movie, and I couldn't recommend it to anyone and that doesn't make me say this when I eagerly await the resurrection of British Horror. <br /> <br /> If you disagree with this review, it's fine, it's just my own opinion, and I'm sure someone out there will love it (the director's mother for example).
