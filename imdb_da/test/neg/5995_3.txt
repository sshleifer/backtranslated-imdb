This should have rocked. VH1 moved away from the traditional divas (Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, etc.) who had made the 2003 show obsolete. Unfortunately, the move went back. The show had no MC to keep the show together. Queen Latifah did a fantastic show at the 2003 Divas. The show kicked off with a horrible reproduction of Lady Marmalade with Patti Labelle, Cyndi Lauper and Jessica Simpson. Okay in the studio with some control they can all sound good. <br /> <br /> But when they compete with each other (why?) it just sounds torture! Jessica Simpson has the most bizarre facial expressions when she sings that I've ever witnessed! Cyndi Lauper also performed Girl Just Wanna Have Fun. It wasn't that bad, but it was hardly impressive. The worst was yet to come! Cyndi and Patti Labelle joined forces to perform Cyndi's hit 'Time After Time'. It was acoustic and did not fit in with the rest of the show. Still it could have been okay if they both hadn't insisted on trembling as mamed animals. It was just violent. <br /> <br /> Debbie Harry (from Blondie) is always cool. She has her own style and although she may not be able to compete vocal with many of the divas even though she can certainly sing very well. Debbie came out and performed Blondie's # 1 hit 'Rapture'. With some lovely vocals. She really hit the notes perfectly. She looked great. Rapper Eva delivered a new, but unfortunately subordinate rap. It was good. Debbie's next performance was a team with newcomer Joss Stone. They performed Blondie hit 'One Way Or Another'. I think Joss misunderstood the style of the song and just shouted over Debbie. A rather sad bit was when Debbie tried and failed to match her shouty style that spoiled it a little. She should just have let Joss continue with her totally inappropriate warballing. All of Blondie did this track. The final track Debbie performed was Blondie's massive hit 'Call Me'. It was pretty poor. Not Debbie's sake, because you just couldn't hear her. The sound was terrible all the way through the show. <br /> <br /> Joss Stone also performed a few songs on his own. They were quite well done. Ashanti also appeared to perform two inexplicable cover versions. First, she did Diana Ross' 'I'm coming out', and then Chaka Khan's' Not any '. She's not a diva! She can sing to a degree, but she has no presence at all. Why not just get the right singers in. Chaka was even interviewed on the show. <br /> <br /> Gladys Knight appeared and did a medley. That was very good. She was probably the best part of the show. I don't know much about her other than she is an experienced artist in Las Vegas, and her experience and class really shone through. Patti Labelle mounted in another performance this time her 80s hit 'New Attitude'. It was the final, and it was okay, but it was too late. This was a big dud. Better luck next time VH1. <br /> <br /> The version I saw was a heavily edited 55min version shown on VH1 in the UK. If these were the best bits .....
