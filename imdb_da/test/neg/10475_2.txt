This movie was not really well-aimed. they almost completely ignored the book. I guess they tried 2 save time. the only upside 2 me was that the actor who played finny was sweet. Some of the dialogue between the protagonists appeared a little homosexual, which was not the case in the book. Most of the book was once again carved out. You lost it over all the effect, it wasn't as scary as the book and left me missing seriously. Also, the strong language, although short, was very unnecessary. I was also surprised (not pleasant) by a new character who was not in the book. One of my favorite characters (leper) was poorly interpreted and portrayed. He seemed more creepy in the movie than the real leper was in the book. Over all disappointing.
