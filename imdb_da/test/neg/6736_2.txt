I saw that "The Foreigner" was ranked in the movie list "Bottom 100" here on IMDb, so I didn't expect much when I voted in on the US channel one week back, but I had hope. "Belly of the Beast" (which aired a month ago) was a mess, but it had fantastic scenery and photography and some beautiful cool moments scattered so I thought this movie might have some of the same. <br /> <br /> Oh, this movie fails the standards of basic watch ability in almost every way. The play comes out as a bastard offspring of a John LeCarre novel and a Richard Ludlum movie, but performed by humans with none of these worthy writers talent for plot and characterization. Instead, what we got is a glum, medium-spirited, nihilistic, cryptic jumping cabin with confused motives, collapsed alliances and back-shootings. And chest slides. And bombings. And eviscerations. This transfers to the direct style, which relies on hackneyed 'grain shot / slow motion' shoots every 10 seconds, along with wire work and hyperactive jump cuts. These cinematic devices, which were outdated 10 years ago when MTV directors used them for Whitesnake videos, and the director works them as a punch press, hoping to inject some weird art-house techno thriller coolness into the case. <br /> <br /> Segal itself is just horrible in this. He uses the whole movie to talk in a hoarse, half whisper and switch between two expressions: Just as he sucks on a lemon, while someone bends a little thin under his nose or looks constipated. And he is so chunky (and in vain about it) that he never actually takes his knee length on the camera. I understand it's hard to keep the perimeter under control like male actors (though Denzel Washington and Paul Newman never seemed to have that problem). But you handle it by being honest about it and by growing as an actor, not by saving it with carefully selected camera angles and floor lengths. <br /> <br /> So I can't really tell what's going on, and the movie doesn't give me a reason to break my mind, and the protagonist is completely one-dimensional and visually unpleasant. Not a recipe for a good movie experience. <br /> <br /> It is strange that most of the set designs and landscapes are atmospheric and striking; In fact, if you were to freeze the movie on almost any particular scene that was not close to Seagal, you would be afflicted with the care and professionalism of lighting, colors and composition and of how beautiful the Eastern European settings are. But dressing a rotten egg like a Faberge egg cannot make it edible. And the case is the mess of the heart. <br /> <br /> There are "cool" movies (like "Versus") and there are visually striking but emotionally cold movies (like "Underworld") and there are paranoia conspiracy players (like "The Bourne Identity" and its remake with Matt Damon). And then there is this thing that cannot imagine what it will be, pretending to be all these things, and failing because it has no gut or soul. <br /> <br /> This is a movie made by professionals with a real budget so you can't really put it in the same class as "Manos", "Killer Shrews" or "Hobgoblins". But I'd rather see all three of these movies back to back more than see "The Foreigner" again once.
