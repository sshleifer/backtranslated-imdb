The first of three Aztec Mummies movies is the only one that, in my best consciousness, was never completely dubbed English. The movie was chopped up and used by people like Jerry Warren in other films (he combined it with another Mexican horror comedy with Lon Chaney to make Face of the Screaming Werewolf. And it appeared in Attack of the Mayan Mummy and elsewhere .) The longest of the three films make up a good part of this movie the later two films that use this as a basis for flashbacks. The basis of this film is a scientist who performs a previous life regression experiment that causes his subject to return and discover hidden chambers in an aztec pyramid. The group, as well as a creepy figure known as the Bat, hopes to use the information to discover hidden treasure. Instead, they discover a living mummy that has other plans. Far and far this film has far too little effort to maintain its 80 minute driving time (worse mummy doesn't even get up to an hour has passed). Probably the smallest of the three films, it's easy to see why this movie was cut apart, it's the only way to fashion on a movie that doesn't lead to sleep. Looking at the movie late last night, I found myself struggling to keep myself awake. It was a tough move and I found out that I ended up scanning to the point where the mummy appeared. Given the choice, I would take a passport and watch the other two movies.
