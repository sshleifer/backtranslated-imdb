This movie is pathetic in every way possible. Bad play, horrible script (was there one?), Horrible editing, miserable filmography, cheap humor. Just awful. <br /> <br /> I watched 'The Wishmaster' a couple of weeks before this movie, and I thought it was a dead-end ringtone for the worst movie of the year. So I saw 'The Pest' and suddenly 'The Wishmaster' didn't seem that bad at all. <br /> <br /> Bad Bath Bath. Terribly bad.
