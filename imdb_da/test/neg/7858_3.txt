Henry (Don Ameche) appears at the entrance to hell and tells his life story to His Excellence (Laird Cregar). History focuses on his relationship with women throughout his life, and especially his relationship with Martha (Gene Tierney). At the end of the film, we cut to Henry and His Excellence for a very predictable ending. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there is nothing more to say about the movie because nothing happens. It's a sentimental story of a man's life and it's very boring. I saw it with my girlfriend and my father, and we all thought it was bad, despite the Lubitsch touch. I yawned more than 15 times. Hugo (Charles Coburn) is good when he is on the screen as a grandfather and there were a few fun moments of dialogue. The color made it a good play, but it was not enough to save this plodder from entering the rejection pile. In the same form as "It's a wonderful world" and "You can't take it with you," and it was not surprising that it was nominated for an Oscar. A story about ordinary people, none of them are interesting and without history of any interest. Drilling, sentimental and the largest humid squib of an end that I can remember ...
