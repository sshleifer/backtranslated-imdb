As a flagship show, the Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic to the greater fall of G4 TV; It's a show (and a station) that has fallen so far that it parades sex to try to cover its glorious mistakes. Its predecessor, The Screen Savers, was a place for technology troubleshooting and exploration of the latest and greatest technology. It was a lovely show with a nice staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments that the crew could put together. <br /> <br /> The acquisition of TechTV by G4 disturbed some long ago fans of the station, but early returns were actually promising. The importance of games was a nice addition, and I really enjoyed the coverage of E3 and other major entertainment events. Unfortunately, AOTS now stands as a shell of its former self. Those who oversee the channel have shifted the channel's focus away from technology and games and to anything that can bring forth dream from young adult men. The result is that AOTS spends as much time as parading Olivia Munn or touting the adult film industry as it covers games. It's so bad that it's practically impossible. While some might get poignant joy out of this kind of thing, those who really enjoy games can wonder where the good coverage went. Just disturbing young players, who may be listening to G4, are thinking about getting games - the active game group between 10-15 - is instead fed on a more mature audience. On a channel such as HBO or Cinemax such things are expected. At G4, it's tragic. <br /> <br /> At least SpikeTV, another paint-targeted channel, is good programming as CSI. AOTS and G4 have very little good to offer. <br /> <br /> Too bad, really.
