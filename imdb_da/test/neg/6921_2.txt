Occasionally speaking, a good current debate sparks some interesting opinions from the audience. Unfortunately, there is always a desperate sad person seeking acceptance, who will end any interesting debate immediately by standing up and saying the word "Everyone must come together and love each other" as they know they are guaranteed to receive applause and confirmation as no one would disagree. <br /> <br /> Now those same people who marked this movie so well, why did they do it? UNCERTAINTY. Still, it's all I want to say about that. <br /> <br /> The movie, it begins with interesting interesting, so you hope it will build, and if I have solved myself with a nice pair of glasses of wine and some cheese, then you will give it even more a chance, simply Because you can't be bothered to move. <br /> <br /> But as you daydream, you walk, your mind runs off on other things, why? because the director did it too! he took his foot out of the gas, and then he understood 'ooops' to compensate for him accelerating hard, but then he runs again, and again you make the story slower, the plot thaws and almost disappears, you wonder yourself about yourself "What happened again?" As you consider your screen, Nick Nolte is running around with some supposed purpose, but you've long watched what he does, and he appears as nothing more than a screen saver in the background for your day to dream. /> <br /> Michael Moriarty, who plays John Converse, has a great ability to speak without moving his lips or his face, like a ventriloquist, he must have gone to the Nicolas Cage school of expressionless facial, or he was attacked by the Phantom Botox injector. Tuesday Weld was to play Marge Converse, but instead she played Mia Farrow perfectly. <br /> <br /> In all, there are hundreds of movies to watch, so let it be one of the last you see, I just wasted an evening watching it as I could have seen or done something else, learn from my mistake, nights relaxing is precious, so don't play someone who sees this boring tale, does something else, dusts the old game of Cluedo, practices gurni ng for the evening or has an argument with a loved one, trim your nose hair, get rid of unused files on our laptop, it will be time better spent what you ever have to choose.
