This early movie by director Bob Clark ("Porky's", "Black Christmas", "A Christmas Story") did not really pump my nads as I expected. In fact, it annoyed me straight up. It's about a theater group that sails to a funeral island that consists of dead criminals, where they plan to evoke some evil forces and revive some bodies ... The leader of the group, a gifted black magic enthusiast and possible homosexual attempts to summon Satan's help for the re-animation of an excavated body that fails so that they take the body to the nearby, desolate janitor's house and play with it ... Nothing interesting happens until the last fifteen minutes or so when the undead finally come from their graves and go after desecratorens. The makeup effects are okay, gore is very minimal (PG rating), and the extremely annoying characters are focused on too much, which has really got on my nerves. I think having a group of terrible actors bickering for an hour was supposed to correspond to some "comic" status, but I found no humor in it at all. The whole concept is just ridiculous - how these kids are willing to dig up and monkey around with a dead body as long as they did. The characters are stereotypical and bland, and the movie is simply boring ... Don't waste your time with it ...
