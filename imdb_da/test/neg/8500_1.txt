I didn't understand the people who rated it above 5. I think it's a horrible movie from every point of view. Plots, acting, art, dialogue, music at all! I don't mind a low budget. But you have to get some points. Wandering, wondering .. infinite ... the two boys began to kiss in bed. awful ,, just awful. I love indie movies, don't mind it's slow. But this movie disappointed me from every perspective. Even Graffito, not artistic. <br /> <br /> I wondered what kind of people liked it. I am a woman in my 30-year-old. Is it for teens who have some kind of loneliness about life, or haven't I got it? What have I got then? Wasting time! Please go to some others.
