One can always tell if I enjoy a movie by the number of times I cross my legs, change positions, make light rusting sounds, etc. The smaller = the better. I moved so many times throughout this movie that I managed to knock over my friends giant tub of popcorn and get a huge thigh strength training. Sobieski, a young actress who on some points in "A Soldier Daughter Never Cries" gave some promise of her thespian talents played badly in a badly written part. Depressing fact number one. Number two: Chris Klein was in it. Depressing fact number three: Chris Klein had lines. Number four: Chris Klein played a valedictorian. Woah. Dummies from rich families unite! Even worse, he actually tries to act, but only succeeds in sounding like a mentally handicapped overactor in an increasingly juicy independent version of a Cecille B. DeMille film. Go back to humping your American pies. <br /> <br /> This movie was horrible in almost every sense, scaring Josh Hartnet's mildly favorite performance as LeeLees stiffen boyfriend Jasper. Fortunately, he refrains from trying to have too many "moments", unlike all the other characters. Of course, that's why he is much better than the rest, and he actually shows some mettle here. If you like Josh or are thinking of casting a child who knows a few things, he is your husband. <br /> <br /> Hartnett is a sharp actor, but the rest lacks further lambasting. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for poor Hartnett in this horrible movie) <br /> <br />
