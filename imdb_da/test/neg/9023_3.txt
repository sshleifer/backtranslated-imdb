While most of Wayne's B efforts are entertaining in a fun way, this movie is so bluntly edited and written, it's a dud. The first ten minutes alone, Wayne and bandits in nighttimes scenes intercut with stock footage apparently show off today. Dwire plays half a white, half Apache bandit with a heavy Mexican accent, and he doesn't seem to be pulling off any nationality! I give this a 3.
