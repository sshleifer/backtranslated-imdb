The very first time I saw this, I recall in HORROR on what was presented as modern, liberated women. Sorry, but I can't relate to whining idiots whose lives are about loveless sex and the acquisition of Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton labels. The worrying thing is that some might actually think this is how career women live in NYC. It is certainly not. These women are incredibly superficial and materialistic, and as another reviewer said, they act as gold diggers. <br /> <br /> This is not liberated femininity and I am glad it is gone. 0 stars and just plain horrible
