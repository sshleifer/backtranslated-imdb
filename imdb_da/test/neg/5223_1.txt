I recently had the idea of ​​making a short film with a man hit by a car and waking up that he himself is Chuck Norris. This meant I had to do extensive chuck research and find out what I could about the man. I later find that he is not a man, but an angel sent from heaven. With a face like that, who could ever doubt it? I've seen several Chuck Norris movies in the last four months than a person was supposed to. I'm proud to say that the Bells of Innocence is pretty close to the top of the all-time worst list. I asked most of the movie if I could return my copy to the local Wal-Mart without the receipt, which I had bitten down to keep me from swallowing my own tuna. The biggest reason I chose to buy this movie was that it not only had Chuck in it, but his son Mike. I was eager to see if Mike was a chip from the old can't-act-his-out-of-a-law paper-bag block. I came to the conclusion a long time ago; Chuck Norris is one of the worst actors in film history for a single reason. The only character he ever plays is himself, Chuck Norris. No matter what movie, whatever the situation, he is always Chuck Norris. The one thing he holds over his son is that he is consistent. Mike doesn't seem to understand how human emotions work. In the scene where he speaks to the little girl about her dead daughter, he seems to be very happy! Perhaps this is because he actually pushed his daughter into traffic, as depicted in one of the strangest flashbacks of all time. His actions confused me throughout the film, making it very difficult for me to focus on the little plot that was. The other two leaders were just as painful to see as Norri's son. The guy who constantly wants to eat or tell a stupid peacock joke was simply one of the most annoying signs ever to cut directly to the video screen. The only thing I remember being in the other than this movie was an episode of Walker Texas Ranger, where he plays an equally annoying character. Maybe Chuck owes this guy something. The other guy who is the only name I can think of because he was so forgetful was your average Christian fanatic. I don't mind Christians, I'm actually one, but this guy was just too much for me. To round off the story, you have a lot of citizens who love to call people "friend" and a few villains who do not seem to be able to determine which one is responsible. Not to mention the scary kids reminding me of the dollar store version of any other group of scary children in movies. All in all, the movie may be one of the biggest mistakes of the time, on more levels than Chuck Norris can kick people's donkeys. Despite being one of the worst actors from all the time, I still can't get enough of Chuck. Maybe he was really sent from heaven ...
