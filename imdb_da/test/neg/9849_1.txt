There are so many things wrong with this movie, I don't even know where to start. The story is not coherent at all. I guarantee that five minutes in the movie will crawl the viewer his / her head in confusion. <br /> <br /> Here's what I remember about the movie before I bored myself with unconsciousness: A quasi-violent father chases some pre-teen sisters through a house, but turns out not to be so fierce at all. In the next scene, the girls are around 15. They drive with their parents and hit a deer. The deer must have been explosive because their car is blowing up, a sister pulls the other from the burning wreck. Then the girls drive into a boat on a lake and make a big plan to go to Kentucky (??) and start a new life. In the next scene, the girls run towards a military base. And what military base it is. In fact, it is more like a hog farm converted to look like a military base with lots of confused extras playing "soldiers." The Base Commander office is particularly amazing because there are random things like an AK-47 hanging on the wall and a drill sergeant hat mounted on a plaque (????) so the audience is sure to know this is a military lighthouse office. Then some random guy pushing a motorcycle shows up, and the base commander instructs him to go into town to buy some porn mags, and to make sure the soldiers don't think he's on the "pink team". So our character takes a pickup converted to look like a military car "to the city" and puts up a box from an indefinite "bookstore" with a blowup doll at the front door. The girls hide in the guy's truck when he stops gasing up and looks through the porn stash to find items inside like "anal invader." I think that's enough of the plot to scare most people away. Plot aside, the sound quality is horrible, and the movie is full of cheesy attempts at symbolism, like a radio announcer talking about forbidden fruits during the scene where "slutty" sister meets the protagonist for the first time, or how the camera kills too long on certain shot to try to convey a "message". <br /> <br /> If you ever see this for sale or rent or anything, stay away. It's not worth the money in either case.
