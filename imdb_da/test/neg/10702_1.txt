All I ever heard while I was traveling was gender equality, and here we have a movie that not only exemplifies imbalance, but continues with a whole concept that a gender is better. I have always been hoping for the redeeming quality to make the viewer feel like there is hope for the future, and there it was. I will admit that I did not finish the movie, I had to turn off the part where the old man whore told the genetic Adam that it was ok to be a whore and get, and I quote: "More tail than any man in the past time. "I'm not completing it's a bad review of myself, but it's the writer's and crew member's responsibility to develop a story that will keep a viewer interested and they fail. This movie confuses all true female nature characteristics of the mother figure and the need for balance. Instead, it exemplifies what America ran of lesbian natzis would be like, and I'm not against lesbians. Thank you, Mr President! Someone gives me a redeeming quality ... wait I have it! There is no successor!
