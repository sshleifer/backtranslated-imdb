This movie is so bad that it forced me to create an account with IMDb just to warn others about it. <br /> <br /> I've been using IMDb for a long time, and many movies have come close to making me feel like registering for either praise or bash them, but no one has ever been worthy. Until now! <br /> <br /> I'm a big Matt Dillon fan. all i could ask myself throughout this movie is "how did Dillon choose this script"? really. I think there are gaps in the bigger than Vredefort. <br /> <br /> I think it's a modern hoist movie, not a set in the seventies. To cry aloud, even a child knows that armored trucks have GPS tracking and the variety. makes you wonder what it takes to get a script produced in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> I could go on for years, but I don't want to. believe me when I say this. Save yourself time and give this a jump. <br /> <br /> Sorry Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie is sucked.
