I don't see the point. It is strange. The animated people are scary (look up the creepy valley). Scenes continue and continue for very small purposes. The plot is the skeleton and must be padded with lots of pointless dramatic, screaming slides, as if Disney or Spielberg were planning an amusement park based on the movie. Most of the characters are annoying and unlikeable. Some of them continue to appear as if they want something important to add to a climate game. They don't. They just disappear without a lasting impact. Someone summed it up as "if you don't believe in Santa Claus, you're kidnapped on a train on Christmas Eve." It sums it up.
