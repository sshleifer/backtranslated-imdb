I often prefer French movies over American, with explosions and car gates, but this movie was very disappointing. There is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens. This French couple have lived in Lisbon for years and they return to Paris for a friend's wedding. They advertise to another friend, they have dinner with them to split. So much does not happen, they do not seem to know if they want to separate or not. I don't necessarily think their hesitation makes a bad movie, it's very human to hesitate before making such a decision for good, but it can be treated in an interesting way, giving some meat to their desires and their relationships, but it does not happen. You get out of the theater uncertain why these two came together or want to share. The only piece I enjoyed was the conversation with the full one. It was true for life.
