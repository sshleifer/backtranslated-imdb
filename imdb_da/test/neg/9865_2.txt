Yes! this movie was just bad in every way in things like cast, effects, boredom, excitement and of course being great, and we all know that the four heroes in this one were a little more colorful compared to the new ones, but it still needs go, a fantastic drilling like this was really just silly waste, as i knew no one would like, as i saw it, i guess certainly with the budget about 3 or 4 good movies could have been made, but no. I'm just glad that the new version that was made this year completely showed everyone how the amazing four should have been made with good story, great cast like Jessica Alba, one of my favorite actresses otherwise it would have been totally forgotten but fortunately no. The new one was excellent when I saw it with my friends in the cinema, but this old fantastic drill has to go.
