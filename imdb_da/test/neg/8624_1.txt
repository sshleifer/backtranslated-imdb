This movie was so badly acted. What was with Jeff Bridge's accent, horrible and incredible. Should it be French, Scandinavian? Scripture was paralyzed. To get the herointing over the grave of his girlfriend while running from the Jeff Bridges character ... are you kidding me? How convenient Jeff brings his dirty shovel in the house after he has cut off organs in his lawn. Do these people just don't think about calling the police? Okay ... I get into the car with you, why not? YOU H! Why was Bros daughter obsessed with getting her father to have an affair, is her mother evil or just boring? I didn't see the original, it would be hard to make myself after watching this movie.
