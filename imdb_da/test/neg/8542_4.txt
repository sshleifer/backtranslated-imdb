Jess Franco is making film and he has made tons of them. Franco is responsible for some of the most shocking movies in cinema history, and God bless him for that. Unfortunately, The Diamonds of Kilominjaro is a truly horrible movie that is not up to its usual standards. Exercise films should be judged on history, sex and behavior. What else is there? This movie fails on most of these benchmarks. The plot is paper thin and places a nubile young girl in the jungle among cannibals. We really don't get information about why she and her father were there in the first place. As expected, her father is the "Big White Chief," and she becomes a goddess, sitting in trees, naked. Add yachts and gemstones and you have your basic rescue girl for greedy intentions, plot line. The characters are in stock, without adding an ounce of credibility to the case. <br /> <br /> Gore? None, or at least very little. This film is often mentioned in the same vein as the classic Italian cannibal films. Those looking for that kind of thing must run the other way. Save for a cheap be-heading, this movie has surprisingly little blood and gut. <br /> <br /> As best I can tell the only reason this movie exists, Katja Bienert, Aliene Mess and Mari Carmen Neieto can run around naked. In fact, "Lita" (Mari Carmen Neieto) makes the full frontal heavy lifting, while the two jungle ladies are harsh all the time. Yes, there are love scenes .... probably the most sterile Franco has ever watched. The women are beautiful but nothing here to really make this movie an erotic classic either. <br /> <br /> This movie is just a series of low budget buffoonery. The sets are ridiculous. The action is horrible, and editing is confusing. There is no real story to keep this together and not enough of a budget (or effort) to shock or titrate. I think Franco fans have come to expect more from the development champion.
