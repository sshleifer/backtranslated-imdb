This movie was rented for free, I had no misconception that this was a very bad movie. I rented it for Thanksgiving because we eat turkey and then watch the family on a horrible movie. So you ask what makes this movie so bad that you gave it only 2 stars? Dialog. Lack of dialogue makes this a movie perfect for a deaf audience. In fact, if you rent this, just turn down the volume to zero and pop on any heavy metal CD from your favorite artist. I know you will enjoy it better. The reason for this holiday turkey was so obsessed with tech and geek that you need a translator for the story. Now for all of you people who enjoy good sci-fi effects ... eh, they are not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes in cases worse. The actors, both of them, are not much to look at. They say nothing much throughout the film. Many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like the scene where the hero sticks to a missile and burns it in the city 70km away (it never showed how she landed). The scene before that we see a robot fire on her with a cannon from 12 meters away, and he misses several shots. We are also told that the political division between the antagonist and the protagonist is bio-tech (genetically enhanced people) against cyber-tech (machine-enhanced people), but both appear to be cyborgs or improved people. What told me that this was a bad movie on the rental shop was covered, which looked like a video game cover art and there was only one copy, good new releases having many copies available.
