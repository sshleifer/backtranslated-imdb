This movie is so boring, I spent half of it on IMDb while open in another tab on Netflix and tried to find out if anyone thought it was one of the more boring, overwhelming, gimmicky movie they have ever seen. One warning: I couldn't actually finish it, so it's my impressions up to the minute 54. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightly gets lots of screen time. As others have mentioned, her mother wrote the script (perhaps under a kind of substance-induced stupor, where complete inanities and emotional statements of emotion sounded like an interesting dialogue) and it seems that the film is a showcase for Knightly. Oops! Although I agree, she is lovely (with her teeth unlit ... her blocked teeth gives me anxiety and fear) I found her reactions forced and poorly timed. As in, William or Dylan makes something sweet ... break ... HAHAHA from K with dimples and a playful arm jab. Just like a moment too late. What? And she can't match Cillian Murphy's intensity. He somehow manages to look at her and look as if he is fascinated by her and falls in love with her while she seems completely interrupted, almost as if she is interacting with a mirror. It must be torture that is contrary to someone who does not deliver the same energy consumption as you. Know what else is torture? This movie. <br /> <br /> Knightly looks amazing during her cyclical "I have 1940s pin curls and a warm dress. Look at me, sing!" shots, but what is the point? Is she an altar or an actress? When she speaks it's bizarre, "Ooow, Mehster Deelan. What are you going to do?" This makes me confused because the accent is so mixed and unauthorized, yet so thick, I have no idea what she says (or maybe fell asleep). If no one knows who Vera was or cares about, or few do, was it so important to give her this supposed Welsh accent? It distracts from the rest of the action. (Just kidding there). This movie looks like someone dreamed a movie, maybe after reading a little Dylan Thomas before bed. But instead of adapting to the awake world, it was like, "Man, that dream was so interesting," and tried to replicate it. Then another warning was, "Your script needs work. Nothing happens, promotes a story or creates necessity" and the author is all, "But that was the way I dreamed it!" It's like a child's wandering fantasy, one of the wild and winding nets they spin to get your attention. And when William went to a war and then Vera had a baby and then some blonde chick drank too much, and there were so many planes and pin curls, and everyone had ruby ​​red lips and ... As for Dylan Thomas the character (so bland, That's all I can call him), why didn't he have any lines in this bitch biopic? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and roll around with Sienna Miller, who is so wild and artistic that she wants to make a wagon wheel public! Get out here, you crazy poets! (I realize she's not a poet, but she and Thomas are like this a nauseating group of crazy boys who are crazy times like a lukewarm sailor and Lula from Wild at Heart.) Someone asks on the bulletin board if they must buy this movie. I say do it. Let it stand on your shelf and only use it as a weapon to drug children, elderly or lingering guests. <br /> <br /> P.S. for Murphy's character ... when someone asks if you were "in sh **" you can say yes because your war scenes seem to have been shot at a dump.
