Uuuuaaa! Vomit! Yuk! Yuk! Disgusting! Puke City! Worst piece of junk ever made. Ill. Strange. Terrible. Enough said. Keep your nose. Don't eat. After watching this sick, demented, trash can of a movie, you won't be able to eat your food for a week. But maybe it's good. A new diet has been invented. Go to see this vomiting movie. Get sick in your stomach. And you are then turned off by the whole mess that you can't eat for at least a week and you lose about 15 pounds. <br /> <br /> Me Me Lay! With a name like this, it's really amazing that she doesn't have a "cult" fan after. She is betting as the worst actress ever. Her movie makes Ed Woods look like Gone With the Wind. This movie rates at minus 10.
