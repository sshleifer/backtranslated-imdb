Well it was a complete waste of celluloid. Preview was promising, but after watching the movie, it seemed that previving * was * the whole movie. No plot, no clear story, just a little misplaced excitement. It seems that the director was trying very hard to create an atmosphere of mystery and fear, but there are still gaps to fill. Why the substances? Why number 11.11? (Btw. When Sara enters the library says at 11.14) What is the connection to the murder of the parents? What is this Rayden's role? Is she one of the children or not? Who are the kids anyway. There is much material lying around to create the ultimate cult movie like "The Omen", but the director just lets them lie on the floor without digging into the story. Even the "Blairwitch project" was more scary than this. All the gaps you hope to be filled as in "The Butterfly Effect" will remain open as the credits begin to roll .. OK. Off to the next movie ...
