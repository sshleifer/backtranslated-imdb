This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The three main cast members just didn't seem to click well. Giovanni Ribissi's character was rather annoying. For some reason, he seems to like to repeat what he says. If he was "Rain Man", it would have been fine, but he is not. <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10.
