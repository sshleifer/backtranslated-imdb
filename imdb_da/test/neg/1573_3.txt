Bette Medler is the best thing about this movie. It is a bad second to the original from 1962 with Natalie Wood as a gypsy. The songs were made much better in the original and the costumes were better. Bette's voice was great and she looked better in most costumes compared to Cynthia Gibb. Only one who has not seen the original would think this is a good movie. <br /> <br /> There was not enough change between ugly ducks to beautiful girls. When Natalie Wood was a gypsy, she was only seen as beautiful when she came into dress with her gloves for the first time in the burlesque show. When she has her hair down and then magically, it is all done beautifully and she looks so elegant, it is an important aspect of the movie because it is also the first time gypsy sees itself as something special and that she can actually be a star, not just a bad replacement for her sister. And the scenes, where she slowly became more famous, were rushed through. It was an important part of the movie and they beat it. It is crucial to show her becoming more comfortable with her future as a stripper and the costumes are amazing in these scenes in the original. It was a big disappointment to see it unfold in this movie. I was totally disappointed and had it not been for Bette Midler I would have closed the movie off.
