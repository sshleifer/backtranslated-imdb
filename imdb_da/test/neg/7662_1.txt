This last installment of the "Airport" franchise was so incredibly awful that it took me a while to realize that it was not actually a slapstick comedy like "Airplane". George Kennedy shoots a flare gun out an open window to divert heat-seeking missiles were comical. What would happen to your hand if you held it in a two-speed window? You will lose your grip on the gun and get a broken arm. The passengers were inadvertently hilarious, like the interior of the plane. The sophisticated French woman who came to slobby George Kennedy was like Jackie Kennedy who came to Ernest Borgnine. Must not happen. Susan Blakely, a talented and rude actress, didn't get any points on her CV for this. Nor did Robert Wagner. This movie was so miserable it seemed surreal.
