My biggest criticism with the movie is the animation. I totally agree with everyone else, it was very poor. Some of the characters seemed to have darker skin color than they did in the first movie, which is much better. The background colors also looked rushed and somewhat static. It's also a shame that Michael J.Fox didn't vote for Milo, he did a good job, and James Arnold Taylor wasn't sure he would sound like Milo or Aladdin. I have also taken into account the lack of a good story. The third story was confusing and clumsy, and the other story was bad scripting. To make matters worse, the first thing I can't even remember, except that a fishing village is haunted or something. However, there was good music and good talents from John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson who rescued the movie from total disaster. All in all, a disappointing sequel to a surprisingly good movie. 4/10 Bethany Cox.
