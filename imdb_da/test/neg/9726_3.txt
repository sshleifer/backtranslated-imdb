If I were to pitch this movie idea to some Hollywood bigwigs, I'm sure it sounds like this: <br /> <br /> ME: "Four boys at a private high school are good friends and they're witches." < br /> <br /> Hollywood: "It sounds like" The Craft. "ME:" No, I said four boys, not four girls. "<br /> <Hollywood:" It still sounds like "The Craft" , just with boys instead of girls. "<br /> <br /> ME:" OK, but there is this fifth unknown boy coming into the picture and he wants more power. "Hollywood:" Still not much difference because one of the girls in "The Craft" also wanted more power. <br /> <br /> ME: "OK, OK ... I want to make these boys part of the crowd, they get rich, and the school is on the east coast. <br /> <br /> Hollywood : "Now it sounds original. It's not something like "The Craft", here is a billion dollars. "<br /> <br /> This movie was so cliché and uninspiring. Even the produced drama between Chase and the brothers in Ipswich was very blasé. A bunch of rich children whose biggest problem is which color Bentley will have for their 18 Birthday (and 18th car) doesn't interest me at all, even if they have the powers. Every child in this movie looked like they were coming out of a magazine and of course there had to be the free male nudity and female 80% nudity. just to drive home, how unformed you are, I would rename this movie "The Witches of OC." Oooh, rich kids and their problems .. Let me pretend to break me. <br /> <br /> This movie was Completely imaginative and predictable, the final battle was paralyzed and pulled out, and the end was very anti-climatic.This was a movie that was best left on the cutting edge.
