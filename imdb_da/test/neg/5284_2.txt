I paid $ 2.00 for this piece of shit, I want my money back. It's ad grade horror movies that aren't so groovy. There are many many floors in this movie, including the play, the lack of actual scare, lack of nudity (as well as starting nurse porn outfit) and the still-weather naked onion flash, there is none. <br /> <br /> The audio track is perhaps the best because it has some upbeat sorta guitar riffs / tracks. <br /> <br /> There are your usual typical characters, the jocke, the jocks woman, the nerdy guy (who looks more like a jock), the rookie police / ranking (who has the biggest hole in the teeth I wanted to separate a few dollar coins into that gap .. or go to a field goal) the mysterious trap and the pure girl. The makeup was pitiful with page views of dr chopper showing a clear "make up line" and natural skin tones, coker art for the DVD is clearly photoshop / enhanced to make the cover more appealing as dr. chopper looks like an old "popper" The scraggy women hanging around, dr. chopper is not explained and or l also convincing as the rest of this movie. Plot twist was very predictable, and abundance of bad-looking FAKE limbs was ridiculous, what did they think .... um throwing some limbs around and some false blood and you have a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Dr chopper himself is the most stupid character I've seen for a while, though original, I think the creator of this movie was strained for ideas and possibly tried to use the Doctor and helicopter rhythm (bike) and thought that "bingo" would make a crazy film about it. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse before ..... but it's just pretty bad. everything about it is bad ... the lack of excitement ... the lack of real horror or character development ... the lack of a decent story ... the only good thing about this movie was when it was finished. This movie does not fall into the category otherwise so bad, it is good for me either / <br /> <br /> Overall 2/10, the instructor / author / editor must know better.
