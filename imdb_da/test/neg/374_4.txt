Although the story is good and depicting what I expected from Sam Elliot, my DVD copy contained almost unbearable synchronization issues. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the film. <br /> <br /> I would be very careful about buying movies in the DVD without checking the problem. <br /> <br /> I also want to follow the recommended censors ratings especially in terms of language and drug use. <br /> <br /> This movie could become a silent classic cop movie and with the above warnings I can recommend it to potential viewers
