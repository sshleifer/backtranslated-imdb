Now I have to say that I own this movie and I only like the end. The movie is boring and slow, but the final battle is so fun. Let's just say that if the fake bird didn't attack the biggest evil guy, this movie would be a 0 out of 10. However, the bird does a 3. If you really get bored or want something awful to see rent here and fast forward to the last match.
