This was so bad, I can't even go through it. So I put some sentences on what I've seen and it will be up to you to decide. <br /> <br /> Captain Kirk, with toupee and tubby gut, is climbing Yosemete's El Capitan. Spock meets him halfway on a floating skateboard-like glider. Kirk falls. Spock flies down and catches him in inches before Kirk hits the bottom first. <br /> <br /> Later that night, Spock, Kirk and McCoy eat beans around a bonfire. Spock likes the prayers. Then Kirk and McCoy sing "Row Row Row Your Boat" and want Spock to participate in three-way harmony. Spock doesn't want to sing. And later he disagrees. "But life is not just a dream, Captain". Should I continue? <br /> <br /> Okay ... A renegade Vulcan that happens to be Spock's half brother leads a rebellion on a sandy planet - taking hostages. The crew of the company lands on the planet, and Uhura, pushing fifty-five and weighing two hundred unique pounds, lures natives with its bare legs. But they can't fool the brother who claims he can find God. <br /> <br /> He kidnapped the crew and the Enterprise. They go to a planet where a great bearded behavior that claims to be God spits fire on Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Spock's siblings who are aware of it are not God - but are really a form of themselves - or something - joins the apparatus to destroy it and ... sparks fly. <br /> <br /> Then, after things get too complicated to explain, Klingons, similar to Lorenzo Lamas ... involves the three amigos - Kirk, Spock and McCoy - coming back to Yosemite (did I mention, Kirk had wearing a GO CLIMB A ROCK T-shirt?). With Spock playing a kind of funky Vulcan guitar, they sing "Row Row Row Your Boat", this time all three harmonization as the credits roll.
