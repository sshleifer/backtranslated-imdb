Don't see "Mr. Magoo." It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Leslie Nielson was not fun in it. He hasn't been fun since Naked Gun movies. Now it won't take long to figure out that this is not a Naked Gun movie! The movie's plot is ridiculously foolish. Nothing in the whole movie was fun. The first few minutes of the movie were animated to resemble the old Magoo cartoons. I wish the movie would have been that way.
