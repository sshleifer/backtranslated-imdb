Well ........ how and where do I begin to describe this complete nonsense? Imagine the morale of a cheesy Hollywood Western, plunge into a lavish help of the most trite soap opera story, and try to cheat the kids into thinking it cool by dressing it up to be about something 'modern'. This movie is all packed and absolutely no substance. <br /> <br /> It starts with promise ...... young men dream of becoming rock stars and engaging in the kind of excessive holiness that anyone can laugh at. Then it goes all the way down ..... faster than a bobbin without brakes. The scene involving the first concert with Steel Dragon is one of the most pathetic pieces of "cine kitsch" I've seen for a long time. The singer appears on stage for his debut and falls down some stairs ..... will he get up and sing ??? ...... or will he stay on the floor and not sing ...... who cares now? It gets worse, but I don't want to drill myself by remembering it in all its scary details. If you see it after this review, it's your own fault!
