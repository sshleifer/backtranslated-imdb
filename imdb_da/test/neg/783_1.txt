How really sad that this happened from the same mind as Donnie Darko, possibly one of the best movies in this genre. Where do I start myself? I think one of the most unpleasant aspects of the movie is that we should criticize humanity, and yet we see no humanity in the film. No more than 5 minutes of the film has been used agonizing about a possible human's death. These are terrible one-dimensional cardboard cuts of people. Unfortunately, this is how they are played with what can only be described as terrible acting. Is that really how Kelly sees humanity? Judging by the viewers' reaction, this is a horrible enclosure of humanity. Why don't the characters in the movie ask the questions that all viewers have? This is not an indictment of humanity. It is an indictment for those straw men who Kelly creates, which barely resembled real people in this situation. To those who say this was a wonderful thought-provoking movie, what do you compare it to? Armageddon? I even saw someone comparing this with Kurosawa's works. How truly deprived do you have to believe that this would promote good existential discussion? For the love of everything that is good in movies! Even innocent suggestion is ten times humanity's accusation that this is. There we see people really agonizing about greed and human condition. Yes, even the innocent proposal puts this film to shame for philosophical discussion, yet it gets 5.3 vs 6.0 for this thoughtless step. Rarely have I seen a more pretentious, pontificating and self-explanatory film fall so flat on the face. This has the depth of a high school movie project and a poor one in it. It really is about the level of discussion being promoted by this film. If you want to see good psychological filmmaking, do yourself a favor and check out Das Experiment. If the box had lived up to this one goal, I would have been willing to forgive some of the cruel acts, gaping plot holes, and pure inconsistent history. Unfortunately, it can't even do that. The true accusation of humanity is that there are people out there who believe that this film is a profound, introspective look at the human condition. This is not Sartre! This is not even the Cliff Notes version of Sartre! This is a fast-paced and hacked 9-year-old paper on Sartre based on some internet bulletin boards. If Sartre lived, he would sue Kelly for defamation.
