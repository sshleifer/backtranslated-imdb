This was pretty much inevitable. This movie borrows from "The Core" and from the movie it borrowed, "Armageddon" and the movies it borrowed from and so on. Except this time, there is also Luke Perry. This movie version of the well-known save-the-world plot involves super-earthquakes that begin in the Pacific Northwest and stretch for the entire ring of fire. It soon stated that everyone on earth could just be convicted. So the military and some scientists are building one of these high-tech drills to go into the ground and fix things (it just wouldn't be so fun if they didn't have to go somewhere like space or inside the planet). There is even a line trying to make the journey to earth sound more impressive than the journey into space (like that of "Armageddon"). It's a Sci-Fi network movie, so the script is paint with numbers disaster movies. There is a struggle between scientists and military guys, there are rock-melting lasers, people die and sacrifice for everyone's best, and above all, there are (weak CGI) special effects. Not original and not all that entertaining. This is a movie to watch when you have nothing to do, especially if you have beer.
