POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER <br /> <br /> It's not a terrible objective review, but I've just found this movie terribly depressing. As a lot of Russell T. Davies' work, it asks more questions than it can answer. His best work (Bob & Rose, Doctor Who) enjoys hopes against odds and endurance even after apparent defeat. These uplifting themes seemed oddly absent here. I suppose the fact that I still think about the days after viewing is a testament to the quality of the program, but the decision was just too bleak for my taste. <br /> <br /> However, I would disagree with the reviews I have read to complain that the ending feels "tacked on." I think every conclusion follows logically from its premise, and the end represented a healthy personal belief that just solved the primary theme of the show. While I never really questioned the development of events, I felt that there was much that could have been expanded. I also read that it was originally conceived as a four-part series instead of two, and it is possible that the shortening has done little damage to the finished piece. But these errors occur all the way through in sequences and themes that sometimes feel pane or outlined. Davies is totally unaware of writing big, and you must admire the sheer audacity and scope of this project. The prerequisite he tackles here is things of movies or novels ?? It is a brave and ambitious thing to tackle it on television. Strong points include Christopher Eccleston, who is positively mesmeric at the forefront. For me, he was and is the best reason to see. The portrayal of the Messiah's humanity was brilliant, thought-provoking and engaging and a real credit for both Davies' writing and Eccleston's play. I also thought that the depiction of the modern world reaction to the second coming was true. <br /> <br /> So two stars simply because I personally want my entertainment to be entertaining. I'd rather be uplifted or at least distracted by my fiction. I have a whole big real world around me ?? as filtered through CNN or newspapers - if I choose to be terribly depressed. There are certainly less subjective reasons to judge this paragraph, but I am afraid that my judgment in this case is overcast by my emotional response.
