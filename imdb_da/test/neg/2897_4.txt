I have never seen the other two "Ninja" movies, and for all that I know is known, but for some reason I looked at it. This starts pretty fast as this one ninja goes on a super killing spree. He is almost unstoppable as it takes a lot of balls to take him down. He is not out for the census, even though he ends up having a woman, and then he continues with his killed ways by using her as his tool. Another ninja enters the pigs and apparently is the only way you kill a ninja with another ninja, so he volunteers. This leads to a big battle at the end when the dead ninja goes back into his body, and they have it out in an all-out war. Sounds better than it actually turned out to be, but at least it wasn't boring.
