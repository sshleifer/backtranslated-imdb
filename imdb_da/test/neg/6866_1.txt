The concept is excellent. The performance characterizes the overall quality of the ABC network. <br /> <br /> Apart from Peter Jones, the rest of the panel appears to be marketing execs. rather than real entrepreneurs. <br /> <br /> When I realized Peter Jones was coming with Simon Cowell, my first thoughts were wow, he'll take America with the balls. But it seems that ABC has come together and destroyed the concept. <br /> <br /> I was an absolute abuser of Dragons Den in the UK and was interested in seeing Peter Jones manipulate the concept that originated in Japan and developed his own show for the states. The result is neither inspiring nor informative. <br /> <br /> If you lack drama in your life, you have a choice now ?? Jerry Springer or American Inventor In summary: A fighting musician selling out to a media bull. Idea: Get Me! And I want to produce a show worthy of the title
