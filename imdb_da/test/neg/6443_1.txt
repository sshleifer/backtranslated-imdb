My wife and I saw this abortion from the beginning. I hated it immediately, but my wife was hooked on it for a few years. For me it just got worse and worse, and the characters were all without a doubt gloomy and depressing without any redeeming features. My wife then got tired of it and we stopped looking altogether. Occasionally I take a clip of it or pass it when you surf the web. There is always someone shouting at someone else or doing something terrible. There never seems to be any easier moments or happiness of any kind. It was always my biggest grip on it when we first looked at it - no humor. The authors do not seem to have any idea of ​​drama - they seem to believe conflict is drama, and that is of course only an element of it. Light and shadow are much needed and actors who can bring something to it. I'm sure the Eastenders players are competent, but they have nothing to do with. It must be the most depressing work in showbiz. I fail to understand why the British public sees it and loves it. What on earth does it say about our psyche? I have heard it said it is "like real life" - is not something like my life or life I know, otherwise we would fling ourselves from tall buildings or during public transport. The themes it tackles are far from family viewing, but are still displayed within the water. I love series like Breaking Bad or The Wire, but I wouldn't expect to see them at. 7.30 or 8.00 in the evening. The program is trash can and should be avoided at all costs.
