This could have been so much better than it turned out. Tom Pittman gives a good performance, and some of the older actors are happy with what they have to work with, but it just doesn't work. <br /> <br /> First, the actors are too old to play high school students, especially Howard Veit (Vince). He looks about thirty. Second, it is difficult to sympathize with bad Marv, especially because Betty is not so hot to start with. <br /> <br /> ******* Spoilers ****** The end is so strange. It seems the director intends to get shot, but there are no shots. He has just knocked on the cement where he is lying until the ambulance drivers pick him up and place him on a stretcher (face down!). What was his injury? A shiny knee? Goofy! Vince has just shot his girlfriend's death without any remorse, but he simply pushes Marv to the ground and rushes off, despite not paying tribute to the fact that he hates the child. And to make the case even more frightening, Marv asks the police to tell his father that he is sorry. (Duh! Hi Marv. You've just been turned around. I think you will have many opportunities to tell your father you are sorry ... personally). And this author didn't get an Oscar nomination? Skip it unless you see it on the MST.
