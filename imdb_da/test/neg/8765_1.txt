This movie was horrible. The action was horrible. Scripture was horrible. What was even worse was the camera's shot and sound. Half the time the voices do not match the actor's lips, and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different shades. The worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building should have been 50 stories high and probably 100 meters wide. But when the actor was on top of it in another shot, they had "recreated" the top of the building. The width of the building was reduced to approx. eight meters wide. How could a building be a hundred meters high eight meters wide? I know the movie was low budget, but it is unpredictable. The movie itself just pushed ideas on a "cleanup" as they actually had a story or point. This reduced the manuscript to pure dirt, the characters seemed to sell ideas in their lines rather than conveying emotions and moving the film together in one direction. It was a complete waste of time watching. The movie gives Christians a bad name if it is one of the current best Christian movies out there.
