A big disappointment for what was proclaimed as an incredible movie. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if a single person would create a high profile for a young woman who was not a prostitute. <br /> <br /> We don't really learn about this character except he seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage has an excellent performance as usual, but I feel that this role and this script knocks him down. And how can he, after he has been unable to perform the entire film, get his erection on his deathbed? Really terrible and I felt like I needed a bath.
