I expected a comedy about NVA, but it's a parody. It shows the eastern German national army in a light that is not appropriate and absolutely not true. <br /> <br /> You can make a comedy about everything as long as the underlying facts don't change. Even a comedy about the German KZ is possible, as Roberto Benigni with "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL" has shown. <br /> <br /> The movie NVA would be an "OK" comedy because the jokes in it are overall OK. Nothing special - not fun, but enough to live with it. The point is that the film makes a farce and a parody of NVA. A death machine ready to attack WESTERN EUROPE with his friend the Red Army. An institution that used everything to get the best out of the soldiers. An army marching into the CSPR in 1968 and ready to march also in POLAND to destroy SOLIDARNOSC. You can't make a movie without showing the slightest bit of evil, or would you make a parody of a KZ, Guantanamo or 9/11 ??? Does Osama bin Laden show like a fun screwed guy? 90 minutes of a fun Osama in an Afghan Taliban camp, where he makes jokes and trains his soldiers, it would be comparable to what this movie is about NVA!
