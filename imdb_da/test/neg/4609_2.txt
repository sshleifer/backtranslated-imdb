Be warned by the line at the back of the box that promotes a story of "over sexed jocks". There is nothing to solve about Carrie 2. The plot is absurd, it acts terribly and the end too predictable. I didn't expect a masterpiece, but I expected to be entertained. I was not. The only way I could rationalize watching this movie was because I was in a relative's house while waiting for my car to be fixed. Unless you are in the same situation keeping yourself away from this movie.
