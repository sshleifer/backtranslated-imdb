To be fair I couldn't bear to watch this movie all the way through, so I have no idea it suddenly gets better half way through the movie. But the first 30 minutes or so is among the worst I've seen in a while. Children under twelve can get a kick out of the poorly written, acted and directed slapstick humor, but adults in full control of all their faculties should remove this stink.
