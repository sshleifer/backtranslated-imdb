The ten steps are pretty much a prerequisite for a scary card, but the execution is simply appalling. The dialogue is horrible, and the play is of the kind that is regularly seen in Irish short films. Really really embarrassingly bad. The girl must step down 10 steps in the basement to change the secured fuse. She telephones her father who entertains her boss for dinner. The mother, an "actress" with very dubious action skills, answers the phone, and in loud voice she says she should not call when Dad tries to impress his boss. The actress, who plays the boss's wife, emulates very successfully the mother's bad plays when she tells them their house is haunted. The rest of the movie consists of the father who gathers his daughter down the stairs on the phone. The ten steps utilize the storage techniques of camera movement, lighting and music, as one would expect in a translucent horror movie. Poor.
