This movie is equated with various super bad hard beacon characters loosely connected, but without any real story. Some of the scenes are nicely filmed. If they took the same cast and crew and made a movie called Gent that was the coolest character in the movie and came up with an interesting and continuous story, it could be decent. As it is, prepare for a lame series of tough guy character intros, all of which do nothing but ride bikes around the desert all day and cause problems while everyone should never get tanned and keep their hair and clothes perfect and never have to Look for a home or money, etc. There was a kind of background story about the characters passing by various people who were killed and a treasure that was likely to be plotted.
