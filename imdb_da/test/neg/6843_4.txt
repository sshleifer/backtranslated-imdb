The most fertile man in Ireland is about Eamon Manley, who is 24 years old and still happens to be a virgin. He lives with his mother in Belfast. He is also a very shy guy against women. Everything has changed for Eamon when he is seduced by a woman (as far as I can remember a neighbor). It is not because he loses his virginity, but he discovers that he has a superpower. Despite having protection, this neighbor becomes pregnant. He is told by the doctor that he has very high sperm counts. His mother brilliantly comes up with an idea that makes us see ginger headed babies around the end of the movie. He starts helping women on both sides of Belfast to perceive babies. First he volunteers his business with a colleague out of it. The most fertile man in Ireland has his fun moments, but it is necessary to make better jokes and better script. I couldn't think it gave me the impression of a TV sitcom rather than a movie. Kris Marshall is another name on the silver screen, but is not shining like a star. It's more like the guy you saw in such a movie. Like he is in love with reality (I think he was very fun in one). Well, it was okay to see, but couldn't help turning off from time to time. ** out of *****
