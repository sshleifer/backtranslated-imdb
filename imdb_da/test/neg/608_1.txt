This is a lame comedy. <br /> <br /> Here's why: A man and wife sitcom. Okay. <br /> <br /> The man is a shower bag. The wife is Einstein. <br /> <br /> Where is it originally? <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller is just the same guy at Seinfeld. <br /> <br /> Gags are paralyzed. No witty one-liners. <br /> <br /> I've had enough. Stop this now. <br /> <br /> The last word: Stupid. The destruction of the average white guy continues on ABC. The worst part? Kevin James is actually a fun comedian. He's just not here. Leah Remini is amazing the eye so, but is unlikeable. Wasted talent is the word. Poor sitcom.
