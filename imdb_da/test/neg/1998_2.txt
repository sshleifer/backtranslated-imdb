I usually like Casper in his movie, a real credit to STARSHIP TROOPERS. But the box cover of this video SSOOOOO is the home of the tenants. On my local video, people rent what expects a (PERHAPS) Borg as a vampire, and instead they get a bad re-entry of Lon Chaney. It had great potential and fell very flat. I think I could have written a better story and play. Why is it in ALL science fiction movies, they (cast) constantly refer to a solar system as a galaxy? Has none of these writers or writers been awake in science class? It's a pet of mine, but a solar system is a single star with planets, a galaxy is a whole lot of solar systems. It's like referring to a can of cola as a gross of six packets. Make it sound even more stupid.
