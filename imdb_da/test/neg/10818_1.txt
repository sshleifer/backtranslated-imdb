Perhaps it is unfair for me to comment on this movie, because for the first time ever I was beating a movie because it was so bad. I can see something, but this movie was so boring. I was bored before I put on the DVD and thought this could be a ridiculous action war / action movie to ease the mood. It is not even that, it is a device that increases the level of boredom with 100 effects. Should interrupt it after 45 minutes, because all that had happened at that time, some people were diving and a large mole had been discovered. Seriously, this movie is not worth the time, even though you can enjoy a bad movie as I can, avoid this movie like the plague. That's what I've seen this year.
