In fact, this is a very funny movie if you are looking for bad plays (Heather Graham can never live it down ... it has three titles for one reason - protecting the culprit!), Beautifully poor dialogue ("Do you like. ribs? "), and a plot only a mother could approve, this is your Friday night entertainment! <br /> <br /> My roommates rented this under the title "Terrified" because he liked Heather Graham, but frightened is what we felt after the final credits. Not because the movie is scary, but because somebody has actually paid money to make this trip a movie reel. <br /> <br /> Horrible movie. There are a few no-name actors who give some unintentional comedy, but nothing worth seeing. Heather Graham's dramatic climax was also one of the most pathetic and disturbing things I have ever witnessed. I do not give this movie any meaning, and God must have mercy on his soul.
