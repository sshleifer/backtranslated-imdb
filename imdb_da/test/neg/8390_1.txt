Unless you're going to be bored half to death. I have never been a fan of Gus Van Sant, and as part of what previous posters have described as the new generation of youth, I was very disappointed and slightly angry at the stereotypical depiction of the characters in the film, especially as they were used to string film ridiculous story that largely enforces the show masses that skateboarders are social rejectors and should be blamed for crimes. As a tax car myself, I see a lot of skate movies, and the movie under the skate scenes, which of course is a big part of the plot, when the protagonist is skateboarder, was horrible, and the Bourne identity researcher shook camera technology was used with slow motion to give a horrible effect. This movie is just full of ridiculous stereotypes as shown by the 'emo' soundtrack, which simply adds the media perception that all skateboarders are white rockers. Just a really bad movie.
