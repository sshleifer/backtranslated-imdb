Perhaps the target audience for this Disney Channel TV movie will be happy with it, but if any parents look with the young, they will clearly see that "cranked out" is written all over this production. It was of course no dream to make this movie, but it would rather be in a shower room somewhere and then produced with cold efficiency. There is some talent among the players, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas don't get much chance of showing their talent. The impossible cute Elisabeth Harnois is engaging as the first daughter, but Will Friedle is stuck again and plays a different stupid character, although he is not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his "Boy Meets World" role. The background for this movie is Washington, D.C. and the White House, but there is no real "presidential" feel to the movie, and the secret service is made to be a little better than Keystone Kops when it comes to doing their duty. Disney Channel presents many original TV movies, and most of them are better than this.
