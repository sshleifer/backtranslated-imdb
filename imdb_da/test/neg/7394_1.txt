A ragtag collection of Western tourists in Africa suffers the accident for their aircraft degradation so they are forced to jump on a bus to travel across the Nigerian desert to reach the nearest bounce point back to civilization. Not surprisingly, the driver's compass does not end up working and, of course, they find themselves stalled in an abandoned ghost town that had been a barracks during the Second World War. They find some petroleum (useless in refilling their bus), a storage room full of half-poisoned carrots in canned cans and a native hermit who sees them with indifference. One guy among those who seems to have something on the ball with regard to survivalist techniques is going to get help. They must remove the tires from the bus and burn them if he is not left for five days: hopefully someone will see the black smoke. <br /> <br /> Is that so interesting? Well of course, even though it looks very much like the * Phoenix flight * or any number of movies in the "Desert Island" genre. Therefore, it is surprising that * the King is alive * is number 4 (if anyone still counts) in the ongoing "Dogma 95" series, as if I remember the ridiculous "Dogma 95 Vow of Chastity" correctly, proclaiming that " genre film "is strictly connected. Oops. Well, at least you can tell it will try to be all arty and things to compensate for the fact that it is a genre flick. Yep, it doesn't take long for a member of the group, a wizened old stage actor, to start scribbling down - from memory! - The different roles from * King Lear * on, well, paper rolls. The idea is that the performance of the game will help away the time. All that really goes against the absconded survivalist's advice to remain optimistic (never made the old actor ever a dinner-theater performance of * The Odd Couple * just once in his life?), Quite apart from such an activity being a colossal waste of valuable time and energy. <br /> <br /> This movie is so bad, I really don't know how to proceed. It is so monumentally silly, so full of absurd situations and signs that it speaks rational criticism. It can be a timely moment to offer full information: I despise this so-called Danish movie "movement" to an almost irrational degree. I think my face even gets weak red by just mentioning Dogma 95. First of all, if the name of your movement has the word "dogma" in the title, you have already lost me; Secondly, the movement's insistence on the abnegation of individual artistic performance in this particular case is a recipe for hypocrisy on the heads when considering that the filmmakers here plunder one of the greatest works of the greatest INDIVIDUAL writer who has ever lived. (But without doubt, the dogma groups believe that the Shakespeare works were actually written by a consortium of Elizabethan bigwigs such as Earl of Oxford, Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh and Queen Herself.) Hell, I may have forgiven the whole company if it had played the scenario for farcical purposes (attack the precious dogma - now it would be subversive!). But the film takes itself very seriously and soon goes into the clich√©s that accompany the genre, where it unmistakably belongs: People face each other; men grow beard; the inevitable deaths of some of the key players. Everyone with a straight face. "Is that the promised end?" Well, not quite: we also have to endure the immense transfer of DV. For this is another rule in the Dogma 95 Load of Chastity: only handheld digital video. Some kind advice to the Danes: Your "movement" is in trouble when your finished product has poorer visual quality than an average high school graduation home video. Professionalism belongs to an artist's bag of tricks, right next to his own individuality. "Artisan" and "artist" are related words, Mr Von trier: not all jackasses with a $ 100 handheld can be a movie maker. Pass it on. And by the way: Let your dogma directors be credited for their movie while you are in it. The fact that the author of the * King is Alive * receives credit while the guy (or girl) who actually films it is just a little hypocritical. <br /> <br /> Despicable. 1 star out of 10
