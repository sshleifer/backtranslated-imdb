I come from Bangladesh, and here is C.C.Costigan a goddess of great sex. All the fun aside, a friend and I were awake in the middle of the night watching movies on the Encore: Action channel when we came across a series of sci-fi esquire flicks. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad ... not at all bad) ... Judge Dredd (Stalone almost destroys his career) and then a movie called Lethal Target. One would think that the title "Lethal Target" could only be awarded a really cool and really cheesy Rambo knock-off. But no, what is delivered is what I would like to call a "Semi-softcore, semi-pseudo action, semi-sci-fi movie" ... in fact, I think I can say that this is not even a movie at all. If it wasn't for the main character's pure hotness, my friend and I would have turned off the movie as the opening bonuses rolled. <br /> <br /> I have a few questions for the people (I wouldn't even dare say "professionals") who made this movie. -One, in the future, why do they use the weapon we used in 1999? Oh, wait, I get it, that's all they could do ... right ??? Well then ... Why is the protagonist wearing what looks like a normal everyday linen suit and a vest, just like what people had at the end of the nineties? .... Oh ... I get it ... in the room it must have been a fashion statement .... Well, then ... why, OH, why the protagonist draws a 3.5 floppy disk at a point in the movie so she can upload some bullshit ?! wtf! ... we have developed so far that we have space travel, but we still haven't gone past 1.44 megabytes of space ..? <br /> <br /> I guess I'm just asking too much. <br /> Question two, let's just say ... that yes ... this is a softcore porn. So why is there only a real sex scene and why does it last for 2 minutes? <br /> <br /> I mean, you take the reason people stop in the middle of the night to see this shit (dare I say 'movie' more?) ... and whittling it down to 2 minutes. Hell, they should just have taken the sex scene and sold it to another porn movie, and they would still have made more money out of this "crap" than they did. <br /> <br /> CCCortigan is hot. And no disgrace to the actor, but she does as well as I do. and I am mentally retarded and have only one testicle ... (C.C. Cortigan, ... email me ... we want lunch) I would write more but I have run out of space.
