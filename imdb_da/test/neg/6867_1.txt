The idea is great, spoiled the time by the judges. Why make fun of people? If what the inventors say is true, and as most say, they used their lifesaving on the invention, the least is to reject the idea without making fun of the people. <br /> <br /> It also shows when they want to accept an idea of ​​crier that they added to the judges. <br /> <br /> The only one I respect out of the judges is the one who always sits on the right side of the table, he is a respectable person <br /> <br /> of course the English snob who claims to be a businessman Wearing a suite, you don't make a pal <br /> <br /> last but not least, the big guy who sits between English and Crier. wake up man, it's not a job called and inventor to call you one. an inventor is a property, not a job man. I think they would add someone like Simon from the American idol, they thought it worked there, it can work here as well. The context is different and the idea is completely different. It's a good idea and they could have made a good show out of it if they just change the judges and remove their action and attitude. <br /> <br /> Just stop making fun of the people.
