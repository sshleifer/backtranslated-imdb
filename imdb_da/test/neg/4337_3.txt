Okay, here's a very brief review: this movie was blowing. I wish I could only get a review that stated this simple principle, but I have to drill you with more bad-looking words like "horrible" "klich√©d" and "rigid". It's the type of movie you see when you're drunk or stuck on a desert island with nothing else to do. Here's the premise: The vice president is caught by a terrorist group on a play-off hockey game, and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Really, really terrible, but then again I didn't pay to see it the first time, and only my dad felt the lack of circumference in his wallet after this movie. I hate the fact that he is Republican and all, but then again he saves me the scare of paying for this piece of waste. Okay, it's enough space to be recognized as a review, so I bid adieu.
