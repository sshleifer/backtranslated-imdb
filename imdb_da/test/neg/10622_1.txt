This movie made me hit my head against the wall. It's hard to compare such badness to this, but some say watching this movie looks like bleeding under your nails. And that comment comes from the author's cousin. This movie was so bleak, it made the "Hulk" (the second worst movie ever) look like "The Departed" (One of the greatest movies in film history). If you like boring family movies with predictable plot lines, then you will absolutely love this movie. If you have a brain then you certainly won't. When I rented this movie, I actually fell asleep while I saw it. The next day I ended it off where I was relaxing and that was my worst worst choice.
