I give the show a six because the show was actually a platform for Damon Wayans when the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby, it was about many problems with humor, and I felt it was actually tailor-made to have a laugh in contrast to let the jokes come from the character. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person. He is PHENOMENAL in film, but in the show he was there for wisecrack, and though I loved it, I felt that laugh was more important than plausibility. <br /> <br /> Jay Kyle I have loved her since the House Party and have enjoyed her in School Daze and Martin, it was a big part for her and she made a good choice by choosing this sitcom to co-star I also feel that Jay and Michael were more equal in the show, but Jay was more the woman who fed her crazy men lines and followed her way of being unorthodox discipline because she might have felt it was working. Jr. Just stupid, his character should have been well developed and even though he has his moments of greatness, we return to stupidity as if he didn't learn anything, driving me nuts !!!!!!!! Not to mention that most situations (in episodes I've seen) seem to be centered around him <br /> <br /> Clair The attractive sister who dated a Christian, I found her boyfriend character more interesting than she was (She would rather stick to movies, the authors should have done more to show her intelligence, but it's not stereotypically enough) Kady Lovable and the youngest daughter. I think the authors established their character most on the show except for the parents and Franklin <br /> <br /> Franklin I love this character and I think they have derived it from Smart Guy (TJ Mowry), which lasted only one season. They did a good job of casting for this little genius (the effort would have been made if Jr would have been wise but also showing the lower sides). All in all, this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it's a tribute to the Cosby Show is well done, I love the show and wished it would have been longer than that. I can't wait to see the series final
