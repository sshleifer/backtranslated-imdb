Surprisingly Kieslowski, this movie is disappointing for me because of the sometimes weird and sometimes cliché script that also works like a work with a poor observation sometimes. There is an isolated young boy. He lives with one of his relatives, but he is lonely and every night sees a woman living above their building. It works! that he wants her. He is one of the young people who are not good at communicating with the opposite sex. But he likes the woman when the woman comes to her house with a man, gets Tomek's pain. Then we understand that Kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs a female flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman. He does nothing else because he may know that it is his salvation. One day he stops that woman, suddenly he seems like a shy boy, but turns out that he is not, so he explains her almost everything. She refines and refuses him. Everything is as realistic as the other Kieslowski movies, no problem. The problems start when Tomek visits her, the story of a lonely young boy falling in love with a mature woman (but a pristine love), a story of a lonely young boy falling in love with a mature woman at the beginning of a woman refuses , but after a short while she begins to change her mind. This U-Turn makes the movie cliché first. The Tomek's personality is weird? or a result of poor observation? I was disappointed with this character, that is my opinion, and I will try to tell why. When he goes to her house, Magda treats him very kindly. She asks what do you want from me? To kiss me? to love me? to go out with me? At this point, I remember the people who say she is a femme fatale. See? Back to the scene, Tomek rejects all the suggestions. Why? Because he's shy? I don't think so, but his communication is blunt, okay. After the leg scene at home, some events make the movie miss its goal. I think the purpose of the movie is (should have been consistent with the story) to show us that there are some people suffering from lack of endearment and to save from this situation is not easy due to lack of communication and dismissal especially for gentlemen. I mean, at this point, what does the movie say? It's blurry and disappointing. It is seen that he is not hungry for love or a woman or sex. So what? And the suicide test room supports this weakness. So he touches his legs, he'll kill himself! By the way, as I mentioned before, some say that Magda is a femme fatale. Not quite. She strives to make Tomek happy. Does she avoid having contact with him? No. Does she insult him? No. Is she spamming him? No. And does she cheat him? No. She has some problems with her (ex) lover, so she is not O.K. But she doesn't take revenge for it from Tomek. She is not an angel, but not a femme fatale too.
