Like many people, I loved the original; "American Graffiti" was one of the great films from the 70s. The sequel, "More American Graffiti" is a horrible, depressing mess on a movie. It wasn't fun, the wide eyes, resembling figures had become cynical and combed, and the stories were constructed (like "Lauries" character with another brother, because Richard Dreyfuss didn't do the sequel and "Terry the Toad" and "Pharaoh Joe" rule somehow to serve together in Vietnam). They even have a police officer named "Falfa" (Harrison Ford's character in the original) who makes a "cameo". He doesn't even look like Harrison Ford, who was too big a star in 1979 to even disrupt this waste. The operative word here is "fun". This movie is not even funny. Debbie (Candy Clark) is a stripper mixed in with a bunch of dope joking hippies and trying to fine her dealer boyfriend out of jail; Steve and Laurie (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams), lovebirds in the original, have two children and have become an annoying, bickering couple; Cute little tomboy Carol (MacKenzie Phillips) has become "Rainbow", another hippie child. John Milner (Paul LeMat) is a loser race car driver whose fortune was predicted at the end of the original. Even Wolfman Jack, whose voice was such an integral part of the original and gave it so much power, is heard only occasionally. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it was different authors, another director, and the complete lack of a coherent narrative that made this movie so bleak. <br/> <br /> The episodic charm and authentic nostalgia of the original is nowhere in the sequel. It was a movie that didn't have to be made, and just remember what a great movie "American Graffiti" was and avoid the movie with "More" in the title.
