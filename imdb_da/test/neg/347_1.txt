I only watched this movie because I was under the impression that I should be treated to a cheesy horror flick. I mean, look at the roof line: "They are men turned inside out! And worse ... they still live!" Doesn't that scream cheesy horror movie for you? And then there is the title itself - "Screamers." What a perfect apt title for a horror movie, I thought! Unfortunately, I was not aware that the right title was correctly translated, "Fisherman's Island." <br /> <br /> So about an hour to see this I realized that this was not a cheesy horror movie at all - it was a cheesy "fairy tale" story of slimy Atlantis fishermen. "Men turned in"? No. There was nothing like that. I was very disappointed. <br /> <br /> Damn you, misleading taglines! I want the 81 minutes of my life back!
