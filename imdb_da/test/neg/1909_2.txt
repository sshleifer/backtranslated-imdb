Ho hum. Rich good-looking child gets into trouble, poor girl falls in love with him, jealous ex-girlfriend causes excitement .. yadda yadda. I actually shot high in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and simple stupid. As a scene moved to the next, I often found myself wondering how we got there, as if I had skipped a few chapters in a book. The script was pretty pitiful and didn't have me or my wife cared much about any of the characters except the jilted girlfriend. Now, if the former girlfriend had got an ax and hacked apart the girl and the rich child, then .... then we would have a movie, and all the stupid dialogue and jump in the plot could be acceptable. But since this movie is trying to touch and completely miss the boat (and end up attracting the romantic equivalent of divine intervention to try to tear a tear) ... it just falls very flat. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Cut your toenails instead, you want more fun.
