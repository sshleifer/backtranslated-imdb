Yet another Lo Wei production to completely waste the talents of a young Jackie Chan, At Kill With Intrigue, is a weird mix of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural acts and ordinary old-school kung fu fights that are rather boring despite several surrealistic WTF moments and lots of ridiculously poor dialogue. <br /> <br /> To protect his pregnant girlfriend Chin Chin from Killer Bees, a gang of ruthless kills who are attacking her home, Cao Lei (Jackie Chan) is making a heartless cad, driving her away and thus save her from danger. During the attack, all Cao's relatives are all killed, but he is left relatively unlucky at the gang whose leader, a scared-faced woman, seems to have hots for him. Cao then goes in search of Chin Chin, whose security he has entrusted to his close friend Chu Chuk. <br /> <br /> In her quest to find her true love, Cao turns to a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil 'Bloody Rain' clan. Finally, after being wounded in a fight against members of the unpleasant clan (a fun scene with lots of stupid weapons), and then sick back to the health of the thighs Killer Bee (showing his love by burning the face!) Cao finally learns that he is a miserable judge of character: his friend, Chu Chuk, is none other than the power of hungry head honcho of the "Bloody Rain" clan who plans to marry Chin Chin himself. <br /> <br /> Cue the drawn climax battle, with Cao being kicked in the face repeatedly before finally stifling his treacherous ex-pal to death with a scarf. Even die hard Chan fans will find this a chore to sit through, with only the final battle ready to showcase some of the star's amazing acrobatic abilities. Fans of ordinary Asian peculiarity can dig the spooky look of Killer Bees at the beginning of the movie (with a character inexplicably demanding back his cut hand!), Or the moment when three men flow through a window to attack our hero, for Most, this movie will have very limited appeal.
