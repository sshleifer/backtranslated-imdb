The first word I can find to describe this movie is Awful. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First of all, the plot is a very thin plot (will not comment more on this part) and a plot that many movies from this genre follow. It makes the movie so bad because you know what happens. Second, the film contains many questions that are never revealed. One of the questions (and it's not a spoiler) is: WHAT HELL IS THE CHILDREN IN THIS CORE !!!!!!!!!! Third, the characters are very bad, not only because the film is bad, but also because of the boring actors. They are bad as they can be. The last thing that makes this movie bad is that it is a horror movie. You should be afraid of the killings or the sudden shocks, but you are not afraid, you are not horrified because you know what to do. Conclusion: The movie is as bad as the movie about the killer ants! I was hoping it was a very good movie, but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises many questions, and because it's not scary, the movie is best invisible.
