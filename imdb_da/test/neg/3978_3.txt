I have now been through Dele, The Clonus Horror. <br /> <br /> To get the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror. <br /> <br /> The story was about a cloning centrally owned by the "Man" They cultivate clones to harvest organs from the clones later to the indigenous people who need transplants. A clone escapes, the government gets angry and kills everyone involved, but the story is still out. It's really shameful how a film with potential is being destroyed by amateurs like Fiveson. The only thing he really managed to do was to weave into the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect of what makes man a human, and would it be OK to cultivate clones for organic harvesting? Unfortunately, mediocre actors have been selected and the plot has left the city, ultimately in where a pathetic attempt is made to summarize it. <br /> <br /> But !! What disturbed me most was the introduction of new characters that lacked actual relevance to the plot. Despite this, Fiveson feels the need to kill them in a bad explosion, which only Sir Coleman Francis himself would be proud of. The setting was interesting. How Fiveson thought to pull plastic plates and running water over them would make a credible river past me, but I think if you were to compare the setting to Coleman Francis' gray pasty oatmeal of a setting, this movie would win. br /> <br /> Maybe Coleman has changed what bad movies are for me. 3.10
