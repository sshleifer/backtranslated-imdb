The title tells it all - Ed Gein, the butcher in Plainfield. <br /> <br /> It's not a zappy action packed slasher movie made for teens high on energy drinks. It would suit a well-established genre, the kind that some people find entertaining, something like "Halloween" or "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". <br /> <br /> This is dark, slow, full of chopped bodies, and quiet. There are few downsides, no monsters viewing angles, no high electronic score. I don't know who it is aimed at - ghouls, maybe. <br /> <br /> During the credits we still see pictures of skulls, carcasses hung up, skins draped on the backs of chairs, such things. And they are sufficiently disgusting that I couldn't help thinking that this movie was better off making up this Grand Guignol opening. Unfortunately, it is not. The action is uniformly horrible, as in a high school game. Scripture does its best to sink under vulgarity. Ed Gein, who only killed two middle-aged women and perhaps his brother, fights a screaming, bloody young woman through Weir Woodland, and she only has a modern bra and bikini instead of period underwear. Gein also decapitates a night watchman, whom he never did in any historical sense. <br /> <br /> Direction? You could do a better job. In the first few minutes, the lawyers discover an abandoned car with blood spattered over the windshield. There is no body. The beautiful young deputy Sheriff turns to her boss and suggests that they search for the victim, who may still be nearby and living. The sheriff, who lacks any motivation, shouts at him: "You just forget it! I don't want you to go out of half of anything!" It should not be more than a business discussion. Why did the director Sheriff look angry? Signs of various kinds listening to radio programs or registers playing old jazzy pop songs - Louis Armstrong's "Does not Misbehaving," for example. This is - what - rural WISCONSIN in the 1950s? And the characters insist on music that would appeal to customers of the Cotton Club in Harlem in the 30s, or New York intellectuals like Woody Allen. Nix. The radio would play Kitty Kallen's "Wheel of Fortune" or Theresa Brewer or equally likely Lefty Frizell. Not that the dysfunction between music and events adds something to our understanding of what is going on under the pictures. Someone involved in the production just liked old jazzy pop songs. It is of course. <br /> <br /> Of course, there is only so much you can do with a low budget, but it can be bright years ahead of this slaughterhouse. See "Ed Gein" with Steven Railsback for an example of a much more sophisticated way to handle this lunatic and his fondness for dead bodies and on a budget that could not have exceeded this much. <br /> These comments are all based on the first 20 minutes of the movie. It's about as far as I could get. If anyone finds this story to be well-run and fascinating in any way, he should try to find an insight into his taste. It's under mine - and I consider myself pretty combed.
