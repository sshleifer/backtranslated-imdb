If you just looked at all the dogs go to heaven and learn that there is a sequel, don't see it. It's terrible. It's terrible. They hasten the signs to evolve. For example, Sasha begins singing about how to figure her out for love. And in the end, this seems more like a dramatic romance than a comedy adventure movie. They rip Charlie out of his character and replace him with a nice, soft but still rebellious version of himself. <br /> <br /> The humor behind Carfall's character is just totally lost. He is a completely different dog. He doesn't have a cool voice anymore, he's not the villain you love to hate anymore, he's just a wimp that doesn't match anyone other than Mermaid Man from Spongebob. Talking about voters .. <br /> <br /> Charlie has a completely different voice. And while it's not terrible, I don't like it. It's horrible compared to the excellent job that Burt Reynolds did for the character of the first movie. Dom DeLuise is amazing as always, as Itchy. This character remains true and therefore this film gets a 3/10. Just because Dom DeLuise still speaks Itchy. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my last complaint. I know, Ann-Marie's film was finished and gone, she has parents now etc, but has Charlie completely forgotten her, or what? No mention of ALL in her in other films. I think even a little mention of Itchy would have been acceptable. (eg, "Charlie, we have to come back. You can't take care of any child to save.) Or something of that kind. I think he died with her, she deserves some kind of publicity. /> <br /> Don't see this if you're looking for a wonderful sequel.
