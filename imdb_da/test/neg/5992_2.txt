Hunk of waste only Full Moon Studios could do have a group of college kids living for free in an old hospital, without knowing that a demonic creature with two faces (hardly visible the whole movie due to incomprehensible lighting) passes through walls kills each member who has a particular sheet of paper with old markings. Someone among them (it won't be too hard to prove, but a little twist is so uninspiring revealed and elaborate, you just want to scoff) is the mastermind behind whom the animal kills and must be revealed before it kills everyone. /> <br /> Cheap, badly acted mess has a "That's it?!" kind of weak ending that makes you worry about why you just wasted your time. Tanya Dempsey, who could not get through a wet paper bag, has heroine duties as the newest member of the college rooming bunch called Clark. Oh, and the title refers to the sound that the animal does before it attacks the next victim.
