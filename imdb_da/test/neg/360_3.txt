This is the story of a madman who, for some reason, has it for a young college student and his fellow. After reporting to his supervisor, who in turn pauses him for psychiatric evaluation, he finds an opportunity for psychology to torture them when the kids are hacking into a major's security and unlocking the door. Only they get locked in the store with the nice one. Murder and chaos are on their way, and the kids are running around trying to survive until morning when they may be able to escape. 'Dangerous Game' would have been a successful cat-and-mouse psycho thriller probably if it was tuned to another location. The idea of ​​a psychotic cop chasing a bunch of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn't work. Especially when he comes face to face with his grinning prey quite often and yet, it does not matter seriously quite often. There was no real confrontation that would suffice for this kind of story, and it may have worked better if, for example, the teenager was loose in the neighborhood and left to defend against this underworld (especially if it took a few days, while making them more and more paranoid ... even if it is given, even it is cliché). What a shame it couldn't have been a better thriller, considering a funky cast of young Australian characters. Even a merciless adventure, despite the villains' disgrace that spread through the picture, could even have made it a more satisfying picture. Instead, it started fresh, and it probably had lots of action sequences, but wound up on the ridiculous.
