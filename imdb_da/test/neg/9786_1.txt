Nine out of nine people who looked at this have declared themselves to be mentally wealthy for life. No one should ever see this abomination. The English language is poorly equipped to express how totally, terribly terribly this "movie" is. It really is not worth the plastic it is made of. No major crime has been committed by humanity throughout the history of creation; It is never even worse. <br /> <br /> It was unanimously agreed that the scene involving Tommy and the young girl's blouse that was curved was incredibly sick and twisted; In fact, many of us have not yet been restored from the probation and are currently sitting in the corner of the rocking room, sucking our thumbs and whining. <br /> <br /> However, the basic question about everyone's lips must be "Why ???". How is it possible for someone to create such a monstrosity and then subject it to so many innocent people? After seeing the trailer, we thought this movie might be a laugh: how wrong we were. <br /> <br /> Please sign the petition to free the world of "Shrunken Heads" so no other poor civilians are exposed to it. Be kind to the good of humanity.
