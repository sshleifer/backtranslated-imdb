The Toxic Avenger, Part II begins with the outrageous revelation that, after Toxic Avenue (John Altamura, who apparently was fired during production and replaced by Ron Fazio), had deleted his hometown of Tromaville from evil, it actually became a good place to live . This meant that Toxie no longer needed a superhero and now suffers from depression and a sense of complete uselessness (like directors Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz should feel like having produced this), Toxie now works as a concierge at 'Tromaville Center for the blind '. It is not long before problems solve the ugly head, but an evil chemical producing company called Apocalypse Inc. plan to take over Tromaville for some stupidly insignificant reason, but to do so, they must get rid of Toxie. After the first plan of the evil president (Rick Collins) fails, he bribes Toxie's psychiatrist (Erika Schickel) to tell him to go to Japan and see his father. Leaving his girlfriend Claire (Phoebe Legere), his mother (Jessica Dublin) and his home behind Toxie leading to Tokyo, Japan. When Toxie sets out to find her father & a woman named Masami (Mayako Katsuragi) helps him with his quest. Meanwhile, in Tromaville Apocalypse Inc. to kill & without Toxie, citizens are powerless to defend themselves. Toxie eventually finds Big Mac Bunko (Rikiya Yasuoka), whom he has believed is his father, but the Big Mac is all part of Apocalypse Inc. plans to destroy Toxie once and for all ... <br /> <br /> Produced and directed by Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz this follow-up to the successful The Toxic Avenger (1985) essentially demonstrates that the first film was a complete fluke, a lucky accident combining the right mix of bad taste comedy, fierce violence and so bad - It's good film making, The Toxic Avenger, Part II is a lot of shit in comparison. The script from Kaufman, Phil Rivio & Gay Partington Terry with a lot of extra material credits does not include a single fun moment during its entire 102-length. The visual gags are horrible, Toxie goes through Tokyo with a wig and glasses to blend into eg. Or a scene where he warms a bath with a bad guy in it, and as he does Toxie throws in a lot of vegetables & spaghetti, a scene where he sticks electric wires onto a woman's nose, sticks an antenna in her head and a microphone in the mouth as a Japanese radio announcer talks about, a bit where a Japanese poor guy has his nose burned in the form of a fish, a little where Toxie takes a swordfish head and uses it as a weapon or the embarrassingly bad overactive and stupid idiotic facial expressions, a guy who literally has a fish to his head and is transformed literary into sushi, the horrible comedy music and sound effects and the whole film in general is a pale imitation of what made the original mildly entertaining and memorable. The bad taste of gags is not there this time and the stupid juvenile juvenile humor of the first defect too, it just feels like a real step back from the original and let's not forget this is Troma here, so that's definitely a bad thing. There are a few gory fights and some serious gore and violence, at least in the supposedly effortless 102-minute version, so I crushed heads with the bodies that spread out blood, crushed faces, intestines, roses bumped into some eyes and thorns wrapped around about the neck, ripped off ears, cut arms and a very graphic and gory scene of a man chopped up. Unfortunately, the special effects of Pericles Lewnes are not very convincing and come largely within the first 20 minutes. The action is of embarrassing proportions, as I have already mentioned. Action ready there is an ultimate inexpensive car race at the end and a few unexciting, insidious battles using cardboard ninja throwing stars at some point. Scared wise, there is nothing there are a few sets apart. Comedy wise this is very unfunny. In fact, the toxic avenger, Part II sucks at all levels really and on top of it all makes it terrible too, most of the casts seem to be people picked from the nearest street corner, continuity is not present, filmography is basic point & shoot and the special effects are anything but. One or two gory scenes apart this is total crap plain & simple, making yourself a service see the original again instead.
