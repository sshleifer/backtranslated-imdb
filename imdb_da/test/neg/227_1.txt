I only saw this because my 10-year-old was bored. He and his friend hated it, but of course liked to be in the cinema. This is the first time I have strongly disagreed with Ebert for many years. There is not a single thing to recommend this movie. Willis is good as always. But the story stinks, is incredible, there is no real story, no action, no interesting cinematic sequences, no surprises, and worst of all, the kid's star is a thoroughly repulsive slug guaranteed to extinguish any parent who doesn't have a dweeby fat mess to a child. Stay away and save your child - unless you want to punish him or her. There is no excuse for such miserable direct or written, and it is hoped that these filmmakers will suffer accordingly.
