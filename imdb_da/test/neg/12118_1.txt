Friday night with Jonathan Ross, those responsible for Ross have to rub their sweaty little palms together. They know the BBC lacks imagination when it comes to talk shows, so when they have Jonathan Ross at their disposal, they are definitely in the mood to just sit back and let a semi-trailer command this primetime slot. <br /> <br /> Ross uses most of the show grooming his ego and smiles on how much the BBC pays him. The show is a complete copy of many American chat shows - Leno, Letterman, Conan O Brian, the list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses, which can also be done for the stupid masses in Britain too. <br /> <br /> The unfortunate situation - he has no competition? Parkinson's gone from reality, he was never really too much except for grooming a celebs ego. Can't we have any more fun and slicker on British Screens instead of Jonathan Ross? When Ross has built up his ego, he will then proceed to the very boring concept of the stiff celebrities in the green space - then try to get on with each other. If an A-Lister is present (which is so often the case these days - as there are no other chat shows, they can turn to - to promote their latest movie) - he will spend the next hour either flirting with them or try to be their best friend in the universe. Sqeamish, when he had Ringo Starr on - a man who cares about licking ass - Ross rightly requested his mobile number (as the common policy on this show is for Jonathan Ross to get everyone's number so he can be seen in the right company when it doesn't work). Of course, Ringo said it is - and simply said no, I don't like you - dead pan. Seriously. Ross must be picked up from all the prizes and TV shows - the masses will come over it.
