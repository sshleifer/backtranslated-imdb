Let's see: there is a civil war, a lost city, a talking gorilla, some common gorillas, a previously unknown species of morderalbino gorilla, the most powerful laser ever known to man, a * mass * of diamonds lying mined and loose in sand, attack hippos, an active volcano and a balloon packed in a suitcase in a downward plane. It's not too much, is it? I have had more coherent fever dreams ("... and then the Romanian guy picked up a bunch of diamonds, because it was a lost city that he had been looking for or something, but then the average gorillas we had seen before came out of nowhere) Now he was talking gorilla back from visiting the ordinary gorillas, and as a kind of earthquake or volcano started, the woman's industrialist / doctor built a gun with a laser and this big diamond she had just found in her dead fianc√© hand ... "). It is a ghost if you are looking for more ammunition against Michael Crichton's harmful influence in US entertainment (and thus world entertainment) and if you keep in mind the extent to which this cynical and half-hearted attempt fell on his face at box office. But unfortunately, the responsible men - Crichton, scewriter John Patrick Shanley, director Frank Marshall - have probably never lost a penny. Shame on them, and I mean that. 1.10
