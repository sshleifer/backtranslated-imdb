This is the first and as far as I can tell, the only finished production of "Heart of Darkness" ever released. Before starting the "Citizen Kane", Orson Welles shot some test shots for a version of "Heart of Darkness", which was to be filmed completely in what would now be called "POV", where we would see everything from a point of view of the protagonist Charlie Marlow; he would only be seen fleetingly in mirrors, windows, water, etc. The film was never made. The "POV" technique was used, not successfully, in 1947 in "The Lady in the Lake", with Robert Montgomery starring Philip Marlowe. Probably the coincidence of the two "Marlow (s)" signs is just that. Of course, Francis Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" was based on "Heart of Darkness." The short novel "Heart of Darkness" by the Polish-born British author Joseph Conrad, first serialized in a British literary magazine in 1899, has one of his favorite alter egos, ship captain Charlie Marlow, who also tells the short story "Youth" and indirectly tells the story of "Lord Jim." Marlow, temporarily out of work, decides to take a job with a riverboat to a Belgian company involved in the brutal exploitation of the resources of King Leopold II's personal fiefdom, the cruelly mistaken Congo Free State. Marlow travels from London to Brussels and tells that his mission is to take a boat up to the Congo River to a remote station with one of the company's most productive agents in the colony, a German named Kurtz. Ivory, latex (rubber manufacturing) and other Kurtz station items have been discontinued and no word has come from Kurtz for some time. There are rumors that he is "native." Marlow must investigate, take the necessary measures and prepare a report on his return. He takes the passage down the West African coast to Congo's mouth, delays for several weeks, while having to repair his boat at the company's station on the coast and finally settles to find Kurtz station. The river, the heat, the vegetation, the wildlife, the insects, the people, all take their breath, his imagination and his mental resources. He finds Kurtz sick, half-grained and close to death. Kurtz's last meeting and death is almost an anticlimax, especially because Conrad is so unclear about what actually happens that we are left to puzzle it out for ourselves. This is a novel where you close the book vaguely dissatisfied with the end, yet the story counts for its amazing atmosphere. <br /> <br /> This "Heart of Darkness" was filmed with Guyana in Central America, representing West Africa. It is best where the novel has the greatest disadvantage: In fact, we are showing the world's first urbanites what a trip on a tropical river would look like. But the rest of the movie was forgettable. Tim Roth does his best as Marlow, but so much about the plot, characterization and character conditions have been changed without realizing that you are wondering why they were bothering. If the goal was to make Conrad's story on the screen, why didn't they leave it alone? It is unreasonable to expect no compromises to be made when making a book in a movie, but so many changes were made that I had no cinematic reasoning that you were wondering if we were simply dealing with incompetent writers and filmographers. Most disappointing was John Malkovich as Kurtz. He was completely miscast and simply flubs the role. Everything about him is wrong: his appearance, his acting style, his voice, his accent, everything. A much better choice would have been someone like Bruno Ganz (as opposed to Malkovich, a real German character). <br /> <br /> This is a very disappointing production and I would only recommend it after reading a book if you want to rely on more than your imagination to get a visual picture of a cruise in Congo the river around 1900.
