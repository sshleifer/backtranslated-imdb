Negative numbers are not available to convey how bad this movie is! Wooden effect combined with a story line that has been rehashed dozens of times. Everyone in this movie must participate in the Overactors Anonymous. You would think an original story could evolve from the general concept. Young men at a prep school binds themselves to address the Pearl Harbor bombing. It raises interesting questions, but the way they are conveyed makes it more a joke. The typical signs were present, including the keen jock and geek (glasses included). I could not have been more disinterested in wood dialogue and clich√© signs. At the end of the movie I had to throw the DVD in the trash. Stay far away from this dud! You won't get back the 90 minutes of your life!
