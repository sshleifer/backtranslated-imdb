This movie is on my list of worst movies ever made. The story is interrupted and it is difficult to understand what is going on or the reason for the character's actions. All movies must have an inner logic, and this movie just doesn't have it - the story makes no sense. <br /> <br /> To watch Faye Dunaway, Christopher Plummer and Diana quickly waste their talents in this movie is a crime. Faye Dunaway is the lucky one because she plays the victim and gets killed early in the movie. On the other hand, Donald Sutherland must be a great actor because he manages to look good despite poor conducting and poor writing; His performance is credible and he manages to remain in character after all. <br /> <br /> If Dame Agatha Christie lived, she would die laughing! The movie is so bad!
