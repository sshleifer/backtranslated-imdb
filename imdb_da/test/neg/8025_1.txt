After hearing that some of the people behind the low-budget flicks "Terror in Rock'n'Roll Island Lake" and "It came from outer space ... and things" were involved in making this movie, I decided to buy it invisible on DVD. I wish I didn't. The other movies were fun, heavy-in-cheek and a little silly. While Power Plant 3714 is devoid of any humor whatsoever. And it is so god-terrible that I get angry, just think about it. The worst actors possible, the worst script possible, the worst special effects available. And the most unsexy sex scene ever. Uhhh. And it all goes on for 2 hours and 45 minutes. Please make another movie ever.
