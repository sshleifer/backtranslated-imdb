This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is so much in the house that goes wrong, it wouldn't happen, it's not even fun. Granted this is a movie that means things that don't happen in the normal life here, but this movie is far more taken than theories that no child left behind working. All these people are in the house, and no one has noticed another, not to mention the regular owl that seems to come everywhere but in the cage. I could deal with an owl joke the first few times, but after an hour I just can't take it, I'd rather kill myself than see the damn owl again. Did I read this movie? none. Not even once? none. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. The fact that this pile of garbage is cut off with Ashton Kutcher bent his boss over and took out the pants in front of everyone, just making this movie ever worse. But wait, the day is saved because the regular owl can fly. WOW FANTASTIC! But I give this movie some cred, it's not as bad as Epic Movie .....
