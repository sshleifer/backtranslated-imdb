Jim Carrey is a particular humorous brand and I personally think he's a great actor (for example, eternal sunshine). But this movie is probably not more than a Jim Carrey vehicle, so be aware that if you don't think his comedy style is fun, you will be stony-faced all over this movie as it doesn't have something else to recommend. <br /> <br /> Although you like the Carrey's comedy, I'm not sure you will find this movie entertaining. I went to see it on a Saturday night at. 10.30 and the audience was clearly ready to laugh. They giggled in whole trailers that were not particularly fun, but when it came to the movie, stony silence. I think it raised about five real laughs. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is, it doesn't know what it will be. It can't be done if it goes for slapstick or seriously. If it was stupid in all that, it could be forgiven, but I guess that too. The relationship between the two central figures. <br /> <br /> The strong point of the movie is hold-ups and there was plenty of potential here. But these began only halfway through and remained largely undeveloped. Meanwhile, you have to sit through the first creepy 40 minutes when the couple's life worsens. <br /> <br /> Four separate groups went out of this movie while I was there and if my flatmate hadn't asked me to stay away from the house (his girlfriend just returned from a month long vacation!) , I would have done the same. And throughout my 25 years of filming I have done it just once before.
