**** Probably will contain spoilers **** <br /> <br /> After a successful attempt to get attention (I wouldn't call to make sure you get help before you die a "failed suicide attempt") ", Joey finds out she is pregnant and begins to see pictures of spirits. In general, the film was a little slow but entertaining enough to see it all. For a horror movie there were few minor creeps and tensions. Halfway, however, it was a really scary scene (I will not give it away though) :) I saw this movie because I really liked the previous movie, The Eye. I was a little confused, however, to find that Eye 2 had no relation to the eye at all * except to be a "supernatural tension film" from the same creators; different cast, other story. Eye2 doesn't even have anything to do with the eyes: The movie had some dubious scenes: Joey tries suicide 3 times (4 times if you count the time when witnesses say they saw Joey trying to jump in front of the train) she's associated with brutally damaging an attacker, she freaks out in a restaurant and witnesses say she was "attacking" people, and yet she is allowed to bypass her business freely without much as much as a psyche or hospitalized (for other reasons than her pregnancy). The movie was not the biggest horror movie, the story was quite removed (even for a fiction movie: P), the spooks were either few and / or nothing we haven't seen before. However, it was an "interesting" story, and when you know what the "truth" is behind the ghosts, it was an interesting twist on the "ghost" story. <br /> <br /> I rate the movie 3 out of 10.
