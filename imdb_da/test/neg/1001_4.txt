I am a big fan of both Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and am amused to see them tracked by Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this shockingly little movie that had all the ingredients to be so much more. Those for short scenes, in which he portrays a blunt, infinitely right, worthless son of a rich Lord, is spot-on and entertaining. But for a love triangle, there was remarkably little chemistry to talk about between anyone. The music was annoying movie-of-the-week quality, and voice-over jarring and completely unnecessary. It is clear that the work of a first-time instructor with a small budget, which was either missing or insufficiently aware of good advice. Too bad. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate how the people you kind of hate in the beginning are the ones you like at the end, and vice versa, so there is a kind of character arc at least in terms of perception. For example, while she was refreshingly honest with her husband about her feelings for another man, Watson's character began to congratulate me at the end, especially when she informed her husband that she simply did not have absolute control over her actions, and later on. she simply stated that she would move back to their marital apartment without requesting permission, no apologies offered. And I went from not liking Wilkinson's control freak / moral relativistic character to understanding him and not really wanting him to change (unlike his wife). This movie was unfortunately morphed from a whodunit to a "Love Story" or "Steel Magnolia" disease drama without adequately informing me of the fact, so I was left distracted guessing what the next plot twist could be long after they were all revealed (Was it the Lord who drove the car? The Lord's dog?). The scene where the Lord visits Wilkinson and tells how brave Watson is, the best nurse every dying boyfriend could ever ask for, Florence Nightingale incarnate, etc. Was OK until he started driving over-the-top like a baby. Good God! If you ask me, she's just another nice rich person with too much time on her hands, and then she runs hard and gives her spouse crazy with unnecessary drama. Her screwing around was just another way of occupying her empty life; The dying guy was an added bonus for her, somehow telling her past actions completely. <br /> <br /> See, everyone would have been better if Wilkinson had just left her to his secretary who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead, he acted as an abused dog, his open desire for his wife's love to increase with every kick she gives him. I'm not anti-PC or anything, it just didn't ring right, even after taking into account all the hard realities of the Middle Ages, we all tend to face. The end for me was (and not the director's intention, I'm sure) depressing. The film spent the last 80 minutes convincing me that these two people just don't belong, so I found no joy in the promise of their relationship continuing. I'm not over because my feelings are manipulated by a story, it just has to be something plausible and not hackneyed. Is it asking too much? <br /> <br /> My score: 4/10
