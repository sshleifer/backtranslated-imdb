Probably one of the worst movies ever made, I'm still trying to find out if it was supposed to be fun, but I didn't have fun at all. Maybe the movie lost something during English-Italian translation, not sure, I miss the courage to see it again in the original version. <br /> <br /> My rate for the 2/10 and I want I'm pretty generous (let's say 1 point is for Liv because she's a lovely treasure and the other point is for the decent actors caught in a worthless, useless and pathetic film). </ p> <p> Beware <br /> <br /> Alex
