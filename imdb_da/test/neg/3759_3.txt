I fully understand the historical significance of the Rocketship X-M, but it does not make a good movie. Initially, the plot (or whatever it is) is dull and lifeless. Five astronauts burst for the moon ?? they are beaten by the course and end on Mars (huh?) ?? cavemen-looking martians throwing stones at them ?? they return to Earth and face a burning death ?? The end. Believe it or not, but this pithy plot description makes it sound much more interesting than it really is. To make matters worse, John Emery's feel, Dr. Karl Eckstrom, the need to give long pronounced talk about everything from human nature to the dangers of nuclear weapons. It's just a voltage-one-minute (sarcasm calculated). Looking back at the Rocketship X-M almost 60 years later, I would call women's portrayal fun if it wasn't so sad and misunderstood. There are a number of examples I could quote, but there is a dialogue exchange right after the start between the male chauvinist pilot Floyd (played by the annoying plastic hair Lloyd Bridges) and Dr. Lisa Van Horn (the only female crew member and the constant object of Floyd's often scary attention) illustrating the film's attitudes towards women quite nicely: <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "I'm going to have a girl like you mixed up in such a way in the first place." <br /> <br /> ?? Dr. Van Horn: "I suppose you think women should only cook and sew and carry children." <br /> <br /> ?? Floyd: "Isn't it enough?" <br /> <br /> I think Floyd should have stayed behind with the caves!
