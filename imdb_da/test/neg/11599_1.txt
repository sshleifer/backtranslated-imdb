The Good Things First: I agree with another viewer who said Gene Raymond has a wonderful drunk scene. He does - I was putty to finally get a chance to laugh. And there were other moments I found entertaining - Raymond's parents in the bathroom with the defective plumbing, and the stage in the restaurant with Robert Montgomery trying to make Carole Lombard jealous by saturating sweet nothings to a stranger. <br /> <br /> But in general, I was horrified. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the limitations imposed on productions in the Hays code. But it was embarrassing and terrible to see. Of course, I knew they would end up, it's a romantic comedy. But it had no meaning, it happened too quickly. Plus, I can't believe in the love industry when confronted with such harmful behaviors, both physically and confrontationally.
