This film claims to be a sign study of perversion. Some reviewers have been joined to assume that because perversion is depicted, the film is psychologically deep; In fact, it is surprisingly boring and superficial, with no motivational substance in view of the vast material. Why is the protagonist the way she is? You will not find out the script. For a better treatment of the same theme (and a more entertaining movie), try Bunuel Belle de Jour.
