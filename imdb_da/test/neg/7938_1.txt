I'm a big fan of the original Assault On Precinct 13. The ice cream mocks me this day. I'm 33 now, and I still remember being horrified by it as a child. When I heard that they remake it, I thought it might be good, but when I saw the movie, it's 100% not the same movie. It's not a remake. It's a badly stolen idea. It was completely destroyed. Cast, Maria Bello, Laurence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Burne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are all great actors, but even they couldn't save this movie. It was just wrong. Even the setting was quite the opposite. And how in hell did no one notice in the town that there was a war next door? Why didn't it help to show up before? Stupid. No meaning.
