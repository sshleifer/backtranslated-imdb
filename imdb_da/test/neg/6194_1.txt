The director / leading Dutchman breeds in this gaze at films where he tries to gain worldly acceptance to stifle the otherwise very optimal world of Mormon missionaries. Some of the actors are fair. But some roles are unrealistic, ie. the vicious (rather than paternal) mission president, etc. The film gives a fair look at how some missionaries can fight for their faith, but the real missionary program he claims to represent is far from his concept of being upbeat, coherent, and inspired. The only inspiration I see in this movie is the Dutch self-inspiration. The movie is slow and boring, and the recording and manuscript resembles a college student project.
