I remember when I first heard about Jack Frost. I was in Video Ezy at Miranda with my family on a monthly video hiring tradition. It was at this time that I worked toward venturing into the horror section of the store. Browse the various titles, I finally came across Jack Frost. The deck was enough to convince me that the movie was out of my views. Years later, the film disappeared, only to be replaced by the inevitable but unnecessary successor. Once again I dared to go to the horror section and pick up the case only to come to a conclusion: the movie would be scary? but not on purpose. Jack Frost 2: Revenge Of The Killer Mutant Snowman (quite a title) follows from where that predecessor left it. Sheriff Sam is seeking advice after his trials, and Jack is now in the form of antifreeze. To escape his past, Sam and his wife head to an island hotel where he is in the company of a wide variety of slasher movie stereotypes, including busty female models, thick sports jackets and Caribbean employees. Jack, however, is released from his floating grave and is back to his icy methods. He heads over to the island and continues to kill anyone who will prove to have a fantastic death. Only Sam can stop him. <br /> <br /> Let me just say this is a straight-to-video movie so it's bound to be bad. But this is terrible even in the eyes of others over the best movies. The camera's work is poor, using a camera that would make a soap opera look majestic. Half of the actors seem to have come out of a pornographic game, and the other half looks as if they have come out of a guest house, but in fact they have come out of an asylum. There is a widespread use of special effects used in the film, which tends to switch between gentle puppetry and CGI, which can be improved by an infant, and the death scenes are mostly of the screen showing us a little about what happened to the rude, yet deserving, victims. But the movie is most memorable because it kills a line like "There is something that needs some Christmas stuff" and "I know you are officially saying you are dead!" Ultimately the whole purpose behind a movie like this is to make a popcorn flick for the Friday nights boredom and even it fails on it. To make a sequel to a movie that was a bad slasher with a concept that a child would find incredible, you must have taken some nerves of steel ?? or a total frontal lobotomy. To director Michael Cooney ?? thanks for wasting my time. To everyone else ?? Avoid like arsenic.
