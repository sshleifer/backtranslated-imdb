After reading both _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_, I can't begin to express how disappointed I was with this movie. Although I agree that some poetic licenses can be accepted, this film is constantly deviating from the books and makes an incredible injustice to the exciting, plausible and wonderful stories written by Wilbur Smith. I can only believe that the authors, the director and the producers of the movie have never heard of Mr. Smith, let alone read his work. Smith's vivid characterizations are transformed into wooden stick figures, all historicity is ignored or discounted, the books' realism has been changed to include phantom patterns that are more suitable for a cartoon. And why is an Egyptian hand speaking Spanish? Geesh, no wonder the movie was made for TV miniseries! Has Wilbur Smith had any influence on making this movie? I can't believe he did. Horrible, horrible movie. If you've read one or both books, don't waste your time or money looking at that money. You will be very disappointed, I assure you. <br /> <br /> Only a moment of supreme generosity persuaded me to give this movie a ranking of "2" and only because of the beautiful, sometimes spectacular, photography.
