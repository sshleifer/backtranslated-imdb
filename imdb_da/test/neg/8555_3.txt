Get the CD instead. The show is pretty, and editing sucks. The audience gets too much screen time, like Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time on the same child shaking their heads the same way (which makes me think it's the same shot) than they do during Richard Kruspes solo in Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so fast, it is impossible to tell where the camera is pointed and the replays are simply superfluous. It's not worth the tape being recorded on.
