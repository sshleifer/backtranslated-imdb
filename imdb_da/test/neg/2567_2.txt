Dr. Steven Segal saves the world from a deadly virus outbreak. This movie strikes me as a foolish seriousness that has turned into an unintentional camp classic (the best kind). Memorable lines include "Knowledge is like a deer. Chase it and it runs away from you" and "Drink this. It will make you feel better." It's so sublime bad - they couldn't have made it worse if they tried. <br /> <br /> Segal is trying to convince you that he is 1. sensitive - by saving a hit pony; 2. a good father - by a saccharin cooking scene for his daughter 3. A scientist - by looking at a false spectrum 4. in accordance with nature - using homeopathic remedies 5. Politically correct and multicultural - having Indian friends 6 An iconoclast - opening a rural practice after a past life in a national research laboratory and an action hero - by being really bold, yet it can still struggle. ROTFL. <br /> <br /> It is good to watch as a satin flick, with friends, preferably (but not necessarily!) effortless.
