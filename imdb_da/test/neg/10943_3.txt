This movie is missing in everything. With the exception of Bobby deol, which in his own standards is mediocre, no one in this movie has come close to acting in a single scene. Kangana is completely fake in her acting. <br /> <br /> The big Anupam Kher has a guest appearance and is better in the 2 minutes than the bobby throughout the movie. The music does not compliment the movie <br /> <br /> as well. The contrast in music between Bobby and the Upen is not highlighted as well. Good concept gone completely wrong. The movie does not have a proper finish. Don't waste your time as I did on this movie
