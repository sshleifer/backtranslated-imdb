What a frustrating movie. A small South Village offers opportunities to explore the complexity of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden under quiet surfaces, as everyone who has read something from Carson McCullers already knows. It doesn't. Instead, the authors turned to cutesy twinkles, cheap hot fuzzies and banal melodrama. The case looks like a movie for television, and was directed without particular distinction, but it is difficult to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting. <br /> <br /> The most frustrating aspect, though, is the fact that there are many extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast, everyone is trying gamely to do the best of things and do what they can with this - Well, there is no other word for it - drive. A tragic waste of talent, especially the great Stockard Channing.
