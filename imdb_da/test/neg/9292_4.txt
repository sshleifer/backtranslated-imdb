You may be interested to know that BARRICADE was considered a failure in the studio and celebrates for a year before ALICE FAYE's popularity reached so high that the studio decided to release the film despite the fact that it was never completely completed. Faye refers to a murder during her nightclub in New York City - and this scene was actually in the script and was the way to start the movie. . Instead it lacks completely and what could have been an exciting sequence (including a complete song from Faye) was never filmed. However, the rest of the story is quite intact and allowed the release of the movie within 71 minutes. <br /> <br /> A tired look WARNER BAXTER is too old to be credible as Faye's romantic interest and is just perfunctory like the broken reporter. The audience today would be offended by the portrayal of Chinese by using broken English phrases like "I like noisy". Key Luke is one of the Chinese loyalists, but plays its part in a turnkey and straightforward way. Arthur Treacher is anything but invisible and, however, receives fourth billing on the screen due to editing changes in history. Originally, Joseph Schildkraut had a role in the film, but his part was eventually edited. <br /> <br /> A mishmash of a movie that only serves entertainment for the most lethal Alice Faye fans who will have a chance to see her in a dramatic role - albeit a weak one. Charles Winninger is totally wasted as a friendly man who runs the US consulate. <br /> <br /> In spite of all the weaknesses, there are a few scenes involving narrow flight played efficiently, and Karl Freund's B&W photography is top notch.
