Occasionally, a movie comes exclusively by accident that makes you doubt your beauty. We have just finished studying the short story "Northanger Abbey" at school and decided to update our memory of this unexciting piece of humorless waste with the BBC customization. The fun of Northanger Abbey is that it actually causes you to kill yourself. The film is nothing like the book, for example, the subtle evil characters seem to have been transformed into transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe resembles a leprechaun on acid, while Isabella plays the role of sludge. Catherine, the protagonist, is the most depressing stupid and annoying actress on the earth of the god (she looks like a coffee winery, her eyes are like basketballs), while Mr Tilney looks and acts like a retired pornstar double. The plot goes completely away from the rails at certain points in the film. I do not know what the hell the director was thinking, as it was not at all why a 7 year old black child whom we have never met takes the protagonist out of the monastery and starts cartwheeling in front of her. Yes, that's right, cartwheeling. Nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by Catherine's "fantasies", where she is carried around a cathedral by an ore. <br /> <br /> Northanger Abbey is basically visual euthanasia, so if you want to murder your boss or something like that the BBC has basically discovered a new way of killing someone. Northanger is a hardly ridiculous movie. Don't look at it unless you're in a padded cell.
