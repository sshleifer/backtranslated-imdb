Twilight Zone has achieved some mythology about it - like Star Trek. That's because there are many devoted lovers of the show, regardless of what each episode was a winner. They are the ones who score each show a 10 and cannot objectively evaluate the show. Because of this, I once took back all the original Star Trek episodes (the good ones and the bad ones) because the overall reviews and reviews were just too positive. Now is the time to do the same for The Twilight Zone. <br /> <br /> Now I was very surprised when I saw reviews for this intense episode that described it as "among the best" and gave it scores of 10 If so, why is it that everyone, I know who has seen this episode hate it as much as I do? It is possible that I and my family and friends are all cranks, but it is also possible that it is another case of healthy fans who are violently blowing up on an average or below average episode. <br /> <br /> The episode itself stars William Windom and others as different archetypes - a soldier, a dancer, etc. They are stuck in a cylindrical space without escape and only in the end do you realize the "shocking truth" - which is not at all is shocking and is actually heavily paralyzed. No, this is a badly written and unengaging episode. Yes, there were lots of episodes of the series deserving a 10, but getting as unworthy as this because of a low script and an unpleasant decision.
