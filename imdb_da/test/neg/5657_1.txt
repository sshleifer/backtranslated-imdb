First of all, I'd like to say that I'm a teenager so it's all marketed to me, and I can confidently say that iCarly's very poor programming, and the fact that it is accepted among both sexes, baffles me. It contains some of the worst attempts at comedies I have ever experienced with mediocre actions to begin. The supposed humor within the show is all based on saying a person's lines again with bad sarcasm, bad sarcasm, saying bad one-liners, and well, you get the picture. I should also mention that I am still looking at Spongebob as I know I get a negative feedback for, but it is quality programming with some honestly fun moments in it, unless we forget something iCarly lacks; WIT. The show is about a young girl, Carly, who makes a web show with her friends, which I can say without a doubt is a nicer version of the internet. That's fine, but the show is just ... yes, not fun, as mentioned earlier. If this is what children's programming has come up with today, parents, show them something that is FACTS fun; SpongeBob or Rocco's Modern Life would work. <br /> <br /> Also, compared to the Brotherhood Show, Drake & Josh, it's terrible, which was implied. Seriously, please see something worthwhile. Even for a children's exhibition, it is poor.
