This is "realism"? If Rivette tried to give us a basic study of a woman at a particular place and time and how she could influence (and was influenced by) the world around her, he has failed miserably. Most prominent because we never get a clue why thousands of men would have followed her in battle. There is certainly not enough exhibition of the cultural / historical context to define the country's need for such a savior. God knows there is nothing particularly charismatic about Joan that she is presented here. Unless Bonnaire's wooden position and flat line visits are to be stated transcendent faith and determination. The use of landscape is particularly uninspired - we never lose the feeling we see in twentieth century actors wandering in a presumably medieval landscape. And as for the battle scenes (which, unlike some commentators claim they take a good 15% of the time) - they look as if some little history club from your local high school recreate a medieval siege, although the kids would no doubt put more passion into the. However, I want to give Rivette credit to show a page of Joan shown by other films: the one of a petulant, naive, and narcissistic youth (played by a woman too clearly at least twice the age of the character she was going to portrait) unable to understand her place within the movement she helps to create or the world exists outside of her own passions. Joan's disgrace on her own soldiers swears and astonished at the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience to her, are controversial spontaneous and credible notes (you suddenly find that such moments of course must occur) in an otherwise non-involved historical "representation". Unfortunately, they also serve to clarify what is not addressed on the screen - what did Joan SPECIAL do? I have to say that I also continued to get confused and frustrated by some foreign film lovers who correspond to tedium and lack of dramatic involvement with "artistry" and "seriousness". Does this movie really increase our understanding or involvement in the subject? Or with something for that matter? 10.4.
