As long as you remember that the production of this movie was a copyright and not intended as a serious release, it is actually surprising how not completely terrible it is. I even liked the theme music. <br /> <br /> And if ever you were looking for a treatment by Joel (or Mike) and MST3K Bots, then that's it! See this with a bunch of smart-ass wiser and you are in good time. Have a brew, butter up some great pretzels and enjoy. Of course, getting a copy to buy a bootleg or downloading it as a shareware requires, but if you are here on IMDb then you are most likely savvy enough to do so. Good luck. <br /> <br /> And look for my favorite part .... where Dr. Doom informs FF that they have 12 hours to comply with his wishes .... and he actually moves the number "12" with his finger while doing it .... it's like "Evil Sesame Street" .... Hoo Boy. <br /> <br /> ... and of course, Mrs Storm says "Just look at you .." ..Fastastic Four "is just so heartfelt .... you will laugh, you cry ... <br /> <br /> So if you love Schlocky Sci-Fi, this is great for you!
