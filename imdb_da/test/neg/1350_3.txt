I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie. <br /> <br /> It's something I haven't done since - I've never fallen asleep at the cinema. <br /> <br /> I love the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone. This could have been the problem, but I don't think because there were a few bright spots that showed if they were finished, they could have made this movie. <br /> <br /> Bette was under used and Anne was over used and miscast. <br /> <br /> I don't know why English or anyone for that matter makes it possible to go into that state. They billed this as a sex in town, but better? Not a chance I liked Sex in town a lot and was disappointed with this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this movie - see anything but this!
