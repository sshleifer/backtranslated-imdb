Although I have great interest in biblical films, I became sad every minute of the movie. Everything is bad. The movie is too long, the play is mostly joke and the script is terrible. I didn't get the point of mixing the story of Abraham and Noah together. So, if you appreciate your time and hygiene, stay away from this horror.
