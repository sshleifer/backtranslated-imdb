When I drove home after work, I bought some movies for my four-year-old twins. I had bought this movie that my kids would enjoy. I saw this with my children. My 10 and 17 year olds were throwing up. In this movie, dad seems like a tard. My little ones would see it every day. One day they beat all our movies away. I sold Omosis Jones movies on Ebay. My character: F ++++++++++++++++ I'm rather seen on the worst dress list. My kids now hate this silly movie. If it is the idea that bacteria can talk to each other. I wonder how the silly movie sounds in Japenese. I broke the CD half as I was annoyed to see it again and again. No offense, but Brandy & Elena's play was the best
