It goes without saying that a mode of quotas must be made when a true story is adapted to the big screen. But if you shoot an adventure that has almost nothing to do with what actually happened - why does it call Bugsy and get the audience to believe this was half a true story? The Godfather trilogy deals with many real characters and events. Once in America it does, but they do not claim to tell true stories. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> In the film, Benny has this grand vision of a gambler's Eldorado; in fact, Lansky had to argue for coming to Nevada. Benny assessed the notion of a contradiction to Monte Carlo's idiotic, and he would have preferred to continue his life as a playboy in L.A. Not until much later Benny heated the idea. But of course he is the film's hero, so of course his idea was. <br /> <br /> In the film, Benny will use Count diFrasso to get close to Mussolini to murder him because he was Hitler's partner and Hitler killed Jews in gas chambers. Obviously we have to suffer from Benny, so the writers invented this nonsense. In fact, no one knew the gas chambers, at least Benny, who was totally uninterested in politics. In fact, he used the count's connection and he visited Mussolini, but not killing him, but selling explosives to him. He even met Goebbels and Goering during his stay in Italy. <br /> <br /> Whole Greenberg's subplot was nonsense. Greenberg did not beat stools, he did not seek refuge with Benny, Benny did not kill him (it was up to Albert Tannenbaum) ... at least they got the name right. <br /> <br /> I suppose it would be very romantic to get Virginia back to Benny and offer him the money she had stolen. The film even goes so far to tell us via text panels that she just returned the money to Lansky after Benny's murder. Let me just say that revisionism just doesn't get any worse than this. <br /> <br /> This list is by no means exhaustive - there is the issue with Benny's family who do not live in LA, as Benny deals with Dragna and Adonis, the depiction of Costello (an inappropriate business type), Lansky (a lovable teddy bear), Benny herself (a staggering windbag who would not have reached 12 years if he had regularly been "bugsy" in situations such as in the movie, and in addition, having neither the good looks nor Benny Siegel's charisma) many others. Apart from a few hard facts, nothing is right in this flick. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS END HERE * <br /> Overall, this is the one mafia movie that manages to be even more ridiculously bad than Harlem, NY. But honor where honor is due: This is a priest in itself.
