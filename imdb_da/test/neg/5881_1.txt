This movie is horrible. It has absolutely zero laughs. Hebrew Hammer (Adam Goldberg) sets out to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot, in fact, the film does not go beyond this premise. Although there are some (far and few) fine touches and the plot is relatively coherent, it is the work, hackneyed and ultimately thoughtless boring. This despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick and Greer (Hammer's client / love interest) all have quite a significant screen presence. Despite being played for what can be described as whacky over-the-top gags, this movie is consistently middle-class mid-of-the-road muck. Don't waste 85 minutes of your life on this. (Note - the music was good ..!)
