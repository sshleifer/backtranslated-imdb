I must say that this movie was really awful. the play was average, the pacing of the movie was horrible as well as the soundtrack and cinematography.i found out that i was bored in most parts of the movie and the clich√© lines did nothing to me. The two boys who played the lead roles sometimes looked awful and did not take the feelings needed in the movie. The little girl was sometimes scary and looked like a doll that was scary. The ending was not satisfactory, even though the film was at the end, did not make me feel like the characters. this movie was boring and didn't do anything for me, i recommend this movie to no one.
