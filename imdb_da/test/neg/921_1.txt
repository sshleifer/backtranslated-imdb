How did I deserve to see this crap ??? Worst Ever The action was horrible when I read that this was a comedy, I expected at least to smile, once - or twice, but .... If you want to lose an hour and a half in life, it is the right one movie. I just recommend looking in a wall or something other than seeing this "movie". Yoy can even see a documentary (if you are a guy) about pregnant women, I guarantee it will be more entertaining :) The actor in this (I forgot his name) is not that bad and I am surprised how hi accepted role. Anyway, "I want someone to eat cheese with" is the right movie if you want to punish someone.
