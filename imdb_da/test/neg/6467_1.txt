The only entertaining thing I found about watching this movie was Star Wars, who came through the cinema wall (yes I go to a really bad cinema). This movie is so fun numb, I think I would rather have my eyes scratched out of a cat instead of seeing it again. Let's compare it to the original. One is charming, fun, exciting, well-acted, and one of the best movies ever made, the other is so far from fun that all you can do is hope your eyes fall out so you don't need to see more. I'm sorry Christina Ricci is a fine actress, but can't be compared to Hailley Mills and doesn't even get me on Doug E. Doug in some one obsessed with the amazing and absolutely charming Dean Jones. Dean Jones's small part of the new version is the only partial redeeming part of this movie, and that's the only reason I can justify a 1 * rating (also because imdb doesn't go into negatives).
