My brother worked in a movie theater when I watched this movie; I saw it for free and still went out. I've seen many movies in my time, but it was the worst. When people ask me what the worst movie I've ever seen, I mention this movie in less than a second. This movie is bad because it goes from a lame plot setup to the next, it encourages stereotypes about blacks that are sick and the stream is horrible. If you want to see how to make children cry and vomit at the same time, study this movie. Okay, this movie is not good "bad" but terribly bad. If you're like one of those people who watch horrible movies for fun, like me, you won't even be able to do it through this very short movie. Please for God's love destroy all copies of this movie.
