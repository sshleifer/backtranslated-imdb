Perhaps it is unfair for me to review this movie because I went out well before the end. It's strange because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen, and I enjoyed Midsummer's Night's Dream many years ago when I saw it on stage. <br /> <br /> I think two things did me in: the creaking twerp with Shakespearian name, Calista Flockhart, and Michelle Feiffer sitting in a huge clamshell. Well, I suppose you could say it should be a comedy - but when the scene is fun and the actors are not, I would say we have a bad movie on our hands ....
