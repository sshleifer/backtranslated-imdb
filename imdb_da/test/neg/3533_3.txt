A scientific experiment designed to create a superhuman being has gone wrong. The creators are trapped in a remote desert post, persecuted relentlessly and mercilessly by their own creation. James Stockton, the scientist whose research was used in spite of his protests to create the monster, is called the headquarters to help undo the horror now lurking somewhere in the dark halls. James along with his son and daughter soon find themselves trapped with the others and are desperately trying to survive. And with the outboard sealed inside, there is no way out ... "The Outpost" / "Mind Ripper" is very unoriginal. The sets are rather claustrophobic, and there are a few things to do. But as a horror it fails miserably at almost every level. There is no excitement, the script is weak and filled with big holes, and the end is highly predictable. The so-called master Wes Craven produced this one. I wonder if he is happy with this trash. Joe Gayton leads without any style. The action is horrible, only Lance H Enriksen can act at all. Ok, I'm a big horror fan and was bitterly disappointed. Sweep it like the plague - it's just the same old boring shit again!
