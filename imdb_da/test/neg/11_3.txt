Julie Andrews provides satirically his own goody-two-shoes image in this over-produced musical comedy drama, but if she approaches her role with aplomb, she is alone in doing so. Blake Edwards' film about a woman who is both a musical entertainer and a German spy during WWI, does not know what tone is to be ensured, and Rock Hudson has the incredible task of playing romantic second killers. Musicals had grown out of favor in 1970, and elephant productions like "Star!" and this movie really argued Andrew's reputation and left much dead space in his catalog until "The Tamarind Seed" came together. I always thought Julie Andrews would have made a big villain or shady lady; her strong voice could really order attention, and she hits some low notes that can either be imposed or seductive. Man / director Edwards seems to realize this, but neither he nor Julie can work much energy in this scenario. Screenwriter William Peter Blatty is not a good partner for Edwards, and neither man has his heart in this material. Beatty's script offers Andrews just a fabulous sequence - a striptease. * 1/2 from ****
