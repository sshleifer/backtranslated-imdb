This film, like no other state, illustrates the Australian film industry and everything that holds it back. Great talent, excellent performances (especially of Victoria Hill), but a failure in almost every other way. <br /> <br /> An "adaptation" of battles, it did not bring anything new to Macbeth (no, to put it in today's Australia is not enough) and essentially failed to justify its existence except (let's face it, completely unnecessarily) to pay tribute to the original work. If there is a body of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it is Shakespeare's. So any adaptation, if it should not be a self-reliant and meaningless exercise, should at least bring a new interpretation of the work. <br /> <br /> And that's what this Macbeth fails to do. As it was done, this film has no contemporary relevance at all. It's the same piece we've seen countless (too many!) Times before. Except for guns and in various outfits. In addition to the basic blunder (no other way to put it) on keeping the original Shakespearian dialogue, one of the more cringeful moments in the movie is the long-lasting and incredible boring slow motion shoots out towards the end where I totally tuned even though I looked at the screen. I never thought I had a brief attention, but you went there. <br /> <br /> I suppose the movie succeeds on its own very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce talented world-class talent, its filmmakers must cease to be proud to succeed on limited terms and in fact set high enough standards to show that they respect the kind of dramatic talent they work with. /> <br /> A shame. An absolute shame.
