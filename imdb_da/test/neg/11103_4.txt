I saw this movie only because Sophie Marceau. But her acting abilities are not enough to anoint this movie. Almost everyone thrown doesn't play their character well, except for Sophie and Frederic. The reason could give rise to a better movie if the right pieces were in the right places. I saw several good French movies but this one I do not like.
