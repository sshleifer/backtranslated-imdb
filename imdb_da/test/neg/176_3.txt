The filmmakers try to paint the influence of Mondovis and Robert Parker as a travesty on an equal footing with the German occupation of France and the Fascism government. But they never find a victim in this movie. We hear wine producers, critics and distributors regretted that while the wine industry is growing, it becomes more and more homogeneous. But the film never does anything that has resulted in the loss of good wine or the exploitation of any other person or culture than naive Wine Spectator readers with lots of cash. If they want to pay hundreds of dollars for a boring wine, then it is. <br /> <br /> If this was a movie about diamond trading, where the DeBeers Corporation's market dominance results in human suffering, the muckraking style may have been appropriate. But as it is, it just comes out as anti-American, anti-modernization and anti-capitalist. Had the filmmakers been around in the 1870s, they would probably have protested against the grafting of American vines in an effort to save French wine.
