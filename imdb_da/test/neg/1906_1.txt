Have you ever seen a really bad movie and get angry with it? Even a movie you didn't have high expectations for? Now I just rented the movie "Dead Line". This is the American video title for "Interferencia". Now I've seen many bad movies and so many titles on "B", but it's in another league. It was posted on the "The Asylum" mark, and anyone who rents much for video horror movies knows this label. When you rent one of that, you know what you get. Very marginal low budget horror, but usually still pretty good. Not this one. The action of the three leaders was beyond bad. Even quick forwarding couldn't help. The roof line on the front of the box says ".. in the tradition of DePalma's Body Double. The nerve to compare with the classic movie. The only true comment is" The screams you want to hear are real. Yes you will be one screaming if you rent this.
