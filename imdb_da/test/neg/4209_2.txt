So the used DVD was cheap and got it a chuckle. I had recently also found "The Octagon" on DVD and bought one to remind to have seen it in the theater as a pre-teen and loved it at the time. The problem with "going back" to these American karate films is that since then I have seen so many Hong Kong and Thai action movies, where the battle scenes are long, fast and downhill. I am thinking in particular of games like Jackie and Benny "The Jet" at the end of "Dragons Forever" or Tony Jaas circular staircase from "The Protector". Hollywood kung-fu deals are just not "filmed properly" and even make any of the certified skills that Chuck look uncomfortable at times. And what's worse than a fight going in slow motion? Then you know it looked crazy at normal speed, so they lowered it to power. It really highlights how ridiculous an opponent looks like they are waiting just to be kicked in the chest. Bad Chuck, he just has no intensity in this movie, nor does he project any fair threat. Compare it to his former co-star Bruce Lee, who had the charm and attitude to burn. When Bruce wanted to squeeze against some opponents, one could almost see the air around him crackling with what was going to happen. In "Breaker, Breaker", Chuck accidentally seemed to kick people, with complete nonchalance. When the judge comes to see him in jail and judge him to death, Chuck stares at a sad look, and I thought "OK ... he makes the" third eye "focus and will grab the judge by the neck and get out of This "but he does nothing except look up with a doe-eyed stare. Terrible. And while the DVD cabinet gives you hope indicating a run time of 1 hour, 5 minutes, it is actually 1 hour, 25 minutes, so there is 20 minutes to see pain. <br /> <br /> For big fighting, see Jackie Chan in the first "Police Story" .... the fight in the mall at the end is pure gold ......
