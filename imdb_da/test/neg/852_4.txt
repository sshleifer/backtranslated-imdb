This was a mish mash of a movie that started going nowhere, lost on the road, then suddenly found a plot in the last 5 minutes when the title character is finally introduced. There were so many nasty, cocky guys in this movie, I wasted on who was the owner and who was the watcher. I have a casting theory myself; All the evil plays were played by ugly actors (and a nasty actress) and all the good guys / victims were played by beautiful actors. In fact, the actors who played the ultimate victims, the slaves, were beautiful as the innocent priest's daughter, while the plantation owner, his minipulative mistress, and his overseers were pretty hard on the eyes. Intentionally? You make the call. <br /> <br /> I hung in there for the end, and some others could do it too. If you just want to look at just breasts, there are plenty of them here and if you have a slave / master fetish then you will love this movie. Otherwise, see it once, vomit, shower and never talk to anyone.
