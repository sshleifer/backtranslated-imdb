Why didn't they follow the book ... I'm really sad and disappointed. So I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but if you have read the book (maybe recently), it can be very difficult to remain objective. My wife hadn't read the book and she loved the movie. <br /> <br /> The reasons for the disappointment are: 1) The involvement of the core ... away with the wind, such a shame, there is a very small portion at the start, where the antimatter is created, but does not hold on to facts ( why not the fact that Vittoria's father was burned with the first Illuminati brand, as Langdon was involved would have been a perfect start to Movie_ 2) Story-line between the (deceased) Pope and Camerlegno completely gone ... this completely up the motif for the antimatter's steal 3) The story between Langdon and Vittoria Vetra is completely involuntary <br /> All-in-all, for flaky history, and cannot understand that Dan Brown allowed them to put his name against the. Maybe I should watch this movie in 10 years when I can't remember the excellent book anymore (great chance to forget the book, I'm scared). Really sorry about the negative review which was spoiled by expectations
