... don't waste your time looking at this vanity project. I have had my comment deleted twice now for reasons that I have not yet understood, except for the suspicion that someone involved in "Gone" is not satisfied with what I had to say. So I've paired things down to the nitty-gritty this time with an excerpt of my original comments that can in no way be taken as a personal attack on any, nor unfair comments: <br /> <br /> "Gone" is the kind of train wreck that gives a new meaning to the words. Terrible, silenced dialogue, a script that just turns on like a fish out of water, that is what would scare the most self-centered by community theater divas, cinematography inspired by the "Survivor" school of swooping crane shot followed by static , nostrils-exploring close-ups, horrible ADR work, special visual effects that are not pedestrian music that completely fails to maintain mood or emotion, horrible editing with completely meaningless freezing and fading, no artistic direction to talk about --- the passion Evil just goes over and over again ... I really felt cheated by the time it took me to speed up most of it ... time that could have been better spent staring at a wall ... Under No circumstances should anyone you unfortunate enough to read this topic themselves to this "movie", long before it is over, they will wish they had been "raptured" before they made the mistake. "<br /> <br /> Case closed. Amen.
