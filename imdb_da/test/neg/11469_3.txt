As a big fan of the most modern fantasy films, I really looked forward to this. I was not aware of the character, but after hearing some general stories about the style of the comic and good reviews of the movie, I thought I was in for a real treat ... From the moment the protagonist started talking in his forced husky voice, I could immediately tell that I would not enjoy this movie. I found the story weak and predictable, the acting poor, the effects were very good for a small budget film, but did nothing to the overall plot. <br /> <br /> Perhaps as a fan of the comics you can get something more from this, otherwise I suggest you skip it and not waste you fare on this boring adventure.
