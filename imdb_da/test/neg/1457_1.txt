This is a movie that has received any interest or praise it has received, simply on the merit of being a lesbian interest piece. The performances are most numb compared to better movies in the GLBT interest genre. The whole film's clear value is achieved through modest excitement over whether and when the partners' family members say something discouraged about their lesbian relationships. The best feature of the movie is probably the beautiful New England scenery, though much of the movie is set inside. It's hard to imagine how any viewer watching this movie and not seeking confirmation of their GLBT lifestyle or wanting to see others confirm, even through poorly realized drama, could appreciate Treading Water in any significant way. It's a horrible movie.
