This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is not a piece of historical accuracy, in fact, reality is reversed. Just an example: Morgan pursued the few Chinese he encountered. The play is over the top, the script is a badly written lie. I have never seen worse false beards. <br /> <br /> Hopper arrived in Australia and had to make the movie only if the manuscript was completely rewritten so he could be a hero. When the script was ten completed on the run, it can explain how bad it is and how unfortunate the movie is. <br /> <br /> Any movie about Ned Kelly is much better than this movie.
