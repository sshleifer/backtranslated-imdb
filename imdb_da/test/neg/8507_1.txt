Debbie Boone had a monster hit with her recording of the pop song "You Light Up My Life;" The Didi Conn movie of the same name, however, was a horrible embarrassing flop. Conn plays the stereotypically crap-home vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. They are engaged, but everyone knows that Zaslow will not marry someone who is not blonde and built so only Didi is surprised when he dumps her. Needless to say, Didi is rather embarrassed. Fortunately, she has made a small songwriting in her spare time, and she has made a tune that she thinks is quite nifty. She calls it - can you guess? - "You light up my life." She jumps in the car and drives out to the big city to sell her song and create new life. Now I remember sitting in the theater and looking at her hop in the car to drive out to the big city and think "Good sky, we finally got the whole exhibition out of the way. Now there might be something interesting that will happen." And something interesting happened. The credits rolled. <br /> <br /> Yes it was. Not only was the film badly acted, poorly written and poorly filmed, it also ended in the middle. This movie is a really, deeply bad movie, and we're not talking cool-movie-bad here. We speak impossible flop, a real gabber from start to finish. If you liked the Debbie Boone song in every way buy a copy of it. But don't waste your time or money on this flick. This is a movie you will be glad you missed. <br /> <br /> Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
