I really tried to like this movie about a doctor who has the opportunity for a new life with a young woman if he can be expressed with his wife's death. I suppose this should play like a quirky light romantic comedy, but the theme is a little uncomfortable to me. <br /> <br /> But putting it aside, I found that the dialogue was too much like a stage play, even though it was based on a novel and also the mediocre play was embarrassing to watch especially the young leader Vincent Spano. <br /> <br /> I've been trying to catch up with all the 1980s movies I missed over the decade. It has been my favorite that the 80s nostalgia buffers seem to focus on the same core canon of films that usually offer the abrupt pack actors and actresses and neglect the other films that Creator have fallen through the cracks. But in the case of this function, I must say I can understand it. Not all these eighties movies were magical, and Creator is proof of this.
