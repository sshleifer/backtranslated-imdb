Undoubtedly one of the most racist prejudices I have ever seen, with prejudice smoothed against Hayden Panettiere, as she has to move into a hard inner city school. She is constantly called "white girl" and other slings based on her color. First, would it be allowed to reverse if a black girl were shot at all abuses? and secondly, the stereotype of the ethnic children from the city school is also a disgrace. The writer's apparent desire to show that they were "hip" was also extended to miss the point that the city school wins the cheerleading competition, not through talent, but by frightening their white opponents !! These overtones to the movie took it away from the anticipated direction of a harmless merciless comedy suitable for a family audience in a vehicle that makes none of the participants any credit. Hayden Panettiere has star quality but I would be surprised if any of the rest of the class ever gets much longer. All in all, a charming movie that was a waste of time.
