Cult buyers are undoubtedly familiar with the term "video nasties". This was a notorious British list of all the movies that could bring 'harm' to society if viewed by irresponsible audiences (dramatization). For gore buffs, this is an excellent checklist as it contains inhuman cruel and disturbingly realistic films (the faces of death, cannibal holocaust, driller killer) as well as outrageous and ultra-sick horror movies (The Burning, Nightmare City, Toolbox Murders). With this in mind, it is quite unusual to see "The Bloody Apes Night" listed among the other "nasties". It's certainly gory ?? But blood and violence are so poorly presented, I can't imagine anyone being offended by it. And the stupid plot (if a desperate doctor who transplantes a gorilla's heart into his dying son's coffin) is not exactly what you would call disturbing real, either. All that is left is a rather entertaining pulp horror flick with horrible plays and meaningless drag. The man-monkey make-up effects are ridiculous and there is no excitement or atmosphere to discover anywhere. Only fun if you are in the right mood, in other words. The few sequences that show detailed matches of lady wrestling (which one of the leading actresses live) is very cool.
