In the first fifteen minutes, the story of NAKED FAME is interesting: two late thirties male pornstars in an apparently healthy relationship decide to leave the porn industry and try to sing and act. The two very buff and preening men are Colton Ford and Blake Harper. With the help of Kevin Aviance and Marc Berkely, Colton produces a dance track marketed in New York hoping that Colton Ford will be an instant star - a unique disco singer using his background as a Porn Star for PR. /> <br /> The rest of the movie is grumbling and in-fighting and comments from Porn Producer ChiChi LaRue, and the movie slows slowly into repetition and doldrums. Not a bad idea for a movie, if there was a bit more depth revealed in each character's drive to move away, forming a successful career (though heavily influenced by youth, both characters have lost) to an alternative. It's just that a uniform song carries thin fast. Grady Harp, November 05
