The film is an adaptation of a Japanese story by the respected author Yukio Mishima. It simply does not make the transition to a credible story of the British and the Americans. <br /> <br /> The story goes slow, especially the part where Miles and Kristofferson are separated, and the director fills in the clipped shots of a ship's prow cut through the waves, and the small route line fills the cards while their letters become heard in overvoice. The movie moves me for so long that I even fast forward through sex and masturbation scenes that, though long, are not really passionate or erotic. The film gained some fame when Kristofferson's then divorced him for extra-curricular activities with Miss Miles during the film. I guess they enjoy the sex scenes, but it's not quite the same for a viewer. <br /> <br /> There are no signs to hang on. The sexually frustrated widow is unbearable, the young child is abominable. Kristofferson is gracious enough, but he just doesn't have the acting ability to bring much to the role, though we may not really be too involved with him, given his ultimate destiny. <br /> <br /> As for the little child, he falls with a bad crowd after his father dies, and they help him plot some evil against the man who enters his mother's life. Now this is a really bad crowd. They do not just shoplift and smoke dope, nosireebib. They throw a mickey for a cat and vivisect it. This is shown in gory detail. But of course it is only practice, so they can do the same for Kristofferson! <br /> <br /> So the movie is moving slowly, with no sign of reliance, and when something happens, it's accidentally morbid. <br /> <br /> The end is about as unsatisfactory as any movie you will ever see. All this may have made sense if the Japanese locale and cultural context had been preserved. As it says, it's just unpleasant. <br /> <br />
