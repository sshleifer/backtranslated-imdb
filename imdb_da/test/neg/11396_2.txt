If you read Errol Flyn's autobiography, My Wicked, Wicked Ways, you will see that this movie is full of poetic license. Not what makes much difference, because Errol Flynn was nevertheless generous with a poetic license in the autobiography. There is no need to worry about spoilers as there is nothing to spoil. <br /> <br /> For me it seems more sensible to use the story of a fictitious Hollywood actor; Then you could go out and find a better actor than Duncan Regehr to play him, and you don't have to worry about the audience saying things like, "But he didn't have a mustache in Captain Blood." Another mistake in this movie is that it shows Flynn as a two-dimensional character. Flynn was an intelligent man, well-educated, well-read. This film concentrates only on his funster image. <br /> <br /> Regehr is a disaster. The rest of the throw fight with their scripts. Hal Linden is OK as Warner, and Barbara Hershey makes a credible Damita, even though Lili Damita didn't even believe it. <br /> <br /> The best thing about doing this movie is to forget it and let it gently slip away for oblivion. So what I write this to, I can't imagine.
