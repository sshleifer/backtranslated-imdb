I have never seen the original movie that others have commented on, so my perspective is just about this movie without comparison. I found the message about the movie to be: if you only worry about yourself, everything will be right with the world, everything will fall into place, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect and like you more, your employers will have you more, pay you more and even your own children and parents will love you more. <br /> <br /> I find this message to be reprehensible and completely wrong. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the very fun birthplace at the end; There is not a mother out there who does not laugh under that scene. All in all, a very disappointing movie lodge. I didn't find myself rooting for anyone in this movie. I thought they were all pathetic self-absorbed people that I just didn't care what happened to them, and it's not a movie people want to see.
