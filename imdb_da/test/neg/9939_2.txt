Creepy face masks and slasher movies have merged like cheese and steak throughout the life of the bike. People often assume that it was John Carpenter who started the trend, but as with many of the genre's clich√©s - the Italians did it first. Movies like Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the creators of a hooded maniac in a murder mystery. There were also a few American pre-Halloween slashers that guarantee a mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep My Digg Open and Savage Weekend Clearly Prepare 1978, while The Town that Dreaded Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-kill movies. Carpenter's seminal flick may not have been the virgin masked nightmare, but it certainly started the competition between directors to reveal the spookiest disguise for their bogey song. Over the years, we have seen some memorable challengers, but my favorites should be: My bloody Valentine's maniacal miner, The Prowler's sadistic soldier, and Wicked Games' copper-faced assassin. I am also keen on many of the killer clowns who have expressed themselves throughout the category. The final scene in The House on Sorority Row should be listed as one of the best, and The Clown of Midnight is also high among the greatest food man's costumes. <br /> <br /> A leather mask was probably the last type to be used in a slasher movie, probably because they are very much associated with sexual perversion, which of course does not even make a scary disguise. But in recent years, both Blackout and this ambiguity decided that fear could probably be incorporated with a gimp suit. Such is the later of the two fared ?? <br /> <br /> The screen lights up with the rush of blue sirens as the police run into a hostage situation. It seems that a stressed gentleman may have had enough to be thrown as an extra in cruddy low-brow turkeys, so he has decided to endanger his wife and child. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to fight with the gunman, but unfortunately for him he loses the fight to grab a loose gun and it seems that it is the end of the road for the gray-haired officer. Fortunately, he was rescued during the time by a precise fieldman from Lisa Ryder (Donna Adams), the California Police Department's hottest female law enforcement officer. <br /> <br /> Her heroic meeting serves the brunette a campaign for Detective First Class and it is a feat that is highly envious of her male counterparts. Meanwhile, a leather-covered madman is laying slaughtering heads around the city and dumping their bloody bodies on street corners. Ryder and Shine are on the murderous gimp case, and their first question mark is a shabby back street photographer called Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is such a first-class inspector that the normal police regulation does not seem to apply to her, so long before she dates the cameraman, even though he suspects numero uno. When the bodies continue to rise around the city, she decides to go undercover in an attempt to flush out the S&M madman ?? <br /> <br /> If so, Zipperface sums up everything that went wrong with the slash genre towards the end of his bitch. What started as a big step for recorded filmmakers and thespians, had been reduced to a sewer of cinema graffiti with flat-headed movies, zero-voltage or shock and talentless mediocre actors. The boom years of the early eighties were split flicks managed to hide their lack of strong dramatic line-ups with gooey special effects and exciting directorial blooms. Unfortunately, at this point in the bike titles such as Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and Majorettes, it appeared to be produced in a conspiracy to put the category where many of the features above mentioned ended. In an early grave. <br /> <br /> Donna Adams not even at all convincing as the law officer and her inexplicable idiotic behavior - which involves making a striptease for a supremacy in a nationwide murder investigation - is more mind numbingly pathetic than you could ever expect to be . Mansour Pourmand couldn't drive traffic, and the vast majority of the cast members would struggle to get another reading for a radio commercial. I searched and searched, but found nothing here for profit or note. <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you manage to keep the TV on at the end, you may be surprised at the killer's identity. To be honest, however, I doubt that you will take care of yourself at that time. And another plus point? Well erm .... the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means you can use it as a mat to place your cup of tea on? Apart from that, there really is no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Poorly bad and not in a good way, it is 90 minutes in my life that I could have used more constructively by picking my chest hair. Miserable.
