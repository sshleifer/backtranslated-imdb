I really mean, really, really tall and this movie has a shot at entertainment. I don't mean regularly high, I mean the high one where reading the phone book would have you stitched. otherwise save time out of your life and go do something more constructive with it, like hitting your head on a wall and insulting your own intelligence. A complete waste of talent in some cases (Bernie Mac, John C. McGinley, Tom Kenny and the Shatner Hammer) and exactly the kind of crap they deserve to make (the countless rappers who insist on making movies). Not without it laughing (again, chemical aid is crucial) and certainly not without insulting the politically sensitive (which I am always in favor of), but ultimately not worth the time out of your life.
