When I checked out the review for this movie after I saw it, I was surprised that there were people who gave it good ratings. <br /> <br /> This is a movie with poor camera work. Everything 'scary' happens on the screen, usually accompanied by a close-up of someone shouting: "Have you seen / heard it?" Well, no, we didn't see it! We can not! And since there were no close-ups, the camera did something weird like rotating upside down, or shaking back and forth really, really fast, either to convey action or to make us physically ill. <br /> <br /> The characters were unlikeable because every two minutes they started screaming the same thing over and over again. I don't care if that's what it really would be like, I didn't rent a scary movie to see reasonable stuff! I expect unreasonable things like foreigners, demons or good plays! They were also stupid - let's go in close relationships in a cave! With all our clothes on! Talking about which, the end something contradicts what Domingo said immediately before he died. This bugged me a little, but not so much as the fact that the end resulted in a ... serious invasion of a girl's privacy. <br /> <br /> No plot, no climax, no good acting, terrible camera work. What's back? Oh, right. The end may have had a 'twist', but generally with horror movies, the twist at the end actually has understandable relevance to what happened during the movie. Sixth Sense does - it explains a lot. Hide and Seek did too. But the cave had a lama twist that served as an "explanation" if you could call it like it didn't. Explain. Something. <br /> <br /> Can't see it. Please.
