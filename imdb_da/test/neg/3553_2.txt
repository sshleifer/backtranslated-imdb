I had great hopes on this after reading previous reviews, but it was so slow and plotted so basically as well, I wondered if I had read the wrong reviews. <br /> <br /> Please a boy meet girl next door at 11am and both strive to love and be basketball legends. Grow apart but see each other progress Guess what! Both get scholarships for the same university and become lovers again until his father is caught playing with a younger woman. Our young hero, who is unable to cope, lapses in court concentration, but some decide to go ahead and lose investigations and guess what is being retrieved by the Lakers. Dumps heroine because she wasn't there for him in this emotional period. So for 5 years they go their own way. She returns from Spain and has lost souls to the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks. Mom tells her she has to fight for her love so she confesses her ongoing love and challenges him to a basketball shootout. He wins he marries that he wins that he loves her. He won but decides to dump another girl into our girl. The end has her playing basketball and he has baby chores. Sorry 2 is my high score. My partner scored 0 for a soap story for those reading Mills and Boon
