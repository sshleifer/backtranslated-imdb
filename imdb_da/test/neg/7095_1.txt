This movie rips off of all mobster / gangster movies ever made. MP Da Last Don has a reference to each movie. The action was by far the worst I have seen everyone. Who the hell is John Mario anyway? His plays were by far the worst I have ever seen. He makes bad actors look good. As far as Master P goes, he sells faster than an N * sync concert. I really wish I was there to tell the whole production company: WHAT HELL WOULD YOU THINK WHEN WRITING THE SCRIPT? "Of course, these people are so fixated on the gangster image that they decided to make a movie and live out of their gangsters live for real in their minds. One thing I know is that no one wanted to distribute this movie, so It seems (and predictably) that the boys should start NO RESTRICTION, NO RESTRICTION MOVIE. I've said enough! This movie is horrible and it doesn't deserve to be called a movie!
