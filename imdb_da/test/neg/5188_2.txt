on this twitter of mediocrity? You're so much better than this one. <br /> <br /> Put simply, Frostbite is worthless. Bad play (and I use this phrase loosely), minimalist "plot," sophomoric humor and blunt snowboarding. There is not even a sufficient display of feminine pulchritude to rub the wise interest in socially inappropriate but red blooded men. Top Gun had spectacular flight sequences to goggle on. Thunder Days had heart-pounding racing action. Even Point Break had skydiving scenes for its credit. Frostbite has none of these. It is not worth your time, my time, Traci Lords time, Carmen Nicole's time or the time of anyone involved in this destruction of celluloid that would have been completely usable on something that was worth it if it had not been wasted on this feed for the recycling center. <br /> <br /> The world becomes a better place when we forget that Frostbite ever existed.
