The original review I had planned for this movie might be a little over-hard, so I favored the good: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer-and-pizza or sleeping movie, the kind you see with a good group of people when the mood is light and nobody really focuses on the movie. The visual elements are beautiful, and it's a bit of fun, in parts. But horror, my friends, it's not. I made the mistake of seeing it expecting something to shake with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I will offer you a list of alternative recommendations. (It is a serious offer by the way. Real horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS, why even make a movie "based" on a classic story if you don't even want to be true to the sense, feeling, tone or theme of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of poorly written dialogue and you will hear Washington Irving's slow stick rolling over in his grave. I would even accept Big City Detective bit, but ... Ricci draws warding-hexes around the bed? Come on. Not only is there nothing as vague as this in "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", but it is historic BUNK. I don't care what neo-pagan ax you should paint, but in the 18th century, "witchcraft" meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for devilish forces; This all-fluffy white-witch goddess-worship "an-it-harm-none" approach to witchcraft goes back historically as far as the British invasion. (Parties interested in genuine oldschool pagan practices, refer to James Frazer's "The Golden Bough" if you don't believe me.) This creates such a contradictory element cast into the film's context that the very framework of Sleepy Hold legend is broken. So we end up completely with a completely different story. If it was Burton's idea, I wish he'd warned us beforehand. I would also like him to come up with a better story than the closest pedestrian seen here. And he might as well have lost Irving pretensions completely. And in any case, the film is not scary. Not even. Not at all. The curved wood came close, but was more than counterbalanced by the scary effect of the hessian's farce comedy bellowing. And finally, yes, I also wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God clearly never meant that she should be a blonde.
