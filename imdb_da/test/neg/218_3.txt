Incredibly disappointed. The pace was slow. The characters incredible and in the whole movie as a whole just let me get bored and unfulfilled. There was no real plot that could keep you spinning around the movie and keep you interested. Heisten himself never offered any excitement and did not work well, but through. <br /> <br /> There was not enough depth or background for any character, and Laurance Fisherman's character was one that I eagerly awaited, unfortunately, Laurance has no idea to play Thuggish Brut and is much preferred as a sympathetic character . Columbus card one of my favorite actors (in the stomp yard) let me down with his performance, his character was dark and you could hardly see what was driving his mind. The only sign I think offered was that the movie was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes). Although his character is quite small and insignificant, I think his touch has been added to a dull movie. In the conclusion buy the DVD if you want to find a new way to waste your time.
