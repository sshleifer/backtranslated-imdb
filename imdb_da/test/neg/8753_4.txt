Yes, the film is not a work of art, but the first time I saw it, I was 10 years old, my parents were out and I stayed with my two brothers. It was May 1970 (I know it because I found a note about the horror movie cycle that a network had). It is one of the most vivid mines I have with the guys. We finished everything in a bed and covered up to the head! Our very first horror movie! We kept talking about it for years and laughed at the moment. It was horror movie. Now, horror movies are always the same. Or was it better when we were children who enjoy without analyzing the plot and the cast and the dialogues? Most sure it was. But for me it's a great movie!
