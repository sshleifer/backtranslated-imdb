OK about 11 years ago, the amazing, funny movie "The Mask" came out and everyone loved it, and now, 11 years later, the mask is brought back in this amazing movie right? WRONG!!!!!!!!!! this movie was the dumbest movie I've ever seen !! I think when I rented it, I thought I would laugh so hard that I would almost pee my pants from the first. but after I saw this "sequal" in barley itself discharge a chuckle. I don't mean any kind of violation for the director or cast of this movie, but what a waste of time and money. so the whole story was about this little baby who has a part of the mask in him and this evil person is after him for something, because that's all i really have, i would have at least added some more things to it so it would be higher than a 2 out of 10 stars.
