It starts quite well with the accident and the decision not to return to LA. But everything falls in place too quickly. There is a decent plot twist towards the end, but so many scenes that don't make sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) comes home angry and ready to confront people, and he takes the time to put on the club when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of heaven? I don't want to spoil it for anyone who decides to see it, but the last 45 minutes are ridiculous. Even the play, which was not bad early, gets bad towards the end. Do not disturb unless you want to see how bad it is.
