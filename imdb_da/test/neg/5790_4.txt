I learned a bit of importance from this movie, which I didn't already know from CNN and The New York Times. (And I did not observe the Enron case obsessively as some others did.) The film did a very bad job explaining what "business" Enron was in that could actually have been up and down before it started saving debt in units created by Andy Fastow. It also significantly emphasized the role that Arthur Andersen and Vinson & Elkins played in validation practices, which were subsequently found to be illegal. Nor did it go as far as it could be to investigate what the "investors" - all the prominent bankers - thought they were doing. With 24-hour cable networks, the Discovery Channel and History Channel, the documentaries have spread. I have seen many in the past year that were better than this one.
