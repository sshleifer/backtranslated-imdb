This film was indecently apparent and predictable. The scenes were poorly written and even worse. After the terrible scenes, the horrible script was filled with meaningless and ill-thought lines. I would never suggest this movie to anyone who would have meaning in watching decent movies. This film was not only with the same ideas as the Bachelor and Bachelorette performance, but also included many parts where you would know what the next move and line should be without having to watch the movie before. The casting was fine, but the actors played there characters scary with more drama then should have been used, and the lines mentioned were that you wanted to change the channel quickly. As a note, don't watch this movie.
