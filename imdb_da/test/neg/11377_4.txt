I was hoping to like this movie, for a night of fun fun. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis, and the premise seemed enough of the wall to be entertaining. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I found myself dying again and again. Judy Davis gave a good performance but had very little to work with. Juliette Lewis was fabulous as expected but had very little to do. The plot was full of "twists" that were just stupid, and as so often happens in films of this type, no one seemed to act like a real man. And personally, I thought Marcia Gay Harden was completely miscast. The movie also seemed to change about midway from a black comedy with touches of farce to a total farce with touches of black comedy. One reviewer here notes that other reviews seem to have this film somewhat different and therefore dismissed it. All I can say is that I would have determined that the movie was * something * and sticking to it. The one feels like the director had some grandiose ideas, but couldn't pull them all out. I give it a 4 out of 10.
