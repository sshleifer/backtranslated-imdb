I really like Kinski he is a great actor. I've seen this movie because I've heard there are autobiographical aspects in this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is full of symbols like a piano sinking into a river or strange shadows on the walls. Then the narrator always tells abstract phrases like: "A child sells happiness, but her box is empty now." This is really disturbing and was not really necessary because everyone understands what this movie is about. The film shows how Kinsky's character treated woman and how he kept them under control. If there really are some aspects of Kinis life in this story - then he was really a pig. So there is no need to watch this movie unless you want to see Kinski naked or if you like sick trashes to laugh about.
