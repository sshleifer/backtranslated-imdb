This has to be the worst case of overhand action since the silent era. Not just one or two players, but pretty much the whole cast. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were fine, but the rest of them looked like their first time. <br /> <br /> So the budget wasn't huge. Much of the costumes and sets were trustworthy, but there were many things that jumped out on the viewer to tell us they couldn't double check or make all the props match the period. <br /> <br /> I can't think of one aspect of the movie that I liked or didn't shake my head. Your time will be better spent burning ribbon collected from your navel button.
