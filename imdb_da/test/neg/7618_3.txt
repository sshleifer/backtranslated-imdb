I once saw a bit of this movie and was interested in seeing the full thing just to see why the critics give it two stars, which means I agree. Basically, the movie with Kermit the Frog (Steve Whitmire) begins to tell all its Muppet chums that they have lost everything and he stops sitting depressed (and possibly thinking suicide) on the bench. In another world (Heaven), the angel Daniel (David Arquette, who had already been in the Muppets from Space) visited the 'Boss (Whoopi Goldberg, another reason to watch the movie) to show that Kermit really needs help. In flashbacks it shows Kermit, Miss Piggy (Eric Jacobson, not the original and better Frank Oz), Gonzo (Dave Goelz), Fozzie Bear (also Jacobson), Pepe the Prawn (Bill Barretta) and all the other Muppets have prepared a stage show For many people to see during the Christmas holidays, and it all seems to go well. But the real Rachel Bitterman (Joan Cusack) is determined to close the show or theater, and Kermit does everything possible to make sure it doesn't. Of course, Kermit fails last time and Bitterman tells him they are finished and she can officially take the theater. This is where Daniel is sent as Kermit's host angel to try to help him, but Kermit is not in the mood and eventually ends up saying "I wish I was never born". Of course, you can recognize the spear if it is a wonderful life with Kermit like George Bailey and Cusack as Mr. Potter, and in the end, Kermit realizes, of course, how much he means to everyone and goes back to finding the theater hidden as a historic landmark. Also with Whitmire as Rizzo Rat and Beaker; Goelz as Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and Waldorf; Barretta as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog and Swedish Chef; Jacobson as Animal and Yoda (the only person similar to Oz's version), William H. Macy as Glenn, Matthew Lillard as Luc Fromage, Carson Daly, Molly Shannon; Scrubs' Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Neil Flynn, John C. McGinley and Judy Reyes, Mel Brooks as Joe Snow; Brian Henson as Scooter and Janice; Jerry Nelson as Robin the Frog, Statler, Pops and Floyd Pepper, and Kevin Clash as Sam Eagle. The most memorable moment for me is the Moulin Rouge scene spy, besides that and the familiar faces in it, not amazing. It was nominated Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the song "Everyone Matters". Muppets were number 47 on the 100 biggest pop culture icons. Sufficient!
