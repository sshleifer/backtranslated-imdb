In subsequent Dylan Moran's star from the charming misanthrope bookshop holder in the surrealistic sitcom Black Books, I could see his cartoon potential begging to be used in theater or major movie paths. This first big screen outing in a lead role (he had a cameo as Rufus thief in Notting Hill) had vows of promise, but like the strained Steve Coogan vehicle, The Parole Officer, has too many folds that should have been ironed out preproduction. <br /> <br /> The reason is so distorted that I don't bother repeating the finer details (the manuscript has all the characters doing it for us) and the grinning comes from show business jokes. Michael Caine is a pompous creator of a production of Richard III - updated to Nazi occupation (one of the few real laughs, a satirical jab on Ian McKellen) where everyone forever makes Hitler's salute every time they take the stage. Convincing Dylan, acting, should be a conceptual act for himself, the two plots to steal money from some rather harmless mobsters through their ability to act. Confusion follows (both on the screen and in the audience), there is a romantic partial plot between Dylan and the daughter of one of gangster blah blah blah, and Dylan will dress in odd clothes and make fun accents. Michael Caine delivers some election lines and Dylan's comic timing is on the money, so why isn't that good? It has some charm that you would expect from Film 4, but it also has a precious little girl who acts as a compass in a confused and irrelevant plot - a no in screenwriter 101. Exposition overshadows everything else. You just want to see Moran and Caine as a comic book to each other as they were in the beginning, but when they are together to the end, the mating has lost its charisma. <br /> <br /> Actors are an entertaining, albeit subversive, action. Should it come on telly during a rainy Tuesday afternoon, then you have it. Otherwise you would rather watch your old Black Books videos or rent Withnail & I.
