This should be one of the most annoying, arrogant, bags of movies I've ever seen. What a waste of budget and actors. Angelopoulos has reached new levels of pretentiousness. It is clear that there is almost no plot, although this part of Greek history is material for big movies. He simply had some supposedly symbolic (actually shambolic) scenes in his mind and he built a whole movie around them. Death is the main theme and repeated ad nauseam, along with litanies, processions and the like, which should only be a vehicle for the movie, but unfortunately it is the movie itself. A totally incoherent result that can only leave you saying "huh?" or "oh dear" every two minutes. <br /> <br /> There is no sign development at all, nada, zilch. I usually complain about some movies that have two-dimensional characters, but oh, he managed to create one-dimensional characters. This is annoying to us and degrading to some of the players. He even managed to make one of my favorite Greek actors, Giorgos Armenis, seem wood. <br /> <br /> And at the core of Angelopoulo's film production: No, we're not idiots. We do not want to chew food. Please someone tell this guy symbolism should be subtle. Theo do you really underestimate your audience so much, or are you simply incompetent? Personally, I think he was trying to make a Greek "Underground". No matter how he tries, he can't reach Kusturica. <br /> <br /> Only rescue grace: Photography, costumes and music.
