OK, let's get one thing right, I love dinosaur movies, even the bad ones. So with that in mind, we can continue. "Raptor" is a really horrible movie, in fact it is not even a movie in itself, as it is cobbled from "Carnosaur", "Carnosaur 2" and "Primal Species - Carnosaur 3". There are some new recordings with Eric Roberts as sheriff and his busty sidekick runs around and looks confused, scared or whatever it is that tries to convey (badly) on emotional scale, but how can they respond to something that was filmed more years earlier. The producers (yes Roger Corman I'm talking about you!) Even went in the length of hiring 2 people from "Carnosaur" to play bit pieces so that grisly death scenes can be reused! So this movie is the cheapest of the cheap. See the 3 original movies, there are no Oscar winners, but they have some merit and entertainment value, but avoid "Raptor". Oh, it also has the most meaningless sex scene running for almost 10 minutes! Do you think they were trying to redeem in maturity?
