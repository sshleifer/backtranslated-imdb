Most of this movie was okay, for a sequel to a sequel to a sequel ... I was impressed by the amount of excitement there was; I had actually expected to be chucked out in the window in favor of Gore, Gore, Gore. It wasn't, but there are some rather ridiculous deaths. <br /> <br /> However, the thing I didn't like was all the plot complications. It could have been okay if the screenwriters had taken the time to explain them all. But what was the purpose of the secret society in mental institution, specifically? Why were they protected from Michael's damage until a certain time? What should they do with the baby? How did Jaime Lloyd become pregnant for that matter? Why lock her up for 20 years for her to get pregnant too? Why did Michael finally kill all his partners? Why were there fetuses in the lab? The actors seemed to have "figured it all out" when they saw the fetuses. But it was never explained to the public. <br /> <br /> If you just want to watch this movie to see people being sniffed, then it'll be okay for you. But if you can't stand a plot thrown at you, which is still not resolved when the credits roll, you'll see something else.
