A 1957 Roger Corman not epic, where a healthy bunch of characters end up in a leading valley (sic) just as stock footage thermo nuclear heck is released. It is the end of the world. Four men with guns, two women (one unmarried virgin the other a Las Vegas show who is afraid of who drinks and smokes - guess which one makes it to the end of the movie?) Time goes by, tensions are evolving (or shall). There is something in the forest that eats radioactive rabbits. A mutant monster! Seven weeks of radioactive dust has performed "a million years of evolution" (on an already living human being) the result is a ridiculously bad, zipper up on the back, rubber samples that are strangely afraid of their only source of fresh water. It rains. The sample dissolves. The remaining two characters, Hunk and Virgin. designed to rebuild the world as the caption 'The Beginning' fills the screen after it turns out that the rain's short shower had washed away all the radioactivity and dissolved all monsters that ran around 'out there'. <br /> <br /> The only thing with real note about this is the incredible amount of 'curtain acting' that goes on in it. One of the short elements in poor and lo budget film making of the period was the excessive use of curtains in the set design. That was cheap. Completed with a setup? Drag a curtain across, drop another piece of furniture in front of it, and you have another place in minutes without having to move the camera or change the lighting. <br /> <br /> 'Curtain acting' is a skill in which the actor will comment on what goes on outside a building, he happens in ("It looks like rain" or "Here they come and it looks seem to have the sheriff with them! ") kind of thing). He does this by standing to one side of the window - when he crosses his body and lifts the curtain away from the window, but along the axis of the shot - ie. against the camera - which allows him to like to look and tell us What happens outside the screen without the audience seeing that he is staring at the studio wall three inches away from the nose behind some cheap velvet curtains. There was a lot of it in this movie.
