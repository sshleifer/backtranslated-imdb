These rubber monsters failed to try to be cool, frightening or even comedians, resembling a wannabe movie of Porky's or Animals House, but the sequences and history are not always clear, also can't catch your attention, the whole movie looks cheap and with a fantastic bad taste, the only thing that makes you laugh is the horrible rubber monsters that have to cost a dollar each because the work or them never look realistic, the movements and expressions make Muppets as a Pixar 3D movie when you compare with this. Hope Marie Carlton is the only one who supports this horrible movie, and when she dies in the movie, it gets even worse than before. A movie that should only be viewed quickly.
