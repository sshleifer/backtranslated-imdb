First I want to say that I will be as subjective as I can. <br /> <br /> There will be some potential spoilers ahead, so beware. <br /> <br /> I almost never watch movies, but this one I especially felt I had to go through. This movie Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children, based on the ultra popular RPG (Final Fantasy VII) for PS1, has been in the works for some time. After years of hype and dozens of trailers (none of which I have ever seen, I had only seen still images), this movie fans fans were really excited to see their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself had played and completed the game a few times as any good fan, and being such a movie freak I was pretty excited about myself. So I had thought of myself, "WHAT CAN GO?" The movie started OK in the first 20 minutes, but then things go out of hand when the film progresses. It is undoubtedly the best CGI animation around, but it does not help with a weak plot, undeveloped characters and over indulgent action scenes. <br /> <br /> Here's the story basics. These three silvery nancy boys in leather that have nothing to do with the game are apparently clones of Sephiroth (he is the villain of the game who presumably murdered all his supposed clones) trying to kidnap all the kids for some reason, there was not really explained everything good, probably making an army (of children?) They also center some of the story of a child named Denzel, I do not know who this child is or what his point is, he just works depressed all the time. So the sephiroth clones are also involved in some form of disease involving a disease called geostigma, which only affects the children. This disease appears to cause boredom and small amounts of skin discoloration. So now Cloud must save the day from these guys. Apparently, Cloud and his fellow comrades have learned the ability to fly, I felt a little offended by the fact that these characters flying around a city are struggling with a dragon and landing there, all the time. Maybe if the movie wasn't that top then relax in it and then they might be surprised by something incredible. The real problem with this movie is logic. Now I know what you want to say, "But it's called FANTASY! It should have these ideas in it!" Well it's a foolish way of thinking, the game was based on some kind of reality, and the movie had to follow through in that context. The context and logic of this movie is inconsistent, I could explain everything, but if I did, I would end up writing the script. <br /> <br /> Also, some scenes in this movie were extremely constructed and trite. as when all the characters from the game appear right in time for their mandatory screen time so as not to disturb the fans. They come up, do it a bit and have virtually no meaning in the story. <br /> <br /> If this is too long here, the simpler review - <br /> <br /> the pros - the first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunning <br /> <br /> the consumable over indulgent action / unbalanced action (leaving the viewer encountered the climax) weak plot super human character = no tension j-rock soundtrack / score (what happened to the orchestra?) Terrible end <br /> <br /> BIG TIME SPOILER- <br /> <br /> Now this movie really stops me disappointed. they could have gone the really cool and sweet end where cloud dies and meets with aeris in the surviving life, but after the big blow at the end the cloud is shot in the back, the kind of wounds where the bullet pops out through the chest. then the cloud has its 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of life stream. (Now I remember the life stream in the game, but it has not revived features, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life and thus make a completely different story) so that the cloud returns to life and everyone has a party and Dive into the pool and we have an ultra cheezy feature / lifetime type moment. <br /> <br /> not that movie doesn't have that moment. It is worth looking for his pictures. But that's all. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, it's not really a good movie. It is strictly for blind fans of the game. Not for people who care about plot and character and storytelling.
