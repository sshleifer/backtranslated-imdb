If you really want to experience the magic (?) Of Don Dohler, check out "Alien Factor" or maybe "Enemy", but not this. Alien Factor is actually quite imaginative considering the low budget, and it's pretty unintentional, but "Nightbeast", which I think is a kind of update of Alien Factor, is simply stupid. Actors sleep through their roles, especially Mr. Monotone sheriff, and the monster is something stupid Halloween mask kind of thing instead of the wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) looking critics from Alien Factor. A spaceship crashes on the ground and there is a critter inside, of course, running around evaporating people. And ripping arms etc. And he has a cool jet gun that he uses to evaporate people until it is shot out of his hand. And it's really about it. "Alien Factor" knocks this red hands down if you really want to see a good Don Dohler movie, check it out instead. And RIP Don Dohler, 12/2/06.
