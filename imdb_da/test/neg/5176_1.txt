This is possibly the worst of the cockney gangster genre that has blighted the British film industry since Mockney Guy Ritchie released loose stock and two badly traded barrels. This "True Life" story about Carlton Leach (who?) Has everything wrong with this genre, a really horrible script made up of people screaming "Cant", "Fahcking Cant" and "I want to kill you, you can't do it "ad nauseum. The action is uniformly horrible, as the two most recognizable cast members are two former soap stars quite visibly out of their depth. For some reason, the film assumes that we have heard about these people, and I can assure you that someone north of Essex does not have it and that we should be interested in some low life history. Why? This is not Goodfella's despite blurb on DVD cover. The story centers around a soccer hooligan that faces bounces, became gangsters whose friends end up being shot. Boo hoo. The fact that these people are completely unsympathetic is the only minor plus for this movie. In all action scenes, it appears that the camera was tied to a piece of string and whirled around while people have promised to fight, and the story of someone most people has never heard of, and nothing really interesting happens too. is a complete waste of time. People talk about how violent the movie is, as if they are signs of a big movie, and although many good movies have violence in them, it's just an excuse that the FX man shows what he can do. Overall, this film is a reminder of why the British film industry is interrupted, and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions, the better.
