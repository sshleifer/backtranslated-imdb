"Delusion" is what you experience when you see this flick and then you think something worthwhile. This flick, which tells of a trio of semi-psycho travelers who have nothing good somewhere in the CA desert, is amateurish and simply stupid. The movie suffers from a horrible story, a miserable manuscript, and a horrible direction just to name a few of the deficit. If the girl has it at all, the B-film diva Rubin's uniform performance is. Don't waste your time on this turkey. (D)
