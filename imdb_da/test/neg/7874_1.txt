Ugh. Stephen Baldwin. I have never noticed before I got the DVD home and saw his name in the credits. Double ugh. What's worse, he's the name in this low budget, mindless, wandering, wannabe shoot'em up. I mean, where did they find the guy to write this refusal? Running a larva in the LA City Dump while hoping to break into the movie game? The whole plot is ridiculous situation piled on ridiculous premise. Baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy to American gothic, sense pitchfork. His entire acting repertoire looks as though he needs the pot and looks as if he found it. <br /> <br /> Then you have the people: bad script, bad play of non-name actors, low budget setting and a hero who is just as convincing as a girl scout looking for a cookie customer as an act entirely . It's too late for me to get my money back on the DVD, but you can save yourself - unless you're one of those who likes to look at the dogs for a laugh ... honestly this is too boring Be fun.
