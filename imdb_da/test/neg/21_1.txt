Bloody Birthday is a rubbish movie from the beginning to the end. <br /> <br /> I found the play to be pretty good considering the movie's genre and its obvious low budget. I don't know what was going on with cinematography, but it looked terrible. Too saturated. Maybe it's a bad transfer to DVD or maybe it always looked like I don't know. <br /> <br /> There are really no redeeming qualities to talk about. There are a few deaths, but not really gory. I wouldn't bother with that if I were you. The best thing about the DVD was a 15 minute interview with producer Max Rosenberg, who was very entertaining and honest. He had no good to say about Director Ed Hunt and admits that the film was a failure, but he wants to recreate it when he thinks it has a decent plot. But he died in 2004, so I think it will be up to someone else to take up the challenge. With the things that have been in the last couple of years, it would not surprise me that there is at least one remodeling a week at the cinema this day. It couldn't be any worse than the original one, but I couldn't care less if it was remanufactured or not.
