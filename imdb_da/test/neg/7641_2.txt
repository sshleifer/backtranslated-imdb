... I'm back with a little choice but to hire it at least once during my review of Respiro. Among other things, what defines pretension is in my opinion a lack of emotional sincerity on the part of the author. Respiro works with an overly-constructed and self-conscious intention to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical ... mythical, though. But fortunately for all true artists out there, there does not exist a predisposed formula to achieve artistic beauty and depth. Stunning natural places (yes, these remote parts of southern Italy seem to be exotic even for most other Italians), beautiful actors and some entertaining, gutsy, spontaneous notions of a handful of attractive children will not lift a lifeless movie beyond a beautiful series of pictures. Nevertheless, this non-terminable and in vain and ultimately hollow film is worse for being art that leaves only a very limited degree, perhaps in some cases accidentally. I admit that the conceptually pompous end has some visual poetry for it. But it is my view that this was achieved in ways that were more related to the beauty of the Lampedusa sea and the strong symbolic force of bathing and water (linking it so much that it is mythical, mysterious, religious, archetypal, and so on). ) End with Crialese talent. <br /> <br /> Valeria Golino is gratingly histrionic and influenced in her performance as Grazia. For a mentally unstable woman from a humble and provincial background, she probably has a fashionable wardrobe. Her flattering, flowery flower dress and attractive, sun-drenched beach hair could have graced the sides of any Vogue summer edition. The fact that she was a "nutcase" could somehow have been nothing more than a fashionable addition to her trendy behavior and appearance - it was so delicate, she "seemed" to me. Golino's two-dimensional stereotype of the innocent, natural childhood woman misunderstood and repressed by his backward society was tiring and annoying at worse, while at best I left motionless and indifferent. I agree with the reviewer from London who wrote that mental illness is very poorly served by the cinema - throughout the film we never get a feeling of Grazia's disease and have no idea what is actually wrong with her (except that she is a tiring stereotype of a "free spirit"). We do not know why she has given injections and is obliged to see a specialist in Milan. This generic way of writing mental illness is one of the most important telling signs of the film's overall foundation. <br /> <br /> Another pretty offensive aspect of Respiro is the sense of its location. I struggled to find out if this film was to be set in the present or the past, as it was intended to get a backward portion of Italy (for comparison) apparently a dozen times more clearly and more conveniently primitive than it actually was. is. Again, it complains of superficiality and a complete lack of sincerity on Crialese's side. Some non-Italian viewers will happily beat the picturesque decline, the Italian man's possession cliché as if it were a common place, so spectacular they will continue to see my country as a culturally stranded once in the 1950s question I would like to ask David Ferguson, the reviewer from Dallas, Texas, is as follows: Is your country's mentality fixed in the 1950s? No? OK, why should it be mine?). Unfortunately, for those who still want to see Italy in such an anachronistic way, this aspect of Respiro is actually ridiculous and false even in the eyes of this Italian viewer. The subtle incestuous tension between Grazia and her eldest son was so tiring and predictable as Fabrizio Bentivoglio's sexist-but-loving man routine. I especially cut off the scene where Grazia joins her husband and male friend in a man to human dread over a bottle of beer, to her husband's macho embarrassment and dissatisfaction. According to this film, it is not a woman's place to participate in a man's conversations. Oh, but our "lovable" "free spirit" is too good for this place and does not understand the oppressive, unwritten rules of the Lampeducian patriarchy! This scene not only portrays something so false, it should be enough to discredit the whole movie's credibility. It also becomes quite the wrong end of the stick in the culture it strives to portray, clearly showing that it is written without a clear understanding of the location or its population. I want to challenge anyone who knows contemporary Italy to say otherwise. For a truly well-established modern Italian filmmaker, I deserve to be listed among the great Italian glorious film stories (which unfortunately is not the shadow of his previous self!), Look no further than Gianni Amelio - especially Lamerica, Così Ridevano and his latest La Stella Che Non C'è. Unlike most modern Italian cinemas, unfortunately derived and stagnant, Amelio's is a fresh and independent creative voice. Despite my scathing review of Respiro, I am now more than willing to believe that Criales' latest Nuovomondo, now showing in Italian cinemas, will be a worthy one. So I look forward to enjoying it, though it won't be too shocking for me if I don't (considering my feelings for Respiro!).
