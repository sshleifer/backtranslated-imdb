Just above the box I enter now, I was obliged to choose a number from 1 to 10 and judge this feature film. Unfortunately, there is no possibility for a figure less than zero and I have to put something down. If I had my choice, I would just put nothing, no figure, because there are no digits that express the worthlessness of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch this movie even after reading all those horrible reviews, make sure there are no sharp or dumb objects in the area. This will prevent you from trying to kill yourself in the middle of the movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this movie was released to the public should it be unlocked and guarded 24/7 somewhere in Fort Knox. I'm angry that this movie was even available to me to watch. I feel cheated by humanity, I had no idea that people could be so cruel. Stalin, Saddam and Hitler got nothing on this shower bag Cowell. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the film cover. 1) There is no scarecrow, no one knows why there is a legit looking scarecrow on the front. 2) None of the characters on the back of the case are even in the smelly movie! 3) The tagline says something about "new moon, more victims", there were no liberated victims no one even died. We do not know if the steam oil died, and I suppose the killer did not die because it sounded like he was hit over his head with a disengagement. a service and stay away from this movie, it wasted about 4 hours in my life. It's really four, it took an hour for me to see it (I quickly forwarded through 4 minute zoom scenes that reveal nothing in the plot), I stared at the television for approx. one hour after it was over and considered my life and direction it was about to look at this crap, and then I started crying for the next two hours because I know someone out there, unfortunately, will see this movie, And there's nothing I can do to stop it.
