Geesh, I never thought I would write the four words above. But in fact, she is the highlight of this little flick. When the movie was packed when I rented it, it seems like a comedy about a girl who has been kidnapped, but does not have her medicine, which keeps her stable. It sounded like a cute concept. For many years we have only seen Spelling as Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of boring, lifeless television films. It sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little, and considering that with the television success and her rich father she could have no financial reason to make this movie, I figured she was taking part because this must be a low-budget jewel. <br /> <br /> Incorrect. <br /> <br /> Instead, Spelling part is small, and a little bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnapping victim is just one of several stories. When she is not on the screen, the movie crawls so badly I could have sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes recorded on the tape. This would have worked so much better if Spelling's story had dominated, and it had been changed to a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the least annoying kidnappers.
