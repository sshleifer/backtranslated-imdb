Michael Myers, the horrible, not-so-more-psychic, who seems to be better off with every appearance, again arises from his grace brothers to destroy more threat to his family members and anyone else who gets in the way. Lack of logic seems to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count. Michael, who originally preferred strangulation and kitchen knives, learns to swing an ax and use the means necessary to perform his sacrifices, and the result is a horrible patchwork dollar store movie that is barely aided by a couple of real scary sequences. Donald Pleasance, who died shortly after production, seems to have been injected into this story, simply so * someone * could be billed as the star. You will not cover your eyes under this, but you will shake your head on the downward glide of John Carpenter's classic creation.
