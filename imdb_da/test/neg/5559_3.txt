This is a parody. This means that there are no signs as such, they are all common stereotypes, and the movie is entirely dependent on the quality of the jokes. There are quite good jokes in this movie. Unfortunately, they are hidden in a lot of real stupid. If one expects all dialogues to become absurd, the boss releases. <br /> <br /> You see, American Pie 2, my favorite favorite teen movie. It contains many real original characters. Perhaps the jokes are tasteless, but all people have some kind of living. For example, they feel annoyed if something embarrassing occurs. That's what makes the jokes actually fun! <br /> <br /> Not this movie: every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody so there is no sign at all, so there really is no room for any sympathy. Also, if you know the original movies, you know full scenes in advance. Add the fact that many jokes are not fun at all and you have this movie. The only thing that saved me from being totally bored, where there were actually comments from some teenagers in the cinema where I was watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Oh, and my personal highlight of the movie was Melissa Joan Hart's very short scene scene. Sigh. She's just too cool, she can't be right. Hmm, worth a whole movie?
