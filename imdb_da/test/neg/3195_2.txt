Wow. I saw one night at McCool's yesterday and all I can say is, "Wow." <br /> <br /> Here I go. MAJOR SPOILERS. <br /> <br /> Do you want a summary of the plot just to see how stupid and pointless this movie is? I would never tell anyone to see it unless I was hurting them. Anyway, here's a glimpse (or a big piece) of the plot. <br /> <br /> Randy works for a bar, McCools. He meets with this woman named Jewel, who convinces him to have sex with him surprisingly. Her ex-boyfriend ends up trying to steal them and be killed. Randy and his cousin and detective on the scene of the crime all fall to Jewel. She's the dumb's mascot, using every one of these guys to get what she wants, with a DVD player. Randy hires a hitman to kill her, and eventually the detector is killed by the prelude's psychobreak and the hit man and Jewel are going out. <br /> <br /> Seriously. That is it. I left almost nothing except for some more sex scenes and an almost pornographic scene by Liv Tyler as Jewel using a snake to flaunt her sexuality. What was the meaning of this movie? To be honest, I think it was that the producers and the directors could show their male calls. Which I think is absolutely effortless and just stupid. When I see a movie, I want a plot. I want characters. I don't care about sexy woman flaunting anything they may have. Something has to happen in a movie for the sake of goodness. It's just as bad as Fight Club. <br /> <br /> It gets even worse. John Goodman is a detective devoted to the higher being. I wondered why Goodman would play in something as violently miserable as this, but then I remembered that he was in O Brother, where are you? as well. His reputation went straight into a notch. Liv Tyler was a great actress in the Lord of the Rings. In this movie, she is nothing more than a relentless blunt who only wants her way. Her reputation has gone down seven or eight notches to me. I'm surprised, simply surprised that people would work so hard to do something so stupid. The music is totally crappy (having "YMCA" games while John Goodman's character is killed, doesn't fit properly), the characters are totally unlikely, the plot is one of the most stupid ones ever conceived by man, and To top it off, it doesn't even fit any genre. The closest thing is to be pornographic comedy. If it were even fun. As it wasn't. <br /> <br /> I think I've finished ranting now. But let me just assure you that no one in their real mind will ever see this movie. Unless they ask Liv Tyler as much as the characters do, it is.
