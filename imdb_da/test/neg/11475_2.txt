This movie is not one of those movies so bad that you get annoyed and angry because it looks like it's up to its own ass and yet it's not quite fun. It's just that there is nothing of interest in this movie. There are no real jokes that make you amused. Just look for 80 minutes and then turn it off. I bought this on very budget DVD and I am glad it is not worth much. This is not even one of the movies that is so bad that you can see it with friends when you get drunk and have a good giggle. I didn't hate it as if I hate some movies, but it's rather boring and not worth investing in any time. I can't imagine anyone actually likes this movie, except small children passing by
