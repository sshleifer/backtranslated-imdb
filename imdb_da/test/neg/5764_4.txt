A group of friends discover gold deep inside an old mine. But by taking the gold and thinking that they have hit it big, they awaken a long dead mining which is Hell Bent to protect his treasure. "The Minerals Massacre" is a chintzy b-horror movie in the extreme. You have all your known clich√©s, your group of intellectually impaired teens, characters go out on their own to investigate strange sounds, a few pop-scares, the mysterious sheriff, the old lady who all think nuts (played by top - picture Karen Black no less), and so on. Nevertheless, it's done in a fun, non-pretentious way that makes the movie fun entertaining in a "so bad, that's good" kind. The characters and dialogue are what you would expect from this type of movie, well-known, routine and unoriginal. The actors all do a decent job even though considering ?? I have actually seen bigger budget movies of the type with worse acting (I know what you did last summer, somebody?) and add some credibility to the movie itself. The crook of this movie (The 49's) comes naturally from the creeper from Jeepers Creepers, right down to the brown overcoat, the hat and the long white hair. As the snail he never speaks and is crooked to start. Gore is somewhat disappointing in my opinion. There are a few rather cruel moments, but too much is off-screen and death scenes are often ridiculous (Spoiler in front!). There is a really funny moment when a girl is beheaded by that villain, and to achieve this' effect ', the filmmakers hid the actor's body under the villains' cap, poking out and putting some false blood on her neck. You could seriously see the outline on her shoulders! I think they could have done a little better there, even though the budget was low (and I'm sure it was, but still?). The special effects are cheap, but sufficiently effective and mostly, moderately well done for a low budget film. Either the effects men or director seem to have a thing for explosions and fire. Almost every scene at the end of the movie has at least a few characters burned to death (always recorded in slow motion) or something exploding, be it a car or an old mining hole. Seriously no one has ever heard the concept; "Stop, drop and roll"! "!?!? <br /> <br /> The" massacre of the miner "(or" the curse of the forgery ", what you will ever call it) is cheesy and stupid, albeit entertaining, and as long as you have no expectations through the roof, You will be adequately entertained. <br /> <br /> I feel generous so I give it a 4/10.
