I love ghost stories, and I want to sit through a movie until it's over, even though I don't really enjoy it. I rarely feel I wasted my time ... BUT, this adaptation of the Bell Witch story was horrible! <br /> <br /> It wasn't scary at least. What about the comic relief moments? The dialogue was boring. Acting Inconsistently The movie was too long, and some scenes were unnecessarily pulled out in my open. <br /> <br /> I'm curious about other adjustments, but until then I keep reading about the story.
