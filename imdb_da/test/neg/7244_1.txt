Right on Colmyster. I totally agree with all your feelings and add them. I came to my PC specifically to comment on this terrible (minus) Bgrade movie. I should say that at this time and age I lose to understand how to make such a boring movie - but you hit me. Anyone reading this and Colmyster's comment trust me ---- Don't waste your time and money. It's an absolute choke. The action is completely pathetic, the manuscript is much worse, and the (so-called) special effects are a joke. Surely no investors actually money to make this movie? I really can't think of anything else to say about this so-called horror sci-fi product, but have to remind this comment to make 10 lines of comments to get it accepted for submission.
