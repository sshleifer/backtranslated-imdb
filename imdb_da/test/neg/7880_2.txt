I'm sorry about the "open mind" argument. I am generally completely outspoken, but this kind of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be "enjoyed". You know what's a reason so many people are disgusted with this. And just because someone out there is not making it less. There is a reason for the existence of disgust, and no amount of "open mind" or "pushing the envelope" should remove that feeling. Otherwise, we are no better than meaningless living things. <br /> <br /> Back to the movie. Another argument is that this movie usually puts women in roles reserved for men, which may be why men do not like it. But just because it turns out to be disgusting for more men than would otherwise not do well. Perhaps men should not be turned on by what dominates the film industry, but is the answer for women doing the same? Perhaps, if you don't like movies, TV and entertainment that have so much sexual objectification of women, so much violence, don't watch them. <br /> <br /> And if you're an instructor, don't do them. otherwise one day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this "movie" happens in real life. Heck, some people seem to like it so much.
