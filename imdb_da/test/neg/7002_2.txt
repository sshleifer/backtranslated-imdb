I rarely close a movie after the first 10 minutes, but that's what I did with this one. What struck me, it was so obvious that the only purpose of this movie was to expose as much skin to as many B-actresses as possible, and nothing else really matters. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong; I like beautiful actresses and sex scenes, and sexploitation movies have their own profits, but this instructor does nothing else right. <br /> <br /> Take the scene where the two police (of course, a guy a gal and OF COURSE there is all this probably witty crooked between them) speaks over while standing over the first dead body. The camera pans between them for each line (there is more than one screen width between them!), And you end up wondering if you are seesick from that or the clueless dialogue. <br /> <br /> Well, that MIGHT has gotten better after the first 10 minutes, but I wouldn't know. I rejected the sucker effort and found something better to do.
