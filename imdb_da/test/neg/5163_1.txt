What was the goal here ... I started looking at it, but then I realized that it had no purpose ... bad acting ... no action and no story .. I ended up listening to it while surfing Internet reading about David Beckham's $ 250 million US football Galaxy contract. Don't let this rent. Don't let this borrow. DO NOT BE DOWNLOADED. I have seen so many films that I could feel that it should be off the beaten path. <br /> <br /> War movies must be accurate and, if possible, have some artistic achievements and not actually feel like a Christian melodrama ... This movie is in comparison to something I've seen before. I must say that I really disappointed in this movie ..
