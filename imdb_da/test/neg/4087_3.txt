If I liked me, you enjoyed the first movie "Bruce Almighty", my advice to you is not to get your hopes up too high; In fact, disregard any hope you possess for this movie if you are over 12 years of age and have any movie experience whatsoever. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much, the story Evan (Bruce's nemesis cocoon from the first film) sees home with his family to the Virginian suburbs of "Change the World" with a new political path. The following is a rather distant and rather stupid story, which is obviously set to target young children as the main target group. Unlike its predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family-oriented film with the ambiguous genre of "comedy" marked on the misleading "sequel" site that some would consider a modern comedy classic that can be enjoyed by a slightly more mature, upscale audience. Generally, Evan Almighty consists of horrible movie values. The play; omitted Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman were stiff, and many of the signs were apparently thrown in to use the unduly large production budget. In addition, the cast includes actress John Goodman, who looks like a heel, and is only seen a few times in the film's entirety; I didn't quite buy the character and believed the story from which he was involved in the lack of depth, even for a family comedy. Every other character in the movie (especially wife and kids!) Deserves a mention for their performance so cheesy it could fill a royal size of Kiev. Be warned though; It is the typical Americanized Cheddar party associated with many mainstream family-oriented films, so I would advise you to defend yourself with the closest tear in sight. It may seem that the film is worthless so far, it has one-promising aspects. The CGI was excellent and it was clear that there was much time to model the sheet and produce water effects and animations of the computer-generated animals towards the end. The particles, render and textures used were aesthetic stellar. Though some of me couldn't help but think they were not deserving of a movie with such poor ideals and in my opinion was "too good" for this piece of cinema and brought the film all the way through. <br /> <br /> All in all, I see this movie as a disaster for continuing what was a great potential franchise, but unfortunately it was not a bad conclusion in the omnipotent series and approaching the end of The movie, I had set my expectations high for an epic and somehow meaningful finale to compensate for the mediocre content I have experienced so far. This was not the case and I was deeply disappointed and confused the final credits. When I was unhappy, I couldn't help but think the movie wasn't anywhere near 'Mighty' I was hoping for. In many ways, movies reminded me of a water "Night at the Museum", as it showed similar styling and properties, but unfortunately, leagues were under the same. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 3 out of 10 as it can be seen, but it's definitely one to be avoided! If you are going to watch this movie, be prepared for disappointment, as 'mildly entertained' is the best you can hope to get in seeing that production.
