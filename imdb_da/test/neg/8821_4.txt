I had heard many bad things about this movie before I saw it, but thought all the negative comments were probably down to the movie's low budget and bad acting - both of which I can handle when it comes to zombie films. But what I didn't expect is this movie really, really boring; If there is one thing you can trust from low budget zombies, its gore and entertainment - but unfortunately this movie does not. I'm very surprised because the two previous horror movies I've seen from director Bob Clark - Deathdream and Black Christmas - were both very imaginative and entertaining movies, but kids shouldn't play with dead things, it won't. The baseline follows a group of young adults traveling to a funeral island to mess with rituals to bring the dead back to life. But they quickly learn that playing with things they do not understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life, and the body's islands return to celebrate their blood! <br /> <br /> The pieces sound like it could lead to a decent flick, but what I don't mention is that the interesting parts don't start before the last 20 minutes; And since this is a ninety minute movie, I'm sure you can guess this isn't a good thing. The opening hours and ten minutes are padded with bad actors and even worse signs. I can understand creating a situation so the horror is more potent when it comes together; But please, if you want to spend so long on it, you really made it interesting. All the characters in the movie are over the top and annoying, and personally, I just wanted the zombies to hurry and eat them. The film is not without its benefits, as the atmosphere is a standout. Lucio Fulci wanted to show seven years later how an isolated island and flaming zombies can be mixed well; but Bob Clark did it already with this movie. The direction is also not bad, but it is brought down by bad makeup effects and a clear lack of blood, which is unlikely to delight fans of zombie films. Overall, I really can't recommend this movie; But if you are a hardcore zombie fanatic, you can get a kick out of it.
