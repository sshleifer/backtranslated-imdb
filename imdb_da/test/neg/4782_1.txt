God! Where do I start? From start to finish I couldn't help hating this movie. Vines? Vines that make mobile phone sounds?! Oh yes, I'm so scared - I'm going to remove the weeds of the earth! Come on people! The plot went nowhere when the group discovered the ruin, and the village people (no pun) came to warn them and burned weapons in front of their faces, didn't worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take pictures! The whole scene had really wondered why she didn't take pictures of her beau, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), sowing Mathias (Joe Anderson) legs. When idiots first threw the rope after Mathias, how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how it was eventually able to be only two to four meters from the ground. I can't begin to cover everything that was wrong with this movie, which is just too much to cover. I want to say the graphics as far as gore was fantastic, but it did not matter, since acting and script were so bad.
