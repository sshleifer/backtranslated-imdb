Well, that's what it should have been called anyway. Mostly because of the ridiculous, ham-fisted use of what can hardly be called the symbolism of the director. It would not have surprised me to find out that this was A) One of Lea Pool's earliest efforts, and B) at least semi-autobiographical. Turns out that A is wrong even though I am not; I don't know about B. I bet she went to the college and had a rather horrible same-sex relationship of some sort. This is the message that was knocked down in our throats of this movie, and the short film that preceded it, the name I no longer remember. <br /> <br /> In any case, character development was clumsy (who introduces himself by saying what her name means? None.) The symbols were about as subtle as a full-glass elevator full of teenage girls lost a cable and plummeting 80 stories. Over a speaker. Actually, a falcon's crying when Perabo declared she was a raptor and ran out of the table? It was ridiculous for parody. And it was just one of too many symbols that were supposed to show even the stupid viewers what her point was. And it was that she had a crazy childhood and had to make movies about it, albeit Vincent Gallo, instead of seeing a therapist, all of us all continuing with our lives. There was nothing tender, nothing sweet, and nothing to move about this movie. It was badly issued trash can and the actors couldn't save Brett Ratneresque over the top "HIGH IT'S MY POINT IN THIS MOVIE" use of movie techniques, writing and acting. Sorry, but it was terrible.
