This movie was Jerry Bruckheimer's idea of ​​selling some items. Not seriously it was. The idea behind it is that if you made a movie full of pop songs, you could keep track of an LP, sell it and make even more money for the studio. You can also release a few tracks as singles and cross the promo video with clips from the movie, so when MTV plays a track, you actually get free advertising for the movie. This is a good business deal, but an artistic disaster, because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s, and I judge the mid-1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American filmmaking and FLASHDANCE opened the door to this "Let's make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie" type movie production <br /> <br /> Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet, and immediately the logic goes away with this career opportunity. Welding is a rather sophisticated trade, it is not something you go into and learn in five minutes. There are other gaps in logic like ballet dance and "flashdancing" is somehow similar. i.e. If you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot and dirty flashdancing, the male judges might like to meet you after the audition, but you won't get the job. It is a bit like saying that screenwriting, novel writing and game description are somehow the same when they are not <br /> <br /> But I don't think any of this mattered to Jerry when he asked Director Adrian Look to make the movie. In fact, Lyne makes almost a very sexy movie, JenniferBeals is very cute and innocent in appearance. Fortunately, I sussed out why her face is heavily illuminated in close-up, while her silhouette darkens long shots, except when the camera cuts to unlock her heavenly toned body. This is because a body double is used most of the time, and often the body's double is a man! I bet there are a few naughty boys who feel guilty not to mention anything horrified to know it
