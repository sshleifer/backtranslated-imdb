"Thunderbolt" is probably Jackie Han's worst movie since "The Protector" in 1985. Yes, I know that no one is watching his movies for their stories, but the plotting of this is unusually paralyzed, even by his standards, and while the fight choreography IS up to his standards, the battle scenes (the two of them) are destroyed, as others have mentioned, by the frenetic, distracting camera work. Even the most serious Jackie Chan fans shouldn't really bother with this offensive random, stunt-and-plug-filled waste. Anita Yuen's sweet and perky performance is one of the few redeeming virtues. For a good "serious Jackie" movie I recommend "Crime Story". (* 1/2)
