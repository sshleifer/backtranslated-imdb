UP ON THE VILLA I wondered about thinking that I saw something similar to GOSFORD PARK. The film opens in a ballroom in the 1930s Italy, populated by vulgar Americans and busy upper-class Britons, but in reality, UP AT VILLA is far more like a grocery store - producing oils that are very bad news because it is very slow and I mean very slowly romantic drama with some of the romance that is very unlikely. If you like slow romantic dramas, you like this movie. I did not do it
