Very disturbing but professionally designed & scripted and intelligently geared to a good eye for color and detail. Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis, and especially Randy Quaid are exceptionally good. The story is about a young boy (Bryan Madorsky) wondering where all the leftovers they eat every night come from. His parents (Hurt, Quaid) strange behavior get the school's psychiatrist (Dennis) involved. It's a cruel cannibal movie. But it's not bad. If you like Hannibal, you'll love this. If you don't like parents, stay away from the movie. Just give advice to Cannibal Lover and Haters. <br /> <br /> Rated for strong adult themes and graphic violence.
