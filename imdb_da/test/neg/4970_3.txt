I saw the trailers of this movie and found movies and what was presented interesting. I saw the IMDb rating and 6.8 confirmed to be an above average movie. Then it went to see it. <br /> <br /> The story is about Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) ?? a beautiful girl in high school who is the subject of male sexual desire. Mandy's friend Emmet (Michael Welch) provokes another fellow student to show his love for Mandy, leaves the fellow student full and jumps to death. Nine months pass and Mandy is invited for a summer weekend for a secluded ranch of her teenage friends ?? three girls and three boys go there! There is a security guard Garth (Anson Mount) working on the ranch. During the first night itself, the murders take place ?? One by one, the members of the group are killed. Who's behind the killings? I don't want to tell you here to ruin sports? Do I like the movie? NONE. After the usual interesting opening ?? the film takes a downward turn with each unfolding of the event. At half time when the killer is revealed, you lose all interest in the remaining case. There is a last twist in the tale of shock viewers, but it made me shake my head in disbelief and laugh! All this for excitement? Huh ??! Amber Heard works and plays his role well as a shy and conscious girl? who is aware of her beauty and men's desire for her. The remaining rolls are usual ?? nothing to say about. There are so many movies made by teenage boys and girls in a secluded spot and slowly someone kills them one by one? that it doesn't interest me anymore. <br /> <br /> Director Jonathan Levine is trying hard to make the movie interesting by using simultaneous chat queries by teens filled with sexual overtones, but does not allow the movie to rise above everyday life. <br /> <br /> The only and most appealing saving grace of the movie is its filmography by Darren Genet ?? who captures beautiful picture perfect pictures! (Stars 3 out of 10)
