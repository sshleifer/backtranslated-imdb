Okay, I haven't read the book yet, but I have to say that the protagonist was miscast. How can I say such a thing hasn't read the book you're asking? It is simple. Looking at these miniseries, I was annoyed by the way, gesture and look at the protagonist Fannie Price. It is one thing to be a good person, but it is completely different to be a stick in the mud that does not seem to see anyone in the face or otherwise meet their eyes. Except for the exaggerated "Susan B. Anthony" profile, she seemed determined to refuse to look at another person. The scene in which Edmond pours her heart out to her, she looks right all the time and forces him to do the same. As a result, it was just awkward, and I just couldn't imagine anyone being in love with her, not just Henry and Edmond. Many have said that it was right in the book, if so, I find it hard to believe that Jane Austen would create such a character as her main hero. It is possible to create a sign that has been taken by others and succeed in serving their trust and endearment, but the portrayal of this character in this miniseries just did not make me.
