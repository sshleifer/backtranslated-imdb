Where to start? Some guy has an Indian pot that he cleans and suddenly attacks Skeletor. He hits a woman in the neck with an ax, she falls down but rises up and appears to be rude. She runs into the forest, and it turns out that there is the basement of a shopping mall out there in the forest. She meets a helper and Skeletor attacks again. Fortunately, like any good helper, he has a gun and a shot at the guy. Does not work, everything starts on fire. <br /> <br /> Cut some people walking through the woods. Although they have been walking together for some time, they sit down and introduce themselves to each other. Wouldn't they have done enough when they first met? In any case, they are "undercover" Delta team members (undercover, I suppose, that way doesn't have to pay to dress them in uniforms). The cute girls are different things like a sniper instructor and, I can't remember the rest. It does not matter. Eventually, they take out all their weapons and begin to aim for different things immediately. ? In any case, they meet an old Indian who sits in the woods. He wants prayers. You know like pork and beans? He mumbles some things, I can only assume that it is the premise of the movie. I trusted to have heard the premise of the advertisements, because you can't really understand anything he says. <br /> <br /> So they walk around the forest a little more. All dialogue is a burden of quasi-military, macho BS. I mean all that, as in every word. Like "This reminds me when we were in Kabul" or "This reminds me when we were in Laos". Skeletor is attacking again. Let me give you an overview of a basic attack. One of the female characters hangs behind a tree, and she directs her gun to the nearby guy on the horse. For some reason she does not burn, but shouts several times for someone else. So when Skeletor approaches, she jumps out behind the tree so Skeletor can hold her with her spear. Then everyone starts shooting. The balls cause sparks to fly from the trees. Apparently the people who made this movie never shot a tree with a ball. They don't make sparks. <br /> <br /> Then, suddenly, Casper Van Diem drives a semi-truck trying to run over Skeletor. He misses and the truck slides to a stop. Van Diem is injured, apparently he slides over the seat and hits the hip of the window wagon or something so that he crawls out of the truck and explodes. Later he is dying in the woods and everyone says a bunch of quasi-military, macho BS. They meet a couple of guys in the woods and blow their "undercover" status by immediately identifying themselves as being from the army. They turn on the guys for some reason, so they go away. <br /> <br /> Some other things happen, people mumble, the camera shakes, and so on. <br /> <br /> My theory is that the Sci-Fi Channel gets a little annoyed with everyone bashing their movies so they set this off to remind us all how bad movies really can be. Can you think our movie is bad? Well, you haven't seen bad. HERE IS BAD !!! Okay, now that we're out of the way, the rest of our movie is pretty good in comparison, right? <br /> <br /> Now it's just a theory.
