I actually went into this movie with some expectations, not because I thought the movie sounded really good, but because I am a fan of Italian exploitation flicks and with a throw that sees Franco Nero and Telly Savalas with Oliver Twist, I figured It should be interesting at least. Now ... RedNeck has one or two positive things going on, but mostly; It is a dull, lifeless movie that is as ridiculous as it is meaningless. The reason simply focuses on two criminals (Nero and Savalas) who kidnap a young kid (Oliver). Twist in the story is that the child realizes that he would have more fun if he is accepted into the "gang". Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors who have proven that they can even carry a movie on several occasions, and they have some memorable moments in this movie - even though it is for all the wrong reasons. Savalas in particular gives a silly account of the "bad" criminal. The reason does not flow badly, but since nothing is interesting, it is not really a positive point and does not save from the movie from being mediocre. Overall, I cannot recommend this movie; It may appeal to some for its cult value, but it didn't matter to me.
