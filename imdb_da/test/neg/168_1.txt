This is one of the most horrible movies I've ever seen, probably only surpassed by the terrible and utterly meaningless Blueberry. How can Harald Zwart even put his name on this crap. I feel every ounce of respect I had for him declining rapidly. <br /> <br /> So what is it about this movie that makes it so bad? Is that the story? Yes. Are the actors? Yes. That's the whole "look and feel" of the movie? Yes. <br /> <br /> To start with the story, my god! It's about being clich√©-ridden and predictable as you would expect from a drunk 14-year-old who's late writing his paper on "What I did this summer". The evocative mood that decision-makers are trying to achieve is just as drunk as we are suffering through yet another embarrassing journey to history. The actors are amateurs, I know, and therefore we cannot expect them to be of the same quality as professional actors. But for this to work, the characters must be charming and / or funny (preferably both), so the viewers don't mind the naughty plays or maybe even add the characters. In this case, not even close baby! You start to ignore the signs gently, and at the end of the movie (I think it's about 90 minutes long, though it feels like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt someone to think of these annoying stupid guys! It should be impossible to find the movie's attempt at humor success unless you are actually yourself as these stupid hickeys. Their previously mentioned lack of talent and credibility with regard to acting, only makes the foolish and overly simple scenes harder on earth. Even the family of the people involved will find it hard to find this anything but very, very embarrassing (I'd rather get my sister to fool on American idol). Finally, why in a lot of misplaced Norwegian celebrities? They look even more out of place than the actors, if possible. These celebrities just came to the cheap feeling of the movie and are in themselves a beautiful transparent shot in the dark by trying to improve something broken just before the start. I can't even begin to stress how much I'd rather see paint dare than ever see this movie again ...
