I was looking forward to seeing this movie because the trailer made it so cool. But the fact is that this movie is boring and completely confused. There is no plot and half of the movie is rapidly flashing shots from football matches. Zoomed in shots that do not give you an overview of the games. I am constantly looking at the timer to see when the movie was over! <br /> <br /> There is only one good thing about this movie. The sound!! The soundtrack is amazing! ............. Don't expect anything from this movie.
