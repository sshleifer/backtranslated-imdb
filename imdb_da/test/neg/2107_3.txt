For their credit, this is one of their most competent pieces of waste, and that is because there is a very good deal and an interesting take on tearing off "Snakes on a Plane." But if there is any more example of the inconsistency behind Asyl's newest rip-off, it is the two signs at first that are illegal immigrants and cannot understand or speak English to a Texas man who slips them across the border, but when they Getting on a train and meeting a friend they begin to understand and speak perfect English. Besides being a pretty bad portrayal of a Hollywood formula, "Snakes on a Train" is quite boring. At least with "Snakes on a Plane" we got the chance to watch actors wax comic and try to be extremely interesting. Mallachi Brothers installments contain some of the most boring characters I've ever seen from an electrical engineer (gee, I wonder how he comes in handy later) to some stoner surfers right down to our two main characters trying to fight "Snakes "is never entertaining, and even when it's very fun, it's still never as good as it has the chance to be, because" Snakes "could have been a fun short film, and instead it takes itself too seriously and puts it never up to it at any time. Instead of taking their small budget and making original movies that can set a precedent, they instead force their little budget to work against them in those knock offs. While the Mallachi brothers seem to be trying, the train just looks incredibly artificial. It almost seems like a stage game with these inconsistent and horrible gentle sets trying desperately to look like the actual train cars, while every time it shakes, the background of the windows is blurred and the sound effects sometimes go on to tell us they actually is on a train; Not to mention that in such a large extended train there seem to be only about ten passengers on it. And besides the train battle and a drawn sex scene, we have to face a plot that makes no sense. And not even the directors can work around that the "deadly" snakes that go on this train look far from poisonous or dangerous. The rest of the movie spells in just a minute with snake carnation and a bad subplot of an ex-drug agent trying to molde a passenger. All this boring exhibition ends with a really ridiculous climax, where a bad computer-generated snake (I saw better animation on Super Nintendo) completely turns off the train and then handed over in a method that should have been practiced from the very beginning. Asylum scores again. <br /> <br /> Once again, asylum scores with a hackneyed, lazy, horribly directed and boring rip-off of another better movie. "Snakes on a Train" takes way too seriously and therefore it is never entertaining or memorable.
