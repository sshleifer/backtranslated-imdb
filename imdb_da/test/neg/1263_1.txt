I would like this movie, but there is very little to like about it. It starts with Jean Stapleton and a Randy Newman song in Iowa (Northwest Iowa, I guess), reminiscent of Norman Lee's cold Turkey, which was one of the best movies ever made, according to people at IMDb. So far so good. And the idea of ​​Archangel Michael, who lives on the Pansy Milbank's motel on earth? Well, give it a try, it must be a comedy. Okay, so far, so good. But Michael would never do things that an angel did not do, and it blows credibility that the movie might have had. The other characters in the film don't have much appeal either. Michael brings a dog back to life and we should be in awe of it. The people make up corny country songs. Finally, Stapleton dances with Travolta. Big deal. If she was smart, she wouldn't even be in this movie. When it was over, I thought, "Give, what stupid, tasteless, boring, corny, sacrilegious movie!" It is not suitable for being seen by children or others.
