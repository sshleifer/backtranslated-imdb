In Hong Kong, 1962, editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, and secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband move to an old building simultaneously. Each couple only rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay away from home most of the time, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they love kung fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant near the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a kind of platonic and oppressed love. Later they realize that their friends have a relationship, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shame and probably repressed state of married woman keeps her love on platonic level. "In the Mood for Love" is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film didn't have a screenplay, and the actors were never sure what to shoot. Later, the director changed his story based on the footage. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966, when his conclusion is deliberately open and not well defined, with questions like who the boy is with Li-Zhen. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Amor Ã€ Flor da Pele" ("Love on the surface of the skin")
