Jim Henson always wanted to put out great television shows. Unfortunately, this was one of the shortest lived. It was endearing to hear every story with their glorious morals. Each episode was a new story, with new characters. John Hurt made the storyteller a wonderful job, and Brian Henson's sarcastic tone as the dog was always nice. <br /> <br /> The set designs and costumes were very well done. The Muppet work, when needed, is the classic Jim Henson work. You know it's a Muppet, but it's more than forgiving. You find yourself enchanted and forced. When every episode comes to an end, you realize that you were quite entertained. An entertainment that is accomplished, not the kind that stays away for a few moments. You sit back and think of every episode, realize that every story is indeed timeless and offers a strong story of morality. <br /> <br /> I still suggested it to my own kids, but it is indeed a series that is more than family entertainment. I recommend you find it on DVD and record it. If you can't do that, just find it.
