This is initial premise based on the American Civil War, but it is ultimately a love story. We start at the beginning of the war, where the main characters (Kidman & Law) are obviously aware of each other and there is a clear attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war. The mainstay of this film is that Law's character returns to Kidman and his struggle to achieve it and her struggle to survive until he returns. The reason it is not convinced is that we do not see enough of this relationship before leaving the law's character for the fight - it is difficult to assume that 2 people are so much in demand because they have so little contact has. Everything else goes well, Renee Zellweger and her established father and his entourage are beautiful additions, such as the threat of gangsters. Sure, it's a long movie, but it does interest and the movies are great. An honest effort that doesn't really make it, but worth a watch.
