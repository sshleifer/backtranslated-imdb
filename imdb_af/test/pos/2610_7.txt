"Please, don't kill me! I'm just an actor!" "Can you play dead?" It is difficult to describe this show. It's like a crime drama. Where the bad policeman is an ass. Literally. What is wonderful about the show is some of Assy's terrible one-liners. Speaking of such gems as "Adios, Blimp," Assy Mcgee, offers some good points. Unfortunately, it sometimes seems that the show is moving at a slow pace, making it almost difficult to watch. It is definitely the kind of show you will love or hate, there is actually no middleman. This is not the best performance on {Adult Swimming}, but it has some strengths. It's just worth checking out if you like it. I know I did it.
