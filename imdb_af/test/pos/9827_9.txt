I really enjoyed "Random Hearts". It was shocking to see such a low rating on IMDB, but a boy's gout chacun and everything. I'm a big fan of Harrison Ford, but I have to admit that he was sick in this movie, and why I gave it 9 instead of 10. Kristin Scott Thomas, however, was wonderful. She was credible and beautiful, despite the fact that she emerged for half of the movie as if she were crying for days. Could 'Random Hearts' Have Been Better? Sure, but it is worth seeing as it is.
