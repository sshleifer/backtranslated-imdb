I really enjoyed this movie. I'm really into movies where women are kicking lots of pieces, so this movie had my hope for a proper entertainment. My hope was met and exceeded less than 20 minutes in the film. The action, humor and whiteness contained in this movie makes it one of my favorite movies of all time. It had Sam Jackson and his unmistakable screen presence, Geena Davis, as I have never seen her before. I have demanded and defeated you, even if you do not want to. <br /> <br /> Geena plays Samantha Caine, an amnesiac who is desperate to remember something of her past, but quickly realizes the more she finds out the more she wants to be forgotten and eventually consumed until eventually Samantha is so much more Charly is all that remains. But now can Charly and Sam, two completely different women, possibly exist in the same body? We have characters jumping in and out of the movie cherishing every side of Sam / Charly, such as Sam Jackson, and Craig Bierko. Craig is also irresistible like Timothy, the sexy bad guy with no conscience. <br /> <br /> This movie is perfectly thrown and perfectly crafted, top and wonderfully entertaining. You watch the impossible happen and complain if it does. So worth your time. Look, you won't be sorry.
