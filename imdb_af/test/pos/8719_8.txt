Another nice but good thing about the same time as 'Out of Towners' is 'Cactus Flower', with a good role: Goldie Hawn, Ingrid Bergmann in her first movie show in one of her later, and the ever funny Walter Matthau . The story is about a dentist pretending to be married to have an excuse not to marry his girlfriend, leading a fictitious woman to appear for evidence. He takes care of his movie receiver (Bergman) to play the role, leading to various comic disasters and surprisingly romantic turns. It's in the same action as the Doris Day / Rock Hunter comedies. Fans of those - like me - will keep this movie; if not, don't bother.
