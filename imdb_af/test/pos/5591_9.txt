This story of the problems caused by an over-possessing, overwhelming, dominant and unscrupulous mother (Laura Hope Crews) for her two great sons and their girls, is a strong star performance vehicle by Irene Dunn (the new daughter-in - law), Joel McCrea (the number one boy), Eric Linden (the number two son) and Frances Dee (fianc√©e of number two son). Here is the display of the pure tyranny of mother's jealousy and obsession as four good people damage their own lives, change their plans and endanger their own identities. Irene Dunn is a star in her role. Joel McCrea's performance is open and clear and Laura Hope Crews is masterful as the mother. <br /> <br /> But this judge finds Frances Dee's performances the best of all. Hers is the first character in the story to show the power of her inner feelings. Her portrayal in her sadly broken engagement scene is gut-wrenching, and even raw. Dee looks around and drives you into her pain without even showing her face! <br /> <br /> Frances Dee, like Laura Hope Crews, has been overlooked for too long and is now almost forgotten as the wonderful actress she was. No actress who started in the film after World War II had something about Frances Dee. <br /> <br /> If you're lucky enough to see The Silver Cord, never released for TV, you'll find it. "Old-fashioned drama drama" to be an excellent film that performs very well 74 years after its release in 1933, as it is full of wonderful performances.
