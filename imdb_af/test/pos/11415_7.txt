As I read all the complaints about this movie before I saw it, I was still interested in the preview. I don't know if it was because I was expecting a bomb or what, but I really enjoyed the movie. I wasn't very scared to the second half of the movie, but even then it wasn't very bad at all. I think most screens and false alarms were realistic, if it was a bit too coincidental, but it was necessary to move the story together. I think the home and environment is the perfect environment for this type of film, it's beautiful and big, but then the same features that are attractive are frightening. I also think the light arrangement worked very well, because not only did they turn in at the entrance, but there was no way to keep them, so the house remained dark outside the small section where Jill was in. <br /> <br /> Talking of Jill, I thought her part was performing pretty well. It wasn't initially credible, but after a few calls it was good. In fact, the scene she is scared of has acted perfectly. And finally someone has the rocket right. I can't tell you how many times when I hear a noise at my house, I take the rocket, and it was a good touch for her to do the same, though she's idiotically forgetting when she needs it most. /> <br /> As far as plot holes are concerned, the movie is not perfect, but almost every hole can be explained, and part of the riddle is how it came in. How long did he look at her? how did he get out to kill her friend? And when did the gardener die exactly? Overall, I enjoyed it and I was amazed how fast it went. It kept my attention, and I wanted to see how it ended, though the end was very short and left a bad taste in my mouth. My only complaint, except the end, was the lack of character development. They could have added 10 minutes to her and her friends or something to make us worse for her situation, giving us a sense of her personality and sketching how she would handle the situation (for example, the scene she is debating Going back for the kids, there seems to be a scene in the beginning that has spoken about her only concern for herself or something.
