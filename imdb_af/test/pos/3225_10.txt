I absolutely fell in love with these girls. Let me tell you something: I come from Romania and here is just the sixth series running bundle every other day that is on US TV. I look down the internet and load it from there, so I'm in line with the rest of the world. I can't believe how deep I am in this show. I absolutely got everything from what I looked at on the internet. What is Rory's car, what are their middle names and things like that? Rory is also Leigh and Lorelay is Victoria. I can't understand why, but my boyfriend doesn't like them and I try to show him how wonderful they are, but without success, but he understands me and leaves me with my "obsesion" with the Gilmore Girls. I worship them. I really hope that if anyone sees it, they will try: You won't regret it
