To look, "Deathbed: The Bed That Eat" is like waking up in hospital, two days in a suicide. <br /> <br /> Look, disorienting, but strangely stimulating. There are few kinematic equivalents to this disturbing but often humorous lesson in mythology, morality and surreal ideology. <br /> <br /> Cocteau's "Poet's Blood" and Mayan's <br /> <br /> experimental works evoke a taste of the strange atmosphere found in DEATH BED. A close comparison is the dark adult fairy tales by literary genius writer Angela Carter, the unsettling stories of Unica <br /> <br /> Zurn or E.T.A. Hoffman. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED has many recognizable elements of the <br /> <br /> past, but displays a completely unique and original story. <br /> <br /> As a story, DEAD BED is an incredibly simple but original <br /> <br /> vision that will only reach one-in-a-thousand independent releases. This particular movie has its technical flaws, but overcame them all with a cast of beautiful non-actors <br /> <br /> and lose creepy spots - a true 1970s independent classic. <br /> <br /> DEATH BED also shows a unique, subversive, 3-dimensional personality - a deep and continuous layer of dream images and ideas that give it a "fun-house" type of construction. Over time, in flashlights and historical time travel, the bed with his sinister black humor said the rich, but underestimated symbolism used in his images. The privilege is the image of Aubrey Beardsly, the suffering artist, trapped forever within the framework of his own painting, as he comments on and loves with the murdered victims "sacrifices" that gave him as sacrifices of love through the demented bed's spirit is. - A sick chorus and wonderful element / metaphor for the "captured artist" - Nothing but the strangest thing in POE or MALLARME can be right. <br /> <br /> Anyone who observes the spirit of an independent theater desires the multi-layered symbolism experience, or longs for the Surreal concept of "convulsive <br /> <br /> beauty" and the Gothic - horror leanings of low budget exploitation movie-up will dig this totally unique vision. A simple and fun movie with beautiful deep psychic undercurrents. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. *****
