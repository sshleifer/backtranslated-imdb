Yes, I give it a 10 because I not only compare it to others of its kind, but also to the beverage one is bombarded daily in what is called "popular culture" today. In addition, the movie has been beautifully thrown, as mentioned elsewhere, and gives us a pretty good look at the popular theater of the late 18th and early 20th centuries. No small coincidence is that many of the plays played by Olcott involved a similar plot: Boy meets girl, someone objects, (usually the father or a figure of authority) boy struggles, boy wins girl. It was actually known at that time as a "Chauncey Olcott Act." No coincidence that John Ford had one. He calls it, "The Quiet Man." And, "My Wild Irish Rose," is in itself a "Chauncey Olcott act." Big things, no? Anyway, good songs, good stuff. Enjoy. <br /> <br /> PS - After watching the movie, I'd like to know more about Bill Scanlan. I found an obit that said he stopped 'Mauvorneen' because of madness (replaced by Chauncey Olcott as in the movie) and died several years later in an asylum. But he himself was a very big star, who wrote songs and plays and wrote to him. <br /> <br /> Anyone know more?
