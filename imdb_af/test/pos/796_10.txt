I barely know where to start writing about this gem, except to say that it represents young Buster Keaton at the height of his powers and surely must count on the half-dozen best short comedies ever made. THE GOOD is twenty minutes of smooth pace, expertly photographed, beautifully executed gags; two roles of non-stop comic invention driven by an undeniable undercurrent of paranoia and yet somehow lead to a happy ending - which was not always the way with Buster's comedies. (See COPS for one case where Fatalism eventually became the best of him, or ONE WEEK for Defeatism's victory.) If I had to describe this movie in one word, I call it "effortless", but if I'm allowed twice I call it "seemingly effortless", because a lot of hard work goes into making any comic opus that unfolds with such a sublime ease. Yet they didn't mention him the Great Stone Face for nothing: Buster never let the public see him sweat. <br /> <br /> A Sardinian title card tells us that our opening sequence "next to Millionaires" "means on a slate in a grim urban environment where Buster is waiting patiently in the line and as a result is not being fed. no. But it must be emphasized that he does not play for a while for pathos; Buster has our sympathy, but he never asks. Earlier, through a series of accidents, coincidences, and absurd misunderstandings, Buster is thought to be an escaped killer called Dead Shot Dan, and is being chased by each police for miles, yet he is clearly upset about this event. There is never a hint of self-pity or even surprise; We get the sense that he always knew that it would have life for him and that he didn't have the time to feel sorry for himself. He needs to find new ways to evade that police and escape from the latest trap. <br /> <br /> Just as Buster refrains from playing for sympathy, he doesn't seem to be laughing, which is particularly impressive because the buck has to be one of the shortest short comedies in life. This is the film that is characteristic of Buster's iconic shot that drives a train's tipper to the lens of the camera, which is not a gag, but in its own strange way, it is nice. Meanwhile, there are guns, dogs, policemen, an amazing hairy mustache and a clay image of a horse melting under Buster's weight (surrealism indeed), but some of the biggest booze is saved for the final when Buster is. trying to evade his primary nemesis, Big Joe Roberts, a round cop who is also the father of leading lady Virginia Fox. Trapped in Big Joe's dining room, Buster jumps over him and sails through a crossbar, turns a telephone box into a lift and pretends to disappear and eventually uses the elevator to rid himself of his pursuer and the win girl in time for a last faded gag. <br /> <br /> To say more, a disservice will be for first time viewers. I just wish I could see this movie in a theater full of people who have never seen it before and floated on the laughter. Live musical accompaniment will also be enjoyable; And by the way, the music performance provided by Kino is for their home video / DVD version of THE GAT, the first to serve as an icing on an already delicious cake.
