If I ever write movies or make them, I want one of them to be like this. I enjoy the goof ball sense of humor and jokes. This movie does stupid things without looking like it. The names of the places and characters are priceless, Generic New York High School, Squid Calimari (George's sister), etc ... genius. I saw this movie so many times because it was a cable TV pile while I was growing up. Of course I didn't get all the jokes back, but it was still funny. This movie is a less classic time.
