After reading more than my fair share of reviews for a large number of different movies, I noticed a certain trend, people are hard at judging what they expected to see. I see if you are in a movie open-minded and don't expect anything, because you will have better feelings about it if you try to look, but have pre-set standards you want to achieve. <br /> <br /> Since then I've been trying not to be hypocritical. I watched this movie with a very clean slate and open head, and was very happy. Since it's not a mainstream title or award for that matter, I didn't know what to expect, but in truth I enjoyed it much more than Ninja Scroll. Beautiful animation, deep story and the always joyful ninja-hack-n-slashing combined with one of my personal favorite animations ever made. <br /> <br /> I don't promise you will enjoy it but just give it a chance and you can come up with a pleasant surprise. <br /> <br /> - "Before you speak, be sure what you will say will be more beautiful than the silence." - Chinese proverb
