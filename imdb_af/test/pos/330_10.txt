To tell the truth, I'm not talking Tamil, and I didn't understand the movie. My good Tamil friend, Kaneswaran Kumarswamypillai (wow, who's a long name), explained everything to me. What a great movie !!! After watching this movie, I felt I had to watch many more movies from Tollywood (Tamil Film Industry). The war styles were wonderful, camera work excellent, and plot beautiful. The actress "Simran", which is a beauty. Give her an award for the best someone. Thing, Thing, Thing, come on, I smell an OSCAR winner. I didn't understand the songs, but they were excellent. Mani Ratnam is a good director and I hope his next film was a success.
