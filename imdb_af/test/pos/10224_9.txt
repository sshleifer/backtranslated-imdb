I wish there was a category to put it in other than Horror. It is simply not. Granted it has terrible moments, but I don't feel it's making a horror movie. I'll give this movie better. A million small things could be changed to make it better. <br /> <br /> It's said I love this movie. I am often sad that people misunderstand the whole point. It was always clear to me that the point of this movie was to say ... things are not always what they look like. Sometimes it's not 'evil'. <br /> <br /> Barker was at a Con where I went and he talked a bit and then watched the movie. It was very interesting. Many things he wanted to put into the movie could not be, and a piece was cut from the movie that he apparently had lost long ago. It was a piece that helped lift Boone and his girlfriend, as well as some other details. <br /> <br /> I know some people are bothered by not having more information about all the races in the background. , but I always felt that the movie felt a more 'real' one. I read the novella, and it was from many of the comics as well as from the hand. As a result, the movie always looked like a scene ground for the whole story. A much more relevant story that unfortunately never has a chance to live. <br /> <br /> Despite all the flaws, this movie can believe it has a lot to offer. The 'monsters' are wonderful, very imaginative. While the acting is sometimes stiff, there are some very quirky lines. When I see it, I find something new. Keep Boone's breast to the end. At one point Decker stabbed him and shortly after Boone fell on a card table. He ends with a card attached to his chest. This card stays there for a while, even after Lori pulled out the knife. It stays there until Boone undoubtedly removes it. I like that. It was a beautiful little detail I thought. <br /> <br /> Basically, what I want to say is that ... if you're looking for a horror movie, don't look. If you believe people can sometimes be worse than we ever dreamed. This is the movie for you. It's a movie about how people destroy what they don't understand or fear.
