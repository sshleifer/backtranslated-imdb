OR FILMS THAT HOWL AT THE MOON. Pixote gets into your nervous system and elevates you despite the pain on the screen. Here's an unrelated list of movies that have done the same thing to me, that is, "Engaged, Destroyed, Transformed, Inspired, Resonated ... This category exceeds nondescript movie top ten listings that seek movie perfection." A Woman Under the Influence, "Wiseblood", "Wage of Fear" "Saint Jack" "Funny Bones" "Out of the Blue".
