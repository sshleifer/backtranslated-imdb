Yes non-Singaporeans can't see the big problem with this movie. Some of the references in this movie fly right across the minds of foreign viewers and most of the time Singapore is the one that would actually get it. But I plead with you, stranger, to look at the other shit exhausted from Singapore and compare to this movie. It's like comparing a mule's diarrhea pieces to a small diamond. This film is the first to truly show the singapore's cunning subcloth - something that does not exist for the forces that pretend. And there is a role in the movie where a gangster (ah-beng in our unique everyday 'ingris') flows into 4 languages, namely Tamil English Malay and Hokkien. Well, the truth is most of us can and do it all the time. The sad thing is that viewers of foreign contries will have an easy time getting their oily little claws on this jewel. In the country of origin it was initially banned, only to give and R-score, also with about 20 cuts to it. It's nice to tell you that one of the best, creative, edgy and original movies ever created would be easier for you to get unsaturated, uncensored; halfway across the world than in your own nation.
