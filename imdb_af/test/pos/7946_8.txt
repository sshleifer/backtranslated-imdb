Many accuse Rod Steiger of over-persecution, and anyone who saw the Amityville Horror and the "fly" section would struggle to say otherwise. It is said, he is brilliant in this. <br /> <br /> It's never on TV, you can't buy it on DVD (legally). In 1988, when Channel 4 had another prescription for innovation, they showed it under a small amalgam of 60-year-old films, Privilege, etc. - And I remember a real theater experience, well converted into movie. The great thing about the theater is it included - how do you make it available and interesting on the screen? PH just about pull it off. Because this kind of movie is never even on cable or Sky TV, it's hard to debate, but for anyone out there who has seen or can remember, my memories of a straight, almost deadly performance by Sally Geeson "it's all those who are cared for" (which offers the almost diffuse general performances of her and her brother and sister in very early 70's), says his ref opinion. It is the power of a movie like this. <br /> <br /> PS I just saw it and it's just as well, someday TV will also be illuminated.
