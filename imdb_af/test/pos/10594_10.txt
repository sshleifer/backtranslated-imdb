I have never seen such a movie, not so funny either. I laughed my damn ass and looked at it repeatedly. Infact I look at it now. Chad from CKY is also hot. Anyway, if you never liked it, it blows your ass out, you have no taste. The film entails that Ry (Ryan Dunn) has just changed with his girlfriend to Valo (Bam Margera) and Falcone (Brandon DiCamillo) for help finding out what she did with "Hellboy" (Rake Yohn) and with the help of Raab (Chris Raab / Raab Himself), they just do. <br /> <br /> The fender bender scene and the scene with Cactus at Record Bin was hilarious.
