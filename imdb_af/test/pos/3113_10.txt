George Cuckor, known as a director of women, could not have hoped for another two talented and beautiful women for his last movie. Even a remake of Bette Davis's "Old Acquaintance" campsite written by John Van Druten, this film is definitely dated but still delicious. <br /> <br /> Bergen and Bisset shine as best friends competing for everything, but managing to stay friends Liz Hamilton (Bisset) is a "serious" writer, intellectual and elegant. She meets her lifelong best friend, Merry Noel at an exclusive girl school, and they start a lifetime of not always friendly competition. Later in their life, when Liz is a "promising" but blocked author of serious fiction, Merry decides to try her hand in writing, which makes her friend bad because of Merry's accidental approach to the vessel she may be. take a little too seriously. <br /> <br /> Much to Liz's chagrin, Merry's trashy novels have paid off dirty, and eventually, her old friend Liz judges her novel for the National Book Award. Bergen steals the show as the haughty writer of steaming bestselling schemes to bring the broken pieces of her life together with her final literary triumph, but unfortunately, things are never so simple. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast includes David Selby, who you may remember as the tragic Quentin Collins of Dark Shadows, Hart Bochner and of course a lovely young and mercurial Meg Ryan in her first film role, as she is the soap left it. <br /> <br /> Rich and Famous is catty, campy, spiritual and wise. It culminates in a New Years fiasco that emphasizes the enduring nature of true friendship, and I never leave a year without looking at New Year's Eve. See it and you'll see why.
