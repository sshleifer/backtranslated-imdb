Seeing this show, I respect MTV, although I imagine that MTV regards this random, edgy material as its main selling point and much less concerned about the appropriate truths it expresses. <br /> <br /> I write and play music for a life and this show really rolled me emotionally. For me, Wondershows serves a very clear feature of most TVs. Instead of seducing or distracting the senses (it can sometimes be very nice), it awakens my right and wrong spirit. It makes me very uncomfortable, but in a very comforting way. <br /> <br /> I don't think many viewers absorb most of this show's content, but if they do, kudos to viewers everywhere.
