Susan Sarandon. She made this movie for me. I have never appreciated her any more than I did in this movie. She really acted as if she were Adele August. I appreciate actors and actresses who leave their individual characters and create a truly credible character. <br /> <br /> Natalie Portman like Ann Augustus helped create the ideal antagonist if their characters evolved through the movie. The movie was about them, so the other characters were peripheral. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an eight rating, but Susan received a ten of me due to her performance. Regarding relationship movies, Beaches and Endearment Terms have had a greater impact on me than this movie, but I strongly recommend it.
