It is a pity that the Gershwin family and Goldwyn Estate drew this big movie out of the show, depriving the public of some of the greatest actors and performances ever packed in one movie. <br /> <br /> It is also true that the song has been named for Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge for this movie, and it is used as one of the reasons why the Gershwin never released this movie again. br /> <br /> Despite the mistakes in the movie and the creative differences between the Gershwins and the Goldwyns, this movie has some of the most remarkable shows ever put on the screen. Sammy Davis, Jr. and Pearl Bailey are especially deserving. <br /> <br /> This film was the great independent producer Samuel Golwyn's swan song. It was also ironic, the Gershwin's greatest shame. <br /> <br /> Finally, it is a loss for the wonderful black actors who appeared in it. Because we can't see them anymore at their best.
