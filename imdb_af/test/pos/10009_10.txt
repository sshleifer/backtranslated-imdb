I love this movie from start to finish. I'm a musician and I get drugs in the way of my stuff I loved (skateboarding, drawing), but my friends were always there for me. Music was like my rehab, life support and my drug. It has changed my life. I can totally relate to this movie and I wish there was more I could say. This movie left me speechless to be honest. I just saw it on the IFC channel. I usually hate satellite, but it was a satellite cargo. The IFC channel has a lot of movies and without it I would never have found this movie. I'm not a big fan of international movies, because I find that many of the don 'I do a very good job on translating lines. I think the obvious language barrier lets you believe it's just what they say, but it's not that big of a deal I guess. I almost never saw this AMAZING movie. Good thing I'm staying for instead of going to sleep ... well earlier than usual. I hope you all enjoy the hell of this movi I love and love this movie as much as I did. I wish I could write it all in caps, but it's the rules I think it's screaming again, but it would really show my excitement for the movie. I give it three inches! <br /> <br /> This movie has taken me away!
