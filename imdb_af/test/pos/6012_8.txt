After five seasons on the small screen from 1976-79, George & Mildred transferred themselves to the big screen in the middle of 1980. Instead of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke retaining their roles as writers, Dick Sharples was appointed board. writer. Unfortunately, this movie adjustment just didn't spot the place with the public. Disgraceful. I enjoy it much better than the series itself. It was a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> 'Mildred Roper' (Yootha Joyce) would like to see if her messy man George (Brian Murphy) remembered their wedding anniversary. Obviously he didn't have it, but trying to convince his wife otherwise, he booked a table at the restaurant where he was sitting a few years ago at Mildred. <br /> <br /> Upon arrival at the restaurant, they find that the place has changed hands. Mildred finally sees George's lies as celebrating their anniversary at a sleek hotel. When arriving at the hotel George is neglected by a villain 'Harry Pinto' (Stratford Johns) for a ruthless hit that wants to destroy a rival! <br /> <br /> Not an outstanding comedy as such, but a good, natural piece of fun. The plans to revive the series after the movie was unfortunately ended when Yootha Joyce died of alcohol poisoning on August 24, 1980. <br /> <br /> The finest moment - George talks to his favorite garden door. His neighbor, Tristram, crawls behind him and says, "I think his time had a chat". George, thinking it has the power of speech, drops the goblin into shock! <br /> <br /> Merry Christmas for co-IMDb users, especially AdamFontaine, Cyril Blake and The LittleSongBird. Enjoy him!
