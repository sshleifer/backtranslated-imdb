When I played the first Soul Calibur on dream cast, I thought it was wonderful. When I played the second, I was addicted. And finally, when Soul Calibur III was released, I bought a gaming station 2 and the game. <br /> <br /> It can really last you hours, with a lot of characters, lots of insoluble content, and not a BIG fighting system, it's really the biggest fighting game to date. <br /> <br /> The games strengths are especially the vs game, where two human players fight each other, either as one of the main characters or as a created and personal character. The Create Character option is great and allows the player to make thousands of different combinations. <br /> <br /> The only thing that bother me is that if you create a character that uses the fighting style "Grieve Edge" (only kicks), wear those ridiculous shoes. <br /> <br /> It is absolutely the greatest fighting game you can win. Now, I just hope the planned movie won't be crazy.
