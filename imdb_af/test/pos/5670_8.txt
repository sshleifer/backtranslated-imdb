This movie is a sleeper because Rod Steiger's is the only big name in the credits. Yet, all the supporting actors fit well with his character. It was fitting that Rod Steiger, in his last film, once again remembered his inventive power as an actor. He portrayed a grandfather's impulsiveness, stubbornness and acceptance of the end of life in a distinctive individual and convincing performance. Because his character was near death, the story brings us closer to the most precious things given to us: the privilege of life, relationships with family members and the empathy of those who care for us. His search with his big daughter for one of his sons gave enough tension to wait for me and expects a highly charged climax like the meeting of two long-divorced elderly lovers who were also in Forever Young in the eternity of death. "I wondered how the meeting would be staged and how stiff my emotions would be by the time he and his granddaughter reached the end of his quest. I was delighted to find that the story brought more than I expected The wonderful satisfying climax has given me a greater appreciation for the value of the precious gifts of life, love and family enjoyed by me and by all of us.
