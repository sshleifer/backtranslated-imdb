And she was really nice (Laraine Day, that is) - herself, her part and her performance. An engaging story of selfish vs selfless love, for the same man, rich heartbeat and dipsomaniac Robert Cummings. One of his attacks leads to an incident that destroys the local community and tests the mettle of the two sisters (Jean Muir and Laraine Day) who are near him (and opposite each other). Their comfortable and somewhat superficial environment is on the point, as the two girls face the crisis and respond to their contradictory demands of caution, integrity, loyalty and love, with the consequences of each one very different. With the old vanity and niche leaving, their true characters are revealed in the surprising contrast. <br /> <br /> A great find on TCM!
