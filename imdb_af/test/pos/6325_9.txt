The episode begins with scenes of a dead woman washed on the beach, a lost Jim disappearing along the beach and a night drive home that ends in murder and mystery. Yes, this is an atmospheric small number with a super turn at the end. Jim does well to unravel what has previously been an inexplicable case of a woman leaving 20 seconds after entering her home. To be sure, the ultimate explanation is a bit far-fetched. Why, for example, goes to length to replace a woman amid a car journey when you just rub her. AND her companions would have been so easy and left less of a route. However, it is an unforgettable TRF episode full of invention, even though Jim is again put in the frame by an ever-suspicious Police Dept. I mean to say, did the thankless so-and-s ever sit down and counted just how many of their files were solved by dear uncle Jimbo?
