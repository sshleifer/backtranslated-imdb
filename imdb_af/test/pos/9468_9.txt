I saw this movie at a special show. Initially I thought the movie would be like a typical Amanda Bynes movie, but I went wrong. The movie is based on the Shakespeare book "The Twelth Night". This movie tells the story of a girl playing soccer. Well, when the girls 'team is cut, they have to go very well to get on the boys' team at another school to take revenge on the egotistical guy at her old school. On her way she gets caught up in a long, entangled web of love, lies and deception. This movie is Mean Girls this year. I think it shows some great new actors abilities and there are challenging a few big stars appearing in this movie.
