It was a pleasant musical about the creation of the Moulin Rouge dance hall. In many ways, it reminds me of the Hollywood musicals of the 40's and 50's, because it has many clicks that lead to the inevitable conclusion ("will the performance continue?"). Although of course nothing of this is new, it was nice and well made. The music numbers at the end are awful and beautiful to watch. In many ways, it reminds me of a more sexy version of the GREAT SEAL FIELD. In real life Ziegfeld was quite the player, but it was purified in the American movie. But in FRANSKANANA, the characters have fully functional libido's - but nothing really is shown, so the movie is cute for kids. <br /> <br /> Nothing new, but well done.
