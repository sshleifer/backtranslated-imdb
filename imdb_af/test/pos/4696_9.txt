This is one of my favorite shows, all categories, all the time. <br /> <br /> A few years ago, I was fortunate enough to keep the whole series on VHS. I loved it when I saw it in -91 -92 when I was about 12. I love it, or more, today, which is remarkable in view of my (hopefully) improved film appreciation and criticism. Most of the movies I liked were not so fond of today, except for the nostalgia factor. That factor is also present here, but there is so much more to Robin of Sherwood than nostalgia. <br /> <br /> There are just a few bad things about this series. First, the picture and sound quality is so-so, at least in the first few episodes. Fortunately, it gets better. Secondly, you would have a little more blood and realism in the fighting, although I know it was not an option in this case. <br /> <br /> So, to the good stuff! And there are a lot of them. First of all, Michael Praed IS Robin Hood. I don't think I've ever seen him in a single role, which only strengthens this fact for me. He does such a credible performance as Robin. Jason Connery had an impossible job replacing him. The fact that Michael Praed has not become a bigger name than an actor is incredible. Or maybe it was his fate, to do this one role perfectly, then disappear. <br /> <br /> I love Nickolas Graces Sheriff or Nottingham. He is not really a complex character, but completely rotten. The relationship between him and Gisburne is just hilarious. Actually, just watching the Rainault sitting in his throne, bored, sly, even let me laugh before he said anything. Another actor who deserves more praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet. You can really feel the sadness of him and his feelings to the soldiers who killed his wife. Winstone is an actor who eventually got her well-deserved Hollywood breakthrough (in films such as The Departed and Beowulf). There are also many other great actors. <br /> <br /> I love the Robin gang depiction. They have fun, play, laugh, you really get a sense of camaraderie between them, the closeness that comes from a tightly bound group like this. These band screens are so important. <br /> <br /> I think it's the UK that was made with British actors, it really made it better, compared to, for example, the -92 feature film version featuring Kevin Costner, who just feels fake, fake. (Christian Slater as Will Scarlet, come on.) The cast that can speak English with the British accent makes it more credible, and I get the feeling that the actors, as well as the director and writers behind the series can place themselves much more in the shoes of the Robin Hood gang that a US crew could have. The music is wonderful, Clannad is perfect for the feel of the series. The music is still one of the things they have just cherished. <br /> <br /> An exciting addition is also the fantasy and magical spice in it. It is not top-notch but credible and makes the whole thing better and more interesting. I also love the beauty of the mix of comedy, adventure and drama. <br /> <br /> These are some of the things that make this series so lively and real. This is by far the best Robin Hood version I've ever seen. I won't wrap myself with the "Nothing's forgotten" quote. But one thing that will never be forgotten is to me the fantastic Robin Hood retelling. See it.
