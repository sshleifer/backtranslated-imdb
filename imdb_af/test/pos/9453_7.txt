The movie was fantastic and everything, but there were many mistakes in the football scene. I wonder if any of the guys working on the movie have ever seen a soccer match. First of all, I don't understand how she wanted to try the boy team? Soccer boys and girls can't play in the same team, and that's the FIFA rules. And don't start me on who when they find out she was actually a girl they let her play! !! Secondly, players can't paint their faces with colors and play like that. FIFA doesn't rule mine. <br /> <br /> Don't let me start with the goals they've achieved, it was ridiculously unrealistic. and all the players seemed to know Jack didn't know about football. <br /> <br /> And when Duke Viola trained, why did they just concentrate on shooting that happened with passing and dribbling. Or did she shoot her only problem? And why are the posters on the wall in their room for Chelse players? don't they like any other players from any other team? It was like this the only team they know ...! But besides the movie was good and I enjoyed the rest of it, just training and game scenes were unrealistic to me. they really had to consult someone about them ...!
