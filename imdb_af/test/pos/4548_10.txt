This film literally made me laugh on the floor (well on the couch). I didn't think I would have liked it, but one day it came to cable television, and I watched the whole thing and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Since then I've also seen Black Sheep, which was pretty good, but not as non-stop funny as Tommy Boy.
