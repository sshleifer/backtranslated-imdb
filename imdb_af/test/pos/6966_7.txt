Since this movie was on IMDB bottom 20, I just had to rent it out. <br /> <br /> SUPRISE! Surprise! I have no regrets seeing this movie. In fact, I really enjoyed it. There is a level of camp in this movie that brings cultists of the 80s to shame. Is this stupid? Yes, but Jim Wynorski proves that stupid is not necessarily bad. <br /> <br /> Rent it for a laugh that looks unintentional, but is actually meant to be funny. Wynorski is a genius. Hope he is directing the next ninja-tortoise movie
