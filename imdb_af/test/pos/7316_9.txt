Everyone's favorite trio of bumbling imbeciles runs amok in a hospital in this incredible raucous and often hysterically funny skirt. These guys are without a doubt the few incompetent doctors they ever drop across the screen. Comic highlights include the Stooges who continually break a glass panel into a door, meeting with a depraved patient who claims that rats used to get out of the buttonhole of his shirt, the Stooges through the corridors on a giant bike drive, a giant horse, and miniature racing cars, and our sublime stupid trio, abandoning instruments inside the awkward patient's stomach, after starting to work on the poor fellow. Director Ray McCarey tells the devastating comic shenanigans at an appropriate, unceasingly hectic pace and stretches the broad slapstick gags with considerable gusto. Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard are all in splendid form, with excellent support from Dell Henderson as the long-term hospital supervisor, Dr. Graves, who speaks Jeanie Roberts as a boost nurse (the scene where Stooges is an absurd Impromptu group singalong with this gall is absolutely sideways!), Ruth Hiatt as a whispering nurse, Billy Gilbert as the ranting crazy patient, and "Little Billy" Rhodes as a physical little patient. The rushed laziness never leaves for a while, making this beautiful birch baby one of Stooges' best outings.
