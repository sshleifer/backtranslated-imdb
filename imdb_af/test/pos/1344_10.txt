It's hard for me to explain this show to my great friends. I have a lot of Shasta Daisy's in the backyard that I lovingly call my "Chuckle Patch." My friends laughed at me and looked at me as I had 2 heads. It would be nice to see this series on DVD for our people who remember it with our other childhood memories, or to show our friends that there really was a chuckle patch! Where kids TV today is made up of violent cartoons, characters who play magic or a talk team living in a pineapple under the sea, the Magic Garden was actually in the sense that we learned good values. <br /> <br /> I'll keep good memories of Carole and Paula, and the Chuckle Patch.
