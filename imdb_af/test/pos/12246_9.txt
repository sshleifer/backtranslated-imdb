Movie watchers often say that good movies should have 3 memorable <br /> <br /> plays to be considered really good. Broadcast news does not have <br /> <br /> three, it has twice that. This movie is extremely well written by <br /> <br /> James Brooks. Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been <br /> <br /> better. I love this movie for many reasons. It's great because it <br /> <br /> makes you laugh and makes you cry. Albert Brooks has several <br /> <br /> big lines and many memorable scenes: # 1 (laughs) "I can <br /> <br /> sing and read, I sing while I read," with Midnight Train < br>> Georgia playing in the background. # 2 (Laughter) To declare the <br /> <br /> William Hurt character that "You really blew the Nookie lid," <br /> <br /> after watching Hurt's date rape report . # 3 (shouting) When Aaron <br /> <br /> (A. Brooks) tells Jayne (Hunter) that he loves her and she <br /> <br /> can't end up with Hurt's character, because he represents <br /> <br /> everything about journalism Jayne finds dispicable. Lastly, # 4 (laughs) that can leave the scene where Aaron <br /> <br /> anchors the weekend news .... hilarious. This movie had to win an Oscar! It has everything I love in <br /> <br /> movies, great acting, intelligent writing, and even a Jack Nicholson <br /> <br /> cameo!
