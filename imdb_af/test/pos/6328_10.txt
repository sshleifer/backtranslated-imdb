A fun-filled skirt, full of stupid, if not sometimes cruel jokes. Not the best of movies, but definitely worth watching. David Niven and Stewart Granger are their usual charms with Granger as a particularly sweet and brilliant man. Ava Gardner is as wonderful as ever, with such a beautiful character that is absolutely irresistible. The story line is typical, but full of joker surprises, especially with regard to the unconventional relationships between Granger, Gardner and Niven.
