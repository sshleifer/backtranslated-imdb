This film is bottling chilling in a way that can hardly be described. Although it is fairly accurate in describing the events that have been seen until the subsequent investigation into the first attempt to destroy the World Trade Center in 1993, it is almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> It would be a mistake to call this movie prophetically, but it makes sure that the common playground wisdom of me once makes you shame on you, twice ashamed. Let's live. <br /> <br /> Our government has learned nothing from the 1993 attempt at the World Trade Center and the subsequent readings of the 9/11 report show that many of the mistakes that led to the bombing in 1993 are repeated. Some people have the First and Fourth Amendments to the American Constitution, partly responsible for the Islamic terrorists who can execute their evil plans, but that is wrong in every way. <br /> <br /> The people who make this argument do not support a ban on free speech, a free press or religious freedom? I certainly hope that they do not support our government officials breaking into any person's home or office to seek without cause or without a warrant. <br /> <br /> The fact is the FBI, the INS and even the local police could have been guaranteed by the information they had in their possession, but they didn't want to choose for various reasons. In addition, no matter how unpleasant or ignorant it is, it is not illegal to talk badly about America or its leaders. Likewise, it is not illegal to pray either own guns or to mecca. <br /> <br /> Consider it until Lee Harvey Oswald actually fired his gun at President John Kennedy, he didn't really break any laws. Living in a free society has its disadvantages. <br /> <br /> Still, Path To Paradise is a movie I fear, never to be seen by so many people. As far as I know, it's not on DVD and 2007 is his tenth anniversary and no revivals are known. <br /> <br /> I'm not really surprised, people don't like to document their failures and this film certainly shows that the different agencies we intended to protect us don't do their job properly and for the reasons, such as jurisdictional issues and a refusal to share information. <br /> <br /> It is a pity as the road to paradise is well done and gripping, and as many have said before, is the last scene where Ramzi Yousef (played by Art Malik), the bomber who built the truck bomb had what was used in the first attempt to destroy the two towers. Beyond the World Trade Center after its capture and extradition, simply say, "The next time we'll both break them down," is a movie moment that put me in place for a few minutes.
