I still can't describe what to feel when I received it from the fnac website. Such a rare movie, so little talked and known, is hard to find, even to fans, but the contrast between the past and the present is devastating: now I keep a DVD of the movie, with the best quality possible. As I did in Atlantis, the other rare Besson movie I bought on the internet, I saw this one at home, with all the lights of my DVD and TV turned off and I was amazed at the experience. I didn't know what to expect. Bad, I've always been looking for some kind of disappointment when I see a movie by Luc Besson I've never seen before. But it never came. This movie was no exception. From the beginning I understood that the person who makes such a film as a first feature will be great in the future. And so it happened. It has won several prizes (including the highest prize in a film festival of my country that makes me proud) and it shows that this movie is preparing much more. It may be the most original post-war movie I have ever seen, Mad Max in originality and artistic feeling. There is no problem with this movie: his cinematography is genius, as well as the performances of the actors. I am also proud to say that I have finally seen all the movies of my favorite director and have a copy of almost everyone. (Joan of Arc is still waiting for me to buy the DVD). This movie is mostly a style and dedication, which makes it clear why Luc Besson is a director of my choice: good taste, beautiful frames, excellent music use (I was also amazed at Eric Serra's first feature) and the promise of great achievements . Gaumont played well in his son-genius, the man who would later change the face of France and Europe's relationship between films and their audience. Let's hope that Besson starts working on a new director project. I'll be the first to encourage it. Until then, I recommend this movie to anyone who needs to learn a lesson on how good movies are made with little money. I loved the atmosphere of the movie, which, according to its black and white cinematography, represents an even more depressing view of the world after the holocaust. This movie works through the sheer magic of movies: show in pictures we can't explain with words. And I'm with all the people who have commented on this movie and liked it: good choice! A big hug for everyone who sees it and feels that some of their lives have changed.
