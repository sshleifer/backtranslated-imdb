I have a letter from Mrs. Knight, who went to college with my older sister. In it she tells of the hardship to make this movie. She was pregnant herself - an interesting combination with the movie's plot - and the novice director was uncertain, reasonably green and had major problems with all the decisions, logistics, etc. They were constantly going on and it was a very difficult shooting. <br /> <br /> The film, however, with a strong debut for James Caan, remains effective and influenced. This is an excellent appearance for the talent of me. Knight proved her entire career - on television, in movies and on stage, where she won Tony for Kennedy's Children. <br /> <br /> This movie is good for the elderly.
