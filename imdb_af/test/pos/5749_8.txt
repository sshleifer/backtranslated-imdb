I just want to say that the movie was good and touching. The film explains to you the true meaning of saved or born again and is very well set out. The acting was pretty good, but could do with some improvements. The story board is striking and when my church had youth service and we watched it, 8 people gave it to Christ. I just want to tell anyone reading it, give your life to Christ and repent of your sin. PLease visit www.lifeofacristian.piczo.com Thanks Andrew <br /> <br /> The word of God will not be destroyed. So, be saved and repent of your sin!
