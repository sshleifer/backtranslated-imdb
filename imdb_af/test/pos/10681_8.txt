Travel to the Far Side of the Sun is about the discovery of a planet on the other side of the sun that shares the same orbit of the Earth and is therefore undiscovered until a space stop on the other side of the sun takes pictures. Of course, two astronauts (Roy Thinnes & Ian Hendry) are sent to explore it, but due to a malfunction, they find themselves returning to Earth just three weeks on their six-week journey. Of course they were berated (at least Dunes, Hendry was seriously injured) and grilled and asked why they had returned on their mission, but it was alleged that they hadn't done so. To Thinnes, some very strange things appear to be back at home. It's great when it is sometimes spoken, and sets and feel are not far from the Thunderbirds area, but will live for actors once. It's not a big "Star Wars" production, but more silent scientific fiction that one has to think about. Worth to see and it is criminal that the DVD is out of print. 8 out of 10.
