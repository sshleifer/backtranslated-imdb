The last film by John Huston, the great American director of the Irish descent, is an adaptation of the last short story in the early collection "Dubliners", of which the greatest writer ever came from Ireland. The film is a family relationship. The dying director based it on the script adapted by his son Tony Huston, of one of the most striking, beautiful and profound short stories ever written in this language and considered by many BEST English short stories. John aimed his daughter Anjelica in what could be her best screen performance. The movie is short, just 83 minutes. It has no action ranges, no plot, it's almost non-event, and it may look slow. The guests, friends and family come to the festival that takes place in Dublin during the Epiphany Week in January 1904, at the home of two elderly sisters who give annual dinner with music and dance. What viewers see for the first hour is the ensemble conversation. The guests speak, listen to the music, discuss the latest opera premiere, and make jokes, sometimes uncomfortable. Gradually, the conversation turned to the long dead friends or relatives who had the memory of who never faded. <br /> <br /> This is the movie you have to stay with, let it catch you, listen to what and how the guests at the party say how they communicate. Pay attention to the body language, to their faces as they drift away from the light, the laughter and the music of the present until long, but never left the most precious memories, where the death of the title is not dead. forever young and so alive. Doing so will give you the final scene of such emotional power and impact that it will always stay with you. It will break your heart, pull it down and transfer it again. The movie as well as Joyce's story is based on Gabriel Conroy (Donal McCann, as James Joyce's alter ego has a very accomplished performance), as one of the festival guests arriving with his wife Gretta (Anjelica Huston). Gabriel is still in love, feels close commitment to and fascinated with her. It's after the party, he discovers that even after many years of closeness he doesn't know everything about her past, her pain, her regret and the unforgettable emotions and loss she has experienced as a young girl and he is not part of it. For the first time he looks at her and does not think of her as the indelible part of his existence, but as another person with her own inner world, her own loneliness and sadness, and for the first time a stranger and kind pity because she entered his soul. "It is he who tells the final most powerful and deepest lines of the story:" Snow is common across Ireland ... fleeing the universe and fleeing like the descent of their last end to all living and death. "<br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie or read the Joyce story, please do so - they are truly the works of art that leave the eternal impression and change something of yours to the best.
