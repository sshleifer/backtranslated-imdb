I bought this movie because of Raquel Welch. She was beautiful in this movie if she played the role of Harry (Mike Wagner) girl friend. Harry is a robber on his luck and is trying to make another one. Harry goes to a funeral where he meets Vittorio De Sica and takes him for a ride. If things don't work out on the ride, put their mines together to find the fastest way to get money. Harry and his gang decided to go to gang with Vittorio De Sica. Be sure it doesn't matter what the gang is going to do. The outcome is never the same and will keep you on the brink of sitting. You have to watch out for yourself for the rest of the time. As far as Raquel goes if you are a fan of here, you have to watch this movie because she never looked better at the beach with a ******. I give this movie 10 weasel stars on the Raquel Welch body alone. It's no wonder why she was the hottest actress in the sixties. She was the gender symbol everyone wanted and nobody could find. Not only does she look good, she can even perform better. If you want, Raquel Welch, you'll love this movie
