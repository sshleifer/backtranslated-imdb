Great movie about an American G.I. leaving the army to marry a German girl who saved his life in the last days of the war. She accepts, but does she do it because she really likes him or because he can support her with easy access to food and so on? Meanwhile, her brother and an old friend form an anti-American terrorist group called the Werewolves, their mission to drive the passengers away (remember that the same group plays a major role in Lars von Trier's film Europe (Zentropa )). James Best, best known for his role as Roscoe P. Coltrane in the 1980 television program The Dukes of Hazzard, is shockingly excellent as the American. He had to become a big movie star? At this age he reminds me a lot of Warren Beatty. The other main actors are also good. Fuller's direction is pretty good, with very long tasks taking over (although they aren't nearly as complex as they were in Park Row, the long takes more often than not from long scenes with lots of dialogue). The only problem lies in the writing, as is apparently the case with all the Fuller movies I saw. It is not too badly flawed, but it had to be expanded, with great characters and parts of the writing. Helga, the woman, goes through a big change, but completely outside the screen. That's why the emotional center rests squarely on Best's shoulders. Fuller also had to kill the sick mother early in the film. I hope it doesn't sound too hard! She does nothing throughout the film, but lies in bed. She has so few lines. But Fuller keeps her up as the movie is going. I would have had her death, and David and Helga's relationship I strengthened myself. And the movie ends too suddenly, and it has no discount. This is not really the biggest mistake in the world (as I have described it, they are bigger than they are). 9/10.
