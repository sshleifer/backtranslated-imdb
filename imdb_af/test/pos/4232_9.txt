I come from Germany so please excuse my writing style. As I saw Chucky 4 for the first time, I was a little surprised, I knew Chucky as a regular 80's scary movie, but Bride or Chucky was very different from the old ones. First, there is the artwork of the very good director Ronny Yu, who we still keep in mind a Chinese ghost story. His visual style is similar to that of Francis Ford Coppola. Chucky and Tiff's voices are also very impressive. I also loved the script, especially the scene in which Tiff threw the Champaignbottle into the ceiling of the ceiling. <br /> <br /> I give it a 9.0 vote for funny, stingy and progressive entertainment. If you have any comments in my opinion, send me an email. MFG Schawez
