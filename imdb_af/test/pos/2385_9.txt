I am a Talent Manager. I was 15 years old. I discovered a wonderful talent. They are in movies, commercial, braodway and television. In my opinion, Eddie Monroe was a wonderful cast. I love the ability to see real people. Not just a name. The actors in this movie were very natural and credible. I was very entertained by this movie. I love a movie with a few twists. I also enjoy when the end of the movie solves the puzzle. I would like to know what happened to the large amount of money. (If you see the movie, you'll understand what I'm saying.) The Mobsters really look ???? I'd like to see this movie on the big screen. The footage is really well shot. The scenery of New York was the New York I know. Have a Happy 2006 and may make this movie the award.
