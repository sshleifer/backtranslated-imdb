I love this movie. The chemistry between the two leads Miller and Carlisle are wonderful, they spark so well apart, creating an unlikely comedy Duo. Alan Cumming is hilarious, his enthusiasm for the role is clearly visible when he trains it. The acting is great and it's a really amusing and touching movie. Not the greatest movie ever made, I will admit, but it's a lot of fun, and I'd recommend to those who enjoy other brilliant Brit movie. Join some of the best British actors, including Michael Gambon, so you can't go wrong. Watch out for cameos by David Walliams and Matt Lucas of Little Britain and Rock: Profile Celebrity.
