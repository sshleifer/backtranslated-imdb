I couldn't believe the Adult Swimming guys got this character. I laughed for days to just think about this show. After I finally saw the pilot, I think I'll stay for a few episodes. Assy is pretty funny and the whole crew of police chances are characters, but Assy is hard to understand and it was a bit frustrating. Most of the humor revolves around the fact that the title character is literally a running ass, with nothing but bones that carry sports socks with garters and feet with traditional wing tips. Assy drinks too much and "plays according to his own rules" as you might guess. The only other funny moments are Assy who shoots many, many people and spends time at home - in the bathroom. It's not squidbillies funny, but it's worth it.
