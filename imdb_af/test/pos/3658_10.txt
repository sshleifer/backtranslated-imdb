In a word ... magic. And so incredibly real. Vijay Raaz is so incredibly raw, so incredibly vulnerable, that you just want his characters to succeed in everything he does. And he plays Hari to be impeccable - from his absolutely perfect "Bollywood e-shtyle" to his awkward, shy way of first kiss. He is a truly gifted actor and I will not hesitate to see him in anything because he brings it all to life and gives it a soul. Camille Natta is absolutely beautiful. It took me time to warm her up - possibly because she played so well the role of an ignorant but fascinated tourist. Her transition really got her and she threw herself very well into her role. Even the man you love to hate, her boyfriend Benoit, was wonderful, but you never really love the froth he plays, Jean-Marie Lamour makes a perfect cad. The scripture so real. I repeatedly showed myself to my friend through the film, "This is exactly what is happening in India! They nailed it!" Very real, very raw. VERY bitter, but you definitely feel the scene fulfilled. Music by Nitin Sawhney is great and goes perfectly with the constantly changing moods. But Vijay Raaz ... I find myself constantly returning to him because he is what makes this movie. He's the hero, the most charming, disarmed rickshaw driver you'll ever experience - he's magic. A lovely, real, sweet, incredibly talented actor I can't wait to see shine and succeed in Bollywood, Hollywood or anywhere!
