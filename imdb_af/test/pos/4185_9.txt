Sorry the Monkees. People always accused them of being manufactured (or what they were) or nothing more than an American beat of the Beatles, but they were important to the children of the time they were, they were legal. Discussions on who were better The Monkeys or The Beatles were common on schoolmates, but the critics, well, they never bought in. Despite recording some very catchy, classic pop songs, the Monkess didn't receive much respect for their albums. Unfortunately, a similar fate was met by one movie vehicle, despite the fact that it was the best band movie ever. Beatle fans may argue that "Hard Days Night" was better and I am sure that many of the children think "8 Mile" was superior, but none of these films was as constant and inventive as "Head" and that is probably why it failed. <br /> <br /> If Head told a direct A to B type story, it would have addressed the young fans at the ties, but by printing the envelope and using the film opportunity to mock their own image , they really sabotaged the movie. their supporters. Can you imagine Eminem turning to the camera and actually talking about how sad it is that he is the best salesman in a genre in which only 5% (and I am generous) of the acts is white. If you can see this if you have an idea of ​​how daring it was, it was for the Monkess to sing. "Hey, Hey, we're the Monkeys. You know we'd like to. A manufactured image without philosophy. If you have a movie in which Frank Zappa tells Davy that he should focus less on dance and more on music it clear that there is a lot more going on than you expected. <br /> <br /> The story, What is there, is about the boys who are trying to flee their driver, forcing them to pour into one play commercially, but every time they run away, they end up in a box, I don't think you should be Fellini to figure out the symbolism of that little bit, some neat comedy kids follow with Davy as a boxer giving up play violin to take a dive in the big game and Peter refuses to throw away an ice cream cone that he does not want because there are hungry children so it is wrong to waste food, but the right point of sale for this movie is the music and it's the best thing the band has ever recorded, even if you put it off the story t be able to sit back and enjoy great music. <br /> <br /> Any movie that starts and ends with Mickey tries to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge (at the end the band follows him) is never going to be a mainstream classic, but if you are a fan of the band or experimental theater of the era, than you will enjoy this movie.
