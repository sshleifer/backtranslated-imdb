The most intense and powerful movie I've seen in years. There were still other movies before going into Vietnam Fat, but nothing compared to this emotional heartbreaking movie, like a typical American suburban family, about 1972, gathered at the seams, revealing the scars that Vietnam on our whole collective souls. The movie is A ++++ fantastic with all four actors (with Kathy Bates an outing) offering exciting performances. What is wonderful about this movie is that you do not use any sides but understand all four characters and empathy with them, although all four have different views and needs. There are scenes here that are as powerful as family secrets and feelings are revealed (like the confrontation between son and mother) that will emotionally drain you and have tears of anxiety. I actually cried in this movie, something I rarely do. The shocking end is a mystery! A very obscure movie to be seen. I rate this 1996 film a 10/10 superior piece. We highly recommended this day and age, and our country used an ominous war, our heads shouted at horrors and again, our young men and women returning with deep psychological scars, with their deep pain of deeds that was done in the worship service. . A must see movie.
