I have looked at this movie for another look and see it quite well. Chloe is one of the few hardcore stars that can really act. She sometimes appears in soft core such as "Body of Love" and "Lady Chatterly's Stories" on Showtime. I thought Nicole Hilbig also did well with her beautiful body and charm accent. Too bad she is not in more movies.
