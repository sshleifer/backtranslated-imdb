Yes, I watched this mini-series with My mother and father as a child. It was one of the few mini-series that my 9-year-old mind could actually follow. I remember doing very well, and didn't necessarily feel like the typical crap mini series. It was more or less an original concept that really grabbed your attention. I would recommend this miniseries to anyone who is a fan of history and intrigue. Although most twists in this movie are either spelled out or predictable, it's still worth it. I did not check if you can find it netflix. I can't imagine. They have to play it on the history channel or something.
