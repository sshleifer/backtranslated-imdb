This is my favorite movie of all time. And I always think of it as John Huston's requiem. <br /> <br /> I must have seen it at least 20 times and never tired of it. The mood, the writing, the singing, the meal, it's like being invited to someone's house and observing the events and not participating, even if you want ... It's a treasure, this movie and I cannot write enough praise for it. <br /> <br /> It is incredibly well thrown, with quite a few Abbey Theater faces and also the wonderful voice of Frank Patterson. Lady Gregory's poem quoted in the movie is one of the most moving ever written. Anjelica's scene runs down the stairs while listening to the song, being one of the best appearances on film. I cry every time I see it. For all the right reasons. <br /> <br /> We all fell in love at an early age and weep for our young, hopeful selves. <br /> <br /> To a lesser extent, Donal McCann trained too many movies, just worked on the stage and held on to it and it is our loss that we have no more of his acting on film, as he is so much into this delicate role by expressing and portraying a deep love for his wife who will never be reciprocated and he carries such inner grief in knowing it. <br /> <br /> If you want your movie action and plot to be packed, it's really no start or end just a lens on the characters at a dinner in Dublin 80 years ago and all the little ones nuances and shadows of the personalities portrayed so beautifully. <br /> <br /> Bravo to everyone involved in this production. 10 out of 10.
