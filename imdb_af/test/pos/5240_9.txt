I recently bought "The Big Trail" (1930). It's a wonderful, wonderful movie. I knew it by reputation, but never expected it to be so wonderful. My version is the one in 35mm and I will talk it later. Thinking of the Western Myth in film, the names John Ford and John Wayne keep in mind are. Well, you only have half the team here, but the whole Mite is present. Raoul Walsh gave us a remarkable epic in which the true plot is the battle of the westward expansion of the nation. <br /> <br /> There is a plot centered on a romance between Breck Coleman {Wayne} and Ruth Cameron {Margaret Churchill} with the chief villain. Red Flack is memorably played by Tyrone Power, Sr. But does it have an almost accidental quality if the wagon train is battling forward at incredible obstacles? both natural and human. Examples are the crossing of the river, the Indian battle and the passing desert. The aftermath of the battle is a bleak one when a doll is placed on the grave of a child while a faithful dog lies on his master's grave. <br /> <br /> Beautiful panoramas are filled with energy and activity. The opening scene, which prepares the wagon train to get away, the Square Dance interloading and the great Buffalo herds are some that keep the spring in mind. Wonderful use is made of space shooting throughout. Another feature of this beautiful film is the fact that men and women get equal credit for their parts in the big battle Weswes. Women work, fight and confront the terrible hardship with the same strength and power as their male counterparts. The final has a powerful exciting experience like Coleman and Cameron meet in the huge tower of Sequoia Forest to start their new life. <br /> <br /> The play is consistently acceptable. I've already mentioned Tyrone Power's scene-stealing performance. Tully Marshall is excellent as Coleman's sidekick, and Marguerite Churchill portrays a woman who develops inner strength as she experiences her own problems as well as those outside herself. The strip lighting is the worst aspect of this movie, but these scenes are not common and are swallowed up in the tremendous sweep of the movie. <br /> <br /> I read a lot of criticism of Wayne's performance? even as far as blaming his "woodworking" for the failure of the movie at the box office. I think this is unfair. Wayne was in his first important role and certainly did not develop the character of his performance in "Stagecoach". But he still does a workable role in a role that will definitely play second violin to the great overall theme. After 'The Big Trail', Wayne played in a large number of low-budget B Westerns. I have a number of these and one can see the developing actor in them. When "Stagecoach" came, he was ready and "The Big Trail" was an important part of that apprenticeship. <br /> <br /> I mentioned earlier that my version is one shot in 35mm. It's still impressive, but to get an idea of ​​the effect of the 70mm version, I set the TV screen to 16: 9 which doesn't cause any distortion. Although I didn't have the full version of the Grandeur version, it was good enough to make me win. In addition, the film shot in 70mm has a few extra scenes that aren't made for regular play. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie deserves any list of the greatest Westerners ever made.
