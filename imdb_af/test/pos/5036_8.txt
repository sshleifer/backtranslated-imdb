This is one of my favorite "Capra-esque" comedies. This movie is just meant to be enjoyed, not deconstructed, microscopically analyzed. This is not religious comment. It's fun. It's fantasy. The surprisingly negative comment (IMHO) reflects a level of expectation that professional film critics have led us to think, should be part of every movie. <br /> <br /> Others described Travolta's role (that's why you will watch the movie over and over) and the excellent supporting role (including Sparky!). <br /> <br /> Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar; Sometimes a movie is just fun. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
