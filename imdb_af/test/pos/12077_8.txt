I still worked with my parents when they broadcast it on Dutch TV. Usually I was the one watching movies with the other, not caring. But somehow we all sat down and watched this movie. This kind of movie was broadcast on Wednesday night. This is the story of a woman who will soon die. But before she dies, she wants to make sure that her (many) children will have the best possible foster parents. So we watched it and my dad (the most emotional of the four of us) started crying. I almost immediately followed and before long my sister and mother were also torn. There we were, completely moved by this simple but heartbreaking story. If you want a good cry, this is the one for you!
