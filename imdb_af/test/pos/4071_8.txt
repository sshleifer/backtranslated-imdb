If you saw the trailer for this movie, you know pretty much what to expect, because what you see here is what you get. And even if you haven't seen the previews, it won't take you long to pick up what you're involved with. Specifically, a good time and a lot of laughs - from this clever satire of "Reality TV" shows and "Buddy Cop" movies, "Showtime", led by Tom Dey, with Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. <br /> <br /> Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a detective with the LAPD, and he is good at what he does; But once a case, things suddenly go south, while another policeman, Trey Sellars (Murphy) accidentally intervenes, shows a television news crew and Mitch loses his cool, leading to a lawsuit by the television station that the cost will cost. department some big money. Besides being able to get there, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in Mitch - enough to make an idea for her for a "Reality" cop show "It won't own anyone but Mitch Preston, who sees Chase as a real-life" Dirty Harry ". <br /> <br /> Her boss loves the idea and gives Chase the green light. All she has to do now is to convince Mitch to take part, which should not be too difficult, as the station agreed to abandon the lawsuit if he did the show. But Mitch is a policeman, not an actor, and he doesn't want to do anything about it. That's until he has a heart-to-heart with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who puts Mitch's future in the hand. perspective for him. And just like that, the show is on. Oh yes, there is one more thing; Mitch will need a partner for the show. And who do you think will come for it? Let's say this: Trey Sellars is more than one of the common suspects. <br /> <br /> It's Dey's second film as a director, his first "Shanghai Noon" - also a comedy - and he is definitely a penchant for the genre. From the opening frames he sets a pace that moves the story across and makes his stars the best of their respective talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing. Of course, with stars like De Niro and Murphy, Dey had a leg on this project, but he is the one who keeps it on track and shows that he knows what works, just the right blend of physical comedy and action, and using the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect. <br /> <br /> There is no more natural actor in the business than De Niro, and he walks into Mitch's skin as he was born there. And after years of trouble he cut drama (in which he changed into one remarkable performance after another), with such films as "Analyze This," Meet the Parents "and now this one he firmly established his skill for doing comedy too Mitch is not a particularly complex character, he is actually something of a "normal" guy, but in it lies the challenge for the actor - to make him credible, to make him look like the man your neighbor and just another member of the community, and at all points De Niro succeeds Mitch, the man you enter into the grocery store or the bank, or say "good morning" on the way to work; love watching the game on TV and have a life, just like you and me, who make his life by being a policeman, this is the character Mitch has to be to make this movie work because it makes credible to the "ordinary man in extraordinary circumstances" - one of those roles - and work - it is often wrong lane out of hand, because it looks so easy; And of course, this makes De Niro so exceptional. He makes it easy, and he does it with the facility. <br /> <br /> As Trey Sellars becomes Eddie Murphy in a winning performance, like Well, it's a role that suits him like the proverbial glove. Trey is a police spokesperson, but also an aspiring actor - and a bad one - and gives Murphy the opportunity to play on the extreme side of his personality (ruled enough by Dey to make him rise best in the Jim Carrey area), which works perfectly for this character and this movie. Part of his melodramatic part takes part in an audition, and he throws out one-liners - delivered directly to the camera (as far as he is concerned is not there) while filming the "reality" show - Murphy is a riot. And he has a chemistry with De Niro who really clicks (which is not unexpected, as it is another of De Niro's talents, his ability to bring along the best in his fellow stars, all of whom - evidence will support - is better in their craft after working with him, including Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, just to name a few). Most importantly, this is a part that makes it possible for Murphy to do what he does best and to make the best of it. <br /> <br /> Russo makes the most of her role as Chase, also a character not much of a piece of art, but she is delighted to offer, with a strong credibility. And William Shatner (playing himself) steals a few plays as the director of the show. <br /> <br /> The supporting film includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday). Well-Manufactured and Delivered, 'Showtime' is a comedy that is exactly what it is meant to be: Pure entertainment that laughs a lot and offers a few hours that will make you hear a bit later. This is the magic of the movies. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
