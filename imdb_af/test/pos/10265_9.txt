It could not come from another country or from another time. This movie simply says psychedelia influences Italian theater late 1960s. So, pseudo serious and sexually free. Beautiful settings and dreamy music make it a visual and hearing delight. In addition, we get the beautiful Dagmar Lassander, surely on her very best. The kinky goings make a wild ride and if the skirts between the Mimosa seem to be the end, it is still a rather enchanting feature of the time. It is probably expected of you to divide between the screen and your girlfriend those few minutes, and that is, of course, a turning point in the proceedings. It would have been better if Philippe Leroy wasn't quite so strange with his red red hair and twisted facial expression. He does well and has very quiet moments where Dagmar cavorting and he has to show a mixture of love and hate. Not an ordinary movie in any way, but for those who like it, it's definitely it.
