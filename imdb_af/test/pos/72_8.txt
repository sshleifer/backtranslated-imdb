Even a bad July Andrews Musical is worth watching and it's not bad! In fact, it's quite entertaining. Actually, it's a fascinating study to try and manipulate a star's personae. <br /> <br /> To break Julie's "goody two shoes mold" she plays a German Spy / English Musical Hall Actress. She then made her in the film SO.B. and plays a dragon queen in Victor Victoria and others not so good girls usually under the direction of Blake Edward. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is problematic. It's hard to feel her character because she is a German Spy. We want to love Julie, but she's on the wrong side of the law. Probably, that's why this movie swelled. July as a German Spy? Our Mary Poppins? our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German spy? <br /> <br /> The romance looks overnight and comes from nowhere. But never mind, it's a musical and it has you. Oh, and did I mention that they're also Rock Hudson? <br /> <br /> July gives a wonderful wonderful show that any musical comedy buff may not miss. Great WW 1 Songs and beautiful songs by Mancini. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie has plot holes and sometimes it doesn't seem logical. For example, why was Julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the Germans as they spied them a moment ago. <br /> <br /> But on another note, who cares? The music numbers are fun and exciting. The costumes and scenery are extremely cute. The cinematography is pretty much about. <br /> <br /> It has the annoying idiot detectives who put Blake Edwards in all his movies. (Yawn) <br /> But it did July - desperately trying to change her image. (You can leave your dinner with Blake and July - July: "Blake we need to change my image." <br /> <br /> Blake: "I'll make you a German Spy, then we'll put your clothes in a others pack a movie and then play a transvestite in another movie, they will not recognize you, it will be the death of Maria Von Trapp. <br /> <br /> Fascinating study of changing an image. musical comedy buffs, much more entertaining than Star!
