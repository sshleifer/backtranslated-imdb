Almost certainly the best Three Stooges are short with Shemp, 'Brideless Groom', as good as any of the trio's best curly shorts. Memorable Stooge moments are in abundance. The opening with 'Professor' Shemp gives voice lessons to homely, undoubtedly and fickle girlfriends. Dinkelmeyer (Dee Green), who shakes her terrible song notes and beats her advances, is an excellent example of Shemp Howard's best. Many regarded him as the most obviously funny of the Stooges. <br /> <br /> Later, when Moe and Larry try to get a wife, he gets a wife (and about $ 500,000), Shemp thinks he cut off his head when his mirror is reversed . He fixed the mirror, he shouted with relief, "THERE I am ?? and pretty like a picture!" "Yes," Moe replied quickly, trying to smother his slacks, "from an APE!" The best scene (and perhaps Shemp's best with the trio) comes when he appeals to attractive young Miss Hopkins (Christine McIntyre). He misses a lost "Cousin Basil". She cuts and kisses him (which also leads to a hilarious bit between Moe and Larry in the hall), and doesn't give him the opportunity to explain his true identity. Suddenly the REAL Cousin calls Basil and she goes berserk, repeatedly beats him and accuses him of taking advantage of an arm? Helpless? Inferior woman! "This final line is delivered as she knocks in the jaw socks (with a real punch, according to Shemp and crew members), through the door and in the hall in a perfectly executed yawning. "What happened, kid?" Tired. "Can I help if I'm not Basil?" Shemp asks before he goes out. <br /> <br /> Other classic pieces include Moe and Shemp that are tied in a phone box, trying to get a lost coin. Larry is slapped because of Shemp's bad look (his face is pressed against the telephone stand glass), and the big girl fights in the apartment of Peace of Peace. The great Emil Sitka delivers his classic line (inscribed on his tombstone), "Keep hands, you love birds" over and over as his apartment is scrapped. <br /> <br /> I prescribe "Wedding Groom" as medicine for anyone who thinks the Stooges' glory years have ended when Curly Left. Certainly, Shemp does not have as many shorts in the group as curly, but it was due to an increasing lack of support from Columbia and its (and other's) progressing centuries. When Shemp was healthy and got the trio good stuff to work with, they were still on top of their game.
