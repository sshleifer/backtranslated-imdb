I think all the judges really caught this movie really well. I saw it a lot, many times, but I still feel a sense of joy and warmth, just as I did the first time. My emotional response to this movie never fades. The final scene definitely brings me to tears, but also the scene between Perks and The Children on his birthday. And as for the friendly gentleman. There's something wrong with that character. The generous provider and problem solver. He knows everything about everything and has connections everywhere. A perfect dad to run and make us feel safe. I don't know how the movie does it, but it deeply touches a lot of English, which has long gone from our daily experience, yet we all recognize and desire again immediately.
