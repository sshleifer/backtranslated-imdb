Oliver Stone is not one to get rid of a movie or theme. He is keen to confront people with their fears or to show their ugly faces in the mirror. Look at his CV as proof! This movie is no exception, but rather a jewel, which unfortunately has not seen much. <br /> <br /> Like contentious movies, it's one you need to be grateful for. A movie that should encourage you to think of you, the people next to you. The prejudices that exist and that all of us have some form. Whether we like to admit it or not, it's easier to categorize and be like "Oh he is" xyz ", yes, he must be so ...". Now I can read it too much, but I don't believe it. I believe Oliver Stone is a very intelligent filmmaker and that he was aimed at it. And if it's something you want to explore (as a movie or within yourself), then look at this movie and be excited!
