Wow! it was a good movie! I just got it from the u.s. And it was worth all the money I gave for it! This movie is one of the best movies for kids I've ever seen, maybe the best !!! everyone who loves rainbow british must see this one! The first 7 minutes, you can't believe what you see! It's so wonderful !!! <br /> <br /> scooter.
