TROMEO & JULIET - 10th Annual Edition <br /> <br /> William Shakespeare's play Romeo & Juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in movies. Sometimes the original text (sometimes sometimes vague in the direction of the stage) literally follows new interpretations where directors prefer to show their own views. Some are good, many are mediocre. Lloyd Kaufman's film definitely emerges as one of the most original, modern versions of the Bard's creation. It can be in a modern New York decay and full of modern-day anti-social behavior, body piercing, disassembly and kinky sex (which does not look for the more than casual reader Shakespeare himself), but at the same time remains incredibly close to the overall feeling and point of the play. It is quite an attempt. Kaufman wrote the script with his co-director James Gunn, who is now known to write two successful Scooby Doo movies. He does the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect movie with his screenplay for Dawn of the Dead and directing one of the best horror movies of the year: Slither. Lloyd Kaufmans' innovative view of law, along with James Gunn's original and unlimited writing, makes an interpretation of Shakespeare's play, which may not all get immediate, but will definitely be recognized by a unique and highly-regarded view of a classic play. With a script written entirely in iambic, the look of Motorhead's Lemmy and a vastly powerful soundtrack that Tromeo & Juliet looks at is something no one will ever forget. Apart from its historical significance, Tromeo and Juliet are a treasure trove of film lovers of all kinds. Not only for the screenplay by James Gunn, now a good influence on Hollywood while working from within, but also because it contains an early part of legendary actress Debbie Rochon. Familiar to all who are familiar with films made on lower budgets. The 10th anniversary edition on DVD adds that as many as undiscovered jewels are included, which not only offers all the information that one wants about the movie itself, and the experience to make it, in ways that make it impossible make to turn off The DVD, but also a very honest (and disturbing) look is given in the way independent theater today has to survive. In many ways, the extras on the disc are a valuable addition to the already impressive amount given at Kaufman's Make Your Own Damn Movie School. More historical items from the Troma cults, including James Gunn, Debbie Rochon and all other contributors to this masterpiece, are included. The movie itself, besides looking better than ever, is accompanied by no fewer than four sound comments, each and every one. Insightful, ominously funny and all for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and indifferent commentaries that are so common today. There are new commentaries (one with Kaufman and Gunn together), but also the one that James Gunn did for the original release of the DVD, but could not be included. There is some honesty that he shows about some other people, on this disk. With the fan recreation of some of the screens from the film, a video diary of Lloyd Kaufman's visit to James Gunn's Slither's visit and brought to the two brought to Eli Roth's Birthday Party and more , it is the ultimate set everyone should own. Again you are a film historian, someone interested in interpreting the great Bard's work, a fan of the big movie, an independent theater fighter, a fan of James Gunn, who is interested in learning more about the making movies on a low budget, a fan of Lloyd Kaufman or whatever: this is the most important DVD release of this millennium!
