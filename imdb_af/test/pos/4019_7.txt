Like the first film in this series (SLAUGHTER, 1972), I think it would be a mistake just to name this a blaxsploit movie. Certainly, Slaughter is a tough, gunfire, black man, but it is more of an action image, regardless of the color of the front man or the bad guys - and a very good action photo about it. <br /> <br /> For the second and last time, Jim Brown plays the title character. The movie starts with one of the goofiest scenes I can remember in a movie. While Slaughter and his friends enjoy an outdoor party, they come with a biplane and start the group with a machine gun! No, massacre is not so difficult that he fired with his .357 aircraft. But Slaughter is marked and nobody is sure why this hit happened - but Slaughter is coming to the bottom! Well, it seems the hit was in retaliation for the last movie. In it Slaughter takes the Mafia and kicks many bumps in Mexico. Now, in a terrified and awkward attempt, the guys in the plane kill and injure quite a few people, but miss Slaughter. And because the work has blown so heavily, the crowd (Ed MacMahon !!) recommends the pilot and armed man killed by his brutal killer (Don Stroud - in a very typical role for him). Stroud is wonderful and nasty to the core, but Ed MacMahon as the boss?! Wow, that's an interesting twist! <br /> <br /> Battle has now been knocked. He came out who was the two guys in the plane, but by the time he came to them, they were dead. So, to help him in his own private vendetta, Brock Peters (who plays a policeman) tells who the men have ordered the hit and Slaughter has to help to help by doing illegal shelter. So, Slaughter and his pimp friend break into the gang's house and steal a list of payoffs to key government and police officers. And of course there is a lot of shooting and bloodshed in the process. <br /> <br /> Stroud is not about to let pass away with this and kidnap Slaughter's girlfriend. Now it's an expectation - Slaughter has the list, but if he doesn't give it back, the woman is dead. To be a tough but brave man, you might just guess what happens next. <br /> <br /> The action is great in the movie and Jim Brown is threatening and difficult. The only negative I noticed was that MacMahon ultimately played this nasty boss, but he simply folded - and too fast. When Slaughter overtakes him, MacMahon becomes a wimp and all previous nastiness disappears - and it's too much of a clich√© and contradictory. Yet, despite this small problem, it is an entertaining movie that is NOT due to the children due to all the violence and boobs.
