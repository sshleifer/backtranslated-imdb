I finally saw the reason why Peter Boyle became known. It wasn't the monster in "Young Frankenstein" or terribly Frank Barone on "Everybody Loves Raymond". For younger people who just know him from TV, this movie makes an effort, it makes Frank look like a saint. <br /> <br /> "Joe" is Boyle's best role and, as someone has said, probably inspired "Archie Bunker" at "All In The Family". I think Boyle even went back to Joe, a little to play Frank. (I say this because I noticed that the basement of both Joe and Frank looks like Barone.) <br /> <br /> I didn't know anything about this movie when I checked it out of the library, but I just got Boyle and Susan knew. Sarandon was known. Yes, Susan looks good here and for a young actress is a very good early role. A young hippie wants to be, who escapes her parents home and lives together, the ultimate lost in a drug-induced dungeon, who also sells as much as he buys. <br /> <br /> After an almost fatal overdose On too many pills she is housed while her parents are going to collect her stuff, her mother is not going into the smelly apartment, but her dad is not. While Dad collects her stuff, her boyfriend comes home and the two swear words and then the father we'll hear later. Joe says he would like to do a hippie. Joe shoots his mouth as he hates different cultures / races, hippies and a laundry list from others. When he says, "I really want to kill one of them," the father (trying to look like he estimates) says, "I just did." Joe almost buys it but takes it so funny. <br /> <br /> Later, when the police are on the scene and the story is in the paper, Joe realizes he is not ashamed. Instead of nailing the rich man for money through extortion, he actually makes an extortion. By just getting to know him and his wife and his wife. Long story short, their association is uncomfortable, but after Sarandon gets wind of what her dad did, the bottom is in danger of falling out. <br /> <br /> In the end, watch it all. for yourself. Although it's over 35 years ago, the end is something you won't expect. Unless you've seen the movie before. Again, I usually recommend it to those who haven't seen it. <br /> <br /> 10 stars for Boyle not only plays someone completely beyond his nature, but for what others will show that he was more than just a TV and movie comedy actor. (END)
