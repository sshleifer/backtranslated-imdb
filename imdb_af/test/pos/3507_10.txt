"Just before dawn" is one of the best slasher movies. It is very realistic and atmospheric. It reminds me of Tobe Hooper's "The Texas chainsaw massacre" and "Deliverance". Deborah Benson plays very well the heroine and director Jeff Lieberman has created a lot. creepy and dark movie. "Just before dawn" is beautifully photographed and the soundtrack is very disturbing. I never <br /> <br /> liked slasher movies or gore except with this one. Very impressive and convincing movie (at least for me)
