A movie about the relationship between a man and a leopard reminiscent of 'The English Patient', even to a scene similar to the character of Ralph Fiennes' character about a desert rock cliff. In a passion in the desert, the main character carries the leopard's body over a desert cliff, but in the opposite direction (calculated decision or unconscious contrast?). Historically expanded from a very short Balzac story, the movie is not perfect, but a surprise no less. Final shot will haunt me for weeks. (8 out of 10)
