This is one of the best non-English ranges I've seen. It weaves interesting interesting and double episodes of crime solution along with a personal aspect that you just don't get in CSI. The individual characters all have personal lives that combine well with their day-to-day work and sometimes interfere. In addition, the characters can of course develop through the episodes. <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent and it is pasted all over the country in Denmark. It gives a great example of the highlights the majestic land offers. Unfortunately, only 32 episodes were made, but they are top-notch television. Here's the hope they are considering to make even more episodes of the same caliber.
