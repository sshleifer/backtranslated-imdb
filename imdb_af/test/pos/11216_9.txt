In this episode, Locke and Eko are looking for the "?" symbol we saw during the conclusion of a previous episode. Michael, who shot Ana Lucia and Libby, is struggling with his Libby thumbs up to death. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about this episode (I think). Is during the commercial break. Locke and Eko find a hatchery under the plane that killed Boone in season one, and a new training video ends with "Copyright, The Hanso Foundation, 1989". In a next commercial break, a bizarre and nondescript commercial "The Hanso Foundation" (a commercial commercial), and the advertised site (www.sublymonal.com), advertises the visitor through a world of information life on the outside of Lost's story. A must see for all fans!
