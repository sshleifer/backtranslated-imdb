I loved this movie, which I just saw at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In March 2005 I went to India with 2 friends, and this movie was really real. I have everything related and enjoy every moment. The characters are credible, the story sad and the ending realistic, but not sentimental. I also enjoyed the conversation with the director after the show. This movie shows very well the mixing, but not complete mixing of 2 worlds (East and West). The supporting role-play was wonderful and portrayed the life of a tourist meeting in India quite realistically. The humor is subtle, and sometimes dry, and it makes it more realistic, as it is woven into the daily escape of the characters. It is so easy to identify with each of the situations depicted.
