I can't comment on the accuracy of this production, either historically or literally, but I can say I enjoyed it. If there is a God, the soundtrack will be released, Ilona Sekacz's work is truly persistent. For twenty years I have been moved by the haunting themes of this production and regularly returned. <br /> <br /> The story surrounds access to Catherine Moreland's society. Something uncomfortable and possessing an unhealthy interest in gothic stories (early pulp fiction?), Catherine falls on Bath in the company of Mrs Allen where she meets Henry Tilney. She was invited to visit the Tilneys at Northanger Abbey, the seat of the formidable General Enney, who is facing financial challenge. The unfortunate misconception is that there is wealth. <br /> <br /> Where mutual attraction with family mix finance, dispute is inevitable. This, together with Catherine's lively imagination, leads her to fear for her safety. Her ultimate devastation is destroyed by accusations and accusations of deception and commitment. <br /> <br /> But the attraction between Catherine and Henry is these trials. He returns to give a happy ending. This last scene is especially compelling, given the random music of Ilona Sekacz. <br /> <br /> It may be a "bad" production of purist's point of view, gaudy costumes and shaky performances that don't resist, but for me it's 88 minutes of luck.
