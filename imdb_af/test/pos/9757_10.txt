I don't know where this movie was shot, but because it's shot in place, it has the authenticity that this story deserves. This is the story of a young English woman captured by Japanese in southern Asia at the beginning of World War II, with a group of other English women. There is no prison camp for women, so they are forced to go from place to place for months, because the Japanese don't know what to do with them. The courage and resilience of the English women, and the bravery of the Australian soldier trying to help them, are at the heart of the movie. This movie is very long, maybe 10 hours, so you can see it as shown on PBS, as a series that is actually the feeling of the endless journey this woman makes in England, over this remote island, and eventually Australia. Story, cinematography, location and actors combine to make it a movie not to miss. My only question is why it was not released on DVD!
