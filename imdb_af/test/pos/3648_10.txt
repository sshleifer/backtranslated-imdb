People who say some of what the Looney Tunes cartoons show are inappropriate because children apparently have forgotten something: they were not originally intended for children. They were made for the film, which should be shown in front of movies, and so they can show anything they wanted. "Tweety's S.O.S." got that bad puddy tat Sylvester to find Tweety aboard an oscillator and go to the ship to try and get him. But two things work against Sylvester: Grandma protects the canary vigorously, and Sylvester easily becomes seasick (we don't see him throwing it up, but with his green face it makes it very clear that he just did it!). And then, of course, the seemingly cute Tweety has a bad line. <br /> <br /> Seeing these cartoons was not scared to go out; Whatever they thought, they showed. We have to understand that cartoons are not always supposed to be cute entertainment for children. Really funny.
