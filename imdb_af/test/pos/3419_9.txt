Where these movies differ from the traditional Hollywood movie, it is a true depth of feelings. For example, in Europe we had years of war, and although one nation could never erase the other, the old enemies always remained side by side or with each other at the end of the conflict. In the US, the immigrant white population has wiped out the indigenous population to near extinction. the American citizen never had to live with his enemy. This explains to me the often simplified nature of Hollywood movie when they try to explain a foreign country's strife. But in this movie the director and script did not fall into this clich√©. It seems that everyone in the story is right and wrong. It is a good story of morality, hidden truth and compromise.
