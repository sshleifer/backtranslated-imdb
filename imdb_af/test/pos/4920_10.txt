When I first looked at the trailer, I had to decide if this series would be perfect for my collection. But after hearing that, I decided to buy it. When I bought the whole collection in a box, it was absolutely what I wanted to see. It was very funny, and the characters were pretty cool. Favorite characters in the show are: Marion, Carrot, Haze Knights, Big Momma and Dotta. I also liked the opening and ending theme songs. The show also has some good voice talents from Tiffany Grant, Jason Douglas, and others. But this show is one of the biggest. So if you want to see something cool. Then this show is the one.
