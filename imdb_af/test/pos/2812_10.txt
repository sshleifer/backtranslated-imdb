Gerald McRaney (Dave Morgan), 'War Crimes', '01 TV Series', was like a father of Tiffani Thiessen, (Jennifer Gallagher), a kiss before lies '03, experiencing a very bad situation in her life and that caused Jennifer to be withdrawn with people and young men. Dave Morgan is trying to get her out of the house and drives Jennifer to Chris (Gallagher) who falls in love with their first encounter. In almost one or two dates later, Chris asks Jennifer if she will marry him and she agrees. It's not long after the wedding that things start to happen, Chris is in the navy and doesn't like to work in submarines and things start with young gals nearby. It's a great TV movie and it sometimes makes you wonder if the guy or gal I want as a Soul Mate is the perfect PERSON!
