I am now exploring the so wonderful world of Monsieur Ozone. I have only seen 4 movies so far, and with the last one in the queue it struck me that they were all about lonely women and their actions. Not a single lonely female character from 12, and everybody has a severe environmental impact. <br /> <br /> This movie is probably the only one (out of four) where this impact is for good. </ br /> <br /> The gay theme is an almost standard part of the background for Ozone movies, so it doesn't grab the accent (though the characters may look). Look at the feelings, not their objects. <br /> <br /> Very nice and quick, really like a summer novel, and while having a mind-set of relaxation and mind, it costs the soul.
