Okay, I know it's clich√©. On its surface, it's a bad movie - maybe in a league with "Plan 9 From Outer Space". The dialogue is supposedly (but the Singlish is quite pleasant ...), the plot is not entirely credible, Gavin's character surpasses too much. While watching the movie, something really does happen to you ... Knocker and Kim embark on a tank, Gwen eats a banana in a bath, all that Gavin says and does ("psssssssssssssssycho !!") . These things that are taken separately may be mistakes. Together, however, they are actually. To watch this movie with an open mind (especially if you're not familiar with the Singapore culture) and with an open group of friends is guaranteed to deliver a lot of laughter and an unforgettable time. You can't go into this movie that expects a masterpiece, or even expects to take something serious. If you can use this movie for what it is - an underdog movie about underdogs, filled with its own wings on the edge - then you need a good time to watch this one! I've seen it three times and I won't hesitate to watch it yet three more !!
