Adapted from Sam Shepard's play, this movie retains many playful elements such as a relatively solid environment (a road motel 50 in the southwest) and extensive, intriguing dialogues. A woman "May" is beaten by a man "Eddie" (played by Sam Shepard). She tries to hide from him in the out-of-the-way motel, but he gets her. The film explores the history of their relationship, mainly from their childhood, which led them to this point. It is very easy to feel sympathy for the characters and to understand that their dysfunctional current relationship is a result of events beyond their control. We look especially at their fighting, making, fighting, making and so on. One image that stands out in my mind is that Eddie kicks over his shoulder and screams and fetches her somewhere. She didn't want to go. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is also a perfect soulful country with chorus by a lesser-known artist "Sandy Rogers". She puts this landmark stamp on some points just a few points in the album! This is the kind of movie that stays in a part of your brain / soul. In other words, see it!
