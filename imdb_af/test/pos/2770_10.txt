I'm absolutely disgusting this movie is not sold. Everyone who loves this movie needs to increase Disney email and demand for it. They will eventually have to sell it. I want to buy copies for everyone I know. Everything and everyone in this movie did a good job, and I didn't figure out why Disney didn't put this movie on DVD or on VHS in rental shops. At least I didn't see any copies. It's a bad good movie and must be seen by everyone. The kids in the new generation don't get it and I think they should. It must be brought back at least to the channel. This movie does not deserve a cheap download. It deserves the right thing. I email them now. This movie will be on DVD.
