This show is brilliantly hilarious! I started looking in 2007 and never heard of it. After an episode, I was addicted. I'm never at home to see it, so my wife bought me the whole series on DVD. Don't stop laughing, should I say more? I wish it was still on TV because it is definitely worthy and much better at the moment on TV. <br /> <br /> I wish they would make a movie, seriously, who wouldn't see it. Kevin James's name alone will bring a big fan base for any movie, the guy is (hurting your stomach) funny. <br /> <br /> Just a very good, earthly, credible show. If you have the chance to buy it on DVD, do it, it's worth it.
