Excellent story, wonderful acting, amazing production values ​​and a cool, action packed short with a perfect twist to the end. What a great short movie! <br /> <br /> I watched this movie in Vail or Aspen at a film festival and used to it. Then I saw it again at another festival (where it won again) and I was even more impressed because subtle touch became visible the second time. For a short movie, it takes a lot of clever work in a short time. <Br /> <br /> AWOL is not for the most beautiful of the heart, but it is very well done and quite impressive for a short movie - for any movie actually. This is an interesting story that is very well-interpreted, and every scene moves the story, revealing that good film-making instincts have been made in this film. The movie looks beautiful and David Morse is also stunning, with a dynamic performance delivered in every scene. Looking at his character attempt to defeat the curves is throwing him, a good performance experience. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that when war cages are in the news every day, the lines between reality, good and evil can become very gray while the rhetoric gets tough and attempts to black and white things. make. AWOL allows the audience to decide for themselves what the message is, what is real and what not, which adds the riddle. <br /> <br /> Both times I saw it, the audience was WAY more in this movie than the others playing it, many saying. There are many shorts out there, but few deliver the all sorts of excellence and complexity that AWOL does. <br /> <br /> It sounds to me that the previous reviewer is his or her rocker, or has a personal agenda, because it's really a good example of short independent movies. I see quite a few short films, and I have to say if only ALL the shorts that make the festival round were so good, then the shorts business would have serious legs.
