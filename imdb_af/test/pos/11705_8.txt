This is the first feature film of Australian comedian Mick Molloy. Mick wrote the film with his brother Richard with the help of John Clarke, another comedian and actor. Mick & John also play roles with several other iconic Australian actors - Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson et al. The basic premise of the movie is that slimy Jack Simpson (Mick Molloy) joined a Lawn Bowls Club for the sole purpose of getting a free parking near his work. The club is in financial trouble and calls on Jack to help. John Clarke plays the clubs bow nemesis - he tries to take over the club and turns it into a "Poker Machine Slum" Jack and the other members of the club to try and save the club with very funny twists and turns and Jack's ultimate redemption. . It's quite a clever movie. It is good above Mick Molloy's usual gutter humor. It was written fairly well and performed well. The older Aussie actors are brilliant (Bill Hunter, Frank Wilson Monica Maughan and Ors). The movie goes along and rather fits into the neck, but it adds to the charm of the movie. There is low level coarse language.
