From late Sydney Pollack comes a great love story about human nature, pain, passion and betrayal. Police Sergeant, Dutch Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford), was devastated when he found out that his beloved wife was killed in a plane crash. He is even more upset about her relationship with the husband of a well-known congresswoman Kay Chandler (Kristen Scott Thomas). He arranged to meet her and see if she knew if he had no idea. They start to befriend each other, then from their mutual pain and anxiety begins an intense affair (which can be healed for both of them). Do memories of the dead and squeeze out of their various jobs drive them apart and cause more damage than good or can they escape the past? Well, you'll have to look at Random Hearts and find out. A moving and well-educated film with a good role.
