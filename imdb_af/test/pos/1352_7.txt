Burt Kennedy both wrote and arranged this Western, from a novel. Kennedy was a well-known author and director, mostly western. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum was a star when he made it for over 20 years. This role was as much as he has already done. One can see why he has been a great star for so many years. <br /> <br /> He easily filled this role like a well-used glove. <br /> <br /> The title character is played by Robert Walker Jr. (his father, a good actor Robert Walker, died tragically at the age of 32 - his mother is known as actress Jennifer Jones). <br /> <br /> Robert was light-skinned and even made talent just a few movies. (he was in Rita Hayworth's closest movie. <br /> <br /> ROAD TO SALINAS --- the same year and was very good). <br /> <br /> He looked much like his dad, but lacked his fathers charm. He made only a few more movies. He still lives and I wish him well. <br /> <br /> Most of his scenes are with another Hollywood-sized boy. John Carradine's son, David, still making movies. they made a nice team. <br /> <br /> In westerners you always have a female character and usually she is a dance room. (Today they call their hookers), Angie Dickinson tests this role nicely. There are also western stalwarts, John Anderson & Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> It was movie in Old Tucson) outside the center of Tucaon Az. & the scenery is beautiful. <br /> <br /> Typical of the older Western, there is not too much action, there is some good humor and the usual end is out. <br /> <br /> It's a quick enjoyable 89 minutes. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 10) 84 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
