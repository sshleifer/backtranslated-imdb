this episode is not coherent as another person has said. the source agreed to help because he did not want to keep his word, if you pay attention ... he says after she (phoebe) agreed to stay there in hell, "CALLED BY HER AND BALDAZOR SO I HAVE NOT TO REJECT IN THE FUTURE "... and, too, he did not wait the sisters like PHOEBE in the exchange rate of accepting the act. Therefore, they have the reason why, because they were heavier than PIPER and on the head, and there was no PHOEBE to call LEO this time, and in the past Leo said she had killed her immediately. Give more attention next time! and there is no "CONTINUED ..." after this episode. This is the end of season 3, and on season 4 they can show nothing of PRUE because she owns the rights to "PRUE", so the producers will have to pay her for whatever they show. it's the last episode she's in!
