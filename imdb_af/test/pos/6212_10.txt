Supercarrier was my favorite movie in the late 80's when it came out. My Dad packed it to me and I watched it all the time until my stepmother Oprah bound it and my heart was torn. I would like to know if or where I can get it from. I searched for it. I believe they even came out with a Supercarrier 2. It wasn't as big as the 1st, but I want them all if I could get them. I don't think it's all a bad movie. It was a very interesting movie with lots of action, but it has a bit of a love story plot. The actors / actresses in the movie were wonderful. It also helped me understand that it is not just a man's world, but it is also a woman's world and many women can do the same if it is no longer a man can do and women also deserve a lot of respect for their duties.
