One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world would end on December 31, 1999 at the end of the night. In "The Book Of Life," author / director, Hal Hartley looks at the possible consequences of a new millennium Armageddon, beginning with the return of Jesus to Earth on New Year's Eve ,? 99. The story explores the task of the Son of God who must open the remaining three of the seven seals in the Book of Life (currently found in a Mac laptop), in which there are also the names of the hundred and four. and forty thousand good souls saved on the last day. Jesus (Martin Donovan), along with Magdalena (P.J. Harvey), arrives in New York City to make the preparations needed to fulfill his Father's will, but he begins second thoughts; shall he judge the living and the dead? Do they earn what they have to overcome? It is a cup he prefers not to embrace at this moment, which encourages Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan), who fears that the fruit of all his hard work will be taken away at midnight, because he can only do his work so long. as there are people who cling to their zealous hope and dreams. Hartley presents an artistic, high concept film in an intelligent, mind-boggling way. He takes great care in handling the sensitive subject so that it even makes it unsatisfactory to the most ardent fundamentalist. The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is intriguing and stimulating, as well as the effect of their presence on those they experience during their physical stay in the city. It is an impressive meditation on the spiritual side of man's fragile existence and a contemplation of what was prophesied in the Revelation of St. John in the Apocalypse, the last book of the New Testament. And there is logic in Hartley's approach to the Second Coming; He maintains the aesthetics of the contemporary environment, while making use of changing film speeds that visually visualize the film. Christ carries unobtrusively a suit and tie, effectively interferes with the population, while Satan's clothes are a little more coincidental, his appearance somewhat slim; he plays a bruise above his left eye. Donovan is well-cast as Jesus, lends a benevolence and a sense of embedded urgency to his character who is very effective. This is, of course, a unique portrayal of the Savior, and possibly the best since Max von Sydow in "The Greatest Story Ever Told". He successfully brings a sense of inner peace and tranquility, of calm, which is at the heart of the character of the character. And Ryan is thoroughly engaging his role of the prince of darkness. he has a clear way of speech and a resonant quality to his voice which makes him absolutely fascinating to watch. His eyes are urgently penetrating, a feature that he effectively uses with furtive tins and captivating stare. He is the man who can sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you ever know what hits you. It is an unforgettable performance that contrasts so well with Donovan's depiction of Jesus. The supporting film includes Martin Pfeffercorn (Martyr), Miho Nikaido (Edie), Dave Simonds (Dave), D.J. Mendel (Attorney), James Urbaniak (True Believer), Katreen Hardt (Advocate Assistant) and Anna Kohler (Hotel Clerk). Hartley, in his own indifferent style, has made the Book of Life a perspective of the last days that is interesting, entertaining and truly unique. He has a way to capture life, because it's just out of the middle, a method that works especially well with a movie like this. Compared to a feature film (63 minute run time), it is one of Hartley's best, and more than the admission fee. It's a movie that stays with you and maybe reminds you of things you might have hidden in a corner of your mind later. And this is part of the appeal of this film; It makes you realize that "later" is probably now. I rate this one 9/10.
