David Attenborough brings his fascination with wild life, this time the creatures under the sea, in this extraordinary 8 episode journey to all the animals under the sea! <br /> <br /> The cinematography is amazing, which really comes on the screen with awesome footage of those whales! But the best thing about it, as well as seeing every episode is how they made it! Whether it be creatures of the creatures or the impressive shots of the whales, they explain to you in about 10 minutes how they did it! <br /> <br /> 2001 has some great TV shows for our screen. But unlike this documentary gemstone, they make them pretty lame! But to boast even this documentary series because the best TV series of 2001 just doesn't sum up the brilliant luster that this series offers in quality! <br /> Overall, this is the best TV show of 2001, with no competition, and perhaps the best TV series of 2000's!
