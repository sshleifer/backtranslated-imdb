This is the kind of movie I grew up with. It's fun family fun, which the kids love and the parents also enjoy. I wish more movies like this were made. It's a great story about a little boy who is setting up a Bull with his mother and sister, and showing it to the national big championship, where he wins! Then he feared someone was going to fry his bull, and he kidnapped it and headed home. I was very excited when I saw the movie in the theater and was amazed to see George Strait, Julia Roberts and Bruce Willis in this picture. The music was great with all sorts of big names such as Willie Nelson and the Dixie Chicks. Anyone who does not enjoy this movie has no children or was never a child himself.
