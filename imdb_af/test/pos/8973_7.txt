Well, we definitely saw and I and many other people actually expected me to be worse. It also had some good parts I didn't expect, but still failed in other areas. <br /> <br /> First, the play was above average. I love Phillip Seymour Hoffman in this movie and I liked Tom Hanks. Hoffman was the glue for this movie. If it wasn't for him, this movie would have crumbled and hit the rocky bar. His performance was by no means beautiful, but absolutely essential. He gave a good, witty, cynical performance in what most other actors could easily make his character in a clich√©. Tom Hanks really did a good loose performance and didn't disappoint, but he certainly didn't impress. What I couldn't stand was that Julia Roberts was involved in this movie. She was as big of a miscarriage as I have ever seen. For one she is a bad actress, at least for me, she was too young for her character and was even cheated for the character she played. <br /> <br /> Directing was average for me. I'm not really a big fan of recent Mike Nichols movies and I'm not exactly impressed with this one either. It's made with such a Hollywood, cartoon-like hat I couldn't stand. The worst part was that he was trying to be a very significant movie. I like meaningful movies, but not when a movie tries to get a scene or two out and shows something that justifies the rest of the garbage distribution throughout the movie. This is something Mike Nichols did in his recent track record. <br /> <br /> The one impressive part of this movie was the writing. The dialogue was very well-constructed and could play the story. The writing was really capable of taking this movie to an above average level. In so many scenes I learned to share the writing. <br /> <br /> Well, that's what we at least saw. Much of the scenery was good in the movie if you get what I mean, but not much else. I thought this movie did not glorify everything America did. Clearly, throughout the war in Afghanistan, the US has given weapons to those who are now against us. This movie kind of show we are to blame for. This indicates that what looks good in the short term might be something terrible in the future. This movie had a good original message, but it didn't fix it. Overall, it was entertaining.
