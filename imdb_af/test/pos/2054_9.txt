I've never heard of this movie until it appeared on cable television and I can't understand why. Geena leaves Arnold as an action hero in this movie! Geena is a former CIA assassin who is brainwashed and given an identity as a quiet family teacher in a rural village. She stays with a man and daughter for 8 years. Clues come to her, that she may have been someone else, especially if someone tries to kill her. Her previous employers seem to have discovered she's never been dead and wants to make sure she does. She hires Samuel L. Jackson, a former police officer. Together they form a few that are as entertaining as Mel Gibson & Danny Glover. When Geena finally regains her memory, she undergoes a transformation in the murder machine she plays with the song "She's Not There" in the background. What follows is Geena and Samuel must go to the bad guys and hopefully stay alive. Through the rest of the film, Geena has to decide who she really is. Kill accident machine? The mother / teacher with quiet family life? Or a combination of both? Especially since the bad guys grabbed Geena's daughter. Great action scenes that come up with any of the Die Hard movies!
