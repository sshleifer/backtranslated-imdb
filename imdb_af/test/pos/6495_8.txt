What do you mean as son of actor, not an actor. You don't become an actor just because your dad is a superstar --- it doesn't work like that, not in the UK. <br /> <br /> Macbeth (this version) is a low budget Scotland movie. You can't compare it to the Polanski version, because Polanski has all the budgets in the world. <br /> <br /> Jason did the whole school, but his big break came in 1985 when he landed Robin Hood's role in Britain's TV series Robin or Sherwood. He has since appeared in many films, including "Shanghai Noon" and "Lord of the Rings 2". Jason has since moved behind the camera and formed the production company Unconditional Entertainment. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ray Winstone. <br /> <br /> And all this has nothing to do with being Sean Connery. If you think Jason told Sean, "Daddy, I want to be in Macbeth movie they're going to film," and Sean said, "sure, boy, whatever you said", and made a call and his son got the role, you're mistaken. In fact, Jason Connery is cut out of his father's will. Seeing how his father is Sean Connery, that's a big part of the change. Jason will come out. The reasoning behind the decision is apparently Sean's strong feelings that his only son must learn to provide for himself. The relationship became quite tense, with Jason even threatened to change his name. <br /> <br /> --------------------- --------------- To the son of Sean Connery <br /> <br /> "I realize I will always be comparing to my dad. There is always something inside. Must I justify my whole life?" ------------- ----------------------- <br /> <br /> Stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being able to act. just because he's son of Sean Connery. (Big deal!). <br /> <br /> See Jason in Bullet to Beijing and you will have a different opinion on his acting ability.
