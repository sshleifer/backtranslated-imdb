I watched the movie while I was back in high school for a few years. I thought it was a thought-producing movie that made you look at the power behind the puzzles. I think the type of people who don't want this movie are those who don't like solving things, or those who get frustrated if they can't solve puzzles. It's a good movie, based on a true story that happened in my hometown of Toronto, Ontario. so if you want a real record of the things happening in the tracks, watch this movie. And for those who just watch movies to show plot holes and character bugs, it realizes in real life, the same thing happens. but that's all I want to say about it. The puzzles are good, some are hard, some are not. But the movie also gives you more, more puzzles, more explanation, just plain, more. Something I still want to add is that the ideas in this movie, the underground mystery world, exist, but there is much more to it. To find it, you can't look for it. To never look for it would be no way to find it. Leave your point and it will get you.
