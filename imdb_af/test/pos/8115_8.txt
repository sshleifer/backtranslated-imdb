I loved this movie! It was pleasantly touched and funny. Finally, here is a story about a group of people who are facing challenges, a bit of a fool and decide to just be themselves and finally be happy; when was the last time you saw it in a movie? Dealing with the fluidity of life, love and sexuality, the characters are confronted with real problems (though they are often ridiculous situations such as men's room tourism and the explicit realizing link) and succeed in learning and growing without the film being precarious. become dark desperate, or too unrealistic. You will love and care for the characters who, far from hollow stereotypes, portray real people with just a touch of the truth behind their popular labels. <br /> <br /> A great room for a Saturday afternoon, and the only movie I've ever seen where sexual fluidity ends happily, and no one is forced to be something they don't want. Much better than Kissing Jessica Stein, a good choice if you are tired of watching gay movies that have painful lessons and bitter lessons. Or, maybe you're just like a good British skirt? James Purefoy looks the same, and Tom Hollander is funny. So go out, look, enjoy; You won't regret it!
