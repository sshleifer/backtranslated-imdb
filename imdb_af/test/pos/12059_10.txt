For a long time I didn't see this funny of a show on the fox, and the wait was worth it. The kids in the show have something I can handle on every episode, and even my dad will sit and watch. It's a show for all ages that don't dumb for kids. It's like standing still, but to the next level. The things everyone says are things everyone says and actions everyone does. It says things we all think, but in a well-rounded way of presentation. The first time I saw the show, I couldn't believe it was on the jackals and that it could stay on the air after a few episodes. From Hilary's boyfriend choices to Kenny's boyfriends choice, it's worth the watch.
