This is an excellent movie and is immediately placed in my top ten (trust me I know movies!). This is one of the movies that really makes you think, not necessarily about the storyline, but about yourself! The film is about a fifteen-year-old child (Leland Fitzgerald) who kills an autistic boy. He is sent to the youth hall where he meets with his teacher Pearl Madison. His relationship with Pearl slowly grows, and finally, Pearl decides to write a story about Leland and his peers, but if he gets closer to finding out Leland's motive, he learns he has to deal with his own problems first. <br /> <br /> It's a fantastic movie and a must see with beautiful music and a fantastic score! Beware!
