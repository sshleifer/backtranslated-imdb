The plot is getting interesting, but by the end there is too little death in a short time, bringing the frightening aspect of the story to a halt. <br /> <br /> The only real highlights were Adam Beach and JÃ¼rgen Prochnow, who were once again their very own. Nice is trying with an inappropriate third, although it's a good ending.
