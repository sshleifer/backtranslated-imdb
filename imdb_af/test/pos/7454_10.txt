"Duckman" is a good show. I only saw it when I was 10 years old and after school I went home and switched on Comedy Central. I saw a cartoon called "Duckman" and I love it. It's such a funny and cool show. It was created by Klasky-Csupo, who are wonderful creators of cartoons. They animated some of my favorite programs, such as The Simpsons and Rugrats. <br /> <br /> I've seen many episodes of this show and I think they're all really funny and sweet. <br /> <br /> I wish the Comedy Central could bring this show back, along with "The Critic" and "Dilbert". <br /> <br /> But it's a great Comedy Central show. Great work, Klasky-Csupo!
