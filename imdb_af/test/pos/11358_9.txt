Excellent and beautiful. Justin Henry is beautiful as a happy and ominous Howard Kaylan, lead singer of the top ten hit, The Turtles. The true magic is the titular sequence with an academically worthy turn by Royale Watkins. A display that completely captures the mystical and to earth Jimi Hendrix. Not many movies, amazingly, can find the essence of a special moment in life and times. I would like to see it at any home video store sales, without any hassle. Uh .. what is the deal? <br /> <br /> Thank you Eddie. A valuable addition to the history of the psychedelic sixties. A certain twist in the mind's eye.
