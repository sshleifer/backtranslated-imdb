My original title for this review was: "Finish disappointing, Film triumph." But I actually thought about this one on the way home. It's not the fairy tale. Most of these films are making turns that are different and while the end is disappointing, it slows down slowly and hits the core satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a man named James Aaron (highlights Your Enthusiasm's Jeff Garlin, who is also a struggling actor who lives in Chicago with his mother and deals with both his obesity and his inability to love, write and manage. <br /> <br /> Yes, it sounds corny, but it is experimenting with elements that make it slightly unpredictable, and actually makes you wish it was longer. said me, "that's it!" But as soon as it starts tolling, it really makes you enjoy. <br /> <br /> It has lots of tons of gravity right through, but not because it's also very funny. offers great laughter, and those who have seen Jeff Garlin's uprising will recognize a few (especially when he gives a career day speech to his cousin's toddler class and bombs), starting at a bit of a serious note what you do not expect, but what follows is very funny, entertaining, and very enjoyable, this is the kind of movie you keep watching and always enjoying. And, as I said earlier, while the end only seems absurd at first, it is a real joy when you first consider time.
