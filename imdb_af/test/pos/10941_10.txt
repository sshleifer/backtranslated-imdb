The Twins Effect - Chinese Action / Comedy - (Charlene Choi, Gillian Chung) <br /> <br /> This vampire action comedy is one of my favorites for being thoroughly entertained throughout the movie. First, the characters are unforgettable, which contributed a multitude of classic scenes. Charlene and Gillian are of course cute, charismatic and humorous. This movie was my first exposure to them and all I wanted to do was to reach my TV screen and give them a LARGE BACK. The remaining role players performed well in their supporting roles, including Jackie Chan, Karen Mok, The Duke, Josie Ho, Edison Chen, Anthony Wong, and the vampire bad guys (one of whom is honestly known by Will Ferrell). Even the horrible terrible Ekin Cheng was good at this one. Good characters are of course important because they avoid the feeling of boredom by keeping things interesting between action sequences. <br /> <br /> Talking about action, this movie has a lot of it. More importantly, there is an emphasis on quality in the battle choreography. One aspect that is helped in this regard is the leading weapon of the protagonist ?? a sword with a retractable spear rope. This weapon, by itself, has opened a variety of movements that would otherwise be impossible. Josie Ho and Gillian Chung, in particular, perform some vicious air movements through these devices. <br /> <br /> In addition, the swordplay is excellent and is highlighted by two major sword battles ?? one that takes place during the opening station sequence and the other in the church final. In fact, the blade maneuvers featured in this film made some other highly-over-rated fan favorite shame and I really feel sorry for those who have the horrible choreographic rubbish in Ashes of Time, Storm Riders or a Man called. Held with the well-planned, precisely executed rows seen in The Twins Effect. It's not even close. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why this film gets so much criticism. I'm sure the hard apologists for the Hong Kong Golden Age will hate it because it doesn't fit in with their meticulous view of what Hong Kong action should be. We must learn from the downfall of John Woo - a once-off pony that never learned to rediscover itself. We don't need another clone. We need something else. The Twins Effect is a good example. <br /> <br /> This movie was so good that it was really disappointing with other Chinese movies with the same actors and actresses. This is especially true for Ekin Cheng, whose other films almost always suck? and yes, it includes the obsessively overstated and exploitative wuxia crap mentioned in the previous paragraph. Even the twins have never been able to match the value of this movie, when both actresses were in a movie, though they managed to hit good movies when one or the other starred (eg Beyond Our Ken, Good Times Bed Times, House of Fury or when one or both support roles (eg, Color of Truth, New Police Story, Just One Look). The Twins Effect 2 had to be a direct successor, instead of a family fantasy. I still crave Charlene and Gillian's team and kick another butt in another movie, but the fact that the Twins effect hits all cylinders is optimizing their charisma while avoiding a decline in annoyance (such as in Protégé de la Rose Noire). <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie has everything you need to entertain. And may I remind the reader that this is just that? DISCOVERY ?? judging the greatness of a movie, more than dramatic dramatic elements or meaningless awards from established academics of critics who usually have no idea what they are talking about. <br /> <br /> In the end, the Twins effect a CLASS should not be missed. <br /> <br /> Rating = 5/5 stars <br /> <br /> PS ?? The Hollywood executives have decided to kill this movie when released in the US by calling The Vampire Effect and depicting 20 minutes, including parts of the action scenes. The final battle of the American version, however, has a better soundtrack than the original version. That's why I bought both versions, so I can watch the original at the 1: 20 mark, and then exchange slides to watch the final battle on the American version.
