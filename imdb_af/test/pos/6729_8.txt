I remember remembering it as a child as part of the Children's Film Foundations Friday film offerings on CBBC and recently happened on a copy. <br /> <br /> In the twenty years since my last show, this movie has lost nothing. <br /> <br /> It is an atmospheric story that focuses on the Cornish folklore and adds elements of a truly scary image of the ghost of the young miner Billy. <br /> <br /> Shooting in the stunningly picturesque Port Loe area of ​​Cornwall makes the film use the blend of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the area truly credible. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of stuff in this CFF drama, something that has been lost from Children's television today and it is worth finding a copy.
