Note: After writing this review, I see that this presentation is about the TV series and not the original movie. My mistake. I thought IMDb for a movie database, not TV programs. But since most people will look up this movie under BAGD CA CAFE and not OUT OF ROSENHEIM, which is oddly the name this movie is listed under IMDb. I'll leave this comment here. <br /> <br /> Maybe I missed something, but when I read the other review, it was quite a review of the CBS series - which had to be loosely based on this movie. I didn't see the TV series, and I like it or not, but one thing I'm sure is that it is very different from that movie. This film is not like a TV show at all, and Whoopie Goldberg is not in it or any other famous Hollywood star (except Jack Palance, who was very charming in his role). <br /> <br /> It's a terribly sweet movie that totally thinks "out of the box." It's not like a Hollywood formula movie, which is probably the (what is a good word for idiots?) Who decides to sell movies or not decide not to market this one. First of all, this movie caught my heart and imagination from the cry. Of the music (which is just a part of the time, you can't really call it) to cinematography to the really cool story. <br /> <br /> A German or Bavarian woman (very nice and pretty plump) comes in an argument with the other German or Bavarian man with whom she travels through the California desert, and shares ways with him - He took off in the car and left herself on a deserted and desert-like highway in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> She finds the small and lost but charming Baghdad Cafe, in Baghdad, California and check in. The rest of the story is magic. I don't want to describe this movie because I want you to enjoy every surprise. <br /> <br /> Warning: If you are a racist or have something against big women, you will not like this movie because the main romantic lead is a great woman and characters of brown and red skin. roles and are included as part of the mix without any racism involved. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 10 for originality, entertainment and pure delight.
