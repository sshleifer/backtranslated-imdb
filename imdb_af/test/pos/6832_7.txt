I have this movie from eBay mainly because I am gay and I love Til Schweiger. However, this is one of those movies you never see for a second time, you never tell yourself. "Hmm. I forgot about this boring part. I'm going to make popcorn." It doesn't have that part. It's a very fluid and constantly interesting film. And yes, Til Schweiger is worth it, as nothing else. But it's a good movie even for straight guys.
