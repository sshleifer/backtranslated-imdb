Film noir meets anime ... brilliant! It was one of the highlights of the surprisingly creative Animatrix shorts. It was one of my favorites, if not my favorite (I also loved the world record). It's basically a reference to the classic movie noir detective stories and movies of the 40's, except it is animated and entails the Matrix. But by being animated, it is able to take the extreme camera angles, the detective style, the shadows and everything film noir to a whole new level. The Femme Fatale? Trinity. The detective in this story seems to live in his mind in the 40's, but in a modern world, and everything becomes too much for him if his case suddenly involves science fiction and agents as a mysterious woman in black walks in his office. . <br /> <br /> My grade: 9/10
