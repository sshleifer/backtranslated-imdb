Okay. Here's the thing. I've read through the comments of other viewers --- a bit of the movie and some say it's the funniest, darkest, blackest comedy ever made. Whiffs of Tarantino, etc. Well, not exactly. But guess what? It's still a pleasant and finally funny movie. Not brilliant, not trash. Liv Tyler gives a good performance and you can absolutely not take her eyes off her. She is a woman with very strong decorating ideas ... Matt Dillon, a very underrated and under-used actor, is wonderful, as always. He always manages to combat that delicate line between scab and soul, and he beautifully pulls off the comedy. Ditto John Goodman (although the religious overtones, probably funny in writing, doesn't really work). Paul Reiser is very good --- definitely better than he was on TV. <br /> <br /> The usually unbearable Michael Douglas is really big in this role. As for his cof, well, see the movie. Between this and "Wonder Boys", you are actually reminded of the fact that Douglas can act. The movie will make you laugh in parts. Okay, not actually stomach-laughing, but definitely in the common-common-I-very-amused category. If you hire this expect to see another "Pulp Fiction", forget about it. But if you want something so hip and kinda, it's a damn good choice.
