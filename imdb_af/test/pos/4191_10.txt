This all-but-ignored masterpiece is about the Monkeys who are aware that their fictional characters are in a movie (Head), and that everything they do or say is already written in an (invisible) script, it seems to be. follow. Headed by Jack Nicholson, Rafelson and Peter Tork during a three-day LSD trip in a suite at an expensive Hollywood hotel. The other three Monkeys only dealt with it. <br /> <br /> They fight it every way possible by doing things that aren't in writing. They throw their lips deliberately, step down, set up landscape, tear other actors for no reason; and finally committing suicide by jumping a bridge. <br /> <br /> For example, in the quick flashes of a psychedelic fairy tale, you see Rafelson next to the camera and cameraman, who deliberately shoot in a mirror. He reveals that the party is actually fake and is shot in a studio with actors suddenly falling out of character and running away in the middle of a conversation when the director shouts "cut!" <br /> <br /> However, the Monkeys never fall out of character, because those characters are also who they really are. It eventually becomes the core of the revelation. <br /> <br /> At every turn they realize that their increasingly bizarre actions were exactly what they had to do in the written movie, they couldn't escape You say they went crazy and ran through the air (which seems to be painted on paper and hanging from the ceiling as the backdrop of the set)? No problem! Hey, hey, they're the Monkeys, and those crazy guys just keep it around! <br /> <br /> In the end, even their deaths did not release them. That's how the movie had to end and their motionless, waterless bodies were caught out of the river, placed in another box and stacked in a movie studio warehouse until the characters needed another studio production. <br /> <br /> The fact that the Monkeys are really fictional characters who have forced themselves into the real world is increasingly provoking. They did it through the power of their music. <br /> <br /> Ironically, Peter Tork has seen ironically what he rightly regards as an extremely deep revelation that solves their problem, but unfortunately nobody listens. <br /> <br /> Peter realizes: "This is not when we are in the box (the movie)". He means that it doesn't matter if the will is free or unclear, and that "the only important thing is that you just let the present moment happen and occur. You just" HAPPEN "as it happens" without analyze or evaluate or judge whether the experience contains a particular abstract definition. <br /> <br /> If you can't even tell the difference, be free or not, no matter - bind to find out if you're the "right", you're just a useless waste of time. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie at a very important time in my life. I tried to figure out how to escape just being "that geeky, creepy nerd girl" by thinking it intense rather than just having fun (ie gender) as everyone else did. But the revelation in Head broke my self-imposed recursive trap and helped me more than Rafelson or Nicholson or Tork ever knew. <br /> <br /> For decades I watched 'Head' and I wanted to thank Pete. <br /> <br /> Was this a good movie? <br /> <br /> Uhh, how are you, like ... <br /> <br /> == <YES> ==
