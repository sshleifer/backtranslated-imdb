I blame myself for the birth of a nation - for the beginning of the long-standing tradition of Hollywood travesties of history, of which there are few examples. Aside from the names of Custer and his 7th Cavalry, Crazy Horse and the Sioux and President Grant, the geography has been correct and the fact that Custer and his men have indeed been wiped out, just need hyperbolas and invention to ridicule limits. Throw in a few straightforward scenes of the purest exposition (try Custer and his wife's teachings of the false "Gold Rush" to excuse the invasion of the Sioux territory, Custer's testimony to Congress rights of the Red Indians claim it's all, Custer's storm in the president's office to beg to return to his post, frankly there are many of the same, some of these scenes are almost comical in their wheat. And yet it is still a big deal with Flynn, as ever, DeHavilland, as ever, young Anthony Quinn started out as Crazy Horse and director Walsh as a gunfire as ever in his portrayal of scarves and, of course, the turbulent action sequences. Ford taught us in "Liberty Valance" to believe the legend before the truth. Here I think we are closer to the legend of the legend, but hey, it's just a movie and a nice, enjoyable, classic Hollywood movie!
