Nice description of the situation in the US, it explains different kinds of Islam, not just terrorists and extremists. Islam can be other things that kill, they show why some people become terrorists and how to be Muslim without being extremist. This is a huge series that Muslims and non-Muslims need to see. Now we hope that other series or films will be made to change the idea of ​​all Muslims, terrorists and all Americans want to destroy Islam. It has given me the importance of discovering exactly what Islam is and what the US and the European government are doing to help society between people of different religions.
