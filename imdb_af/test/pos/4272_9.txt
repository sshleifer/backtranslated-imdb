Great show! Over time, a reality TV show comes together that closes gender gaps. Participants vary from time to time, some seem old enough to watch the movie when it first came out. And others looked so young that maybe parents or teachers handed the movie and hoped it would touch their lives as it touched them once. Grease has really become an American icon. Lubricating is a fun and entertaining movie in which young and old can relate. "You're the one we want" is sure to get even more fat followers. The only thing I wish for was more of the character history, and then it is nice to leave the nostalgic imagination of the 50's. Can't wait to watch the next show ... and then on Broadway !!!
