Brian Foster (a good performance by Wesley Eure of TV's "Land of the Lost") creates a computerized watchdog called C.H.O.M.P.S. (an acronym for the dog's home protection system) for his boss, Mr. Ralph Norton (played well by Conrad Baain), whose home business venture is in the making. A competitive company hires some indifferent criminals for their dirty hands on C.H.O.M.P.S. said task seems to be easier said than done. Director Don Chaffey keeps a steady, fast pace with the engaging dull story, holding an almost dull and light-hearted tone and pushing the goofy slapstick gags with considerable flair. In addition, the game makes a cup with a contagious aplomb: the wealthy Valerie Bertinelli as Brian's lovely fiance Casey Norton, Chuck McCann as clutzy Crook Brooks, Red Buttons as McCann's equally bumbling partner Bracken, Jim Backus as a vicious chief . Mr. Gibbs, Hermoine Baddeley As fine old biddy Mrs. Foster, and 60's AIP exploitation, used regular Larry Bishop as smarmy, dual suit Ken Sharp. Best of all, the titular pooch is a nice joy: C.H.O.M.P.S. jumping through fences, walls and windows with wonderful dexterity, performing acts of extraordinary power, running faster than a deer, and even moving some fine martial arts. A subplot about a hulking neighbor named Monster provides a few extra stomach laughs (Monster is pronounced by some unknown guy with an appropriate deep, rough voice). The brand new animated opening credit series, Charles F. Wheeler's shining cinematography, and Hoyt Curtin's funky, pulsating disco score are also solid. A cute little kiddie flick.
