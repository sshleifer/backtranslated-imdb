The Last Dinosaur is a movie designed to be fun and exciting. It manages to do both. <br /> <br /> Maston is a great game hunter hunting big game (go figure). He owns a venture he plans to embark on with a group of people, including a photographer named France, a Japanese scientist, a man who works for his company, Chuck, and an African man who helped him on many safari's name Bun Ta. The point is to study what is believed to be Tyrannosaurus Rex, dinosaur who killed the last expedition to the area. They will go to this prehistoric area to take a drilling vehicle traveling under the Polar Borer. After reaching the area, they soon find the Tyrannosaurus, who is trying to shoot Maston, but his gun gets stuck. Chuck immediately felt Maston wanted to hunt the dinosaur all the time to add it to his collection of "Stuffed Animals". As they left, Tyrannosaurus came into the camp and took the Polar Borer away from their camp. On return, the group realized that they were longer in the area than they expected, and Maston declared that he would kill the Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> The story is ideal for a science fiction movie. Drilling to a prehistoric area is something that really seems to happen. The scenery is beautiful and it looks like a place where dinosaurs can still live. <br /> <br /> I also looked like the characters in this movie. Maston is the typical big time hunter who wants to get a trophy dead. Also big was Bun Ta, played by Luther Rackley formerly of the NBA, who really looks and acts like an African tracker. Jackie is the typical woman who causes problems for the group and does not seem to belong in the desert. Chuck is the former employee of Maston who changes his view of his boss when he is with him in the wild. <br /> <br /> The Tyrannosaurus in this movie is one of the best in a movie. It is a bit too right as Godzilla does and it pulls its tail, so it's a guy in a suit. But the suit looks good, especially the head and tail, and the Tyrannosaurus looks good and very scary. I saw many other movies where dinosaur fits, looks worse. Tyrannosaurus in this movie sometimes gives a roar that burns like Godzilla and other times like King Kong of King Kong Escapes and King Kong vs Godzilla. SO a great Tyrannosaurus. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of action in The Last Dinosaur. Of particular note is a great battle between Tyrannosaurus and Triceratops. Also a wonderful scene where Bun Ta tries to mirror the Tyrannosaurus. There are other big things I won't give. You must see for yourself. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone. See it and you won't be disappointed.
