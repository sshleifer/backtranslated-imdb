I'm so happy Zac was in 'The Suite Life of Zack and Cody' because it's my favorite show and he's my favorite actor. This is a very funny episode and a funny show !! I love everything about the show and the characters. All the artists are wonderful. Watch acting Zac, and I'm so happy that almost all of my favorite actors (including High School Musical characters) are in this show. Zac Efron is so 'hot' and I have a written picture of him! This is not a photo copy, and it came entirely from America to Australia and it almost did not arrive in time for Christmas. Also, I printed a High School Musical Mug with my name on it.
