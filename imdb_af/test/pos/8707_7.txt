"Subspecies," like many other horror movies, get a rough deal on IMDb. The majority of movie watchers have a great dislike for horror, and when they occasionally hire horror movies, they also want to laugh or shout at excessive screens. Unfortunately, "subspecies" are not particularly lagable, and not so bloody, so it becomes a low rating. It's too bad. <br /> <br /> Of course, there's enough to criticize here. The non-actors are flat, the subspecies are a bad special effect, and the night tones are too brightly lit. But what do you expect? For a straight-to-video horror movie, "Subspecies" boast decent production values ​​and more integrity than you would expect. The film's Romanian environment is virtually unique (I believe it was the first American movie made in that country, post-communism), and the places, both inside and outside, are beautiful. The script has moments of intelligence, especially when it delves into the local folk tale (everything is wrong, I'm sure). Somehow, the place filming and clever writing work well together - "Subspecies" has its own very distinctive world. To take the damnation with poor praise ... it can be much more stupid. <br /> <br /> Fans of the more gruesome aspects of horror will undoubtedly get a kick out of the blood-shattering vampire villain, Radu. He is reasonably effective in this movie - powerful, with an unforgettable grumpy voice - but I like him better in the sequel, when actor Anders Hove gives a more self-parodying, campering performance. A completely sincere Radu is somewhat stupid. Other stupid aspects include the free nudity and the subspecies themselves, which are evident in the movie, as producer Charles Band has a fetish for evil little creatures. (Also see Puppetmaster and Demonic Toys). <br /> <br /> But I also like many of the film's mistakes. For what it is - straight-to-video vampire horror - "Subspecies" is perfect. The successors boast better production values, more violence, and somewhat more thoughtful story lines, so I recommend them even more strongly. However, this is not a bad start to the series.
