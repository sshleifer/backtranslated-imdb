This is Classic Disney at its best live action cartoon! Bumbling College Student Dexter Riley (Kurt Russell) develops a mysterious fluid invisibility formula that actually disappears objects and helps him save his cash thrown college. Further experimentation shows that it also works great on people! Riley's exciting discovery takes some hilarious new twists as a gang of crooks led by the notorious A.J. Arno (Cesar Romero) steals the formula and tries to use it for their less than legal activities. Superb special effects and a quick story make this live movie a handbook of college comedy! I love this movie! This movie has always filled me with a sense of wonder and joy. A nice comedy that the whole family can enjoy. Not much violence or sex and absolutely no curse makes it a movie that parents can watch with their children. More in one of the Kurt Russell movies presented at Medvale College. A nice little series placed in a healthy America before terrorists, when people valued more integrity than cash! I recommend this movie!
