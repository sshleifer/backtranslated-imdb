25 sitcoms had large screen spin-offs. Most of them came in the 1970s. Here is a list of all: Be Served, Blackadder, Bless this House, Bottom, Dads Army, Father Dear Father, For the Love of Ada, George and Mildred, The League of Lord, Love Your Neighbor, the Lovers, the man over the house, nearest and dearest, do not feel the quality of the wheel, feel on the buses (3), please sir, porridge, rising stomp, steptoe and son (2), it's your funeral, until death do us part, Up Pomeii (3), Whack-o, Whatever happened to the True Lads and Whoops Apocalypse. <br /> <br /> There was a big screen turn of my all-time favorite sitcom Dads Army. The focus of the film was when the men entered. It showed the problems of getting a uniform and getting weapons. It was a great summary of the first series of Dads Army. At the end of the film they get some German Spies in the church. The Home Guard is dressed as servers and had bayonets with them and defeated the Germans. The best part in the movie was when they presented a HG lecture and a German lecture at the same time: German: Head office on the phone, you will get 10 000 bombs, (CUT TO HOME GUARD) GODFREY: Mrs Mainwaring the phone, you will get 1/2lb shoots. <br /> <br /> It was probably the second best sitcom spin off movie, hit only by Till Death us do Part (1969). It would have been better if it had already been formed at the beginning of the movie, it was halfway through the war. Although it is still an excellent movie, a good one for the family.
