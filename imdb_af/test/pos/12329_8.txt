I have good memories of this movie ... <br /> <br /> I was just 12 when it was released and it scared the bejesus out of me. I really miss my bejesus ... <br /> <br /> Zombies, cemeteries, mausoleums, how can you go wrong? It's like Phantasm's delayed cousin. <br /> <br /> This movie was released 1 year before the PG-13 rating. <br /> <br /> I suggest that One Dark Night is the GORIEST PG movie (not scariest, mind you) ever released. <br /> <br /> Can anyone come with a gorilla pick? <br /> <br /> (FYI: I don't see Poltergeist to be a gory. Scarier, yes.
