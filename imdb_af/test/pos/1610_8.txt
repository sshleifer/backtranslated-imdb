In Venice, mainly on the Lido, Visconti's "Death in Venice" is a triumph of films combining the excellence of Dirk Bogarde's characterization and expert photography of the resort area in all its various daily moods. For those who love Venice, it's a movie to cherish. <br /> <br /> Mahler's music is often heard by the film, raising the play. The mood it creates is not always happy. But then, what else would you expect with a title like this? <br /> <br /> There isn't much dialogue in the movie. Rather sparse. These are mainly background sounds and chat and laugh among hotel guests. The intriguing part is to interpret the exchange of tins between Gustav von Aschenbach, a composer of some well-known and a slender teenage teenager Tadzio, who from time to time cross the tables of the hotel dining room, on the see beach and in strange unexpected places around Venice. Initially, they seem scarce to each other's presence, with little more than the portrayal of a smile, but later with a strong and resounding urgent look. <br /> <br /> Every viewer will have his own interpretation. The composer lost a child of his own. Is this behavior an expression of desire for the child he loved? Is it perhaps a sexual attraction for this fragile young man with his dazed somewhat girlish stare? Can he discover a new inspiration for an yet unknown musical masterpiece? Who knows? <br /> <br /> From start to finish, this film holds the true spirit of 19th century Venice. The elegance of the ladies, the deck chairs on the sand, the kids in their neck-to-knee bathing suits, the glow of sunsets and a general sense of satisfaction with the world. While some may think the pace is fairly slow, the movie has a total soft quality, but with a spoken indecision between two oppressed people. Be prepared for a sad and beautiful end.
