this movie is probably one of the best I've seen so far. I'll just put the second set on All About Lily Chou-chou because it gives me the same vibes. '9 Souls' are about 9 prisoners who have just escaped prison to search and have imitated money in a time capsule at Fuji Primary School Primary. they later discovered that there was not much there and stood in their own ways. The first half of the movie is just a time for the characters to be introduced and the main points to be set. It is a comical and yet serious part of the journey. The second half moved me to tears. As the film progresses, every character goes and tries to fulfill their dreams, but unfortunately it ends up a little bad. In the end, only 2 of the 9 escapes are left over. The way each character leaves the scene was very sad and you will probably have tears in your eyes. a beautiful movie directing fantastic. It's a movie for people who enjoyed Toshiaki Toyoda's other movies like 'Blue Spring'.
