This film is one of the historically most accurate war films ever made by showing the reality of soldiers in a war situation, as well as the special circumstances of the Battle of Stalingrad, when one compares this film to works such as Anthony Beevor's book "Stalingrad". <br /> <br /> Unlike the better-known "Enemy at the Gates" where the plot derives in a sniper / hunting story, this film shows what war can do for individuals. Although the Germans filmed, "Stalingrad" is nothing more than a nationalist apology. It shows that war movies can be something that is beyond the rolling, jingoistic distortions of the atrocious truth of war, like so many Hollywood war products appear to be. <br /> <br /> The dissertation, play, direction and other movie techniques in "Stlingrad" are of the highest quality. <br /> <br /> It's a must-see movie for anyone considering joining an army and obeying any kind of "Fuehrer".
