I know this movie is not for everyone, and I will not push my opinions on you, but what I have to say is the truth about how many people feel about this movie. It was the best I've ever seen! !! It was sooooooooooooooooo funny, and even though it wasn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, it kept me on the edge of my seat because I didn't know what was going to happen next. If you like funny scary movies, you should see this one!
