There isn't much that comes close to the perfect storytelling and exciting action-packed levels like "GoldenEye". When it came out, it was the best game of all time, and even today it remains strong. <br /> <br /> I will admit that this game has become boring after a few months of playing, and by failing to play it again until two years later, I was rushed back to his biggest, almost as if play for the first time. <br /> <br /> There are 20 action-packed levels, which are probably the most frequent of any James Bond game to date. Probably the most memorable one is the Tank level, which was probably the most explosive video game sequence. And the first shooter, as well as the use of Q gadgets, is what James Bond fans always use to use. <br /> <br /> Honestly, as a James Bond fan, I'm looking for real James Bond experience. , now appearing in PS2 games. So this game, while having some good action and useful gadgets, I expected a little more, even back in 1997. I also did not like this game not having Q or M or Moneypenny, or anyone from MI6 no. While watching the movies, Bond changes at least once with these characters in each movie, but they are nowhere to be seen in this game. And the vocal dialogue would have made the game more lively, rather than the text dialogue they used to use. They had the technology. They just didn't use it. <br /> <br /> Probably, the most annoying feature of this game is that it follows the story of the movie in some ways, and other ways are incoherent. For example, there are two very levels where you have to protect or save Natalya, although she can take care of the movie herself. There are also unnecessary levels, such as the Boot plane where you have to disarm bombs (which are not in the movie), which adds nothing more to the story. There are even levels where you save Natalya, but at the beginning of the next level she is caught again. How? <br /> <br /> Oh well. Even those little things can't really put this game down. And while I prefer the new games, this Bond experience is definitely one you won't forget. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
