A great show. <br /> <br /> First, to the people who don't like it. Don't like it, don't think ... <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful show. Better than Jim (a favorite of mine). It shows a true family household (Unlike 8 simple rules, etc., where everything goes peaches). <br /> <br /> They're hard, they're messy ... I can sympathize with them all drag the garbage into the kitchen. This happens in real life. Blacks like the "Portal to Hell", and all grow like dogs about fast food. <br /> <br /> It's a "There Be" show .... You know what's coming, but fun to watch because you were there. <br /> <br /> A good throw, they work well together, an admirable, enough show to justify a DVD release. Mel Gibson's safety videos were also a highlight of the series. <br /> <br /> Advice? Good show, Actually earning a DVD release (Earn not to be canceled as well).
