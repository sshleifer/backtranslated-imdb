The movie is really cool, I thought. It does very well at the original game, and some of the fighting scenes are portrayed in so much detail, it's incredible. I thought the movie might have been a little better if they gave you a little more information before the end, but trying to figure out what's going on is what the movie is up to you. <br /> <br /> The CG is beautiful, I don't think they could have done a better job graphically. Every little detail, the way they move, how their swords look, everything is perfect. The way they make the characters look is almost like their real people. <br /> <br /> The music was great, and I found it entertaining to listen to how much it was remixed from the original game, with new tools and effects. <br /> <br /> All in all, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys quick action and a good story. I will definitely play the game before I watch the movie.
