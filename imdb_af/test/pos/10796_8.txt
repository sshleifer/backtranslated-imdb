*** SPOILERS *** For a strange reason, Oliver Stone's "Talk Radio", based on the Stephen Singular book "Talked to Death" and the movie Eric Bogosian's play, about the 1984 murder of Alan Berg talk show host, never got the recognition it deservedly earned. The 1988 movie was prophetic enough to recognize the underground movement developing in the farm and interior of America. A movement that arose about seven years later is like a malicious and disgruntled Gulf War veteran, Timothy McVeigh, who hated the US government action in Wacco Texas. He took his and her friend, Terry Nichols, explosion of the US federal building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, which took the lives of 168 people, the worst act of terrorism on American soil until then. <br /> <br /> As far as I know, the film is the first time that an important branch of the entertainment media has been mentioned and worked out by the late William L. Pierce on the rural militia novel "The Turner Diaries". which has since become a chilling underground classic. The Turner Diaries proposed a domestic and utterly disastrous terrorist attack, such as the Oklahoma City bombing, at a US government's federal facility that was the FBI building in Washington DC. <br /> <br /> Dallas Radio Station KGAB Showcase Host Barry Champlain, Eric Bogosian, is the leading show in the Dallas listening area and will soon be going national. Barry gets his high rating through his razor sharp white and offensive behavior when he is on the air. Getting on all levels and making no issues, no matter how unpopular or taboo they were, Barry listened most, as well as hated man on the radio. Barry is a showman at heart and doesn't think his talk can lead to violence, she stays sly for his call listeners as his rating goes to the celling. But there are those in the listening audience, mostly ultra-right-wing types, who do not take too kindly in her attitude. One of them decides to get hold of Barry's expense business. <br /> <br /> Powerhouse performance by Eric Bogosian as tragic Barry Champlain who has crossed the line from entertainment to harsh reality in his radio performance. Thinking he was not so important to seek out and be murdered for his on-air enemies' likes, he just found out there were those out there who were crazy enough with him on the outside. Also in the movie "Talk Radio" is a very young Alic Baldwin as Barry's boss Dan who tries to soften him, but eventually joins his talking style since he killed the competition, without realizing that it is eventually him . that he will eventually be killed. <br /> <br /> Both Ellen Green and Leslie Hope are the two women in Barry's life, his former wife Ellen and now love and talk show producer Laura, who uses Barry to his advantage and almost eventually loses both of them at the same time. The 1988 movie "Talk Radio" is so far ahead of time that even if you see it in 2005, you still think it's too disturbing to show an over sensitive and delicate American public.
