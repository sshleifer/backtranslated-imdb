This scene shows how Wallace's experiment, using his brain manipulation invention, is terribly wrong, creating the "Were Rabbit". His desire as a social entrepreneur is to improve society to the better. That's why he created a "Brain Manipulator" machine. He lived his own life to help solve Tottington's pest rabbit problem and more importantly to collect the overpopulation of rabbits that were collected and stored in his cellar. Although he thought his experiment had worked, it had put more pressure on him and Gromit to find a solution before the Annual Vegetable Competition had once again hit his life. Gromit, who is a quietly faithful dog and loyal helper, constantly finds himself innovative ways to save his master, of his radical crazy inventions going terribly wrong. What's interesting in this movie, try to identify: who is more entrepreneurial, Wallace or Gromit?
