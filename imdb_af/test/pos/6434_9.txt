Co-directed by Rutger Hauer, lead roles, this film was briefly based on a short story by Dutch author Harry Murlisch. <br /> <br /> In the 10 minutes of the movie's length, you get a lifetime of "Harry" unraveling his long-term fascination with a room he is constantly passing through in his youth. On returning to the city many years later, he found that he had rented the same room. <br /> <br /> Using black and white film, the textures are highlighted in this delicate story of a story. The voice of "Harry" draws you into his world. <br /> <br /> A subtle, solid performance of Rutger Hauer and 2 non-speaking characters. Wonderful soundtrack by Dutch musician Dyzack. <br /> <br /> At the moment it is difficult to see this movie as it is only available on DVD region 2 "L'infidele" (Liv Ullman) as a bonus track. But this is due to the re-released DVD of The Hitcher. Another tight, but very different show from Hauer! <br /> <br /> See this movie if you can!
