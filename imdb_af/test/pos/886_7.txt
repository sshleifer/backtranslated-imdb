Having seen a preview for this film at my local mall where there was a view of buying foreign films, I thought it was very entertaining. Before I watched the movie, I went to IMDb to see what ratings and comments it received. I was worried when I noticed the low numbers and the negative ratings. Despite the hype, I watched movie and to my surprise I found it incredibly. <br /> <br /> The story was wonderful (just pay attention) and the characters and their relationships within the movie are amazing. I haven't seen such a good combination of leading characters in a long time. I really felt for both characters and felt a strong bond. If previous postings about this movie were not "epic" enough or a lack of martial arts, I could no longer differ. This film is what it is, it is not Braveheart, and it is not the Dragon tournament, but it is still a wonderful movie that combines excellent work as well as a story. <br /> <br /> While Sword in the Moon is not perfect (which movie is?) it is still wonderful and moving. Just wait until the final scene, with the music and cinematography together, its awesome. I just hope more people can see this movie to make it fair.
