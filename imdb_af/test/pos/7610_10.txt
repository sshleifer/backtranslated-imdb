I thought this movie was really fantastic! One of Drew's best. I'm also a fan of Michael Vartan, so I thought he was so hot in this movie. Why all the bad reviews. I want to see this movie over and over if I could. I also loved the end. This movie clearly showed a smile on my face! I was also surprised that James Franco and Jessica Alba were in it. I love them both, so I also highlighted this movie. In the end, when Drew makes the huge comment on the truth, it really tells the truth about what sometimes happens in High School. Again, the movie was incredible. Defiantly a 10/10. Hope this comment was very useful to any IMDb readers.
