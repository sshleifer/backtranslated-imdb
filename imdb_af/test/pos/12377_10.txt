Some will say this movie is a guilty pleasure. I loved this movie, but I don't feel guilty about it. You can tell the whole movie and the crew had fun making this movie. But Jack Frost 2 won't go well with some people. From the beginning you can say this movie will be cheese and it certainly has an amateur look at it. Well, if you get the privilege of watching this movie, remember Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman a pleasure, not a guilty pleasure. Now, because I can't fill ten lines, but here are some big scenes: <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> The three women on the beach have great deaths had. The first one had Jack in a tree to drop icicles on one of them. He remained missing so he dropped an anvil on her. The next woman fell on a bed of icicles. The last one was stabbed in the eyes with the forceps. <br /> <br /> The other one was where two surfers hang out near a frozen pole. One of them gets their tongue attached to it (of course). Jack Frost pulls him back and shoots his tongue as he says, "COWA-TONGUE-A DUDE!". Well, you have to see it yourself. <br /> <br /> And of course the snowballs kicked ass. <br /> <br /> ** END SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Infinity stars
