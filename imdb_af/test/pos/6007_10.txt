Excellent storytelling and cinematography. Sensitive, biting social commentary. <br /> <br /> Great effects. Well filmed and performed. <br /> <br /> The parallel action between the present and the travel adventures (though very well done) sometimes drag too much (about 3 hours) and breaks the story's flow. <br /> <br /> I first read the book as a child and enjoyed the parts about the giants and the little ones - but the book lost me when it came to the swinging island and the land of the "yahoos" ! Well, although the adventure pot may sound like a children's story, it's actually a mature story, full of symbolism about the moral decline in England at the time of Jonathan Swift, the author of the novel on which the film is based.
