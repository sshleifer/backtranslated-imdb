This movie was fantastic. This is definitely a top 5 hitchcock movie. Directing and camera shots are almost flawless (apart from the dog scene when he licks the guys' hand, clearly in slow motion). The plot is well written and realistic. It was very credible that an innocent man could fall into a trap. <br /> <br /> I'll be Bruno's hitchcock's second most interesting character (of course assets are first). Robert Walker plays a very credible maniac. He did not persuade the part that made it credible (much the same, how did Perkins not persuade his part). Overall, it's an excellent movie, an absolute must see for any hitchcock fans. <br /> <br /> <br />
