I'm a long fan of Luc Besson's work, and for as long as I got his name, I also watched this movie. I've been trying for more than four years to search this movie about California. This past summer I went to Europe, one of my missions on this trip was to see this movie at least. long story short, I bought it and watched in France! I was blown away, it made my trip completely and I finally feel that I have seen Luc Besson's first job. Absolutely amazing character development, many thoughts challenging, great acting and the ultimate concept film. If you are a concept movie fan, it is one of the most original and classic. I feel like it's been a rare treat to see a movie like this, it's risky, its unorthodox, and finally it's just straightforward. If you are a Luc Besson fan, it is indeed a must see or your Besson fan or not, it is definitely an important job, a huge contribution to the immortal art of the theater.
