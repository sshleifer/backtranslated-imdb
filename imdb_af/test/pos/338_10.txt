The director of Kannathil Muthamittal directs the first Indian movie I saw Dil Se, which led me to buy over 122 Hindi DVDs in the <br /> <br /> four month course. I can say I understood the total attraction, I was <br /> <br /> somehow confused why the movie would stop for "music videos". It was an excellent movie, I didn't know what to do about the dance and the female <br /> <br /> vocal was slender for my western ears, but somehow I had AR Rahmen's score found hypnotic. The next day I bought the soundtrack, and then Lagan, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and K3G next week and with the exception of "Ichi the <br /> <br /> killer" a few other Korean movies, I can't be bothered. to look very differently. Kind of strange to anyone who has just watched a strict diet from Hong Kong, Horror <br /> and Action / Science fiction movies for the past 30 years. <br /> <br /> But I have to come back to Kannathil Muthamittal, this is one of the Mani Ratman's latest efforts and I laughed, screamed, totally crazy, scared and mostly I didn't manipulate. The acting was great, photography was beautiful, I think you can stop the movie at any given time and see that any framework would be worthy of painting. The music fits perfectly on the movie and after the <br /> <br /> credits I wanted to watch again ... so I did. <br /> <br /> It would be foolish to discuss the plot for fear that you might miss the pleasure of seeing the events unfold and the characters evolve. That's what a big movie is about! I was listening to my home theater when it was over. <br /> <br /> My wife is watching now and I can't wait for her response, I can't expect it to be anything less than mine.
