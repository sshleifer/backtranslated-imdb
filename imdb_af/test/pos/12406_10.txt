The effectiveness of this photo is best evidenced by the intended target audience, teenagers. My 14-year-old son became so in the movie, that I judged it significantly higher than his imitator "Mad City". It made a debate in our household about issues such as peer pressure and loyalty to the right thing. Only for this do I rate this movie a 10! Parents should see and discuss with their teens. <br /> <br /> I really liked the smart dialogue and consistent acting. I thought James Remar was in his role enough, but the teenage thief really did carry this photo. Other IMDB users praised Corey Feldman's performance, which was truly inspired. All in all, I give this photo my highest recommendation. Go get this one!
