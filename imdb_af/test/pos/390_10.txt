Cam Archer's lyrical Bobbycrush takes on the crazy kaleidoscope the adolescents desire, with a sumptuous depiction (beautifully photographed by Aaron Platt), which is more vibe than story. Bobbycrush caught somewhere between documentary and dream, reminiscent of the ingenuity of early Todd Haynes and the lively hyprealization of Gus van Sant. With grit, shine and grief, it's similar to the movie equivalent of Sonic Youth playing bubbly doll.
