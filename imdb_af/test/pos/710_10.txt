I like to watch the Jericho mile. I mean look at Peter Strauss, the mile is like seeing the 100 meters. I think Peter Strauss is an excellent actor and has yet to do a running movie. He is lightning, has lots of energy and can run a mile within 4 minutes and my friend is wonderful. No one can rain in the race. Murphy, I mean the man runs 80 miles a week. Nobody does, but he does. I saw the Jericho mile 100 times and will see it 100's more. big movies are watched more than movies that don't. I thank the creators of this movie for years to give it. They are wonderful people and I bless everyone. Thank you for thanking my word again, thank you all.
