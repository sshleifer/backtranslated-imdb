FBI Agents Mulder and Scully are assigned to investigate the mystery of what happened to an Arctic drill. In this early 'X-Files' episode, David Duchovny sees himself as one of their first rockin episodes. It pays tribute to the promised John Carpenter 1982 theater feature "The Thing", and one can see the similarities. Visual, color and lighting schemes combine to give the story a healthy quality. Production design / art direction is particularly impressive; The shots of the outside of the Arctic camp are so reminiscent of the previous film to automatically create feelings of deja vu for some viewers. Of course, our heroes are threatened by the weather, so the sound design, as far as wind is concerned, reminds memories of The Thing. <br /> <br /> The culprit is an old worm exposed to the team; Once in a host, it stimulates aggressive behavior. This allows the paranoia aspect to persist, and the way the writing is set up, we cannot be sure of who is infected and who is not. This gives rise to the inevitable scene of testing. This episode certainly works to portray the way tension can break down in groups. It even allows Mulder and Scully to have moments where they are not sure they can trust each other. <br /> <br /> Guest starring is a good little group of actors: Xander Berkeley, Felicity Huffman, and Steve Hytner as the scientists have obliged to accompany Mulder and Scully on the mission, and Jeff Kober as the pilot they bring to the camp. You can also see once, Jason Voorhees, Ken Kirzinger, as one of the bad original team members. <br /> <br /> There is a direct link between "Ice" and "The Thing": art director Graeme Murray, who worked on both projects. <br /> <br /> 8/10
