If you watch this movie, don't go into this movie at all, because the expectation of this movie will be absolutely hilarious, because you will drop. yes, it is sometimes funny, but I will consider it a comedy as a political thriller. The performances are very good, especially by jeff goldblum as head of the election company. Although he has limited screen time, he makes a lasting impression. of course, robin williams is excellent. Laura Linney is very good at what a surprise. She is one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood, and in this particular scene one of these appears. This movie makes you think. What if a comedian ran for president and actually won? would the country be better or would the country be divided into a million pieces?
