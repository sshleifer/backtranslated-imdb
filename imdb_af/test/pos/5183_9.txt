Rosie Perez is the lead in this particular issue, such as Mercedes, a young Brooklyn woman, who has decided to become a movie actress, although it does not benefit from her circumstances, living in East Los Angeles and living with A series of fruitless auditions does not struggle for any kind of part. Mercedes was hooked with a married and excited actor, Harry Harrelson (Harvey Keitel), who once performed in the TV series in the 1970s, and rarely accepted him as her lover, in loneliness. and also hopes that movies will come on the road because of his "contacts", but the latter is of little consequence because Harry is simply self-betraying his efforts to recover what he sees as the previous movie. To support her financially, Mercedes plays as a taxi dancer in the Los Angeles Skid Row dance hall / pub, while continuing her efforts to succeed in the movie business, and that is while at the dance palace a young immigrant from Mexico, Ernesto (Michael DeLorenzo), falls in love with her and most of the narrative shows his efforts to please the object of his passions, even if it means she will lose her altogether. This substantial tradition-rooted melodrama is only given a moderate budget, despite the presence of a good number of well-known players, including Steve Buscemi, Anthony Quinn and Stanley Tucci. They were kept in sight for about a year before being quite stubborn. Distribute and lead marketing efforts on his behalf, more regrettably because his solid production features are firmly complemented by Alexandre Rockwell's admirable controlled direction, a consistent virtue of his work and in the performance in this film from his very open scene, framing form mounting behind the credits, with Perez at Skid Row's Fifth and Main Streets. Rockwell has often demonstrated that he is really playing his part, and this is true in this case, as he allows his actors to create their roles while any ad libbing is applied nicely through the editing process, leading to an artistic success for director, despite negative comments from some mainstream evaluators. The performance of the film is aesthetically related to much of it, which was contributed by Tito Larriva, who also plays as a band dancer for the taxi dancers. Acting honors must go here to the very important Perez, although no sub-performance is enabled anywhere. A fair test for any movie's quality is given when a viewer will see it twice in a short time. To sit through this undervalued work is widely regarded as a great pleasure.
