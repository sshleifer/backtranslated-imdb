This is an excellent movie. There were several parts of the movie I liked. This movie is very funny! Visit the Ernest Fun Club website at www.ernestfunclub.com. There are several movies like the following: Ernest goes to the camp, Ernest saves Christmas, Ernest goes to jail, Ernest in the army, Ernest goes to school, Ernest Rides Again Slam Dunk Ernest and so on. I highly recommend it for family flies. All stars Jim Varney are trying to visit www.ernestfunclub.com again. What is the best Ernest movie? In my opinion there are actually 2 Ernest Goes na Camp and Ernest Goes to the Criminal. So if you've never seen Ernest P. Worrell, it's time to see him. You will find him satisfactorily "no what I mean"?
