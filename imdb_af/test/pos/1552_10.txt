This movie takes the psychological thriller to new depths. Well written by Shane Black, the film is phenomenally performed by the cast under the watchful eye of director Jack Swanstrom. Obviously, Swanstrom is a director we should look into in the future. His strength lies in his customization of personal experiences on the screen as well as in the classroom. <br /> <br /> This thought-producing movie is a must see for anyone who appreciates action, drama, tension and mystery. As with all good movies, the viewer goes on their own journey to find their own interpretation of the movie. The mystical aspect of the film is intriguing and adds to the tension. You find yourself searching for the answers with Marquette. Audiences like the movie on the fair - with many awards received, they must have agreed that A.W.O.L. (2006) is worth watching. <br /> <br /> I want to have a copy - how do I get one?
