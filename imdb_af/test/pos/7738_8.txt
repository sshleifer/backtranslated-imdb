I love this movie despite the fact that it's just a big mistake to be big. It is an adult entertainment, full of issues that an adult can meet. The acting is wonderful. It's fun to watch John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands as a fussy middle-aged couple. Who knows how many of them came from their own marriage? Susan Sarandon has never been more sexy or more attractive than her voluntary character, Aretha. Raul Julia is a hoot as a fun goatherd. The scenery in Greece is spectacular; The New York institutions cause me to suffocate from the World Trade Center because of many shots. Fantastic score by Stomu Yamashta. With so many things going for it, why isn't it a good movie? It's a bit of a mystery and too long, unfocused, and uncomfortably balanced between humor and drama. Yet, it is engaging, entertaining and deeply thoughtful.
