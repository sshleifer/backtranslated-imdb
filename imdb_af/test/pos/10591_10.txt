This movie is simply fantastic. It's so hilarious. Although the skating and other settings are played out, the comedy is great. Raab Himself and Brandon Dicamillo is hilarious. There will be moments when you can't breathe, you laugh so hard. Plus, there are scenes that you can watch hundreds of times and still laugh. This is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen.
