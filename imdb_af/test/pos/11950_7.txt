This is the sequel to Better Off Dead. In a competition, Better Off Dead will win-down. But for the power of the stars, One Crazy Summer is elected Savage Steve's better script. Problems with a crazy summer (OCS): decisive. Better from death (BOD) is so much better cast. Friendship: OCS shows Cusack giving hatred to Bill Murray's little brother. Problems with the set? More outrageous friends in OCS, but more true friends in BOD. Plot was good. You will predict some of them, but even the predictable parts go beyond what you think they can. So, even if it's Better Off Dead's ugly step sister, it's worth it. See Demi Moore before the plastic surgery for no other reason. John Cusack fans, you have to see it, just to say you have. If you don't like Bobcat Golthwaite, I'm sorry. I don't like him either, but you can't escape him in this one. At least he does a good job in the film that makes a tribute to another movie monster. The editing needs help on the beach, but for the most part, not much to complain about. Overall, it's good and funny. But don't try to compare it with BOD, or you'll miss it. * Sigh *
