Christine Lahti (Sandy Dunlap) and Mary Tyler Moore (Holly Davis) worked well with soaps. Ted Danson did his best with an ungrateful role of Chip Davis. The point of departure is that the two ladies friendship, one a seemingly happy married woman and the other a career woman aware of her biological clock. I found the relationship that Ted Danson's character had with the single woman who played Christine Lahti's sordid. He behaved in a caddish way, but he bled two "widows" over him. I found it rebellious when Sandy told him that she wanted to break it down after meeting his wife, he noticed that he was missing her (he phoned his wife? There was no sign of it). He was wearing a heel. It might have made a more interesting movie if it wasn't killed. Maybe both ladies would have been and dumped him. I love the friendship between the two ladies, but it was spoiled by what they thought: a man's gift.
