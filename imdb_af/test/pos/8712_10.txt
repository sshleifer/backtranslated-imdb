A brilliant movie. BB is a miracle. She's sultry. She is a feminist. She is still very much in love. <br /> <br /> The movie has Paris in the 50's. It's great to look at the sites, the cars (DS!) And Orly. <br /> <br /> A simple but very pleasant romantic comedy. The music is terrible. It's hardly missing. On the other hand, it's hilarious. But this is probably the only thing that is wrong, at least looking at the 21st century. <br /> <br /> The film comments on the French way of infidelity. This is the modern sense. A movie like an elephant's trompe tremendous event made it into an 80's. But the basic premise remains the same. <br /> <br /> Thanks to the creators for offering BB with this opportunity.
