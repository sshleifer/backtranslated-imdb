Mr. Bean has always been my favorite. No carpets how many times you see the same thing, the show is never monotonous or repetitive. Mr. Bean is one of the biggest comedians in the world who doesn't even talk to make people laugh. His gestures, his facial expressions and his face are so funny to look at. The situations he faces are simply hilaries and the way he deals with them is even greater. There is simply no reason why this show should not receive a 10 because it is fantastic. It's something that will make even the most serious or saddest person laugh in the universe. Some of my favorite episodes of the show are: 1) When Bean leaving at a hotel. 2) The one where he watches the scary movie. 3) Adjust the baby (especially the diaper scene). In fact, all the episodes are so good that it's really hard to criticize the show. Mr.Bean can reach some height to prove that he is funny, including calling him completely into one of the episodes. The way he dealt with the situation was simply to blow. 10 out of 10.
