This is definitely a cult class !! <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's difficult to follow, but it's also a movie like Jacobs Ladder or even Fight Club. If you want a standard rate then I have to rent the Care Bears Movie or maybe an old Disney Classic. But if you want to see the world differently then I would say that you are opening for Enigma and for that matter a film that presents challenges we see and think. <br /> <br /> For me, the key is that the movie was original and interrogated me throughout. Although I have seen some complaints, I will say everything, take the movie for what it is and enjoy.
