The whole civilized world now knows that Emil Sitka says his immortal "Keeping Hands, Your Love Birds". But Shemp Howard, professor of music, steals the show. See how he breaks Dee Green tutorial if she breaks the "Voices of Spring". Look at Shemp as he shears through a mirror hanging down a rope from the ceiling. Look at him while being twisted by Christine McIntyre. Look at him and you will laugh and learn. Tired is also not bad. Look at him as he tries to put a woman on a crib. Larry, as usual, is the Zen reaction master. All in all, one of the very best Stooge shorts. You won't find one bad moment.
