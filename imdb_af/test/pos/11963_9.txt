In the eighties, Savage released Steve Holland three films, two of which are classics of a very small genre, absurd teenage comedies. The third "How did I get to college" doesn't measure up to "Better Off Dead", and especially because it lacks John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong (except for a small como). <br /> <br /> One crazy summer is an underestimated movie, with many great features and gags. As I recall, Savage was Steve's movies destroyed at that time as brain dead and after three movies he was driving into children's TV. We can use more movies from him.
