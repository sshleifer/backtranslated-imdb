... and usually I don't like surprises !! Occasionally watch this movie in a motel in South Africa second week of a three month motorcycle holiday in ZA. Apart from being well shot and acted, it helped me to understand the countries' problems tremendously. Just watched the "Million Dollar Baby" and had to look up Hillary Swank because the name was a little known and her play was excellent. She didn't realize she was the lawyer in the "Red Dust". Well, now I'm not worried she'll disappear like many other Clint sidekicks before. Now I am asked to write ten whole lines of comment that are rather ridiculous because I wrote what I wanted to write. OK, here it goes: I think if you look from a Western country, especially Europe, it will help you to understand a little better why what's happening is happening there! So it will hopefully fill ten lines.
