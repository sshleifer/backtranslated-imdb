And it's honest. It's just a summary. <br /> <br /> It's a small computer animated series filmed just like an animal documentary. <br /> <br /> The animation is almost flawless (I thought the long-neck swimming dinosaurs' eyes look fake). <br /> <br /> But some of the model shots didn't look so realistic ... <br /> <br /> and I thought the Jurrassic park made a better T Rex. <br /> <br /> If this is the kind of thing we see on a normal British TV show, I can't wait to see what they can achieve in the movies. <br /> <br /> I give these 10/10 stars ... <br /> <br /> (and the "making" video was also fantastic ..... the dinosaur on the skateboard was halar) <br /> <br /> <..>
