One of the best, Lackawanna Blues <br /> <br /> Great movie, good movie, good music, this is one of those movies that is so good that when it is over, it wants 90 more minutes, I'll do this one many times. <br /> <br /> This is one of those movies that you grab and turn from the beginning and emotionally beat throughout the function. The role play is extraordinary without the slightest hint that someone is uncomfortable in their role. You get the feeling that you really have it all. Much care has been taken in the sets, costumes and music of the period. The relationship between the characters we meet is both simple and complicated than the movie, but the steady display of me. Merchant is so powerful that the movie ends before we have the wonderful misfits. Delivering someone other than "Nanny" is an injustice because we include very good performances by major veteran actors, including: <br /> <br /> Jeffery Wright, Jimmy Smits, Terrence Howard and Delroy Lindo. But this is Marcus Franklin, Macy Gray and Mrs. Merchant makes it a wonderful experience. <br /> <br /> The movie moves fast and is short according to today's standards, but it is without doubt one of the best movies you 'll see this year again. If you want good pieces that will challenge you emotionally, pull your heart, pick up your joy, and tap your feet at the same time, then this is the movie for you. I showed it to several friends and everyone wants my copy, it all says, the movie is so good. Check it yourself. <br /> <br /> Danceability-1, Amsterdam Holland
