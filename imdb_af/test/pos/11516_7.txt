"Lights of New York" originally started as an experimental two-reel Vitaphone card that finally played in the first all-talkie movie. Helene Costelle was probably one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood and sister (in my opinion the right beauty) Dolores Costello, who seems to be all the break. Poor Helene is especially known for appearing in this beautiful, brave movie that has bought a Hollywood revolution! <br /> <br /> Two butterflies on the main street in Main Street convince a couple of small town hikers to try their luck on Broadway. The barbers Eddie (Cullen Landis) and Gene (Eugene Palette) do not realize that their barber shop will soon be a cover for illegal start-up activities. They soon realized this and regretted the day they left their small town. The only thing to keep them is the loan Eddie's mother gave them and they want to pay back desperately. Eddie is again introduced to Kitty Lewis (Helene Costello) a girl from his hometown that made Broadway good. Kitty is worried about Hawker Miller (Wheeler Oakman) who is always hanging around, but Eddie thinks innocently that she is exaggerating. Hawk already has a girlfriend, Molly (Gladys Brockwell), but to assure her he gives her a small handgun. To scare away unwanted admirers. "Hawk", who killed a police officer and closed the "Feds", decided to frame Eddie. Meanwhile, Molly is busy with her "Hawks" treatment and after a revelation where he tells her he is after a chicken and not an old chicken that the stage is. Murder !!! <br /> <br /> The fact is that it is not quite terrible, except for gangsters and showgirls who speak in their best electoral voice and it was still in movies in 1930. Gladys Brockwell (as a small melodramatic) and Eugene Palette (of course) were good and were the most seasoned actors in the film. There was no John or Ethel Barrymore to see - Cullen Landis and Helene Costello soon returned to the ambiguity they came from. I also didn't see much of the "hidden mike" - where people had to be grouped around different objects, ie a phone or a couch before they could talk. People who saw it at the cinema probably thought that all policemen were talking in the flat monotone, as the trend continued in many early talks, ie "Little Caesar" (1930). Anyway, they were probably inspired by the novelty of a whole all talkie - with a few singing and dancing movies in 1928. <br /> <br /> Recommended.
