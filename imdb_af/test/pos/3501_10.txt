The thing with Ali G is that he takes the mike out of himself and his character. <br /> <br /> The humor is quite a 'like it or love it' brand of totally politically wrong, unbeatable and self-indulgent type. Personally, I absolutely love this movie, and so have everyone I met who saw it. You can watch it a few times and choose new gags every time. The humor is heard and visual, and the timing is impeccable. The humor is probably a lot of English, and specifically London, so it's possible that non-English viewers might not get the humor. Think of yourself as a teenager and you'll love it, especially if Kevin & Perry Go Large tickle you!
