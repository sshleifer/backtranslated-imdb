I just discovered this and loved it. Just the right mix of fast-moving story, entertaining characters, hilarious moments (but not overloaded with silly jokes), and fun shows by Kelsey Grammar, Harry Dean Stanton, Ron Schneider, Rip Torn and more. Buckman is especially good, and I really enjoyed watching the guy who played Stapanick. <br /> <br /> I also find it interesting that they used a real submarine, the Pampanito, to run on top screens and almost finished it off for their sets. The collection is very impressive if you do a digital tour of the Pampanito online and then compare it to scenes in the movie. They did an excellent job on this movie. <br /> <br /> What a light, entertaining and really nice movie!
