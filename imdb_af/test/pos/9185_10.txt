Last night I had the remarkable pleasure of seeing the movie Hitch. I was amazed and surprised. Will Smith has done a phenomenal job in a role he is not always associated with. He once and for all proved that he didn't have to hold a gun to be a good actor in a movie. Kevin James was also very impressive. I admit I always like him on "The King of Queens", but this role really made him more aware, and I hope to see him on the big screen in the near future. The movie was funny and beautiful and I recommend it to any guy as the best date movie you could ever imagine. The mix of comedy, romance and drama made me feel. It is nothing like most "chick wings" in the sense of tears and sadness, but keeps its own and I think it can be enjoyed equally well by both men and women. I encourage all couples to watch this movie especially, but even if you're not involved with someone, you can pick up some good ideas from Hitch. <br /> <br /> TWO ROADS GREAT THOMBS UP !!!
