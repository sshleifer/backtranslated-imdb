Kon Ichikawa lived and saw the effects of the Second World War on his people in Japan. But also writer Shohei Ooka, whose book was the inspiration for Ichikawa's film, Brande op de Vlak. It is a film about the men in this war, or perhaps more commonly in wars in general, which they lose humanity. The soldiers nurtured by these fields and jungle of the Philippians in this story are almost completely without hope, if not. It makes Stone's Platoon look like a picnic: they have at least some things, like food. <br /> <br /> They have little or no reserves or supplies or ammunition, no backup, no sense of anything. go into this battle in what they are used to. They can't even get proper hospital care unless they can no longer walk or lose limbs (for example, if you have TB, you're on the go). But it is really through the prism of one soldier, a private Tamura, that we get a full sense of the futility of the war, both in the dark scenes of nothing and boredom and decay, and those flashes of intense and cruel violence . <Br /> <br /> In the movie Tamura just wants to get medical care. It's right at the beginning, and she tells of his commander-in-chief - he's already staring at eyes and an expression drained over years of battle - that he'll die if he doesn't get a hospital. He does not really, but ends with a few soldiers: initially with a platoon that looks as if they have gathered themselves, but are actually led by a strong-hearted brute who wants only Tamura's salt water, and later with two others stray soldiers who are part of a group that had been home at home while crossing a road at night. <br /> <br /> The story isn't quite a straight line, but it doesn't have to be. Tamura's path in Fires on the Plains is told in vignettes, small stories like when he comes across a seemingly deserted enemy village. Two of the people come back to get supplies, and Tamura cuts them up. This is a turbulent scene, because at Tamura, we haven't seen him do anything fair * wrong *, but he does it in this scene, not so much from evil, but from fear and despair (that's also without spoiling it, how he gets some salt). Small scenes build up so brilliantly and with devastation, as a simple task to find some walkable shoes, which look nothing. Or when Tamura discovers later in the film, his teeth are torn apart and he falls out of the lack of total hygiene. So much for food, so it goes. <br /> <br /> It should also be mentioned that it is a ghostly movie of Ichikawa, shot in a sharp black and white view of the fields and bushes, the movies make everything look up to us in black-black and white-warm white. Ichikawa also makes sure everything gets really from his actors, not only emotionally, but with their own emaciated look and looks desperate right to them. It is as if Ichikawa must survive them all, as well as characters who survive in nature. By game, incidentally, I also mean cannibalism. The shock of this is twofold; Firstly, the way a soldier started talking about other Tamaura soldiers half-earlier, asking if it was true and only in response to a word of caution not being asked, and the second to portraying cannibalism itself. the mad, hungry man on the hill that pulled out of his lap and said with a straight face to our hero: "You can eat me if I die." <br /> <br /> It makes things particularly brutal when it comes to the director who is filming the short "action" scenes. That is, I would argue, more brutally than 'Private Ryan' in their portrayals of violence in the battle, the totally random massacre. A scene I would like to show, and it just contains a shot that is unshakable to watch, is when we see from a high angle that a group of about twenty soldiers are walking next door, a hail of firearm just doesn't come kill four or five, but it happens just as fast, and the soldiers just stay with the same crawl. It is not the only shot of horrible massacre shown - if it is bloody, it is there, but splashes over the screen like something completely from the macabre - but it drives the point completely. <br /> <br /> All the plays are staggering (especially Funakoshi, which looks the most in peace and most horrible about what it usually sees in the most subtle looks), all the main set pieces offer something different to the horrible experience, and this is all the ultimate question with an anti-war movie: how can or why fight people in wars like this? It is almost too depressing to put into words, and so Ichikawa moves our noses into the mess and dirt and blood and demands that we enter it. Maybe it will never happen again someday. Or one can hope this, by the end of such a dark and wonderful movie like this.
