It's hard to think that "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch", directed by the legendary D.W. Griffith returned in 1914. This is a showcase for Griffith's upcoming style. <br /> <br /> The story centers around a group of settlers called the Cameron Brothers and their families who include a young waif (Mae Marsh) sent from the east along with her uncles and a young woman (Lillian Gish ) to live that has just been born. A group of Indians are trying to catch the waif's pets and are being driven out by the men. During the confrontation, the Indian chief's son (Henry B. Wathall) is murdered. The Indian chief denies his revenge and begins an attack on the small community of Elderbush Gulch. <br /> <br /> It is this attack, which is quite brutal and graphic for this or any other time, which is at the heart of the picture. The Indians kill the towns, people, women and children and drive them out of town to the Cameron's house. The newborn baby is separated from his mother and hell breaks loose. Someone goes for help and returns with the calf. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes contain some graphic violence. For example, we see a woman being alive and there is a sequence where we see a horse being shot down. I have never seen an animal be killed so convincingly on the screen. Mr. Griffith was becoming a master of large-scale battle scenes, a talent he would use in his epic civil war drama, The Birth of a Nation, next year. <br /> <br /> Even though It's about 29 minutes, "The Battle of Elderbush Gulch" is an exciting and historic piece of film. See if you can see Lionel Barrymore and Harry Carey in parts.
