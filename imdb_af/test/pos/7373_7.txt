I decided to see it on FearNet for free, because I thought well, nothing else looked nice. And it was quite a good little horror surprise! The film serves as an anthology of four urban legends told from four teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere. After deciding to build a campfire in the woods, they start telling their haunting stories and the movie transitions to the stories in the stories. <br /> <br /> The honeymoon - a newly married couple travels inland in a RV to Las Vegas is being terrorized when parked in a wooded area by evil creatures hunting the full moon. (I will not spoil it!) The Hook-Amy Smart and James Marsden (probably the most famous people in the movie, except for beautiful Christine Taylor) play the young couple who come face to face with the maniac that has a hook for a hand in this most recognizable card. <br /> <br /> People Lek Too is probably the scariest and the darkest of the stories. A young girl talks to another girl on the internet, but it seems to be a man who is obsessive to her and he will soon break into the house when she is alone. It was very cold. <br /> <br /> The Locket This is also a wonderful story with Glen Quinn and Jacinda Barrett, who play a motorcycle rider and a beautiful dumb girl who has been affected by a mysterious spirit terror in a past century . farmhouse. It was good, but it was the worst of the entries. <br /> <br /> The campfire group slowly develops their own terrifying experience in their segments between stories, and the end of this movie is surprising and truly amazing! Overall, it's not scary and scary, but it's definitely a big, small, guilty pleasure that horror fans seemed to be worth finding!
