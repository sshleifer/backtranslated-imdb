A mere title disguised this solid-accelerated example of old-fashioned Hollywood entertainment, this film proves a great successful hodgepodge of various diverse elements: a period piece, a romantic drama, a crime movie and a political thriller. Interestingly, though made by Fox, is his protagonist ?? Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck ?? were both usually associated with other studios; They on screen chemistry here are tangible and eventually lead to marriage in a few years. While a little too young, Taylor is a brave hero (a Marine personally appointed by President McKinley to expose the culprits behind an organized cleanup of many banks); Surprisingly, he did not find them soon (led by smooth Brian Donlevy and dull Victor McLaglen) that he fell for a chanteuse (of course Stanwyck) who threw her fate with the gang ?? Although, the truth is told, singing is far from the actress's forte! Likewise, in addition to proving his value to make it into their fold, he has to get Stanwyck's attention with McLaglen. By the way, the practical joker of the former reminded me of many Charley Chase in SONS OF THE DESERT (1933) likewise directed by William A. Seiter. Later, Taylor is in two minds to engage Stanwyck in the imminent bait and try to give his resignation to the President while he goes out with the girl ?? but the jealous rival disrupts his plans. The robbery went wrong, we found Donlevy dead and the other two in jail; Taylor's hope for McKinley's intervention? meanwhile learned the identity of the elusive and clearly prominent 'inner man'? is apparently bumped if the president excites him, kills him (turning a huge plot, although the resulting eleventh hour feels confronted)! Returning to the movie's style, even though the vaudeville ranges are a matter of taste, the romantic triangle slows things down and it seems slightly on the player aspect. It does indeed produce a nice production? Douglas Fowley, Sig Rumann and, as two US presidents, Sidney Blackmer (bitter Theodore Roosevelt) and Frank Conroy (McKinley), have already supported the actors significantly by John Carradine (who inexplicably disappears after just one scene!). .
