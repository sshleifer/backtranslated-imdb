In many ways, the perfect movie. The Incredible Journey and Horatio Alger story come together for a positive turn on the usually depressing subject of existentialism. In essence, the tracks of the muppets come down to the final song of the movie: "Life is like a movie, write your own end, stay faithful, keep pretending." They create their own reality, which has all the bumps of every epic story: a high goal at the end of which is necessarily an obstacle-laden journey; an ever-increasing group of equal people for camaraderie; a nasty set of villians who are not beyond all redemption; and a great budget for Hollywood ends because they can do it all. <br /> <br /> Only Jim Henson can deduce this. He runs the line between sentimentality and philosophy, without swirling in too long or too hard. Of course, it seems odd that it's investing so much weight in a movie doll, but in the end it might be the perfect doll to make these points. The atmosphere of the film allows for the pure enjoyment of the Hollywood dream, the "happy" end, unnecessary cameos and bursts into the song on the hat of a hat. Usually these aspects are anatema for quality in film, but the self-degrading way in which the story is delivered makes debt free viewing. One of the few movies that can really be called "suitable for all ages." <br /> <br /> The other muppet-related movies (including "The Empire Strikes Back"), while it's nice, don't get the simple grace of this movie. For example, take the music number "Hope there is something better," the duet of Kermit and Rowlf. Amusing in his vaudevillian goofiness, yet another bitterly critical point about motivating life choices. Brilliant.
