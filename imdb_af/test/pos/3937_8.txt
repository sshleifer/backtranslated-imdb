I never realized what a fantastic dancer Lana Turner was before I saw this movie. She was just 19 years old and beautiful. What a pleasure to dance to her with George Murphy. The story line was typical of his day, but the dance was very special. I never get tired of watching Fred and Ginger, but Lana Turner in this movie was just as fantastic. I always thought of Lana as a so-so actress who was inclined to do so. She had to do more dancing and less of the Maddam X and Peyton Place roles. I had a new appreciation for her after seeing this movie and her wonderful dance. The Academy doesn't badly give an Oscar for dance.
