More entertaining than all gay orgy combined in "300". More heartbreaking than a Shakespeare tragedy. More poetic than even the most melodramatic poems about lost love and blah blah blah. And above all, the biggest waste ever made. <br /> <br /> A black comedy testing the limits of human senses, John Waters cult film "Pink Flamingos" is a story about the conflict between two families ending in humiliation, death and, of course, eating dog feces (yes, actually, this is not the humiliating part). No no, it's not about the impossible love, there is no Roman or Juliet in these 90 minutes. This movie is about fighting for prestige if you can call it. The battle for the title - Dirty person alive. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, we have a caring daughter, good mother, cannibal, murderer, pervert, and current owner of the named Divine (played by the crossbreed Waters regular ... umm ... divine). title. She loves her son Crackers a little too much. Crackers are sporting a sexual attraction to both chickens and young ladies who sometimes mix them in triangles. Family friend and loyal accomplice Cotton gets her satisfaction to look at Crackers during some of his ... acts of the aforementioned earlier objects of attraction. Last but not least, Divine's mother and grandmother of Crackers, Edie. A 400 hundred pound woman sleeps, eats and basically lives in a baby. She is addicted to eggs and loves the eggman (the man who brings the eggs ... lol). <br /> <br /> The four of them live quietly in a caravan outside the city until the moment they get up. a target for the Marbles. Exhibitionists, manipulators, cheaters, many evil people actually. Their main source of income comes from the kidnapping and fertilization of young women. For the fertilizing part, they use their reliable and loyal cross-decorating butler to provide the semen. Then they sell the birth child to the highest bidder. <br /> <br /> It was the Marbles envy against divine and her title which would lead to an inevitable confrontation between the two families. An epic battle of filth, perversion and violence. <br /> <br /> "Pink Flamingos" is an unparalleled masterpiece in the trash movie genre. John Waters's film is loaded and hated by traditionalists, critics and the average movie. But for the few who remain uncircumcised by these generalizations, the Flamingos are a memorable experience. Funny and sick, violent and poet. It really is an exercise in poor taste
