Mikio Naruse's investigation of the lives of three winding, constantly complaining, single ex-geishas in post-war Japan, is a wonderful character piece. They were former friends, but now their relationship is tense because one of the women has become a successful lender and the other two owes her. Although the lender is the only one successful in this rebuilding economy, she is the only one of the three who have no children. The other two each have a child from whom they are dependent on income, because none of them work. Complications arise when the children decide to marry (although not to one another) and go home. This leads to the bitter, feminine old women becoming even more bitter and miserable, getting drunk and cheating their rotten children and discouraging the cheater. Meanwhile, the lender is dissatisfied with her, despite her fate. She has no one but her young deaf girl to keep her company and chances to meet two former lovers out of her geisha days nowhere - all they really want is to borrow money from her. The three characters are all neck-deep in the mercury sand of their own bored lives and are too tired to struggle much, usually prefer to thank themselves for the futility of throwing it all or at least complaining to each other. <br /> <br /> "Late Chrysanthemums" is very slow and not much happening, but Naruse, like all great directors, has the ability to do a lot with very little. I didn't see much of his work, but I suspect it is not his best, even though it is very good. The problem, I think, is that it doesn't look like much. But the movie is full of good points. Although it's cynical, it's not too much. Naruse seems to be too sympathetic with his desperate characters, and he sketches experienced portraits that even look like the characters in the neck of their self-made misery. While the movie is not a must-see, it is important as a fragment of the work of a large, lesser-known (outside his own country) director, little of the videos available in the United States.
