A good story, well dealt with unexpected character turns, eg. evil murderous gangster Bryan Brown teaches his son Macrame. Although it is successful as an action drama where you hope the good man (Ledger) and his gilrfriend succeed, it also has a hilarious ironic black humor, eg. the banks that become radio competition "winners" and their response, the busher's revenge, etc. Worth watching.
