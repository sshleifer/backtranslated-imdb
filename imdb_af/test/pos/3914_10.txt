PEOPLE ARE STUPID. You should not keep up when Paris is murdered with a pipe in the head! It's rude! What did Paris do to you? What if it was you? You don't want people to be sorry for you! Anyway, it was very good, what I liked and it was cool when Elisha's finger was cut off. It was strange with the controversy that they didn't have 2 boys they had and everyone else, it made way for a House of Wax 2: Recession or something. Paris was wonderful in the chase scene. Elisha and Chad chemistry are wonderful, they deserve an Oscar. My friends and I crashed when that guy said it was hot when Paris and Cousin Skeeter's guy made out. Lol.K bye.
