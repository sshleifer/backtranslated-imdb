It is a classic American movie in combination with comedy, romance and dream. You may say, 'There are a lot of these movies already. But believe me, you will find it a good one, because it is well-directed, written and played. Amanda Bynes is just wonderful! She is humorous, cute and charming inside and outside the screen. She is the MAN indeed !!! The message I get from this is to follow your own fairy tale. What I mean by a dairy story is not the one with prince and princess, but refers to 'faith'. namely, it tells us to keep your faith, dream and things that make you regret for your whole life if you don't. one of those movies you can't miss in your life.
