Not too much top is the classic "top rifle" or "independence day" when it comes to attacking the jet plane. Yes, the movie up is based on a real fictional example of how someone can make a rescue, but it's cool because it breaks all traditional rules. The child does what he wants to do in a ray, as he wants to do. <br /> <br /> I can't really get my finger on just what I love about this movie, but others I know the movies feel the same way I do. I think it's just pretty much fun, but maybe a little too unrealistic so some can buy. <br /> <br /> Again, no matter how much I loved it, people I saw have loved it, it's definitely worth seeing to make your own decisions about it. Put it that way, I thought Top Gun was one of the best kite planes ever and I love this movie just as much as Top Gun. Don't miss out, see it, a truly inspirational movie.
