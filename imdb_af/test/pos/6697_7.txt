A mixture of Alien and Ghost Busters? <br /> <br /> Starting very promising, then slowing down to almost boring. <br /> <br /> LifeForce features some amazing special effects that they could make in the mid-80s. The story is intriguing, but in the end becomes rather lacking in gloss. It was named because of grace, sex and gore. Mathilda May's ethereal and wild (naked) beauty is evident throughout the movie. A bizarre movie and much by the time it's made. <br /> <br /> It could have been a bigger classic with a better script, but unfortunately it wasn't a big hit, I think it went really bad. <br /> <br /> So, something went wrong with this one, yet it is very entertaining.
