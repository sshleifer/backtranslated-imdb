I love this show. It's smart and very well done. David Morse and Andr√© Braugher have good chemistry. The writing is clever and subplots generally give great comic relief. After every new episode, I'm always amazed at how challenging and at the same time entertaining this show. My only complaint is Donna Murphy's absence, at this point, in the second season. Like David Morse's ex-wife, Heather, she added such a character to the show. <br /> <br /> I think this show is a credit for the crime / drama genre. With that said - I can't understand for my life why this performance has such a low rating. Would anyone who gave this exhibition a 1-rating criticism?
