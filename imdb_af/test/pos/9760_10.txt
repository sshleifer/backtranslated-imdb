I can't count the times I've seen here, and although it's different from the book in story, the mood is still the same. The connection that two such diverse people are overcoming is immortal. And that the element of women prisoners was a real event, which happened to real people. The story is about the strength of character of ordinary people, just trying to survive a terrible time in their lives. And it also presented Australia in a real mode. The country is like all countries, areas where everyone likes, beautiful areas and deserted areas. But it gives Shute a stage for Jean's transformation from a low outback village to a family community.
