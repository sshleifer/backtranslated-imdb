I saw this short film on HBO and absolutely loved it. Eight different characters, eight different perspectives. Initially I was confused about how the story moved together, but then I realized that it was just one scene that was shown over and over, just to show us the different perspectives of the characters. <br /> <br /> Initially, you think the clerks are shouting at the teenager for the steal. They speak in their own language, which I (and Chris the teenager convincingly played by Eleonore Hendricks) cannot understand. The perspective of the clothing rejects the view. I didn't realize how wonderful the short really was to the last two scenes. <br /> <br /> Excellent short film. Hopefully, director James Cox can make the short in a movie with the same movie or win with a whole new movie. <br /> <br />
