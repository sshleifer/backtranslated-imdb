Kramer vs Kramer is the story of a marriage agreement and its consequences. They can be devastating to the partners and even more to a minor child who is played by Justin Henry in this case. <br /> <br /> What I really liked from Kramer vs Kramer is the greatest power as a movie. is the way parents Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep are presented to the audience as full-fledged people with many sides to their nature. Although the film is in Hoffman's direction and more about his relationship with his son, he is not portrayed as any kind of saint, nor is Streep a completely black villain. Hoffman is a career-oriented man in the advertising field. He ignored his wife's dreams and aspirations pretty much, but it is a big shock to him as Streep says love is no longer there and she wants to. She also wants to be a mother, at least for a while. <br /> <br /> Hoffman and Henry make the best they can. The pressure to be both parents causes Hoffman to lose his job and he has to take a lower paying in another agency. At that point, after more than a year, Streep decided to oversee her. <br /> <br /> Both parents make compelling witnesses and make their case beautiful, but in these situations the tie is always broken for the mother. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep won their first two Oscars respectively for this film, her in the category of Supporting Actress. I don't know how these things are decided, but Streep gets less screen time than Hoffman if it's the determining factor. The film focuses on Hoffman's relationship with his son and his developing realization that he has been part of the debt for the neglect of marriage. As for Meryl, it's a boiling point's choice for her as it is for many women, to balance a career and motherhood. The conflict in her psyche registers for everyone to see on the screen. <br /> <br /> Dustin Hoffman may have partially shared the Oscar for the same reason that Spencer Tracy picked up his first by the impossible task of not hiring a play-talented child stealing the movie. Children with their lack of inhibition are natural actors and Henry is big because he is coming over as a real child, not a Hollywood child. I wonder if Hoffman saw Captains Courageous and saw Spencer Tracy dealt with Freddie Bartholomew. Dustin did much worse than channel Spencer Tracy in his performances. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs. Kramer also won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for Robert Benton and the best custom script. It is an intelligent and compelling drama about adults who fall in love and try to do as well as possible with themselves and their child. Don't miss it if you're ever broadcast.
