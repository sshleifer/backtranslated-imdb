One of my favorite Hartley movies. (As if there could be a bad one.) Although it may be a bit more on the religious side of things than we normally expect. Still, it still sticks to Hartley's oblique approach. <br /> <br /> First photo Jesus and Satan discuss their ideas, opinions, hopes and regrets about the approaching end of civilization. Imagine now that the entire conversation is taking place over a few drinks in your neighborhood bar. And as an added conversation (not to mention visual) distraction, let's throw in PJ Harvey as the sultry companion (aka Magdelena) to Mr. Chist. Then, just for grills, in the background, an ever-present Salvation Army Band (played by Yo La Tengo) to serve as an additional distraction. The road to moral justification has never been such a pleasure. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly more questions than answers, but the fun lies in it. And Mr. Donovan is muted brilliance, as always.
