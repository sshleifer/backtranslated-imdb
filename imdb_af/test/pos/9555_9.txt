<br /> <br /> It's the best cartoon postcard of a dog show I've seen long ago. A very long time. Well, we can ever experience it. Isn't it part of the charm? The idea is actually to make a movie that mocks a documentary about an event that most people will find strange in the first place. Even if there was not much laughter, one would still feast on the thought. Any movie that tries something new in my proverbial book. I also loved the dogs!
