This is a great Italian shark movie probably not a full action shark movie, but it has a wonderful story about a native American in the form of a killer shark attacking a small beach community. The movie has real scenes of real sharks and some, but how they made it is pretty good. The movie is not so brilliant to play in this shark movie, but it shows better in other Italian shark movies such as (cruel jaws, last shark) they show a little bad play, but most Italian shark movies are Well, that means these voices are the best Italian best shark movie ever. Some scenes in this movie show violence / gore that makes this movie good so it says it's the best movie for all shark movie fans.
