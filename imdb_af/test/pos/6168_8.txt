I came from the "Dark Blue World" feeling (sigh) "so sad", but it was definitely a movie that had to be made, and it is really well done from Czech. It was entertained despite the 'sad' point of departure. It is full of feelings, the commitment and unmistakable true friendship between the two main characters - an adult lieutenant pilot (Ondrej Vetchy as Franta) and the young and eternal emerging pilot (Crying Herd as Charles), the inevitable love triangle, and the now and then reminiscent of the grim prison situations in Czechoslovakia in the fifties. It's all in one movie composed by father writer and son director team Zdenek and Jan Sverák (previous performance is the lovely Kolya). <br /> <br /> It's not as long as "East West" (French "Est-Ouest") 1999, which has a heartbreaking, multi-faceted story about a returning Russian doctor and the French woman's fatality. the Second World War in Russia. The plot of "Tmavomodrý svet" (title in Czech) is fairly simple and has spoken of light humor. Music, World War II England songs sung in Czech, modest special effects of pilots and aerial work in the air - not as expanded as Hollywood. There doesn't always have to be bing, scared, all the time when airline scenes are displayed. The sadness was set out in the beginning (two paragraphs in English) and followed up with follow-up paragraphs. The film is not entirely captivated, just when the Czech conversations are translated - the rest is in English, whether it is British or Czech accent. (This is a strange English language film and includes British actors.) <br /> <br /> The three main achievements, especially of the two Czech pilots, have been superbly rendered. There are nuances between them, although they are adult adults. I always appreciate Tara Fitzgerald: yes, there are "Brassed Off" 1996 to Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite; remember her from "Hear My Song" 1991 to Adrian Dunbar and Ned Beatty; versus Hugh Grant in "Sirens" 1994 and "The Englishman Who Went Up to Hill and Came Down a Mountain" 1995, except her appearance in the PBS Masterpiece Theater mini-series. <br /> <br /> "So sad" - the fact that heroes defend your country can be treated so badly and so long (40 years). Thanks for the valuable memories and imprints of friendship unforgettable. So, pause for a ray of sunshine through a stained-glass window (ironic or coincidental that it is from a church where the hard work took place) - symbolically of hope, don't give up? <br /> <br /> Other recent movies that need stories to be told: "Kandahar" (with Nelofer Pazira as Nafas, the Canadian from Afghanistan, who has a trip to Kandahar with a personal "mission" in mind ) more than the eye behind a burqa by Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf. "All together" (with Radha Mitchell as a new mother facing SID sudden child deaths) informative film by Swiss director Marc Forster, and she has talked a lot about controversial movie "Monster's Ball" I'm still catching up with Halle Berry, Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Boyle. View movies without prior expectations or comparisons to movies. See it just.
