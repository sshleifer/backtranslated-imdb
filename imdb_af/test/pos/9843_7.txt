James Cagney (The Yankee Doodle Dandy Boy) has just started his career and was able to run as a gunman and a social worker for a Boys Reform School run by corrupt politicians. The residents of the reform school are underage minors from the streets of New York, such as the "East Side Kids" who were poor and unaware during the Great Depression. In the final scenes, there is a trial by the reform school boys with burning torches and a fire set fire, and a big leap through the corrupt officer. I noticed that they had the horses released from the barn first. This movie is not shown very often and I can really understand why
