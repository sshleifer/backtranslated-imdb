I absolutely loved this movie as a child. I can't find it at all! I just mentioned it to other friends, and none of them remember it! Can someone help me? My older sister remembers it vaguely. There was also a movie I remember it was half-live action and half animation, but I can't remember its name. The characters were animated and the background really was ... I look like it is about a kangaroo, and I believe the introduction of the movie was in Australia. I'm going out of my mind to get copies of these movies that were such an unforgettable part of my very enjoyable childhood. Edit: I searched IMDb for this other movie and found it called Dot and the Kangaroo! All I had to do was in "kangaroo" in the search box under the characters, and the name of the movie in the list was like a bell going down! MAN, I love IMDb! Thank you!
