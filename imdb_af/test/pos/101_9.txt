It's a very, very strange movie ... one that is so strange, it's the best you just see for yourself. The movie starts with a happy professor who is haranguing his class because the students have the audacity not to be as incredibly brilliant as he is! You can very quickly say that this man is a total cynical - the value is found in almost nothing but his own inner sense of self-interest. In addition, he seems tired and bored with the monotony of life. <br /> <br /> Later in the film he runs into a bank robbery and controls the robbers so badly that they shoot one in the head. Strangely, it's just halfway through the movie and what followed was a very bizarre tale of the last seconds of his life. This is when the movie becomes exciting because the style of the story is just like one of these literary professions novels - one that is intelligently written and says things like we want, we can all say it. <br /> <br /> See this strange movie - it's incredibly compelling and not like I've ever seen.
