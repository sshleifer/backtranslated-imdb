SPOILER ALERT !!! <br /> <br /> You can listen to Wong Kar-wai's movies like a radio game: Invisible vibrations between the characters, the rooms in which they stay, the rhythm they put for print, attraction and aversion - the whole spectrum of the atmosphere is played by the soundtrack. The dialogue is mostly unimportant. <br /> <br /> The narrative is similar to a childish, blatant look at a beautiful woman and a sad man whose pain is noticeable but helpless. "In The Mood For Love" is told from a children's perspective, but the child never appears as a narrator. The aesthetic of the film is developed by extreme light and color dramaturgy, hard cuts, an unattached, almost documentary camera and a complex, inconspicuous sound. <br /> <br /> The ingenious use of Nat King Cole's "Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps", whose mysterious power becomes more and more, is repeated and the melancholic waltz helps in the graceful choreography of the two protagonists. Maggie Cheung in her beautiful dresses is brilliant, the perfect fish-a-fish for the stylish, stylish Tony Leung. The audience accepted a romance between them, but Wong just saw sad resignation. The two potential lovers turn around like satellites, knowing they will never share the same job. You wish they would find each other. They will not and the emotional power of their non-love sex relationship makes the movie incredibly fascinating. <br /> <br /> It's about broken happiness and unspoken love. In all Wong's films, these are the search engines. Love, whether it's coming too early or it's too late to take one and not the other person. The desire of the characters who are never satisfied, their loneliness, the mourning and the happiness they experience when it is too late.
