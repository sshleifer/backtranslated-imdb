It was a movie of which I read the reviews again and again; and despite being played at Filmmuseum and not at Pathe theaters? I decided to try this movie. The reasons were very ?? In the reviews it was compared to Pulp Fiction, it had several parallel stories in the movie and lastly both won 17 awards internationally in several categories. I was eager to see this movie and when I was at Greenpeace, I decided to make myself happy by watching this movie. <br /> <br /> This is a story based in Finland. I think it reflects the current life of people in general ?? drugs, crime, sex, anger, anxiety, fear and guilt. Every emotion is captured brilliantly in the movie. There are several characters and stories interwoven, but some characters come back in the last half? Make a link with the beginning series and it takes the story forward. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends ?? one of whom is computer spirit and the other is a drug addict? son of an abused father. The drug addict boy is dealing with a Euro 500 note ?? printed by his friend ?? to buy back his music system, and in return he gets a big change from cash to buy more drugs. Trading the Euro 500 note remains bizarre events ?? from the shopkeeper to a car mechanic cum rower ?? to a car dealer ?? to a vacuum cleaner salesman ?? to a prostitute? to a police officer? then to her family and children. How is the beginning of a small thing? create a chain reaction that even leads to a depressing last note after 5 years of that first incident ?? what I will not reveal here. <br /> <br /> The direction is excellent. The character development in the movie is first class. The character that fits your head, even after coming out of the movie, is from the vacuum cleaner sales person. All the departments of the movie are handled well. Here I would like to make some critical comments. First, in the order of one event that led to another, I felt that the accidents were too fast and forced. But this script writing error is a pity when you see the whole canvas. Secondly, the route of one character that somehow leads to another leads back to the first two characters and it was once again a forced decision by the screenwriter. There was no need to show the same characters again if there were different causes leading to such a big city. <br /> <br /> But after you say that? this is an excellent movie! It's a dark movie with a few sex scenes. The characters have the black, white and gray shades and emotions that change from different situations that are brilliantly captured by the director. <br /> <br /> A Top Movie! It has all the ingredients to become a cult film. I hope that just such movies shouldn't be and gain the status of cultural films and win many awards, because without crime, sex, violence, drugs, etc. Can one also make fantastic movies? Bicycle thieves and Pather Panchali are his first examples ?? The only thing is that they were back a long time and changed times and I think movies reflect current times.
