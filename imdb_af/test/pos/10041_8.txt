Errol Flynn at its best as Robin Hood of the West, who fights military hassles, confederates, Indians and carpet dredges for his big and final heroic end. Not to forget the ever-reliable O. de Havilland as Lady Mary of the West. Never try to link this story to the facts and the right people, it doesn't work out. Just enjoy it because no one ever claimed to make documentary documents when Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn worked together.
