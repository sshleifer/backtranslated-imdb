In the early 19th century, a young woman with a harelip fell foul of her family's ambition and the superstitions of the local community, but she met a man who could see her differently and might just change Pru's life forever. <br /> <br /> Precious Bane is a British Broadcasting Corporation adaptation of Mary Webb's highly acclaimed novel. It is a beautifully filmed piece that performed to an incredibly high standard. The story {Maggie Wadey} screen is excellent, and the time detail and use of dialect is unmatched. It is so unfortunate that this movie will not yet get a DVD edition, if one thought that Clive Owen (here like Gideon) would come to star, the BBC would get it there, but unfortunately no, so the only way to catch it is TCM on the rare occasions. The main achievement of Janet McTeer as Pru Sarn is simply brilliant, guts and true emotion go hand in hand while McTeer gives it to everyone. Pru should not only argue with her facial rejection, but also the constant cuts and sores of the ignorant inhabitants. It was a time when people believed that a Hair ran before a pregnant woman, it once said, a time of Bull Baiting, a time of superstitions and talking of witches. Despite constant setbacks, Pru is strong and resourceful, even her own family is beating her dreams back without realizing it, but this path may be a terrible bumpy one, but hope is eternal and Pru has plenty of hope. <Br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
