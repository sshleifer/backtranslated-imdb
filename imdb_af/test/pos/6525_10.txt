For a movie shot over 18 days and a budget of less than 2 million, this little movie can be a 'best we can' award. Interesting starting point (apart from the usual meteorite devices) with solid perforations through a molded familiar face. 2 inches up. Advice to the other reviewer: Don't be afraid to say you liked something.
