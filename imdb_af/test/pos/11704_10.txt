<br /> <br /> Crackerjack, starring Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy - both part of the movie in the early 90's comedy show, The Late Show, Bill Hunter, an Australian movie icon and John Clarke. watch regularly on Australian TV alongside Brian Dawe. <br /> <br /> Crackerjack is barely a guy in his early 30's (Jack Simpson, played by Mick Malloy) who pays his annual memebership at the local bakkie club to get some parking bays for which he uses himself and others as affordable city center rental. <br /> <br /> The club falls in tough times and pulls all the resources and memebers together, this can get Jack a call to tell him to come to next Saturday's bakkie game or his membership (and thus she parking space). <br /> <br /> I won't spoil the rest, but the movie is funny, light and contains everything a good movie has to do. <br /> <br /> If you're not Australian, some of the jokes and humor will make you dissatisfied if you're an Aussie - do yourself a favor and put yourself down on Crackerjack. It's now available on DVD, I already have my copy! <br /> <br /> 10/10 .. Awesome movie! <br /> <br />
