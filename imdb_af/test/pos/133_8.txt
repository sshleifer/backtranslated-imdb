WASTE WARNING! Don't read unless you're prepared for some spoilers. <br /> <br /> I think this movie had a lot under its cover. Besides the apparent connections with Oldboy (and Park's other films), a turbulent relationship in this one really disturbed me, and also the subtle erotic theme that hung around all the vampire physical action. <br /> <br /> The lead actor, Kang-ho Song, is fantastic in the role of the priest Sang-hyeon - coincidentally, "sang" means "blood" in some languages ​​- which really loved Tae-ju , played by OK-bin Kim. Their relationship reminds me a lot of Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in "Badlands", where the girl appears psychopathic and the man is basically wrapped over her finger. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is one thing, but the girl's mother is completely different. As she moves, she is stiff, one-dimensional and stiff, but paralyzed, she says all by not moving, or by the eye of an eye. <br /> <br /> Parkwook really mastered his cinematography in this movie, and owes much to Stanley Kubrick; There are plenty of beautiful shots scattered throughout the film, some for simple effects and some that require a variety of cans and probably capture repeated views. <br /> <br /> The music is fairly stocked and mostly uses strings to accompany. the main thespian's monoreaction; It is a very good thing that the character is as drawn as he is. While doing very little and losing with it, he seems rather a person who thinks a lot. While his love interests say and do, her actions show very little thought. In my humble opinion. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very disturbing movie not made for action, which is not even in the same dimension as most things about vampires today; It's beautiful, and repulsive at the same time.
