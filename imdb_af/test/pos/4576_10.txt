I recommend Idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the film is insightful and made me laugh so loudly that I had several tears in my face. To the end when I took a breath and realized how close we were to Judge's vision of tomorrow is. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on a cameo by the old Mac ads (Justin Long) like dr. Lexus. I found his performance Oscar-worthy, especially in the light of what Oscars has been released lately. Besides, he's cute. <br /> <br /> In short, idiocracy is a deadly funny look at a possible future where people are named after brand names (the president's middle name is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $ 5 billion, there are rubbish mountains because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it, and no one cares about anything except money. Because just stupid people breeding. Sounds familiar to me somehow. Oh yes; That's what I think about when I see professional wrestling. <br /> <br /> Take a close look at this movie. It's a good laugh and it will make you think.
