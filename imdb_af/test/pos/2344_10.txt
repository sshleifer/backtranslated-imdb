I was lucky to see this movie at a festival last year and half expected it to get a release. The fact that it was shot on a digital camcorder certainly ignored its success, but as I understand it, it was never the intention of the filmmaker to look like film in the first place. It was more about the story of the characters and their relationships. Isn't that what movies are going to be about! But it had a quality in the texture of its visual appearance, suggesting that May Thomas is something we should pay attention to. For independent filmmakers and producers who have a talent and not the money and drive, much can be learned to watch this movie, technically it is all there is to it, using light, music, etc. another digital movie I've ever seen and that's why it is very laudable. The actors' performances are credible to a point, if not played a little, I felt there was much more in there, more depth, especially of male head John Paul Clarke. But one thing that really saves me as a movie maker is that the film in black and white is a need to cover a lot of sins if it was color? Do we learn more about digital technology progress? Or is it the future of wonderful, affordable filmmaking?
