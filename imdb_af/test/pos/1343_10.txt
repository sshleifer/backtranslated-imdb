One of the best memories of my childhood. Must be on DVD. It took everything we grew up in the seventies - peace, gentleness, flower power and good acoustic music. The two hosts, Carol and Paula, were the definite Peacenik hippies, with long hair, boar loops and bells (they looked like a Katherine Ross (ala "The Graduate") and Ali McGraw (ala "Love Story").) <br /> <br /> They made us happy with jokes from the daisy "chucklepatch", gave us lessons to be entertained by conversations with the garden worm garden and entertained us with music from their guitar. They were the best, and Carol was also the original Sandy in the original production of "Grease" (cool). <br /> <br /> This show should be in a time capsule of the era that will also include "The Yellow Submarine", "Arrow to the Sun" and Marlo Thomas, "Free to Be ... You & Me "" Also, "Sunshine" and "The Point." <br /> <br /> And last, but not least, that theme song, "See you, see you, Hope you have a good, good time , ah ha, Glad we have to say good mornin to you. Hope we'll see you again. See ya, see you, glad you can stay awhile, ah ha, hope we see you again, see you, see you.
