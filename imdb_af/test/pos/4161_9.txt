Golden doors are enhanced by Agnes Godard's expressive cinematography (Beau Travail). It is a visual drawing poem that follows the journey of a farmer's family from their primitive home in Sicily to Ellis Island in New York at the beginning of the century. It is a surrealistic, mysterious, often weird, but ultimately profound experience. Filming dreamy and symbolic images with eager realism, the latest film by Emanuele Crialese (Respiro), is like an impressionist painting - a film artist's version of what the immigration process for our parents and grandparents would have been possible. Crialese's "magic puzzle tour" arose as a result of his visit to the museum on Ellis Island, the look of the faces of the immigrants portrayed in photographs he saw and his investigation into the strict policies and procedures used while admitting immigrants. <br /> <br /> Led by letters he read from immigrants who were sent to family members who stayed at home, identify Crialese with the poor immigrants who could see the positive side of things outside their trials. To Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his older son Angelo (Francesco Casisa), America is a distant dream they know nothing about. After climbing a rocky mountain to pray for the saints for a sign, they are rewarded as showing their postcards of Salvatore's younger son, Pietro (Filippo Pucillo), a deaf dumb, portraying the new world as " a country where they can bathe. in rivers milk, put under a money tree or harvest giant onions and roots. <br /> <br /> After selling their animals in exchange for shoes and suits, Salvatore, his two sons and his elderly mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) set out on their adventure with more hope than stress, but the equation quickly changes the other side. While taking the boat on board and arriving in their busy third-class steering compartments, the most talked-about play takes place in the movie. Using an overhead camera that many people see standing while the ship is moving away, the frame is divided into those aboard the ship and the farewell of the cabin and the way they are separated implies that they is known. br /> <br /> On board the ship is a mysterious English woman named Lucy (Charlotte Gainsbourg). Crialian does not reveal her past or why she travels to America, but she appears to be starting the modern world in which they go. Although they see each other carefully, Lucy is interested in Salvatore and asks him to marry her to allow her to enter the country. The trip is treacherous with a violent storm that buffalo the ship. Shot in almost full darkness, passengers are being thrown into the side of the boat and lightly lighted and turned on the floor as if in a macabre Totentanz. The use of immigration processing at Ellis Island is not easier, and Crialian attacks such as illiterate farmers, in the name of civilized society, are forced to merge puzzles, carry out mathematical tasks and undergo humiliating medical examinations to prove that they "fit" is. <br /> <br /> A marital ceremony feels like an auction block and the young women seem discouraged when they agree with overweight middle-aged men. This is the only way they can enter the "Golden Door" as single women are rejected unless they have partners, apparently to prevent the threat of prostitution. Through the dung, the immigrant can hardly see the land of milk and honey and there is no Statue of Liberty asking for the tired and poor, the humiliated masses desire to breathe. In their imagination, however, the river still flows and waits for them to jump in. Although the end is ambiguous and one door opens to an empty wall, another symbolizes a rebirth of the soul and the part we all must take the old world to new.
