Whether one sees him as a brave cavalier of the plains or a glory of hunting selfishness, debates on the life and military career of George Armstrong Custer remain to this day. They died with their boots. Based on certain facts of the Custer story and freedom with others. <br /> <br /> He graduated from the bottom of his class at West Point and obtained this overnight promotion on the battlefield. to the Brigadier General. His record that led the Michigan Regiment under his command was one of brilliance. <br /> <br /> It was also true that his marriage to Libby Bacon was one of the great love games of the 19th century. Libby and George were married for 12 years to the little horn. What is not yet known today is that Libby survived until 1933. During this time she was the custodian of the Custer legend. Through her own iron will and personality power, her late husband became a hero because she would not let him remember in any other way. <br /> <br /> I think Raoul Walsh and Warner Brothers missed a good opportunity To tell the Custer career. Olivia DeHavilland had to be made like Jeanette MacDonald in May, and tell the story of her husband and her marriage from the point of view of nostalgia and memory. Even then, the cracks appear in the Custer legend, but if done from Libby's point of view, they can understand and be forgiven. <br /> <br /> Sydney Greenstreet has a good performance as General Winfield Scott. The only problem was that Scott had nothing to do with Custer, he was retired and later replaced George B. McClellan in 1861, while Custer was still in West Point. I'm not sure they've ever met. But Greenstreet is a good characterization of the spectacular and powerful Winfield Scott. A good Mexican War story should have given them Greenstreet instead of his very accurate portrayal of old Fuss and Feathers. <br /> <br /> However, the film is made by one of the great romantic teams of film Errol Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland. It was the last of eight movies they did together. The last scene they ever did for the cameras was Libby's farewell to George, as he left his regiment for what his last campaign would be. Both their performances, Olivia, were a highlight in their careers at Warner Brothers. We know through history that Custer is driving his punishment, this and the fact that it was their last teamwork, gives this scene such a special poignancy. If your eyes are not watering, you are made of marble. <br /> <br /> As history, they died with their shoes. This leaves much to be desired. If a western adventure that combines romance with the action successfully, you can't beat this movie at all.
