I just saw it, an early Harold Lloyd short film containing his "glasses" character on the Kino Video's "The Harold Lloyd Collection" DVD. He is actually a kingman with Snub Pollard as his partner who is discovered by Bebe Daniels who performs fake seances herself. What she discovers is that Lloyd and Pollard bilk drop many customers through lost fake rings. I'll stop there and just say it's very funny, especially when Harold and Snub enter the place, Bebe works and meets some creepy contraptions and puts on costumes like Snub's one of Bebe's outfits. Not too much slapstick, but whatever it was, was also very funny. So, on that note, I guess Is Crooks Dishonest?
