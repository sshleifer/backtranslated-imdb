The phenomenon Helge Schneider denies easy description or quick categorization. Yet, for the international audience not known to him, one might say he's something like a rough mix of Weird Al Yankovich and Andy Kaufman. He added a foreground to Jazz music and 70's outfits. While his stage performance is already eccentric, his movie work is just hilariously outrageous. <br /> <br /> In my opinion "00 Schneider" is Helge's best movie. He died in the two leading roles - police detective "Kommissar 00 Schneider" and killer villain "Nihil Baxter", and also in a precious smaller role than doctor "Dr. Hasenbein". <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, we see modern Baxter Baxter accidentally killing the circus clown Bratislav Metulskie, from whom he bought a malfunctioning Jaguar, when a beloved sculpture from Baxter's hands stretched out and Metulskie deadly. After reading about the incident in the newspaper, 00 returned from retirement to investigate the case with the support of his loyal sidekick, Lt. Koerschgen, played by an elderly actor of the same name. They quickly pick up Baxter's job, and question him at his oddly decorated house (one of the best screens of the movie!), But initially fails to gather any evidence. The story blows through many turns, with several scenes not always really contributing to the progress of the plot, but is hilariously funny, like a daydream by 00 (including the most unusual view of a running man's short-sleeved cross in movie history), a police department party in which Koerschgen joins the head, must be admitted to hospital, and a visit to the mentioned doctor. Hasenbein. Baxter was finally caught to escape on a plane to Rio de Janeiro. <br /> <br /> Always worth mentioning is Andreas Kunze who plays 00's wife in this case, as he usually occurs in wearing women's roles. in Helge's Movies. <br /> <br /> So, anyone you are looking for is looking for a laugh, I strongly recommend this movie. The catch? You need to understand German (as I doubt there is an English version)) ...
