It's a very funny short film that didn't impress me at first. From a purely aesthetic point of view, the animation is certainly not beautiful here, but after a while you see that the simple and silly drawings possess a certain strange charm. That's probably because the screen screws like this one work. The animation works. <br /> <br /> The movie shows an older couple sitting at the table playing Scrabble. At the same time they get fit on this game or other bizarre activities (like the man's compulsion to see things - even the chair and table)! And all these things happen when the television warns of the persistent atomic destruction - Armageddon is definitely here! Of course, the neighbors are screaming and running amok - during which time the couple are unaware of this idiotic game. Heck, even their cat knows the end is coming when the couple begins to begging over who may or may not have cheated - which leads to a very surreal end indeed !! The movie earns kudos for both unique and very funny. While it didn't win the Oscar, it was nominated for Best Animated Short - which earned it richly.
