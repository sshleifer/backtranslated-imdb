Graphically, it is the same game as the first one that just added different levels and some new features were added for fun. <br /> <br /> The PS1 version still has a problem giving skaters plenty of air for some ground pressure. The Dreamcast version, which is rarely seen, was the best version of the 4 versions (Xbox finally came out with a 5th with 2x), it had the clearer resolution and the skaters look better and more detailed the PS1 and N64 could handle. <br /> <br /> The levels are really done amazingly, from start to finish, like the first one, the school was my favorite, I had so much from the level, not just for the golf cart that will sometimes overflow you but for the length. That's what I liked about the first two games, they don't improve these games graphically, they just focused on the length of the levels, which is cool. <br /> <br /> Overall, just as good as the first one, and worth playing.
