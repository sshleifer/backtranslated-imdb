044: The Big Trail (1930) - released 10/24/1930; seen 4/5/06. BIRTH: Richard Harris, Harold Pinter, Robert Atkins. <br /> <br /> DOUGH: In Hollywood, Raoul Walsh unveils his latest movie, The Big Trail, a western cross-border draw, the leading role of emerging 23-year-old John Wayne. In 1930 we see many "firsts", but little "best". In addition to the first John Wayne movie, we have the first widescreen movie here (although we just watched the full-frame version). Interestingly, the decision to film in the wide screen was essentially the same reason that widescreen later became popular: to compete with television, which has not yet appeared commercially, but was still an emerging curiosity. The same, this film was extremely good, which gave us a grieving look on the train to Oklahoma. The opening title cards let us know that this is a western of the most traditional kind, about America, across the country, that has to live on it, and that is an excellent proof of that. Walsh gives us an amazing footage of the wagon company in the desert (when they reach a wreath, they must make each one one by one), and we also get a revenge subplot in which Wayne the man who is one of murdered his friends, pursued (I can remember something similar in Stagecoach). Wayne's tough cowboy routine is at least partially there, and will surely continue to evolve into subsequent films. As this film represents all of Wayne's early 30's work for the Odyssey, we won't see his face again to Stagecoach, but as soon as we do, we'll see him at the end of the Odyssey. <br /> <br /> KEVIN: Ah, our first soundtrack, and John Wayne's first lead. This is Raoul Walsh's The Big Trail. This review will be brief because it was weeks since I watched it. I enjoyed this movie, but it was far from a masterpiece. The most predictable adventure had some surprises, such as when the brain of the bad guys, Red Flack (Tyrone Power Sr. in his last role) become half-confused; I thought he would eventually be the boss, but eventually it became Bill Thorpe (Ian Keith). I remember not having the way Breck (Wayne) kills Thorpe and at the end gives revenge. I understood that it was the intention to do the story, but I really didn't like his reasoning when he told Ruth why he should do it. I think he had a much greater responsibility towards the hundreds of settlers he had led through the harsh west. <br /> <br /> Latest movie being watched: Animal Crackers (1930). Last film chronologically: Soup to Nuts (1930). Next film: L'Age D'or (1930).
