One of MGM's enduring classics emerged at the end of World War II, which is the movie made by young Elizabeth Taylor. She did some movies as a children's actress before National Velvet, but when it came out, her place in the movies was assured. Ironically, she would grow up soon enough after National Velvet came out and her next battle as an actress had to gain considerable adult roles, as the decisive directors only saw her as innocent Velvet Brown who loved her jumping horse. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure how it will work, because steeplechase horses should have confirmed bloodlines and the PIs are a topic not covered in National Velvet. All we know is that he is a reckless and incessant horse in the hands of Reginald Owen and, after acquitting himself and causing considerable damage, Owen gets rid of him for a nominal prize to local butcher Donald Crisp. <br /> <br /> Simultaneously with these things, Mickey Rooney happens in the lives of the Brown family consisting of Crisp, wife Anne Revere, and girls Angela Lansbury, Juanita Quigley, and Elizabeth Taylor and their little brother Butch Jenkins. Rooney is a former jockey who is on the open road and goes to the Brown family, where his father once was a horse coach for Anne Revere's family. It is he who sees the potential of the Pi (short for pirate) as a steeplechase jersey and it is Elizabeth who convinces Crisp not to give this opportunity. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor was so sweet and innocent in National Velvet. The Good Book says you have to believe like a child and she has to save. She adds Rooney to have faith in the heart and ability of the Pi and leave a little. <br /> <br /> Anne Revere won a Best Supporting Actress National Velvet Award. She is a very wise mother who has hid depths for her who do not suspect the audience. She seems to have had a taste of fame and glory in her youth to swim the English Channel and her prize money, saved her years, she told her daughter. This scene is probably what won her the Oscar. National Velvet also won an Oscar award for film show. <br /> <br /> More than 60 years after it made its debut, National Velvet did not lose a thing as a family classic. The portrayal of life between the World Wars in Great Britain is still an outstanding one. And National Velvet started a film legend. Can't do much better than it does for high standing.
