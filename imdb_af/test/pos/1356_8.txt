This film was a wonderful skirt, intelligent, playful, mysterious, full of surprises, with humor in strange places and awesome energy. The well-known film director (the lead actor) and the events he tries to manipulate through film are entangled in fascinating ways, as he is almost out of control by a prince who has never heard of him. There are wonderful rich images throughout and roads suggested but not followed (exactly what happens to the gloomy woman of the pedestrian-tourist-wedding director?). The end is so much better to be sloppy. Realism and logic is not what you need here. If we want to change our weddings and our imaginative lives to film directors, we need to be prepared for a game drive, which predicts this movie.
