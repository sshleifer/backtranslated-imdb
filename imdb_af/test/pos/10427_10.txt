It must be one of the best movies we've seen and we highly recommend exposing the bigotry iniquities. Billy Wirth is an incomparable actor and truly wonderful as Corby / White Wolf. However, it feels that the story would be improved if his character had more scenes. It's a movie that can be watched over and over again without difficulty.
