I must say: from all modern Korean martial arts movies, this one is worth checking out. It wasn't as epic as Musa-The Warriors and didn't develop the characters, but it had very good ideas. Simple story: An elite soldier thought dead, returning to years to end the Japanese government in the Middle Ages. His counterpart had previously been the best friend he had and now he's out to stop him. The battle scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch. The motifs of the figures are only discovered after the end. You might have to look again to get all the connections right. And I personally ... I loved the end. I could see it over and over again. Maybe it's a bit pathetic, but a true freedom fighter story .... People can be murdered, but not the ideas they stand for.
