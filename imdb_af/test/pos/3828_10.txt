I just thought I'd add another comment here. While there are some visual sub-references in this episode, the possibility of unexpressed feelings between Jim Kirk and Yeoman is Janice Rand; There is a special, physical, instant, moment to the end. When the company reverses an emergency in an attempt to bypass a possible fatal Romulan plasma ball, Janice may, perhaps fearing their lives come to a dramatic end, try to comfort her by putting her head on Jim's sympathetic shoulder while observing. the moving tool of their impending punishment on the main viewer. I thought it was sweet (and of course Janice is beautiful!). <br /> <br /> (P.S. Goof: - Several times, while presumably firing phasors, the film shows that photographic torpedoes are being launched)
