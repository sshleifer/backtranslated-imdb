"You can't take it realistically." sheets <br /> <br /> Zombie Blood Bath 2 (ZB2) is a world of its own. I have never seen anything like this. The only thing I can think of to compare is psychedelic drugs. Forgive the clich√© ?? I don't just mean it's incoherent and absurd, though sometimes. I mean it will take you such a wide variety of intense experiences and unexpected emotions so quickly to overwhelm you, and when it's over, you'll find that all this happened while you were sitting on the couch. <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy that it is extremely low budget, as an indemnity for those who, after seeing "Shaun of the Dead", consider themselves supporters of underground zombie films. Also note is that it is much more "brutal" than you would expect. Children are disrupted, and someone takes a teenage girl before she's shot in the groin. Her body is then raped. This is definitely no fault, and I believe it is the movie's credit. But if that doesn't sound like your kind of movie, don't waste your time. <br /> <br /> (I don't mean to overpower it, in terms of cruelty. Don't expect "Inside" or something.) I hesitate to give away any of the plot because it's many surprises . Even the opening scene, which has nothing to do with zombies, is immediately a classic horror scene and something original. <br /> <br /> Man, I'm in three paragraphs and I didn't say anything at all. . Here's why I thought the movie was wonderful: 1. It's big, and it keeps moving. At one point you expect it to be another NotLD clone, a board-up-the-windows movie where everyone stays in a farmhouse and argues with each other. However, by the end of the film, the farmhouses will look like a distant dream. There are also a number of outdoor, urban scenes. It's rare in low-budget zombie movies. <br /> <br /> 2. The make-up / gore is much better than ZB1. More convincing and more creative. Something funny: the early zombies are really lame. Then, halfway through, they suddenly look very good, with prosthetics and everything. Some of them look like Fulci zombies, some reminiscent of Mr. Tongue of "Day of the Dead." And it has big scenes of dozens of zombies moving around. Never be old. <br /> <br /> 3. There is something strange about it. One character claims that heaven exists, and that our dead / walking protagonists are now in heaven. In the context of the film, we believe it is true. Although the characters are worn with typical horror movie stupidity, they seem to really care about each other. That's why I thought about it. <br /> <br /> 4. The pacing is great. There is hardly a dull moment. <br /> <br /> My only observation that is critical is that Todd Sheets comes the most bizarre dialogue I've ever heard. I personally feel it adds to the experience, but I don't think he deliberately does it, so I can't give the movie a perfect rating. (For example, when a car breaks down, the owner shouts at the passengers. Then he says something with the result: "Sorry, I shouted for you. You don't know how your dad is standing over you with a straight razor when you are five years old. "Wtf?) In the end it gets more than I can handle. Involve a montage with Bill Clinton, and then some preachy end credits explaining the zombie metaphor. Actually, at this point, I relived my drug experience firmly. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10/07.
