Manna From Heaven is a light comedy that exaggerates human foibles to entertain the audience. Throughout the film there is the expectation that goodness will flow into every situation. The result is that the film finds himself / herself with this dull smile on his / her face, peace in his / her heart and high expectations for human nature. Watching this movie was a pleasant experience. (I'd dare say exciting experience, but some would say it might sound!)
