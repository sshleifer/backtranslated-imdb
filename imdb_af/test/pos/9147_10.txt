No matter how many times Wile Ethelbert "Famishius Famishius" Coyote tries to get Road "Burnius Roadibus" Runner, we always know what will happen, although our sympathy always stays with WEC. The highlight of "Hook, Line and Stinker" is a Rube Goldberg style scheme that WEC will hopefully eventually finish. but of course you know what happens. So, Wile E. continues with hilarious involvement in fanaticism (defined by George Santayana to obliterate your effort after you forget your goal) while Road Runner never gets much. aware of the potential danger - or lack thereof - in which he could find himself. A true classic. <br /> <br /> And yes, the coyote's middle name is Ethelbert. I learned it from "Jeopardy".
