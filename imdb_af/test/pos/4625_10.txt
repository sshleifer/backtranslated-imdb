I had the pleasure of seeing this brilliant movie at a Sydney preview. Although it was a pleasure to see it. Pleasure is not the emotion you are left with as the credit roller. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is a movie that not only tackles one stigma felt by young individuals, but all. Head of who is isolation. It is not just to place the final galvanizing scene on a pedestal above the others, but rather it is important to regard it as the highlight. And that's why it's important to realize what it represents for you as well as the viewer and for the people directly involved. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is not a soft picture, but the way Mr Thalluri handles it is subject to a great dignity and that is no tight-knit approach to credit the message. <br /> <br /> I don't think movies like 2:37 should be scaled down by favor. Instead, it should be recommended for those looking for that purpose. <br /> <br /> Losing a brilliantly crafted portrait of innocence. And a master stroke for an unprecedented talent. <br /> <br /> Not to be missed.
