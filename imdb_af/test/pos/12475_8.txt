Reckless mercenary Bruno Rivera (Paul Naughty in a nasty shape) betrays his pregnant partner Meiko (played well by Eiko Nagashima) to have exclusive dibs on a fortune in stolen diamonds. But Meiko can seriously hurt Bruno before he gets away. Bruno wind up in the poor chalet of friendly rich doctor Don Simon (a good performance by Lautaro Murua). He also draws the attention of Simon's two hottest girls: the fiery Monica (nice Silvia Aguiler) and the lovely Alicia (nicely set up by the beautiful Azucena Hernandez). However, Bruno soon realizes that something is wrong about the secluded place and plans to escape as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the bitter Meiko Bruno is trying to find her revenge on him. Naschy, who has written and arranged stars as well, has ever faced one of his strangest, most twisted and perverse horror vehicles with this lesser known strangeness. The indisputable plot and mysterious atmosphere become more strange and unpleasant as the story unfolds, eventually leading to a sincere surprising end. This movie also benefits from occasional moments of graphic gore (look for the memorable sequence with a poor guy who is consumed alive by fleshy piglets!), Alejandro Ulloa's shiny cinematography, and a decent sprinkling of nudity and soft core sex. Good supporting turns by Roxana Dupre as sassy girl Raquel, Pepe Ruiz as amorous playboy Don Serafin, and Julia Saly as the confused Teresa. A pleasant grim and worth shocking.
