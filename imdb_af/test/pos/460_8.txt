In Hungary in November 1956, it is the story of a group of strangers trying to leave the country at the time of the uprising. <br /> <br /> Once the airport is closed, the titular journey starts a bus that takes them to Austria. As is obvious, they are stopped on their way, where they come against the almost flawless Yul Brynner, whose military power as a Red Army Major has been marked with loneliness, his internal struggle between right and wrong, his quest to the truth and its need to feel emotions for other people. He was saddened by the fact that his work alienated him from his friends and enemies, and he asked for social contact. <br /> <br /> Robert Morley plays the distinctive, stiff, boisterous English man who, no matter how serious the role, manages an almost logical life view while Jason Robards maintains a beautiful film debut for the reason he have so many roles in his career. Deborah Kerr, as the leading lady, displays the grace and femininity we've got to associate her, but controls the power and solution needed for her character. <br /> <br /> The movie deals with a very stormy time in European history, but it never stops reminding us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely cover a book by cover judge not. Spectacular writing ensures that over the subject of the subject is still one-liners and comic cases that add, rather than harm the movie. The chemistry in the cat and mouse game between Kerr and Brynner lets you understand why they appear in more than one movie together. <br /> <br /> All in all, a very thorough movie I will definitely watch again. 8/10
