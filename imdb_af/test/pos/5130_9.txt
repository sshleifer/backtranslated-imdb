Hoot is a pretty simple movie with a simple message. It looks like this movie was for young children, but I know adults will keep this movie. The storyline is pretty simple. A child who moved to Florida needs to help a sock sock and an extinct, comfortable owl to build a pancake house. The message in this movie is great, especially for animal activists and lovers. The message is about everything you can to save endangered animals. The play in this movie is decent. All three children seemed to have had good chemistry. The music is not too loose. I love Jimmy Buffet's songs in this movie. Overall it's a good family movie. I rate this movie a 9/10.
