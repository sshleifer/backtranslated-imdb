The movie is incredible, it has a soundtrack that sets the tone for the movie. The lines in the movie are wonderful, such as "Nothings to good for out friends" and "Its collection time Charlie collection time." I can see this movie over and over and still laugh because the lines and action are one of a kind. I feel like watching this movie, I want to go out and shoot bad guys. If there is a movie, you don't want to miss it. "They killed the Giggler man, they killed the Giggler." "They didn't have the right to do it. The lines just stay in the movie. Deff. Go out and rent but buy this movie worth the money to trust me.
