I'm a big Gone With The Wind nut, but I was disappointed that both Gone With The Wind is the movie and Scarlett's mini series is so different from the books. Gone With The Wind left so many things in the movie that were in the book and they did the same with Scarlett. Both were good movies, but I really looked like both books. There were so many characters left out of Scarlett, and some characters did not match the book. The timelines also do not match. Scarlett realizes she is pregnant on the ship to Ireland in the book, but she realizes this when she throws in Savahanna. Sally is also an ugly monkey like a woman in the book and the movie cast Jean Smart to play her, which of course is not an ugly woman. All in all, Scarlett is a good movie, and it helps someone who was disappointed in the way Gone With The Wind ended up seeing what might have happened if Margaret Mitchell could write a successor herself.
