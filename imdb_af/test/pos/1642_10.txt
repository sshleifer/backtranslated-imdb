Ice the Limerick: <br /> <br /> A virus came out of the ice. <br /> <br /> Just didn't know how to play nicely. <br /> <br /> If you are infected, you will kill <br /> <br /> Because you're sick. <br /> <br /> The healing is contaminated twice. <br /> <br /> Ice is a big episode; one of the sizes of season 1 that started the show and if you ask me, you really can't ask much better throughout the series. It starts with a wonderful teaser which, in my opinion, is also one of the best teasers of the series. A group of scientists in Alaska drilled something out of the refrigerator that for some reason caused them to kill each other. Now Mulder and Scully are sent with three other scientists to investigate what happened. As Mulder says, it is either because they are brilliant or consumable. I take it to mean that they were better brilliant or different ... The group soon finds out that the cause of chaos is a small parasite out of the fridge. A little worm coming into the bloodstream and causing violent behavior. Since the pilot has been infected, the rest of the show changes to an exciting kind of what-it-paranoial thriller, while others suspect each other they are infected. It is not helped at all by an exaggerated paranoid doctor Hodge who does not trust someone who knows us early: to see everyone's credentials to make sure we are who we say we are. Events lead to the discovery of the infected and learn how to heal them. <br /> <br /> There are a number of things I like about the episode and of course certain characters I want to face in this episode, as well as some loopholes, but most can be attributed to increased caution and not clear thinking. I love Bear from the moment I meet him first. It's a shame he must die. I also like the scene shown from the other scientist's point of view, as Mulder and Scully argue in the other room. It gives an interesting twist to our typical perception as a viewer and to me it may seem that we should not accept that just because somebody means the government knows all sorts of conspiracy secrets. As much as Hodges frustrates me in this episode, I think Mulder owes so much to some of the rash action taken. I really like Scully in this episode. First, she can approach a frickin linebacker! Secondly, I really like the focus on her terror of what can happen to them and how she tries not to trust and that Mulder's friendship does not enable her to bias her judgment. I love the scene when she goes to sleep in the room to sleep and first the picture of the previous group all seems to hug and the birthday gift from those who sleep in the room and how does she suddenly go out and put in the dressing room in front of the door and in a final touch of subtlety while sitting on the floor with her knees in her chest, we see the bottom of a poster on the wall saying, "Bosom Buddies". It's such a good writing. A way to say without any words that Scully is worried she might not even trust her best friend. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this group suspects that Mulder is infected because he discovered Murphy's dead body although they didn't inspect him at all to make sure. This was my biggest problem with the behavior of the characters, because they could easily solve all the suspicions by simply giving blood. But I think I would probably have rashly acted in that situation too. But then stupid Hodges decided that he had to assume that Mulder was infected, although Mulder surrendered voluntarily and then willingly inspected and Mulder became infected in the process. Fortunately, he sees that it is really Dasilva who is infected and we finally reach a resolution. At least as much as you can expect from an X file. The "government" does not waste time addressing the evidence as always in these cases, and Mulder is another frustrating "unresolved" case. Eventually I give "Ice" and easy 10/10 and I leave you with a haiku. <br /> <br /> "We're not who we are. It doesn't go beyond that. It ends here now."
