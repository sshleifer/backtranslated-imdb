My Mother Frank starts out as a warm, friendly comedy about a middle-aged Catholic woman (Frank, short for Francis, played by Sinead Cusack) who shakes herself out of the room by enrolling her as a student in her son's university. Most of her friends and family are terrible, especially her son (Matthew Newton), who is in love with his best friend's girlfriend (Rose Byrne). Meanwhile, Frank raised the seriousness of her disapproving English tutor (Sam Neill). <br /> <br /> Matthew Newton is totally disarming as David; relaxed and natural in the role, even when the character acted. He generates valuable benevolence and sends the audience through some of the movie's uncomfortable, broad comedy moments. Not long after halfway, first-hand writer-director Mark Lamprell pushes his film into a darker emotional area and gives Cusack a real chance to shine. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is full of familiar and welcoming faces (Lynette Curran, Sacha Horler, Nicholas Bishop) and all the principals (including a more animated than usual Sam Neill) are excellent. While leading a little to the end, My Mother Frank delivers more than it promises and is a true Australian crowd delight.
