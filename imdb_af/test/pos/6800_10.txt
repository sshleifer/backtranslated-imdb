In my opinion, National Velvet is one of the best family classics of all time. It has Mickey Rooney as (Mi Taylor) and Elizabeth Taylor as (Velvet Brown). <br /> <br /> Velvet wins a racing horse, called (Pie) in a raffle. She immediately fell in love with it. With the help of Mi, a former jockey, they practice chasing the Grand National's. After the jockey who was ready to fight Pie at the last moment, Mi convinced the Velvet to take his place. <br /> <br /> It was a well-composed film. Fine storyline and top performance. The inner game between Elizabeth and Mickey was magical. This is a wonderful family photo that is expertly directed by Clarence Brown. That photography is amazing. This is a movie you will enjoy for years. <br /> <br /> This photo is what Elizabeth Taylor made a household name. Both Mickey and Elizabeth stay near the movie. They still send postcards after all these years. <br /> <br /> One side note. Elizabeth loved the horse "Pie" so much that the studio gave it to her.
