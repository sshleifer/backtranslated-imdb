This story is an excellent story of two boys doing what they can to get from there, who is drunkard. The star of Elia Wood is an unforgettable role. This movie is one of the main reasons why I haven't touched one beer and will never be as long as I live. It can make me sound like a nerd, but that's what I have to say. It is a wonder why it is not heard as a classic American story.
