I really enjoyed this movie. It combines effective humor, fantasy and a few moments of horror with a solid film-making effort by Higuchinsky. Brilliant visual and a very original story about spirals. My only complaint is that it had its dull moments and was not as daring as it could have been. Yet I give it a solid 8 out of 10. The US should take note of these and other fine Japanese horror / fantasy movies that have recently come and available on Region 1 DVD. In fact, the Asian cinema generally has some of the best films unnoticed by the American public because they are difficult to find. I strongly advise people to look for these treasures, they are hard to find, but once you find them, you'll be glad you did.
