Sonny Chiba, as everyone knows, is the man. In this film he portrays Mas Oyama (1923-1994), a true martial artist who fought and won more than 50 bulls with his bare hands (interesting man, watch him). Anyway, Chiba just makes one bull in the movie, but it's an unforgettable scene and as the linernotas say, come with the zombie vs shark scene in Zombi! The movie also offers a lot of hand-to-hand combat and a decent plot to start, although I don't believe it's right. This film is the first of the Oyama trilogy Chiba made and is recommended for fans of martial arts. Finally, three neat little balls; Part of the opening theme was used in Kill Bill Volume 1, Oyama appeared in the opening series, and that's because he trained Chiba in real life for five years!
