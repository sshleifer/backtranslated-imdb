While sitting in the theater, I almost cried for the cruelty, Ron Howard and Tom Hanks, the Da Vinci code, I couldn't see the light at the end of the tunnel that is Angels and Demons. <br /> <br /> Hanks and Company are back for the Sequel Prequel Angels and Demons, and they learned their lesson. <br /> <br /> Wise manner everyone is much better. Aylet Zurer is very good as Vittoria Vetra, and better than the girl Sophie Neveau played. Tom Hanks is very good as always, but he is better in this because he works harder to give the movie the feeling that it is a thrill. I think Ewan McGregor does the best work of any of the actors. He may even deserve a nomination coming March, but doubtful. He convinced me to the end. He is dynamic and faithful, but rational, and realizes that the church must put their past behind them. The minor actors also do very good work. <br /> <br /> Technically and visually, the film is much improved. The cinematography is much ... much better, and the visual effects are wonderful. The final blast sequence at the end is excellent. Howard does a masterful job taking you through a tour in Rome. <br /> <br /> Pac Howard shows a wonderful job of moving this story, and we don't surprise us with a history lesson. rejection of Christianity. The movie also makes you feel more at stake. In our weaknesses to find out if Jesus had children, it is not so high on the list compared to a disastrous explosion that kills thousands, including the Roman Catholic Church. Part of the reason I think the story is so fast is because of the excellent score. I can't say enough about the score. It was sometimes epic, like something of Lord of the Rings, but sometimes it feels like a Bourne movie, which is a nice mix. <br /> <br /> My only complaint about this movie is that it's ridiculously far-fetched. The chances of the Carmelengo being someone of Ewan McGregor's age is highly unlikely, and the chances of a cardinal with an adopted son who became the chosen father are even more ridiculous. Not to mention the whole Antimatter thing that still needs to be created and Dan Brown wrote the book in 2003. <br /> <br /> Overall Angels and Demons are much stricter, faster, more exciting and more important than the Da Vinci Code. It has to see thriller for anyone who loves history and mystery combined into one.
