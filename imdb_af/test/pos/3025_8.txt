"The Cell" is a fairly difficult movie to classify. If you read the plot sketch, "Traveling a psychotherapist in a careless serial killer in the hope of saving his youngest victim," you might think it's a thrill with a touch of science fiction. But it doesn't really make this movie justice. There is a fantasy aspect within the subconscious thoughts that are wonderful, with cute visual and incredible thoughts. There is drama, as the aforementioned psychotherapist (played by Lopez before becoming a romantic comedy component) comes into contact with the child inside and witnessing his terrible education. And there is definitely a horrible facet due to the sickening behavior of the serial killer's evil person. The movie tries to function at many different levels and crosses genre boundaries. While I feel it is a rather bizarre experience, I find it quite fascinating. <br /> <br /> Off the opening credits, with Lopez riding a horse through the desert dressed in a white dress will know you're in a visual treat. Each time the audience leaves reality and follows her in the subconscious depths of her "patients", they are guaranteed a feast of visual and hearing delight. The costumes are wonderful creations of corners and color. The camera leaves regularities at the door and goes through a world above and below the same. The characters become rulers of their own domains and change into beings that are so high. If you enjoy nothing else about "The Cell", you will surely be impressed with the work done on these screens. <br /> <br /> In addition, the casting is also. Jennifer Lopez is here in her element, with her natural, compassionate and almost maternal sensitivity, combining her own striking look with the lush surroundings, makeup and costumes. She is incredibly sexy and I personally wish someone would find her another role outside the rom-com world she was using. This will allow her to experiment further. Vince Vaughn is pretty convincing as an FBI agent who does everything to save the life of a young woman. But it is without a doubt that Vincent D'Onofrio has the greatest impression here. This is a very difficult role as he has to bring out various emotions within the viewer. We are disgusting about his actions, yet sympathetic towards him because of the trauma he experienced during his life. He looks wonderfully powerful in his rich but uncertain and vulnerable within the real world. It's a good performance by an underrated actor. <br /> <br /> While "The Cell" doesn't work well on every level it tries ambitiously (some of the characters' actions aren't credible) and while it's all based on a fairly thin scientist logic, it is an occasionally shocking, visually stunning epitome that rewards several views.
