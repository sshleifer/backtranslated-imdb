I was a great Errol Morris fan since I saw Thin Blue Line and heard it saved a life. To date, this movie is his best piece of work. <br /> <br /> The plot is a blend of Stephen Hawking's book of the same title intertwined with the man's life. The story is told by interviews with family, friends and Hawkings themselves. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled; It sounds totally boring, but the whole package is dynamic and thoughtful. The mixing of life and theories is seamless and thoroughly entertaining. I was especially surprised at how well they humanized this genius and omniscient man. The physical powerlessness, Hawking's greatness and scissors glare are encapsulated in a real living man, who must allow us at the same time. <br /> <br /> Find this movie. Watch it and enjoy. And if the studio that owns this photo reads it, a 15-year anniversary edition will be perfect now ...
