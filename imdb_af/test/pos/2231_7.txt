There is a good bit about the price of a side negligent. The bimbo in the office shows off the bargain she received for $ 22. Later Mary Astor found the marker in the master's bedroom (proving that bimbo slept with him). Still, Mary Astor is about to have a relationship with Ricardo Cortez, look at her side negligently ($ 14) and is reminded of how disgusting she was about the bimbo as well as the fact that she spends $ 8 less as the "most obvious" woman she ever met. It sounds a clear morality craze, but it was well done. The movie will be stronger if Robert Ames's character is played by a more powerful actor (he is too low for a self-made seller and he spends most of the film with his face turned away from the camera) and as Ricardo Cortez has given more to do than to ironically smile. Both male leads are vague and forgetful, and are hampered by the pancake-male makeup that is so popular in the film's era. However, the Mary Astor character is interesting, attractive and credible. Behind closed doors is worth seeing.
