For all the viewers who have seen 'The Cure', I agree with this remark that it is an excellent movie and very heartwarming. Joseph Mazzello and Brad Renfro prove their star quality in this movie, along with Dexter's (Mazzello) mother Annabella Sciorra. <br /> <br /> When I watched The Cure on TV, I didn't know what to expect, but as I watched this masterpiece, it soon became clear what it was all about. Dexter, an 11-year-old boy who is afflicted with AIDS, is playing his backyard with his toys when one day he meets his neighbor Eric, who is initially a bit uncomfortable for the two boys, but soon became good friends . <br /> <br /> During the film, I wonder how it will happen to the two boys, as they wonder about me. I wondered how the heel they were going to get to New Orleans, with a sea bake put a door and put on an inflatable crocodile. There were other great scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> But the part that came to me was the part when Dexter's health started to deteriorate. You just can't help but wonder if he'll do it, but by the end, you'll find out. I thought about the first prank they played, that Dexter was really dead, of course he wasn't, my fool. But when they play the third, something is very wrong. Dexter is not going to laugh, nor does he show any kind of laugh. At that stage, the victim of their prank announces that poor Dexter is dead. At that part I lost it. I put out my eyes and from that scene I cried. You just have to. As the end approaches, you begin to understand Eric's loss and then the movie ends with a delicate note with Dexters shoe so slowly floating in the river. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is excellent. It has laughter, adventure, emotion and sadness. Placing it in a blender will give you a great movie. Peter Horton did a good job of directing this movie and I believe it is definitely one of his best. But now I will try to find this movie on DVD, if it exists. Again, a wonderful movie that will take you on an emotional scroll.
