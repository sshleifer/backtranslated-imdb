An inspired choice from the director of this latest Brit-Flick, Rose Troche, who burst into the scene with NY Dykes's budget-free story. _Go Fish_ brings a lightly mysterious view to this story of a Londoner who is the slightly inappropriate environment of a male alliance to declare his desire for a co-seeker of masculine truths. The highlight for me is a scene where society is trying to return to primitive hunter-gatherers, but eventually order a take-away. The movie as a whole has been superbly performed and Troche, who has never been accepted by some lesbians she played in her previous film, enjoys the bigger budget by enjoying some great long shots unlike _Go Fish korrelhiperinesis. A very enjoyable movie
