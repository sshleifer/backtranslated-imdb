This parody is cleverly done: from the songs (Express yourself yourself, like a prayer is now Party in my pants and Vogue is now vague) after the false interviews of the film, this movie is hilaries. Remember Madonna that she didn't know about the rainy season in Asia? In this one she doesn't know about the volcano season. It's a precious gem. They got a lot of money on that spoof and paid it. Highly recommended !!!
