Forever Strong is a kind of movie we have seen many times before, only in different genres. But it is said, I really thought it was a good movie, Sean Faris shows the type of potential that usually actors in the big time. Apparently, this movie had a limited release because I wasn't even aware of it, but I saw it in the video store and decided to take a chance with that after remembering Sean's performance in Never Back Down. enjoy. I finally made a good decision, I'm not a fan of rugby that ever, but the movie isn't really about rugby. It's about a standpoint in your life, challenging yourself, reaching your goals, there is a lot more than the simple plot suggestion. At 1st, we don't give a damn about what happens to Rick, he is mature, full of himself, and totally arrogant, we feel he has completely sealed his fate as a trouble-maker. Along the way we see the changes in his character, he begins to hang around with better people, begins to improve himself, teaches us how much negative impact his father had in his life, that is just a wonderful thing and the movie has a good job of making Rick a nice touch to a kind-hearted person. <br /> <br /> The rugby action itself is not bad, unlike the things I played and saw in high school, it was really nice to look and beautifully choreographed. A good young role combined with some veteran experience helped this movie tremendously. It just did a wonderful job to avoid being able to turn the mill type into a striking and effective drama. I also liked the conflicting contrast between The Coach | Garry Cole | and Rick | Sean Faris |, it made a very interesting story, and I liked seeing him helping Rick help with the feeling of emotional and heartwarming. It's a real hidden gem that I really love, I discovered it made me think about my life and many times I needed something like that. <br /> <br /> The Performances. Sean Faris is outstanding as Rick Penning. He reminded me of a terrible fate of a young Tom Cruise, yet very charismatic and talented. It was a difficult role to go from a teenager to a good young man, but Sean pulled it off with pure perfection. He made his heart and soul clear in this movie, so great kudos for Sean to make so much trouble in this big movie. Gary Cole is excellent as the preaching yet lovely coach who wants to help the children. I always found him to love, he always has some kind of presence he carries on his movies. Neal McDonough is fantastic as Rick's selfish, nonetheless printed dad. For the majority of the movie, the script leads you to believe he is nothing more than a selfish bitter man who wants Rick to be exactly like him, but in the end you start to realize that he is coming out, I feel sorry for him 'a little. Julie Warner is a good character actress and she plays the good heart but clueless mother good. Penn Badgley is needed to play a real jerk, and the boy he does so well. On several occasions I wanted him one doll, so I have to say this is a good show. Arielle Kebbel is not much of a part of love, she did well. Nathan West plays a somewhat mysterious character, he did very well. Sean Astin has been charged as a major player for the film, but he does almost nothing, he did well with what he had to do. <br /> <br /> Bottom line Forever Strong is a good movie, it will make you stop and think about how your life was much better than you thought. Don't let this one drop you, you won't regret it. <br /> <br /> 8 1/2/10
