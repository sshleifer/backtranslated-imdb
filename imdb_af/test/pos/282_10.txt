Comic secret agents have made a return over the past year, with Mike Myers's Austin Powers and Rowan Atkinson's Johnny English, and more recently, Steve Carell, in the big-screen hit '60's, Get Smart! . <br /> <br /> Back in 1974, it was David Jason who wore a shoulder strap and included an attach√© case full of documents labeled "Classified". <br /> <br /> "The Top Secret Life of Edgar Briggs" was his first starring role in a sitcom, after being a supporting actor in such programs as "Six Dates With Barker", the "Doctor" for many years. series and 'Hark At Barker'. <br /> <br /> Humphrey Barclay found him in a pier theater in Bournemouth. He was impressed enough with Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Eric Idle in the children's comedy show, "Do not Adjust Your Set!" Not. <br /> <br /> "CROSS" throws Jason as "Edgar Briggs," a well-meaning but incompetent intelligence service agent. While John Steed wears a bowler hat, Briggs had a trilby. While Napoleon Solo carried a radio pen, Briggs owned a pipe. Objects broke into his hands. He reads confidential documents in bed while his wife (Barbara Angell) used Woman's Own (once it would be the other way around). When he trains a few Russian agents to a helicopter, he accidentally switched on the airport's Tannoy system and broadcast his plans to catch them! When he hid on a train to meet a S.I.S. man and his enemy contact brought him on board and took him straight to Brighton! When trying to organize the demolition of a female Russian scientist, he took a "short cut" to evade his persecutors, just to lose hopelessly in a parking lot. Yet, like 'Inspector Clouseau', he always came to the end, to the horror of his colleagues. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, he was married. His wife Jennifer understood the kind of work he did. Although they once had a drive, it caused them to shout from him from the window of their high-rise apartment: "Secret Service this, Secret Service! You never stop thinking of the Secret Service!". He shouted back: "Think of the neighbors! They're not supposed to know I'm in the Secret Service!". <br /> <br /> Briggs was part of a team of agents who included "Coronation Street". villain Mark Eden (he was psychotic Alan Bradley) as 'Spencer', Michael Stainton as 'Buxton' and 'Doctor at Sea' Elisabeth Counsel as the lovely 'Cathy Strong'. They replied to 'The Commander', played by the late Noel Coleman. The commander was kidnapped in one episode and temporarily in charge of Briggs of the S.I.S. - Of course everyone was scared. <br /> <br /> This hilarious show was by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna, who wrote for the "Doctor" series. Rather than giving Bond a spoof, it was more of a reception of the serious spy programs like 'Callan' (though it had a Bond style theme). Furtive meetings in underground parking, code breaking, stolen missile plans, that kind of thing. Jason gave a lot of energy to the role. He did many of his own stunts, such as Briggs who fell off a ladder while decorating his apartment, and dropping a hill in a rubbish bin and recalling those in the 'Pink Panther' films. <br /> <br /> 'Briggs' had all the ingredients a smash hit. Unfortunately, it was not brought to the network. In the London area it is Sundays at 7.25 pm P.M. where it is in the ratings of the B.B.C. s soap drama 'The Brothers' hit. It was then moved to Fridays at 7 PM. because I.T.V. wanted to show his latest US import - the TV version of 'Planet Of The Apes'. Briggs never got an audience. A similar fate had Jason's next big show: 1976's Lucky Feller. It was only in 1977 and a sharp intake of breath that he found his first successful solo vehicle. <br /> <br /> You can watch the title series (along with two short excerpts in German!) for this series on YouTube. Unfortunately, this is all you can see. Jason will not allow either his early main screen shows to be repeated or released on D.V.D. A great shame. For the moment, however, Edgar Briggs's life will remain secret. <br /> <br /> CODA: I've seen a number of episodes recently and I'm happy to say it's amazingly good.
