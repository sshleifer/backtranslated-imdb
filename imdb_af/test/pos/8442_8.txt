It was easy to dismiss this film as hyperbola at the time of its release. Fonda, Douglas and Lemmon were known as "lefties," but the accident on Three Mle Island provided shocking context to this fictional drama. <br /> <br /> This film works on many levels and takes shots at both public utilities and TV news. . 1979 was the highlight of the notorious "Happy Talk" TV news format (see also "Ron Burgundy") and is shown here in all its glory. The anonymous anchor read grimly a story about a "grinding headache" before he cheerfully introduced Kimberley Wells (Fonda). He does a story about a veterinarian who makes a home (or is it 'aquarium?'). The show's producer and the station driver rests on the content or lack thereof behind the scenes. <br /> <br /> There are some technical errors. The PR flack (James Hampton) shows Fonda and Douglas the required scale model of a pressurized reactor plant built by Westinghouse. Lemmon and Wilford Brimley (Lemmon's friend / colleague who played between service and loyalty) have a sudden crisis in the control room of the plant. Of course, they have a boiling water installation (built by GE.) A small point, but curious, considering how much details the screenwriters have managed. <br /> <br /> Like any good drama, the film asks more questions than it answers. The real accident at TMI proves the movie's basic premise. The work title for the movie was originally "Power" and you will see why. Since nuclear power has been prepared to return in these days of $ 3 gas, "The China Syndrome" is as relevant today as it was over 25 years ago.
