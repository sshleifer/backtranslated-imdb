Interesting story and sympathetic treatment of racial discrimination, the son of the gods is too long and contains a hammie acting, but in general it remains a fascinating film. <br /> <br /> A story of a Chinese passing as white (Rchard Barthelmess) begins when Barthelmess leaves college after being insulted by a trio of brainless co-eds. He starts on a world tour to discover himself and end up as a secretary for a British playwright (Claude King). In Monte Carlo he meets beautiful Alanna Wagner (Constance Bennett) and they fall in love. But when she discovers that he is Chinese, she goes berserk in an unforgettable scene. <br /> <br /> Driven by debt and love, Alanna goes into a spiritual spiral and makes some efforts to contact Barthelmess. After his father dies, he takes over the business (bank?) And down Chinese clothes as a symbol of his hatred of the White race who swore to him. After a San Francisco detective told him the truth about his birth, Barthelmess decided to honor his Chinese father and mother. <br /> <br /> And I agree that one reviewer here has never seen this movie. Alanna explains her love for Sam BEFORE he tells her about his recent discovery. And this makes the difference in this movie. <br /> <br /> Barthelmess and Bennett each have a few scenes where they chew the scenery, but in general it is a solid and interesting drama. Frank Albertson is fine as well as his lovely colleagues, Claude King is solid as the playwright Bathurst. Bess Flowers has one stage as an Indian Indian, and E. Alyn Warren is the Chinese father, Dorothy Mathews is nasty Alice. Not so good is Anders Randolf as Bennett's father and Mildred Van Dorn as Eileen. Also note the beautiful blonde right of Barthelmess at the roulette table. What a stunner she was!
