It's not a movie is a clever, witty and often heart-touching movie. It's a glimpse of a failed relationship between Michael Connor (Michael Leydon Campbell) and his estranged Irish friend, Grace Mckenna. Michael decides on his luck to have a documentary version of his entire relationship playing and what went wrong. He exploits his friendship with an actor he met at Nadia Gymnasium (Nadia Dajani) he gets to play Grace. The concept of this movie is very original. Michael's ratio is shown from each point whether it is high or low. Michael Leydon Campbell pulls out a fantastic show that helps you find Grace. As the fact that most characters perform except the puzzle. The puzzle is needed to move the plot together, but seems to be surrealistic to exist in a coffee shop. His monologues are often convinced and useless. This is proved when he says: "From this chaos we all try to create order, and out of order, meaning. But in reality there is nothing like meaning. Something just has meaning if we mean it." <br /> <br /> The comment saves this movie. The comment was made in vain. It's Spinal Tap and explained Michael and his brother the problems they had while making the movie. Michael offers a lot of funny self-conscious comments that make for very good abdominals. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'll give this movie a 7/10.
