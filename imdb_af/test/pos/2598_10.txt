If you ignore the fact that the plot has been done many times, it is a hilarious and fun Looney Tunes cartoon. The animation is wonderful, the backgrounds so detailed and very fragrant color as well. The writing is razor-sharp, and the face gates, especially Daffy, which is constantly being pushed off its head, are brilliant. I really loved the arguments between Daffy and Bugs, and that Bugs win every time. I also love that Daffy is really greedy and nasty while he is unwavering. I prefer him if he is manic, but he is also very nice. Bugs are still his beautiful and racial self, and Elmer is funny if it is stupid. In short, it's absolutely brilliant, and actually my personal favorite of the Hunting Trilogy for pure entertainment value. 10/10 Bethany Cox
