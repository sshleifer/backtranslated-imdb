What a surprise. A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor', just kidney. Funny old Tim Thomerson (who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men in Tights) is straight hilarious like the anal retentive dr. Jekyll and the slave Hyde. <br /> <br /> The one scene that is really funny is when dr. Lanyon (Mark Blankfield) Jekyll catches up with his daughter and says: <br /> <br /> "How dare you benefit me from my innocent daughter." <br /> <br /> Jekyll replies, " Sir, I continue the operation. "<br /> <br /> Lanyon replies," Oh, well, in that case, fu * * your brain out! "
