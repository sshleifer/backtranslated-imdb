Someone says this anime can be offensive to girls ... not really. Scandalous situations are funny; The first time I saw this series, I was in the video store, people started laughing around me, no matter what age or gender. A teacher said that to pay attention to someone in a book, the beginning should be entertaining and the end shouldn't be obvious by just reading the last page. During the first few minutes the boy is hit by a car. In the last moments of the series the same car appears. Episodes had a pleasant and funny end, especially the last one. I'm not sorry to buy this series.
