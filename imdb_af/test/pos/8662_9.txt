The Bothersome Man is one of the best foreign films I've ever seen. All the technical aspects are, in my opinion, perfect (lighting, acting, directing, pacing, etc.). The STORY is awesome. <br /> <br /> Our main character looks like death, but our main character finds himself in a world without beauty, passion or something that pleases human senses. His work is cold and uninteresting; his relationships are numb and uninspiring, and when it gets too much, he tries to stop it before a train. But it doesn't end - he can't leave this strange world by suicide! She returned to a man who looked, feeling the same isolation and loneliness. Our main character joins the excavation of a stone wall in the hope of revealing the source of a strange and wonderful scent and music. Just as they break through - and I won't reveal so much, everything ends and the movie ends as strange as it started. <br /> <br /> It's enough to say you'll love this movie or hate it. I feel it is like a magical poem - open to many different interpretations and all of them valid as the next. If you enjoy new movie experiences and want to be taken away from Hollywood's crap festival, try this movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10 (and I don't judge easily!) For, despite his darkness, this movie left me with a sense of something bigger ... something mysterious and beyond ourselves. Well done!
