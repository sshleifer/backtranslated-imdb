It is a movie that in no way reflects the real world. Nothing in this movie makes any real world sense or has a real world logic. It works completely in its own small world and your ability to accept or not will determine your love or hatred for this movie. <br /> <br /> I love the movie. <br /> <br /> Somewhere at the very beginning I bought in the totally unreal condition of the hit that recovered her memory, because the past is coming back to haunt her. There was a moment early where I remembered that it would be one of those movies where the heroine would know nothing until it was needed, despite all the logic that it wouldn't. "Oh, its one of those movies," I told myself, and was addicted when the movie started on a wild two-hour race. <br /> <br /> It's an action movie with brains and brawn as things follow, logic and you should actually pay attention to some of the twists and turns. I like this a lot and am pleasantly surprised when I bump into people who feel the same way. People like it or hate it if they have ever heard of it. <br /> <br /> If you like action movies, it's a movie to definitely try. You may not like it, but it's definitely worth finding out <br /> <br /> And as always, leave reality at the door.
