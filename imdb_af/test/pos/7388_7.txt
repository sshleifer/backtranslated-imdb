Dark harbor is a moody little outing in dark emotional waters that run deep. It's basically a 3-character piece, with a fine-low performance by the exquisite Rickman, with Polly Walker and Norman Reedus (also excellent) forming the other two sides of this strange triangle. A perfect late-night cable movie, with a surprise ending to begin.
