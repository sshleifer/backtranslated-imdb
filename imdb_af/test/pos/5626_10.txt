This documentary is such a wonderful example of what an entertaining and wonderful experience can be a documentary, if done so well. The subject, Mark, is clever, funny and much driven, and this story of his personal struggle to live his dreams will be inspiring to anyone who knows what it is like to make an "impossible" dream come true.
