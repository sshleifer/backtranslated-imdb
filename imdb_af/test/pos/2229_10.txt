Although Peter Sellers often sees the worst movie, it's actually an excellent driver of medical corporate corruption and abuse. Often misunderstood, the film is actually a deviation from the type of film. Sellers were best known for; satirical farce. This film had excellent performances by Jo Ann Pflug and Pat Morita (from Happy Days and the Karate Kid movies), but was characterized by his fiery, relentless and total medical breakdown of the day. It was before his time (1972) to take the outrageous path that the Monty Python crew would take in the theater a little later. As such, it was unacceptable for the traditional Peter Sellers fan, who found the more pointed barbs in this humor as something they weren't used to. At the moment, Peter Sellers movies are in demand by fans, but this effort, where is it hurting, is almost impossible to find.
