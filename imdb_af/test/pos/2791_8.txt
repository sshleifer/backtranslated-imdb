I watched this movie in my French class as part of the "French culture". I thought it was filmed and the editing was really good, but mostly it was the guy who played Wendy's brother, especially. Also, the story line was really good, and it was credible and yet adventurous. <br /> <br /> Favorite Share: When William makes fun of the German man studying and acting as flies propagate! :) <br /> <br /> My French is not that good, but with the subtitles I could pretty much get what was going on. <br /> <br /> WATCH IT!
