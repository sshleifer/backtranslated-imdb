I finally hit a copy of Kannathil Muthamittal by Netflix and spent New Yera's Eve watching an amazing drama. It started with Shyama (a victorious Nandita Das) who married Dhileepan in the backwaters of Sri Lanka and then took a war over their romance. Shyama has to flee to India and is in a refugee camp as she carries a child. A few years later we see Amudha, a playful, beloved child (PS Keerthana), who is the darling (or burden) of teachers, parents and fellow-schoolmates, in a lot of how a problem such as Mary's order to solve. On her birthday she is told by her parents Thiru (Madhavan) and Indra (Simran) that she is not their biological child. She was adopted. It reflects her confident love-filled world and she continually stays on why her mother-in-law has left her. Several attempts to take the jersey later, the adoptive parents take her to Sri Lanka to try and find her mother-in-law. The country is torn by a raging civil war and the trio are inevitably caught in the mess. But it also led to the meeting with the new Shyama - who is eventually confronted by Amudha and asked why she left her daughter. <br /> <br /> The story of a child who has to struggle with being abandoned. At birth, her obsessive drive to reconnect with her mother-in-law, the unconditional love of the adoptive parents, the demons who manage the mother-in-law, destroyed the normality of Chennai and the terror of terrorism in Sri Lanka. Mani Ratnam has made a masterful film that has mixed many ingredients into a saga that stirs soul. AR Rahman's music beautifully complements the magical and striking moments in the film. The film has excellent performances by Madhavan, Nandita Das, Simran and an absolutely stunner role than Amudha - the abandoned one - done by the children's artist P. S. Keerthana. This show won her a National Award. <br /> <br /> Cinematography is visual poetry - every frame is beautifully crafted and breathtakingly shot. I am inspired by the relationship Mani Ratnam has with terrorism, love and obsessions. I think his exploration of these subjects is absolutely outstanding. Mahadevan's character was quite unique - his passion and idealism did not make him selfish, rather it was well matched to how much he cared for the girl. His one linen was hilarious. The mother who played Simran was also fairly multi-dimensional. She was idealistic, loved the adopted daughter, but also worried about her biological children. The shock, anxiety and obsession of the child Amudha was superbly portrayed by P. S. Keerthana. Her wide accusing eyes spoke the most. In fact, the enigmatic characters were those of Nandita Das and her husband. Perhaps Mani deliberately made them mysterious not to give our ears ideas as to why they were the way they were - the riddle of why a terrorist becomes what he or she becomes. It also made him condemnable - it was another conflict in which he did not turn his side, but merely reported while showing the human tragedy. <br /> <br /> Kannathil Muthamittal is visual poetry and a soul that moves drama - I rarely cry the movies, but this one left my damp eyes and a little sad. It's a beautiful movie - a treasure and a custodian if you can get a copy; Go borrow or steal it today and watch the movie!
