The latest film by the subordinate director Alberto De Martino ("The Antichrist", "The Killer is on the Phone") is a really exciting but incomprehensibly neglected giallo, which contains almost all the brands that these Italian horror subgenre so wonderful and addictive. to the fans. There are some very disturbing themes (child abuse, false priests ??), numerous eager moments, plot turning left and right, outstanding music and ?? last but not least ?? a handful of very sadistic murder scenes! Especially the opening sequence, which is a kind of prologue, is a powerful piece of horror! What about ordinary puppets that make them so scary? When the anonymous man, like a priest dressed, assaulted a little girl and pushed the broken head off her doll, it really sent cold shakes through my spine! Years later, the young girl from the prologue is an adult woman who is bound to a wheelchair. She inherited a lot of money, but used her fortune to stimulate fellow disabled people to practice sports and stay positive. She ?? Joanna ?? fall in love with her personal trainer and they marry immediately. Of course, he was only after her money and began to terrorize Joanna by reviving her childhood drama that paralyzed her. The repeated images of a sinister priest, accompanied by ominous songs and a nursery rhythm, provide a formula for a murder with a lot of real scares and Alberto De Martino's direction is very determined. The play is quite capable, with David Warbeck ('The Beyond', 'The Black Cat') in a glorious greedy villain. Due to a few plot holes and a lack of originality, this movie may not be able to compete with Italy's best horror efforts, but it certainly deserves more attention. Many formerly dark and unfamiliar Italian gialli received amazing DVD releases and hopefully the "Formula for a Murder" will get the same treatment. Meanwhile, good luck finding this baby!
