I walked through my local library, watched VHS tapes, when I saw a movie that dropped my mouth - Waterbabies. I was hoping to see this movie again - it's been over 22 years since I saw it (cable movie channel around 78-79). I recalled a lot of the details - especially Grimes. My son, who's 4, and I watched it. <br /> <br /> He agreed with me that Grimes was "not nice" and the best way to describe it was that he didn't love Tom. He accepted it. It was great that I also remembered the songs! They've been holding in my head for 22 years - which means they need some memorable nesting. <br /> <br /> It's a good kid's movie, with older guidance in case of questions about what children had to go through who weren't nobility / society in the timeframe. This is what all the children are confronted with every day (except for a few lucky ones), and while we try to make Disney coat films, they make more kids today, that doesn't mean cruelty doesn't exist yet no. I enjoyed the animation. It's not Disney, no. I don't think Don Bluth touched a paintbrush on this movie. <br /> <br /> However, there is much to it. David T plays two roles! (I really like him!) James M does too. The waterbabies themselves are cute. You feel sorry for Tom and root for him. Then Billie herself is extraordinary in the multi-role section she plays - it's as if her eyes are Magickal! I'm a big fan of WoO, TLW & TW, and company (AND LOOKING FOR HP!), And I filed it with those kind of movies. Yes, he jumps into the water, but not because of suicide. He jumped because he trusted the woman in black - she had appeared to him long ago. <br /> <br /> I think it's a good movie! If you have children, pick up a rental copy. If you find a buy copy, let me know! Ian likes it! :) <br /> <br /> Dee
