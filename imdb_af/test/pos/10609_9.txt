I had no expectations (never seen previews for "Marigold") and enjoyed the characters, contemporary music and sharp dance in this light film. Although 98% of the dialog is English (big thing for me), I wish the DVD has subtitles to help with some of the quick moments when the character's accent can be difficult to understand. I won't judge this movie against Bollywood movies, but only on its own merit as a fun entertainment (a musical humanity). I am addicted to Ali Larter as an actress (and her interviews in the bonus material indicate she is a beautiful person). I've been watching this movie a few times (getting better every time).
