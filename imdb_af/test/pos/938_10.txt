It's almost impossible for me to sit down and write a conscientious review of THREE COLORS: RED without letting people in on some of the ideas Krysztoff Kieszlowski examined in the previous two entries to this fascinating trilogy. The more I see them and think of them and imagine myself in their world, the more I get their theme: that we are more connected than we would think ourselves and all that it takes is a small hand of the fate to implement certain events. In BLUE, Juliette Binoche played a raw widow whose plan to live her life without commitment to the past met her unexpectedly. In WHITE, an act of cruelty creates an unlikely friendship between two men who will go against the chance to bring the offender to justice and full circle. And now, in RED, all the elements of fate and the seeming coincidence fit into the meeting of a young Genevese model and a retired judge who has a habit of starting in other people's lives. <br /> <br /> This young girl is quite the name: Valentine (a light Irene Jacob), who has this look and even smiles openly while working on the runway. Not that she is without luggage: she has a boyfriend, invisible, who also claims to know what she is doing at all times, she has a brother who botheres her, and she rejects the advances of a photographer attached to her image works for a large billboard. She hit a dog while she was driving and nurse her back to health, but if she took her to the owner, a retired judge (Jean Louis Trintingnant), he didn't want her. "I don't want anything," he says coldly, and elements of BLUE suddenly reveal themselves as this arrogant man, who also lives in anonymity and apparent free freedom, oversees unsuspecting people. This male version of Juliette Binoche's character at Valentine's first shock - she says she can only be sorry for him if she goes away in horror, but a chance event has her back in place. And here he begins to reveal who he is. , and its great loss. At the same time, Kieslowski selects a parallel story: the story of a young man, Auguste (Jean Pierre Lorit), about the right to be and across the street from Valentine - but they are missing each other. Chance is the word. Like Valentine wins the jackpot at the grocery story she visits, elements of accidental pepper her life and Auguste's. He has a girl who also provides people with phone reports on the weather. One of them is the old judge. He knows more about her than Auguste does, and he never met her. Like God, or Prospero, he slowly creates a storm that will crack the walls of this present state of conformation and add a new meaning to the expression "We Meet." It is this parallelism between the old and young judge that makes RED so beautiful and transcendent, because time is actually much more fluid than we would like to see. There are people who meet us in life, that if we were born in similar timings, so many things would be different. <br /> <br /> This is the case with Valentine and the old judge. I believe there is definitely a strong brotherhood of souls that connects them in a close relationship: they are the woman he did not meet - coincidentally or not - and whether he knows it or not, tries to make compensation That's why he is at great risk of revealing his oversight and becoming the social publishers. But it doesn't end there. One of the many links between the three movies is the character of an old woman walking to a large refuse bin. Where Julie didn't see her (and would never have helped her), and Karol fresh from his public humiliation, she thought, "Someone is worse than me." Valentine is the one who helps her. Impatience in distress can happen anywhere, and Kieszlowski even applies it to a minor. <br /> <br /> Now RED is so much more than a story. Valentine, the old judge, Auguste, even Rita the dog: it's not characters limited by storytelling. An American version would ruin the idea and get the chance to meet and even bring a dumbed end. RED is so devoid of a linear, defined plot that anything could happen to any of these people and the possibilities that this story could deviate in so many directions did not take one important element in the exact moment and place. <Br /> <br /> Adding to the concept of characters mirroring each other despite time frames or places is the theme of sexual betrayal. It is also an important and distinctive feature in all three films. In BLUE, Julie's husband had a mistress and she betrayed Olivier also when it became clear she was emotionally dead. In WHIT, Dominique heard Karol sound over the phone (which became an important device in RED), as she had sex with a man while watching the sign of Brigite Bardot's CONTEMPT. In RED, the old judge's story of love and betrayal is reconsidered. And this time Valentine's billboard image of them, like a prediction of what comes, at the same time that Rita, the dog, hit Valentine's car, wears seven dolls, life is renewed for the six major players in this complex trilogy that of course filmed with care and love. Why do I say six? You'll have to watch the movie and wonder.
