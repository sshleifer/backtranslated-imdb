Shirley Knight plays Sara Ravenna, a Long Island housewife who runs away from her marriage when she finds out she is pregnant. She plans to drive into America's heartland and start again. Along the way she goes up a friendly hitchhiker (James Caan) who calls himself 'Killer'. "Soon she discovers that the benevolent" Killer "is actually brain damaged, and by picking it up, she unknowingly took on great responsibility. The two of them drive all the way to Nebraska, where Sara Killer helps a paddling reptile farm. It is here that Sara Gordon, a local policeman, meets and soon things are going to be very wrong for everyone. <br /> <br /> It is a powerful drama about people who are shut down from society, alienated by the choices they make or imposed by others. Even with such a low budget and a generous attitude, the movie captures all that is set by these clearly defined characters. Shirley Knight has a complex, diverse role and there are moments of some awesome action by her. One of my favorites is when she first called on her worried husband on her phone. It is such a tense scene on both sides, and so little of her is spoken in every little gesture and word of a word. Then comes the character of 'Killer' played by James Caan. This character is different from what I have ever seen him, and he plays great. This is one of his best performances, as he is very stuck and moving. <br /> <br /> The way Coppola develops characters using short, dream-like flashbacks is very clever and adds a fragmented view to it. The fast flashbacks that are graphical and self-contained contrast well with longer shots in some critical scenes. Also, because this film was shot in the east of the US, it offers an interesting, authentic look at America in the late 1960s. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen many other movies yet, especially with Mrs. Knight, I'm just familiar with her more recent work on television, and usually play a mother-in-law or an old woman. It was wonderful to see her so young, beautiful and so wonderfully subtle in this movie. It's also a pity that James Caan is being released as the "difficult man" for the rest of his career, as this film has shown that he can do so much more than that.
