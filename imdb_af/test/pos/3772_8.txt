So this is not an award winner, so what? Have you ever seen a movie that was just stupid? My husband says that "Jekyll and Hyde Together Again" is one of those movies that if you were there and done, you would think this spoof in the 80's cocaine culture is a riot. I think the whole movie is just fun. Nothing is holy; Hospitals, Plastic Surgery, Howard Hughes .... There are ongoing gags that you need to watch to appreciate. To say that the movie does not follow the book will be true, but then really good movies also take freedom with the published word. I recommend this movie to all the old "stoners" among us. We can now be smarter, but we will still recognize and laugh at many people we have known in the old days.
