One real thing rises above its potentially shocking material to give us a picture of a family of complex relationships and defective, real people. It opens with Rene Zeleweger discussing her mother's death with the District Attorney; We save the cheap movie shots from a "shocking" disease and death. From there it goes to a family system, where everyone plays through a set of uncontrolled rules, and uses the mother's cancer to show what happens when all the rules change. <br /> <br /> William Hurt as the self-important father, and Meryl Streep as the Suzy Homemaker mother are both wonderful; nuanced and not what they seem to be. Self-righteous is busy, angry and surprised with herself. Tom Everett Scott doesn't have much to do, but he does it well. <br /> <br /> The story is predictable, and at least takes one badly smooth twist that didn't need it, but the performances, and the view of family as a place where anger and love are equally mixed. make it worthwhile.
