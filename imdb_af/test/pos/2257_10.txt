I thought this movie was incredible. I was a little skeptical, because I really had no idea what it was about, but it was a beautiful story. I cried a lot and I laughed aloud. <br /> <br /> I think it's very important to create movies that deal with the Holocaust and how it affects people (it happened just 60 years ago!) I was in Germany and Eastern Europe and I studying the Holocaust, so this movie meant a lot to me. I think this film did a wonderful job of capturing this story (I'm not going into detail, but I don't want to spoil it). But I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a movie, which I know might sound, but will change your mind about things.
