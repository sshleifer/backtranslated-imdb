After a little slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a very pleasant watch for a few hours, mainly from two points. <br /> <br /> The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as credible because I know it happened in different places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl who was married to Mandras (Christian Bale). From the beginning I had questions about the depth of their love, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras was fighting. After the German intervention, Greece is conquered and the island of Pelagia remains under the Italian occupation. Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage). in occupied countries. When they got to know their residents, they didn't see them as the enemy, but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbors. I just read an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain's Channel Islands, where it was a big problem. As soon as Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. <br /> <br /> The second background issue is the Italian profession itself, which I thought was portrayed fairly realistically. First, the disdain with which the island treated their Italian occupiers was. Greece defeats Italy (very much from a historical perspective) and is really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead insist on surrendering to a German officer hit me as something that could really have happened (and it was quite funny. I loved the line "We rather give this German dog than your Italians." The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as credible. The Italian army never had their German ally and was never enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were good friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops on the island simply cannot understand) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that they are possibly prisoners. of the Germans. It was all well done, I thought. <br /> <br /> It is a bit late with an already predictable finish but still deserves praise. <br /> <br /> 7/10
