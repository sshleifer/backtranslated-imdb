I was 9 when I saw it on TV. on a Friday night. I remember the full page ad in the TV guide with the picture of the Rex. incredible how some things stay in your mind after 30 years. Anyway, if you are a kid who likes monster movies, this one is enough, especially with beans and Keats raging at each other. Special effects are not Harryhausen, but it is worth the one and a half hour to find it on the night of the night. Didn't see it in a few years, for some reason this classic of cable TV disappears. If you do it late at night, don't be too critical, just grab some sweets and enjoy it. It may be cheese, but I thought it was much better than the Kong remake that came out in the theaters a year earlier.
