From the opening stream of "We're Gonna Groove" to the last guitar stripe of "Whole Lotta Love", this two-DVD set can be one of the best music DVDs ever to hit the shelves since the Beatles Anthology was finally released. earlier this year. <br /> <br /> One of the best things about this DVD is on CD 1, a whole concert and many television shows can be found. For example, the entire Royal Albert Hall concert is on the DVD, as well as the best performances of the last concert at Knebworth. <br /> <br /> In the Royal Albert Hall concert, for example, the band had a lot of space to improvise. Jimmy Page's guitar solos "Dazed And Confused" is a great rock crab ball as opposed to the restored blues song it was on Led Zeppelin I. <br /> <br /> Next on DVD 2 is a promotional video for the Led Zeppelin III hit song "Immigrant Song". One of Zeppelin's hardest rocking songs, the video is about as sketchy as a Pre-MTV video, but it shows a lot of kite power by Jimmy Page, as taken from a live performance. After the video we end, in transition, with a short picture of supporters filling the seats at Madison Square Garden. The following are performances that were supposed to be part of "The Song Remains The Same", but did not make the cut. Excellent riffs like those in the songs "Black Dog" and "The Ocean" were both present. <br /> <br /> After the Madison Performances we are treated to Earl's Court. Most of the Led Zeppelin IV material is played here, like the most popular song Zeppelin has ever recorded, "Stairway to Heaven". It's brilliant as always, even more than the version on IV. <br /> <br /> Finally, to end the 5+ hour live material, Led Zeppelin's final concert is in Knebworth in August 1979. If the viewer looks at this, they must admit that Robert Plant's voice is getting busy and deeper from all the shouts he has done in the past, and this is clear here. On songs like "Kashmir" and "In the Evening", Plant did not have his vocal boost of old, but on "Whole Lotta Love" it is another song. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the best musical DVDs ever released, just next to the great Beatles Anthology box released earlier in 2003. The sound, both in 5.1 DTS and 5.1 Dolby Digital, just like the Beatles DVD, gives you a sense of being on stage with the artists, standing right next to them, as you will feel on the Beatles DVD when they in the studio. Although the Beatles and Led Zeppelin are different bands, however, they received different DVDs. Although this set only contains two slides compared to the five disc Beatles Set, it still feels a lot of stuffing to the viewer after they have gone through all the content. It's also a pleasure to watch again and again, not just because of the sound quality, but because of the sheer energy on stage when Robert Plant starts singing. <br /> <br /> A brilliant effort by the Atlantic.
