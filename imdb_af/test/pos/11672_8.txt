This is one of the best movies about the 80 punk scene. I saw it a few years back on a bootleg copy and was amazed. Very little of today's kids know the true roots of punk and this movie shows some of the 80's punk legends like The Germs and shows how it was then. Today, so much punk has gone mostly with MTV and radio and it is nice to see the true underground rebellious movement of the original scene. Darby Crash (or The Germs) is one of my heroes and this film shows why. A must see for all "punks" and anyone curious about the 80's punks scene
