Probably one of his lesser-known films, it suffers from the same lack of exposure as Salvador, in fact it is one of its best. <br /> <br /> Written by and starring Eric Bogosian, Talk Radio tells the story of an opinion radio-phone-in-host that upset the wrong kind of listener. The movie is important and has a lot to say about the freedom of speech and just how free it should be, and you can easily tell that it starts out as a stage play. Know what you're doing before you sit down to see it and you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> There's not much about the play, as Bogosse steals pretty much the movie, he wrote and is licensed license, I couldn't take my eyes off him and it was part of the fascination who had many listeners; the people who hated him would not turn off if they missed something. <br /> <br /> Not for everyone, but a very good drama and a very good movie overall.
