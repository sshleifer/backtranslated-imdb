The duo of Abbott and Costello remains in this version of a story-time classic. In "Jack and the Beanstalk" there is everything to see, music, magic and comedy in one. Costello plays Jack after listening to the story once told by a young boy. We know Jack was a poor boy who sold his cow "Dolly" for 5 magic beans. Well, he planted those 5 beans, and they were indeed magic. He climbs to the sky, sees a huge castle there, and he will sing a song, unknown to the giant (Buddy Baer). Not only would he dance with the woman who was also a giant. She will beat Jack with her elbows during the dance. It was funny! You have the playing harp that knows how to make the giant so comfortable. The goose that lay golden eggs. And my favorite, how Jack gets rid of the giant. He gets the ax, and starts cutting off the beetalk. Another funny thing is where the ax is trapped during the hood, and the last celebration happens when people dance around the imprint where the giant fell. Great fun and also for the whole family. Highly recommended! 5 stars!
