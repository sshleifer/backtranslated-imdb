Yes, I'm sentimental, and yes, I love movies where children are the better people. Climbing climbers do have some logical or even shortcomings. It is more than compensated by the children's great acting (Julia's first film role!) And the charm of a Dogma movie (I kept this kind of cinematic art for the Dogma, since Herzog's 'Herz aus Glas'). Well, I shouted the last fifteen minutes, which is a higher tear factor than Bambi or Fly away had for me.
