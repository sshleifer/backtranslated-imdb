"Bluff" has been in movies in Bogota for a few months, and today I died to see it. I didn't really know what to expect, but I was very surprised. It's a crime comedy of the same kind as Snatch, etc., and it does a good balance between elements of tension with comedy. The style of the film is set up early with cheerful music and the Argentine narrator who moves straight to the camera - strangely the first time, but then of course. <br /> <br /> Having less than perfect Spanish, I still found the plot and dialogue easy to follow, and much of the comedy is situational. My Colombian friend laughed a lot at the different portrayals of people from different regions and social classes that had overtaken me, but for example, a good performance of a pumpkin idiot in a power position is funny in any language. br /> <br /> I think it's on the film's credit that it has something of a global flavor: I'm not often reminded that it was Colombia I watched. Yet, it is important to note that many wealthy Bogotanos live like some of the characters in this movie, and this is not a misrepresentation of Bogota or Colombian society in any way, just a * selective * depiction - like any movie supposed to portray a 'real' situation / culture. <br /> <br /> I don't know how much of the comedy will be lost in captions, but when it comes to your country, it definitely goes out: it's a very smooth and enjoyable movie with great elements of black humor . And all in a tightly packed 90 minutes.
