I was pleasantly surprised to see this movie as a preview in my local theater. <br /> <br /> We've all seen this plot line ahead (Top Gun, GI Jane, Officer and Lord), but a good script still works. This story is basically about training a Coast Guard rescue team with some side story lines. Kevin Costner is playing a highly successful rescue team leader, Ben Randall, who is forced to train the training team to a difficult mission. The film takes us through the guidelines of the training process and the personal stories of both the Costner character and those of Jake Fischer, played by Ashton Kutcher. I'm glad to say that Ashton is great in this part. <br /> <br /> There are no big surprises in this movie and you will probably realize what's coming long before it arrives. But using humor, exploring the toughness of the training and the pleasure of watching Ben Randall "do his own thing as a coach", keep me hooked and entertained thoroughly. I really enjoy watching a movie that makes the whole audience laugh aloud, holding it here and there yesterday, and slamming at the end as a tribute to the movie. <br /> <br /> We all had a good time (despite some tough moments in the movie) and I think you will.
