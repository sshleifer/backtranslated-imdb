Are you right with the foreign work of Italy's foremost terrorist director? Can she accept outrageous story lines and flamboyant style? Then you must have a wonderful time with the Opera. If you don't, you won't. <br /> <br /> Cristina Marsillach plays Betty, a beautiful young opera understudy who gets a shot at fame (in an avant-garde production from Macbeth) when the star of the show comes through a car hit. Like any thesp that trusted the boards, Macbeth will be a curse and Betty soon realizes that the show she is now starring is no exception. A murderer systematically makes the staff work theater and poor Betty is forced to look through the sadistic murderer (who holds needles under her eyes to prevent her from closing them!). <br /> <br /> With the help of a girl crawling through her air-Conditioning channels, her director and agent, and a few ravens who saw the killer's face (!!!), Betty discovers the killer its identity and truth about her mysterious past. <br /> <br /> Let's see it ... Opera is a crazy movie, with its turbulent plot twists, winding deaths, and an end that beggars believe. And while director Dario Argento has never been one, we will say, conventional story lines, this particular giallo is so foolish and contains so much of his brand-style touches (all to the maximum), it's almost as if, with every He sees a sequential movie that he can get away from (sometimes almost parodying his earlier work). <br /> <br /> That's exactly why I find the movie so fun! <br /> <Argento's camera movements are absolutely incredible: gliding, crawling and, in a wonderful scene, even swirling around the opera house above the audience; the power of Verdi's music is perfectly combined with the clever majesty of Claudio Simonetti's score, providing a grandiose accompaniment to the wonderful visuals; and several outstanding pieces (with Sergio Stivaletti's narrator Gore FX) will prove that no one does death better than Argento. (Watch the character of a spectacular downfall, in which a bullet moves through a spy hole in a door in slow motion, and straight into their eye!). <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
