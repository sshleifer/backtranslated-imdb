Most critics find this film, like so many other Charles Bronson vehicles, pick up, but just another patchwork of senseless violence. And although there is a great deal of chaos, DEATH WISH 3 is not so much an effort, especially for fans of the series and its star. <br /> <br /> This aging is lost to Charlie's Paul Kersey. by a police chief who is desperate to clear up a rough section of New York City. The trigger-happy vigilants move in the heart of the gangster, where he once again becomes a one-man army in an urban war of good to evil. Bronson, at least the "older" version, is really at its best. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying DEAD WISH 3 is a classic. Indeed, to the discriminating eye it has an abundance of imperfections. The characters are usually made of cardboard. The violence is over. A man who breaks out and looks good in his 60's is dozens of young punks. But in the tradition of the original DEAD WISH and later movies like FALLING DOWN with Michael Douglas, it has a definite crowd-pleasing charm. Who doesn't want to see gangsters, owe them? There are also some great caseous moments and one-liners so common in the 1980s movies. When a tenant of his apartment building saw Kersey ascending a booby staircase, the vigilants said sadly that he was diluting the flock. A line just Bronson can really make work. <br /> <br /> So, you see the key to enjoy DEAD WISH 3 is to accept it for what it is. It is not Spielberg and it is not art. Then pour the popcorn into the microwave and enjoy it.
