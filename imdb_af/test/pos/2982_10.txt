Michelle, Anic√©e Alvina, was so nice, and I really fell in love with her. She died a few months ago! Friends? Really the best movie from my youth. Elton's "seasonal show" and his arranger Paul Buckmaster sing in my head forever ... If you know where to find a VHS movie, send me a post! My 26-year-old husband and I saw it as Junior in HS. Yes, he was my boyfriend then and still remains. I think we both shouted our eyes. I think we were pulled into the movie by the Elton John music, but then they were consumed by the teenage fear. Paul and Michelle were just over our centuries when we saw the movie - so easy to identify! It's great to hear Sean doing well, I'm also in the "helping profession" (an RN). I thought his performance was good and very credible. "Michelle" has become so sweet, fragile and vulnerable. I think the main theme is that if they didn't have to handle the "real world" then they could be happy and in love. How many times we all just want a "Calgon moment". If we all had no worries and could only deal with our "basic needs", it could be somewhat easier. I have a 15 year old daughter and would not have a problem with her to see this movie. Children nowadays see much worse that it's very tame. For those trying to find the CD, my husband (a great Elton John fan) was able to get a 2-CD set that came out in 1992. This is called "Elton John-rare Masters" Polygram Studios. It has all the friends songs as well as many others. As it is known, it is the only CD with the "Friends" music. We also had the MPs years ago and were excited to find the CD. Strength. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves the theme "young love". I just wish it was on DVD now !!
