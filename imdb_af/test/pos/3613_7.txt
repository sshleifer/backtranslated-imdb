Again, John Madden gave us a wonderful movie. A simple but beautiful story that is in a real paradise and the music can't be better, Stephen Warbeck is nice and good again, but ......... why is Penelope Cruz in this movie? I asked myself the same question while watching this movie. Of course, her Greek accent is not credible, she is unable to act, even in one scene. Not even at the end, she has done very good work after years. After years she finally saw Corelli again and couldn't change the same face of fool that we had to wear throughout the film. Anyway, Cage was very good at one of his best characters; Hurt is also good in her and the rest of the cast has done a good job, so the final result is a movie that is really worth watching. It's a beautiful movie that couldn't even spoil Mrs Cruz. So far I think Madden is the best job, so no fan will be disappointed.
