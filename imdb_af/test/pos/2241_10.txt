This is one of the best episodes of doctor ever. We have the Cybermen, The Cyber ​​Conversion Units (may scare young children) and the rough Doctor do one of his best actions. Bravo David Tennant. Good scenes as if it were a movie, with exciting scenes in some streets, a raid on the Cyberman base, and leaving the world different from ours, basically a 45 minute movie. <br /> <br /> Be part 2 of the rise of the Cybermen, it would never disappoint. The doctor plus an evil enemy (Daleks, Cybermen, Master, Sontarans, Davros, Autons, or even Macra) is a battle for death, just a battle for death. Be careful with young children who see it.
