Taking into account the terrible record of Mick Molloy as he went out on his own, I had quite low expectations of Crackerjack. Even the promotional posters for the movie made me nervous. In fact, if I didn't receive free tickets for the preview, I would have thought of the missus (Mick's - it's a concern) to pay for it. /> <br /> The first few minutes of the movie worried me. It starts with one of Micks's fatigue, "hurts insignificant things" routines, but it has given a neat touch, which made at least a little refreshing. The rest of the script was pretty good and very light. Even the typical Mick Molloy (and Judith Lucy) humor was well delivered and while I never had to get off the track, it was much more difficult to get there. There was nothing new in the plot - pretty predictable, but that moved quickly between one-liners and other jokes. I never hung or shortened it on any element for too long; Mick had to work hard to polish his writing. There was a one or two "Late Show" in jokes, and one or two jokes that would only get Melbournians - but certainly there are many generic things for a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Something I found disappointing was the relatively unfriendly of John Clarke. He just didn't work as the bad man, but it tolerated the movie too much. <br /> <br /> All in all I enjoyed this Australia. comedy, and was pleasantly entertained for the duration of the movie. I left the cinema with a decent grin - a very difficult thing for an Australian comedy I have to do in my books. 7.5 / 10 <br /> <br />
