Being a big fan of hip hop and turntable, I always knew I wanted to keep this movie. However, I was not prepared for just how good the documentary is. It covers almost all the important aspects of the only element of hip hop that was there from the beginning. The "story" begins in the early 70's, and follows the evolution of turntablism as art from early 2000 (Turntablism aficionados will point it out as meaningful). <br /> <br /> Editing is almost perfect throughout. the movie. Apart from the excellent visual scratch techniques they have used, the quick cut between interviews and the stock image material is excellent, which fits the movie when needed. The sound editing is also very good, with some good wiping sounds used to help with transitions. <br /> <br /> The absence of a narrator was also welcome. We are not taken by hand, and as a result, the audience can make their own assumptions easier. Every DJ adds a different side to the story and it's so interesting to hear from the unknown stars of hip hop, especially those who were there when hip hop was cut away by the music business. <Br /> <br /> Although there are many excellent things about this movie, I have a few handles. The biggest of these is the absence of several notable DJs, such as Ca $ honey and Jazzy Jeff, and also DJs from outside the US, such as Scratch Perverts and DJ Noise. However, if you watch the commentary on the DVD (something I strongly recommend), producer and director go deep into regret that they can't function. The deleted scenes feature lots of interviews with Ca $ hMoney, Jazzy Jeff and the Scratch Perverts. <br /> <br /> It's definitely the best documentary I've seen on hip hop culture and music. It stops short of showing the true potential of turntable; I strongly recommend watching the DMC and ITF videos. However, this is a minor problem. I recommend this movie, especially for the phat soundtrack, with excellent music throughout. (9/10)
