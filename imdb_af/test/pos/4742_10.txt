Rules of commitment are one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It is well-crafted, beautifully merged, and provides excellent footage to support the claims it makes. The best quality of the movie is that it is not based on the sympathy of the Dividians, as it relieves the audience of the blatant government errors and lies surrounding the whole situation. I was left with feelings of anxiety disorder and extreme anger over the way the government dealt and then covered a tragedy of this magnitude. The cover is what really left me. It's one thing to make a mistake in an operation and admit guilt, but another to immediately look at the American people and lie to them. I don't think it should surprise me with the history of our beloved country who saw the JFK murder, the Vietnam war and other important events that smell so bad of a lid that you have to keep your nose every time you drive Washington DC The footage of a plane with special heat sensing technology and the autopsies on some bodies clearly shows that the FBI is lying to the public. One of the things I try to keep in mind about seeing a documentary like this is that I usually only receive one testimony from one point of view. But again, this is without a doubt one of the brilliant successes of the English Rules. This gives his evidence in such a concise way that even if you are offered statements by the FBI, how can you really believe them. I clearly remember when the stand sacrifice took place as the media presented the Dividians as these crazy group of cult rebels with David Koresh, the self-confessed, reborn Jesus Christ as their leader. Not one of them was really factual, but rather a story of facts. They simply had the right to carry arms and practice their religion as American citizens. If you were the ATF and you wanted to find the connection, did the building fall with a unit of men who are guns with guns and bullet proof, which is the way to do it? If you are the FBI, why do you do psychological warfare and offer little in actual negotiation to resolve the situation? Why do yarn throw off harmful gas if you want to save children? Why open big holes in the composite structure when you know the possibility of starting a fire? Why lie about not shooting weapons if it can be clearly shown on video? Unless. Unless you wanted to see the situation end as it did. The scene at the end when the flag of Dividians Star or David blew out of the flagpole in the fire and the ATFs rose shortly afterwards was an emotional climate scene that shook my head in horror and turned my stomach uncontrollably. Filmmaker William Gazecki deserves one of my greatest congratulations. It takes a lot of effort to make such a movie and I'm sure there are also many repercussions from the government for that. Because of people like him, the public can be shown real truth, rather than crap that is filtered through a media containing information that can hardly be regarded as real. Looking back at how I felt toward the Dividians at the time because of the media representation of David Koresh and how I felt after seeing this movie, it's really great. It reminds me of the line of the Bible of a man healed by Jesus and asked by the elders how it happened "before I was blind, but now I can see." He told them. Do yourself a favor and look at this movie. You might have to search, but it's really something special.
