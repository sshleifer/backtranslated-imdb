I no longer care about Michael Jackson. Besides being a pedophile, I really don't like his music, with the exception of a few songs from his landmark album, THRILLER. This is one of them. I love this video because it's one of the first and most important music videos ever made. <br /> <br /> It is directed by John Landis, the best known of horror fans as the director of an American WEREWOLF in London. This music video is not so much a music video, but more or less a short horror movie. MJ and its date is at a werewolf. When they leave the movie, they are attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty zombies, when Michael Jackson does his famous Thriller dance. <br /> <br /> It's actually a pretty good song with good synthesized beat. This and "Beat It" are probably the only two Michael Jackson songs I can endure over and over. I especially love Vincent Price's cameo as the narrator. His distinctive voice is perfect for a horror-themed music video. Even if you are not from M.J. don't like music, you should see this video at least once. By the way, he was good before becoming a creepy white woman with a false nose.
