I really enjoyed the movie, especially the performance of the extraordinarily beautiful Gong Li as the concubine. <br /> <br /> However, it was a little distracting to have Chinese PLUS English subtitles PLUS American accented voice-over, although the voice was highly synchronized. <br /> <br /> The name of Qin Shi Huiang Di (The First Emperor of Qin) was Zheng, and his name Yiong so in English he should be referred to as "King Zheng" or "Emperor Zheng", and NOT as "King Ying Zheng" as in those days, the two family / first names are not used together. <br /> <br /> The state of Qin is pronounced "Chin" doesn't "shine, but sorry the researchers didn't do it. <br /> <br /> I forgot, but was in the end terrified when commenting that he was buried with "Zai-an" with his terracotta warriors, the city of Xi'an was pronounced "Sea-an", never "Zai-an" - sure the American speakers could it succeeded!
