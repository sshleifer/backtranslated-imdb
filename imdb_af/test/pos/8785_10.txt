I really enjoy this movie. It is a glance back in the time when this nation was really in danger of nations that attacked either the war against us or the Japanese and Germans. Robert Cummings and Pricilla Lane starred. The supporting role players ... Otto Kruger, Alan Baxter, Clem Bevins and Norman Lloyd were also excellent. Keeping the direction, pace and final and holding my interest. So much so that I bought my own copy. Thanks for Turner Classic Movies, they show so many of the really classic movies, including this one. <br /> <br /> Robert Cummings was definitely not lightweight as an actor and although I'm a big fan of Gary Cooper and see Joel McCrea, two of my favorite actors, who first starred what they would bring that would have surpassed Bob Cummings's performance. <br /> <br /> It's a movie I enjoy watching repeatedly and encouraging others to watch.
