I studied Brazilian theater since 2004, when I stumbled on "Cidade de Deus / City of God". Let me tell you something, this movie is probably as good or better than the "City of God". <br /> <br /> The play, cinematography and music supervision make this movie a unique experience. I haven't been to Brazil yet, but this movie presents the harsh reality to the citizens of SÃ£o Paulo. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie if you enjoy good cinema. This movie is disturbing and you may feel a bit discouraged after watching it. <br /> <br /> Something you want to watch, but nothing you want to sleep.
