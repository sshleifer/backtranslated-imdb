Okay ... so I'm looking through my mom and dad's extensive DVD collection (mostly because they don't charge low cost ;-)) and I'm coming across a Thousand Acres. "I was amazed that here was a movie that Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer (with a small look of Jennifer Jason Leigh) I didn't see. I don't think I've ever heard it. Well, that's exactly find the kind I dream about, since I have to admit that my parents raised two movie buffs in my brother and I, with a few exceptions (neither of us can even consider watching the Lord of the Rings movies but my dad loves the Matrix trilogy - GO FIGURE. We have very similar tastes in movies. <br /> <br /> It was a particularly horrible day today, reflected, it threw rain all day so I went into this movie and shortly after I was hypnotized. <br /> <br /> It must be one of the best sleepers I've ever seen. Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer are GREAT in their roles especially since they play many different kinds, Jessica Lange's character is a satisfying follower who, although she is the senior child in the family, rarely take a leadership role. On the contrary, she bowed to her father (Jason Robards) and sister Rose (Pfeiffer) and tended to teach her sister Caroline (Leigh) how to follow. Michelle Pfeiffer plays a very strong will cancer survivor who can barely keep the rage in her unhappy life. This movie is five years ahead of White Oleander, you think, so it was definitely inspiring to see how she played such a strong, fierce character. <br /> <br /> I must say that this movie is likely to appeal more to women. Really true movie buffs that enjoy a movie for what it is, regardless of the genre or target audience, will have a difficult time denying the charm of this becoming drama about family secrets and what they are the people involved and those who love them. to deny. I don't know how I missed this movie, but it was definitely a nice distraction on a rainy afternoon. Enjoy it !!
