<br /> <br /> As a Harold Lloyd fan, I agree with the other reviewer's comments except I feel that "Movie Crazy" was his best sound movie; "Cat's Paw" is a close second. (But that's just MY opinion). <br /> <br /> This movie is a "hoot" from start to finish and in many scenes, George Barbier (the rogue who elects him as elected mayor) stole the show almost! (Especially at the end of the movie). <br /> <br /> One would like Una Merkel's character to be a little more sympathetic to Harold, especially if the film is progressing. Just in the last few minutes of the film we find her true feelings for him. (And even there is no "romance" - kissing, etc.). <br /> <br /> It's a Must-See movie!
