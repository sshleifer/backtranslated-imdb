My Father, the hero was my favorite movie when I was younger. It's about Andre, a divorced man who wants to take his beautiful daughter (catharine heigl) on a holiday and hopes to get closer to her. But of course, Nicole is not that easy to go with, she just started puberty, I guess. She is angry and hurts that her father was never there and decides to give him trouble. One day on the beach, Nicole meets beautiful Ben and she makes a wild story about her and her whole dad gets involved and becomes the movie in a hilarious, entertaining movie. I will give My Father the hero 8/10
