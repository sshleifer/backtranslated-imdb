SPOILERS Edgar Rice Burroughs' famous character has been adapted to the screen a thousand times until its thirst is extinguished, especially during the thirties and forties by Hollywood. His productors made Tarzan one of the most successful theater characters. A few years later, Hugh Hudson decided to make a more ambitious version of the monkey and that is a more natural, more wild and more earthly Tarzan he gives away. Hudson avoids the clich√©s you usually give Tarzan, such as his famous scream or his friendly pet, Cheetah. Not only are we far from the designed and invented character that Hollwood has made, but we are also far from the movie set that made her stories. The film was made partly in Africa (more precisely in Cameroon). The film proposes two obvious parts: the first one to take place in the jungle, where Tarzan lives among his adoptive friends, the apes and himself as their lord. But he ignores his true origin. The second one in England where Tarzan discovers the English society. Ian Holm embodies the link between the two parts, and Hudson avoids everything the movie can do, thanks to a clever show. Indeed, Holm teaches Lambert basic rules of ways to act correctly in English society and works the result. Furthermore, in the second part, no one ever laughs at Tarzan and is even valued. In the end, it's a bitter and happy ending. Fortunately, Tarzan returns to the jungle and again meets his adoptive relatives. But bitter too, because this homecoming means the Greystoke line will not be insured and condemned to disappear. Christophe Lambert finds his first (and last?) Big role here. Unfortunately, he will never level the performance of his performance in this movie and he will play in poor and indifferent action movies. Yet, as I said earlier, a clever screenplay, a display of scarce quality, is impressive scenery (across the jungle and the English country and we get a beautiful movie.) It is also an excellent read a popular novel. it just framed little (6/10)?
