I saw this stage when it was broadcast on PBS in 1983. I was involved in local theater at that time and saw some incredible things from the Dell Arte players, but Bill Irwin filled me up. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed with how a man of his size (he is quite tall and cattle-like) can fold himself into a small box without much as a break for adjustment and deadlock moving over the stage without even having a sound from his feet if he decided not to make a noise. <br /> <br /> However, the most wonderful thing for me was in this show how he got up on his feet during the jack-in-the-box / puppets. Those who saw this show will remember that when he got out of the box and fell with his body patch and limbs akimbo in the ground, he pulled himself on the head of his head as if he had a rope and not just did not rise. his feet, but to a full ballet point? and done it in one liquid, seemingly effortless. Just consider the power, grace, balance and focus to take such a series of moves to reach them as he did! Add his strong and credible characterization skills to his physical skill, and there is a complete actor / performer. My jaw dropped at the movement and my heart broke when portraying a puppet determined to be more than just a lifeless thing in a box. <br /> <br /> With regard to the unfortunate (yes "tragic" would be a better word) unavailability of this piece in home format, I noticed that many of PBS's works are not available on tape or DVD. Sometimes PBS programs will be available for a limited time for direct purchase of them directly after a broadcast, but they rarely stay on the market for a long time. There are, of course, exceptions, but these are mainly science and history documents; rarely does an art piece stay in print for some time when it is ever started in VHS / DVD. I don't know why this should be so; Certainly, PBS can use the revenue of home media marketing their shows, but they don't benefit much from it. That is a shame. There are many things I've looked at in PBS that I want to own, but bits like "The Flag of the Flight" are, I'm afraid, a one-shot, once a lifetime treatment, should never be repeated on PBS . Again and never be available for home media purchase. It really struggles. I'm lucky to catch it when I did it. <br /> <br /> Oh, yes? Our local library received a copy of "The Flag of Flight." And yes, it's stolen.
