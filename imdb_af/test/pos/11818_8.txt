The subject of terminally ill children is difficult and sad, but 'The Cure' suggests that it should not be all heresy and gloom. And if there is anything, children should have hope and joy in their lives if they find peace before the end. It is also a film of remarkable relationships of friendship and the innocence of childhood. <br /> <br /> The film sees Erik, a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother, moving to a new area where their neighbor is neighboring. eleven-year-old Dexter, who contracted AIDS through blood transfusion. After condemning his initial fears and ignorance about Aids, Erik was friends with Dexter and their almost brotherly friendship saw them starting a trip to the Mississippi where they heard of a New Orleans doctor claiming to be a cure for got the disease. br /> <br /> The talent of two young leaders of Brad Renfro and Joseph Mazzello, who play Erik and Dexter respectively, is exceptional. Brad was able to portray Erik's harder edge without involving the subtle childish innocence of the character, while Joseph portrayed the feeling of vulnerability to Dexter's character, but injecting the right amount of boyish enthusiasm and zeal to show that his illness does not mean that he is still not a child who wants to run and play like any other eleven-year-old boy. The couple's interactions create a sense in the audience that they are two really close boys and they carry the movie well. Annabella Sciorra also delivers a pleasant performance as Dexter's mother, Linda, who adores her son and is delighted to see him flourish with this new friendship with Erik and finally a surrogate mother figure for the other boy. <br /> <br /> Set against an excellent soundtrack, 'The Cure' is a very bittersweet movie that unnecessarily weaves the story of youth friendship that survives unsatisfactorily in the midst of bias and terminal illness without errors. A very interesting reflection in the film is that it is the adults who have the problem with Dexter's AIDS status, while the children, even the "bulls," accept him as they should. What is also very touching is how, despite Erik's street nature, he is the na√Øve in his determination to heal Dexter, while the younger boy has this haunting sense that he knows his fate, but by his best friend's enthusiasm to be swept away for healing. <br /> <br /> I recommend 'The Cure' because it's hard to find a movie that is both sad and uplifting.
