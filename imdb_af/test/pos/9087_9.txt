Cold medical students play chicken with a process that simulates death, in an attempt to get a (hopefully temporary) view of the afterlife. Some plot twists and themes are a bit off the point, and the play sometimes goes over the top. But the underlying message - about God's and others' forgiveness for our true or suspected sins - is positive and unique in the film, and the role play is very good. The last succession between Julia Roberts and her father has been done so effectively that I have seen it for years, still thinking about chills. Highly recommended.
