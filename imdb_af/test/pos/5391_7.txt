Dallas stars Gary Cooper, Rut Roman, Steve Cochran, Barbara Payton and Raymond Massey. This is directed by Stuart Heisler, photography is from Ernest Haller and pen duties to John Twist. Produced from Warner Brothers, Dallas is filmed in Technicolor from the Iverson & Warner ranches in California. Many of the films with his tongue tight in the cheek, the film is a setback for the Westerners of yours who exist without pretensions or deeply penetrating meanings. <br /> <br /> The plot sees Cooper's Civil War renegade, Blayde "Reb" Hollister, fake his own death to kill his reputation and free himself for the pursuit of Dallas from the brothers who killed his family. Essentially, a routine plot, Twist's story, is fueled by a lot of fun and exciting distractions. There are roll repetitions, dandy fashions, horse races, gunfire, a love triangle, powerful dialogue and a few small twists to keep the piece pure to paint it according to numbers. <br /> <br /> Cooper also seems to enjoy himself, further enhancing the feeling good factor offered. It is true that he is not really asked to do anything more than be a laconic man on a mission. But when asked for action duties, he delivers the goods his supporters emerged during his successful career. The villains entertain (especially Steve Cochran's dirty and thin Bryant Marlow), because everyone has their own little pekadillos to prevent them. The two ladies of the piece look nice and well under the machismo, while the high production value makes it possible to treat the eyes with the sumptuous Technicolor. It involves camera work around the sites. <br /> <br /> It has ideas to be a list Oater does Dallas, something he just can't achieve. But it's not a lack of trying and the end result is one of sheer entertainment, which in truth must be enjoyed on a cold winter day when the viewer needs me. 10/07
