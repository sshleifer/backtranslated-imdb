I went into this movie and thought I wouldn't like it, but I hope to be surprised, but it, like the movie, eventually turned pale and hopeless. But don't make me wrong, Minghella delivers every piece of a great epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and is willing to take that adventure and accept what just comes, they won't be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion. The play is of a high standard and will probably come with a trinity oscar noms for Law, Kidman and Zellweger, although Portman's screens may be the most powerful in the movie. The places are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot. <br /> <br /> But for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of willingly, they may be disappointed mainly because of Minghella and his adaptation. The film is so completely dark. It makes for what I see as a punching bag epic which is a movie that is hardly trying to hit emotion, but it does so extreme and so often that during the film I don't have the time to invest emotionally or not recover from a previous stroke, and it has become unrealistic and therefore too difficult to really care for, not to speak predictably. In general, the "Cold Mountain" has almost drained me to even think of the good aspects of the movie, because everything I remember is death, which may have been an original motive, but instead focuses on of the characters.
