Although Bullet In The Brain, without a doubt, is better among short films, it looks much more like a short piece of writing than a movie. And it's a little difficult to feel sorry for the teacher when his smart ass comments shoot him. But after the bullet enters his brain, we begin to understand a little about why he has seen such life in the first place. There is a huge amount of detail packed into this fairly short film and it makes me feel that it should be a bit lengthened. There seems to be almost too much to take in immediately, as the details fly to you. quickly. A slightly more relaxed pace and a less po-faced narrator in the last section would have benefited this film a little. Despite these complaints, there is no denial that Bullet In The Brain is a pretty impressive job compared to very short and even full-length movies. The makers should be welcomed to try such a basically emotional and literate film in the current climate of quick jokes and Hollywood action.
