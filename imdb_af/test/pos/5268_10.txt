"Hail The Woman" is one of the most moving movies I've ever seen in my life. I watched it twice in a row and cut my eyes. <br /> <br /> This tacit masterpiece earns a much larger audience audience; Unfortunately, the only surviving pressure is so bad that most people will not look at it all the time, and they will miss the jewel that is shattered. This movie can use a digital recovery to help its beauty, but I doubt it will be anybody, as the main theme is spiritual restoration before the family unit and it is not politically correct today. However, it remains a powerful theme for those whose hearts are hurt by the pain of broken family relationships. <br /> <br /> The film is wonderful, especially Florence Vidor, who literally glows like the daughter of Judith; ethereal Madge Bellamy as Nan, the poor girl who gets pregnant and set aside; Theodore Roberts as the ancient dominant father who all proudly destroys him; and beautiful Lloyd Hughes, as David's son, afraid of his father, but really of life itself. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie to watch especially Christmas. You will not regret being patient and seeing it as a whole despite its deterioration.
