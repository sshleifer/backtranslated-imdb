kite runner is undoubtedly one of the most wonderful books I've read in the recent past. I might have had very high expectations of the movie, but nevertheless the movie was good, the whole institution was realistic. nothing was made to fancy. the dialogues were not very attractive or powerful, they were just right. The movie was not a bad experience, especially in the last 15 minutes, where it actually became emotional and even the most difficult man would probably cry. But my imagination was much better than the movie. I cried more when the novel was read than the movie. but overall a good movie to watch for those of you who are not readers. But the readers - the novel would be a better experience, so if you want to see the movie, first read the novel and then compare it to the movie.
