Successful movies on metaphysical subjects are rare, but Fata Morgana is a good thing. You can lime the big topic to the ambitions of the youth, but Herzog does an amazingly good job. The film's point is to show people, and even the world, from a non-human point of view. <br /> <br /> The movie is in three parts: Creation, Paradise, and The Golden Age. The images of each are in contrast to the voice over. Although the text of `The Creation '(of the Popol Vuh, a Mayan myth) refers to the original desert, the scene does not go further to illustrate the myth. It lives on the waste, and on various samples of destruction (fire, smoke, destroyed vehicles). The images of 'Paradise' are nothing else, and 'The Golden Age' is dark comic? The highest culture is the strange road music action. <br /> <br /> The Popol Vuh suggests that man is the central object of creation, but the film does everything it can to undo this idea. The mythological framework has no reference in human historical times. There are no human characters to speak of. When a boy is standing in a prolonged shot with a dog, the initial suggestion is of the boy's point of view; By the end it is much more the dog's. Likewise, the lizard is a stronger character than the man who introduces it, and the tortoise's mate barely looks like his big flippers. <br /> <br /> Animal stories and nature documentaries are always anthropomorphic, but Fata Morgana has nothing of it. Certainly, the dunes look like a female body, but the cuts cut both ways. Presumably, only people can easily distinguish between their creation and nature, and here airplanes and factories are offered along mountains, lakes and waterfalls. People and civilization are all part of a broader natural landscape. <br /> <br /> In 1979, Herzog made a new spin on the idea of ​​restoring Nosferatu from the vampire's point of view.
