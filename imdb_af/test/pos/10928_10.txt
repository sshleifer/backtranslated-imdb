I had the pleasure of seeing this short film at the Miami Film Festival last Saturday and I just said I was surprised. It was the only movie in the whole program I loved. It is beautifully shot, composed, edited, acted and written. After the show I saw the director at a party and asked him what he was doing next. He said he was financing for the feature version of the card. He described some scenes to me. It sounded like the kind of first movie the big ones in the industry started. If you ever get a chance to see this short, I strongly recommend it. Hats off to star crossed.
