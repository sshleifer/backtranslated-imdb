(Possible * SPOILERS * warning) <br /> <br /> You never know. The guy says he's a stranger, but ... Oops, seems to be the most humane in the whole story. Arrived from distant planet. Say strange things. Advanced Earth's science. Heal the doctor ... Or was it just a crazy dream? You never know. Better see K-PAX for yourself. Think. <br /> <br /> Great play by all role players. Don't forget to note the music, it's right in a place. Great fun, a little sad. 8 out of 10, after all.
