These working girls go to hell soap is a time capsule candidate, with the consent of his impeccable physical production, 50s of food (watch all the bows and pearls), creamy Johnny Mathis theme song and exaggerated (for his time) sexual attitudes. Rona Jaffe's novel, on which the film is based, is being re-published, and just a few years ago Vanity Fair actually dedicated an article to this wonderful movie of a movie. Watch the new DVD transfer and you will know why. <br /> <br /> The three lead - Hope Lange, Diane Baker and Suzy Parker - echo the girls of "How To Marry A Millonaire" or Carrie Bradshaw and her friends of "Sex and the City." "Lovers of singers on a spree ..." Their romantic adventures and sexual disturbances are the stuff of paperback passion: empty caramel meal calories, without nutrition, impossible to resist. Long work really in her neo-Grace Kelly way, Baker is pretty dull and idealistic as a rogue virgin knocked by a (lift) cad. It helps that the caddy is played by Robert Evans, the throat-free, coke snorting film mogul that surely leads an innocent young lamb to death in his Beverly Hills bedroom. <br /> <br /> Suzy Parker is fascinating in the first half of the movie, all the bleak self-assurance and notable remarks. She banged her well with the panic of the fashion icon she was in the 50's. Oh, she's not on where the movie sends her: in madness and obsession. But she boasts glamor and savior faire and her acting is at least sufficient. One wonders why the critics disapprove of her and drives her almost out of movies a few years later. Perhaps a genuine attitude on the part of a beautiful woman is just too much to bear. That has sunk Ali McGraw's career a generation later, and if you think of it, Ali McGraw and Suzy Parker were basically the same actress. <br /> <br /> The only big mistake of the movie is a poor end. It almost collapses in a romantic swarm, rather than ascending to a melodramatic finish, such as the other well-known marine opera producer Jerry Wald, "Peyton Place", which Lana Turner cries and gnashes her teeth during rape. trial. Here, Hope Lange walks out to the New York sidewalk, places, forever hung (but of course newer) Stephen Boyd and they just walk together ... in the sunset, one suspects. Otherwise, this is actually the definition of a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> Oh yes ... there's also Joan Crawford, blowing all the young girls and smoking cigarettes as she walks over to her married lover. And the titles are made in hot pink, with ribbon letters reminding the late 50's advertisements of the stores. Don't miss out!
