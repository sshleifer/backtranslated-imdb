The film was definitely true to the real life story on which it was based. It was hard for me to find newspaper reports about the real facts, but when I found them, I could see that the truth in this case was strange to fiction. Judith Light was terribly angry at her role as the mother in this movie, so much so that it was difficult to separate her from the role, the point I think of excellent performance. Rick Schroder was quite clueless as her son who also defended her in court, an example of how difficult it can be in some circumstances that a child can accept the actions of a parent, no matter how criminal they may be. One can find fault with the film, but not with the treatment of the reality on which it is based.
