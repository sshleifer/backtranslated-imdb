MCBOING BOING is one of the cartoons that has trapped in my head over the years and finally decided to investigate it as pleasantly surprised and was also surprised by the people involved in the production. If I remember correctly, we had to see it at a UHF station and that meant using a converter in those days. UHF was not part of regular TV to fit the local station to see the cartoon. mysterious. I remember all the sound effects Gerald used to speak. A great memory of 50+ years ago. I will have to see what other memories on the web hide. By the way, I'm trying to do computer animation where the johnl3d comes in the picture
