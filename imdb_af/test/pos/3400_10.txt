I've always heard of this wonderful mini-series, but watched it for the first time this week, July 2007. I can see why the careers of so many young actors started. The story is intriguing and gives wonderful insights into the period before and during the Civil War. I care about the characters and how their lives evolved during this period. Some of them were stereotypes, but they helped me see how people thought in the 1800s. Many historical facts were thrown into the story and it was interesting to see history books come to life. The costumes and sets were beautiful! I thoroughly enjoyed watching both parts I and II. Part III is a disappointment.
