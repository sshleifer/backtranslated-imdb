It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's about true love and friendship. How to turn your life around and do something good for someone else. Thomas Bo Larsen may play the same role in so many other films, but recently we saw him in other roles that he does well. But so, if he plays the same role he did in other movies? He's perfect for that role. Ulrich Thomsen also does a good job. These two criminal "low lives" are the best friends ever. They share everything and they do everything for each other, no matter what the cost. When they find out that Peter's daughter is being abused, they put everything in the way (things you can't find unless you have to do more criminal acts) and take her to a better place. They do the best they can? These two men are not masterminds, but they have their heart in the right place. All I can say is that Peter and Carsten are also my greatest heroes?
