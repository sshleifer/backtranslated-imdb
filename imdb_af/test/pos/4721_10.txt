This film should be seen by as many people as possible, as it focuses on human rights issues in Burma. When I first watched this movie in the mid-1990s, it completely changed my life. I knew very little about Aung San Suu Kyi or her democracy movement. This resulted in me understanding more about the situation. Any movie that has the power to make you want, did his job properly. Patricia Arquette is wonderful as the American lady who, because of personal tragedy, has become reckless with her own life decisions and is caught in the ensuing conflict. It's a powerful movie about a topic that gets more publicity. As the film itself says, the 1988 massacre of Pro-democracy activists was not broadcast on television and thus largely unnoticed for the world. I recommend everyone read this comment to take the time to learn more about the current state of the Burmese people. <br /> <br /> It's time for this movie to be released on DVD. Can anything be done?
