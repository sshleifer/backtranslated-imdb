People say this movie is a 'typical teen horror movie' ... well, it's a horror movie with a teenage girl in it. What do you expect! It's a good movie, I counted 3 real screams in the audience while the movie was going on and it was a very jumping and scary movie. I wasn't bored in the movie at any stage and I was even on the edge of my seat at one point. The only thing that was a bit bad was that it was a bit slow to go into the real storyline, but it all led to why she was true and why it happened. The acting was good, the scenery was good and the storyline was good too, I hope to see a "When a stranger calls 2" in a few months! Good movie!
