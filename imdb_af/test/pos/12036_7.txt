Okay, when it comes to plots, this movie is far from credible and also a bit stupid. In spite of its many shortcomings, the film manages to work - provided you switch off your brain and just enjoy the zaniness of everything. If you can't, you probably won't have to keep this movie at all. <br /> <br /> In one of the strangest plots of the 1930s, Robert Montgomery plays a man living near the Arctic Circle at a wireless station. How exactly he came to such a remote outpost is uncertain, but in this very, lonely and isolated existence, a steady series of guests are coming - even though it has been years since he saw someone other than Eskimos. <br /> <br /> First, Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy arrive when their plane crashes. They're supposed to go to Montreal - how they got it. It is a matter of course convincing! Reginald is a stuffy and dull man who is really worried about Montgomery, since Robert hasn't seen a woman for a long time and Owen seems to be scared that Montgomery is stealing Loy for himself. As far as Montgomery is concerned, it's exactly what its plans are! For the longest time, you never really understand why Loy is busy with Owen, as he is as attractive as soggy bread. <br /> <br /> Soon, Loy and Montgomery fall in love, but it's all for nothing when, from the blue AGAIN, Montgomery's old fiance comes to announce that she is there to marry him! Considering she never wrote for more than two years and refused to follow him, Montgomery obviously assumed the relationship was over - but the villain and annoying fianc√©'s sudden arrival is enough to make Loy and Montgomery's plans , to destroy. <br /> <br /> How it's all solved is something you can only see for yourself. As for the film, the plot is very stupid and confronted - I can't defend it. BUT, it's also pretty funny and beautiful and I see this movie as a cook-like comedy that is just a step or two among contemporary movies like BRINGING BABY. Silly, small but also very charming. It's worth seeing even though it's not particularly credible.
