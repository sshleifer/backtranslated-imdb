This successor proves that Tim Burton was the best choice for ever targeting a Batman movie. The story focuses on Baman who captures three enemies: The Penguin (wonderfully played by Danny DeVito) Catwoman (slinky Michelle Pfeiffer) and Max Shreck (the beautiful Christopher Walken). <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best entry into the series is that it has everything: complex themes, complex characters, and dark tones that really stand out. The role-play is simply wonderful, although the obvious point of view is DeVito as the polyhedron penguin. Here is a man who is angry, spicy, funny and perhaps more important. The infamous scene with Shreck's image consultants is still shivering on my spine. In other words, the cast is simply a joy to watch and, first of all, performances. <br /> <br /> I don't hesitate to say that "Batman Returns" is my favorite of all the Batmans released (sorry, Dark Knight fans). If you want a superhero movie that has a little more to offer as if it were flashing effects and large-scale action, please review this bad underrated movie. <br /> <br /> If nothing else, it's at least the best movie Tim Burton ever made.
