"Bride of Chucky" is one of the better horror movies released over the past 10 years and can be one of the best horror movies of the 90's. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Chucky's friend, Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), manages his remaining remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of Part 3. He brings him to life in her trailer. Her neighbor, Jessie (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl) are tormented by her uncle. (John Ritter) Tiffany upsets Chucky when he refuses to marry her, so she buys a doll for him to play with. Chucky killed Tiffany, and then sent her soul into the doll she got him. To put them back in human bodies, they have to travel to New Jersey to get an amulet to do so. Jessie sees it as an opportunity to escape from Ritter, and they climbed on the journey, but not before Ritter was killed by Chucky and Tiffany. Along the way they force several bizarre incidents to stop at a bed and breakfast. When more people are killed, they call on their best friend (Gordon Woolvett) to rectify the situation. They convinced him none of them were the murderers, as the police started solving the crimes. He finds Ritter's body in the drum in the back of the bus. Thinking he was drafted, he confronted them about it. Chucky and Tiffany are really turning to prove they did this, killing Woolvett. The group steals a garage and arrives at the cemetery. Jessie and Jade get Chucky and Tiffany to switch each other on and give them enough to escape. Chucky repeats Jade and forces her to get his amulet. Chucky and Tiffany start their feud again, giving Jessie and Jade enough time to kill the two of them when police arrive and get rid of the crimes. <br /> <br /> The good news: I have to give the most money. of props to the FX division, as Chucky and Tiffany look completely convincing as dolls. The scenes with them are the main roles of the movies, including a hilarious conversation where Tiffany Chucky advises on how serial killers work in the 90s. It is said, the amount of one-liners in this movie that is actually funny is incredible. Chucky gets most of them, but Tiffany also cakes some gems. It's actually more funny than what Hollywood calls comedies today. The gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic. Several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative. Turning Ritter into a new form of Pinhead was a completely brilliant scene. The wedding couple were also a good mortal. For teenage love, the combination of Stable and Heigl works well. They have a good chemistry together and actually work like a normal couple. I also have to admit that I jumped the first time I watched this movie during certain scenes, showing what an amazing director of work Yu did. He learned enough to do the same thing with "Freddy vs Jason." He knows how to make setups and installments, and here he shows some great skills that have a Hong Kong influence and style. He could be the next big horror director if he resumed playing movies like these two perfectly. Fun soundtrack, like "Freddy vs Jason." <br /> <br /> The bad news: For cheese film fans, it will be a good find. However, this movie has a high cheese factor that can prevent the serious horror movie fan from enjoying a good time enjoying this movie. The movie knows it's a cheesy movie and gets through it, and a serious fan is turned off because of things like the one-liners. It's not that bad of a movie, but it has to be looked at in the notion that it is a cheese film and that the cheesiness of some scenes adds to the movie, not to take it away. Remove yourself from that state of mind and find yourself enjoying this movie. <br /> <br /> The final statement: Fans of cheese films and the other "Child's Play" movies will love this movie a lot. For serious horror fans, look at it, but remember that it is not a serious movie and that the cheese is there and you may find it. <br /> <br /> R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Short Nudity on a Pop, a Shadow Poppy Scene, a Drug Usage and many drug references.
