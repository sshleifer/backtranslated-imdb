I had the opportunity to capture this independent film and was impressed with it, despite the lack of excitement in the plot. The acting was very good by everyone involved. Amy Madigan played the part of a guilty mother who is tired but well-intentioned and determined to make her younger daughter's condition. Yet she neglected her older sister, who was more interested in playing with her Savant Syndrome brother and sister. The men in the movie are very powerful in the world. their secondary roles. Christopher Lloyd, in a very underrated role, shows us why he has so much versatility. He plays a teacher dedicated to his profession and literature research, but hungry for a meaningful relationship. He and Madigan are well connected in their screens, but both know nothing can come from their friendship. Their wordless goodbye is nothing but brilliant, an acting lesson for aspiring artists. <br /> <br /> And in a small role, Fred Savage is nice to watch. <br /> <br /> You can tell why this movie is based on a play, it's probably very good on stage. On the screen it is not very exciting, but it is very thoughtful and powerful in its subtleties.
