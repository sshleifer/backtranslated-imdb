Like many other comments I read, I fell in love with this movie when I was a child. My sister and I had a copy of the movie on Beta (before VHS) that we carried out. Of course, this did not help when our parents sold the BetaMax to a car sale. Since then we have been trying to find a copy. I have, like another commentator, finally opened a rental copy at a local video store. The owner will not participate with the copy after any attempts to beg, bribes and cries to own the tape. GOOD NEWS! Two days ago, I bought a brand new, new-born, VHS copy of Midnight Madness for $ 9.99 on Amazon.com. Finally, Disney woke up. Now, if they just revive Song of the South ... If you love the movie, grab it. If you haven't seen the movie, it's a check worthwhile - totally silly humor, but lots of fun (Stephen Furst is hilarious).
