This movie is already appearing at about 3:00 in the morning on the ABC in Australia. <br /> <br /> It starts with the scene of a London bus crash. <br /> <br /> The movies have progressed flashbacks of every character like the movie, plus the obsolete photography of Big Ben to turn back, to symbolize what events happened thirteen hours ago to the bus accident. <br /> <br /> It took me a while to understand it, but it was nice. <br /> <br /> When Sean Cunningham and Quentin Tarrantino come together and make a movie, this can be the result - due to the flashbacks and tiny stories that come in and die. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure of the main characters, as it has been a while since I saw it, but indeed a rare gem.
