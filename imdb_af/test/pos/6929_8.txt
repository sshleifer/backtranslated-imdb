I like Dylan Moran of his work in Black Books, but I found out of his view that he was really indifferent in terms of long confusing gaps. But I was intrigued to see this movie with him and Michael Caine and curiosity has the better of me. <br /> <br /> I was amazed. <br /> <br /> Dylan's vocal series and characterization of the different people he played in the movie was absolutely perfect, something beyond the skill of a mere stand-up comedian and really really the right way with Alec Guinness, John hurt and the other Greats, he was proficient in his portrayal. Michael Caine was a very convincing prime Donna and the standard British film. device to be a provisional child at hand is too sensible and sad. The only aspect I didn't really like was the incredible plot feature of the chemistry between Dolores and the hard-man of Cockney Gangsta played by Dylan. <br /> Unlike this, it was wonderful. <br /> <br /> I also like the non-cop-out where it happily ever ran, but with MC I hit a beat. Okay, it's not really being dug up by your goolies, and that's what a real crime boss would do to you if you bought Â£ 50k from them, but it showed at least a small amount of reality in the story. /> <br /> I like the movie, and I would recommend it to anyone, but- I would also warn them not to switch off after 15 minutes, as it started slightly slow. If you stick it out, it will all come back. <br /> <br /> And with regard to the curse, they are in Ireland. It wouldn't be any different.
