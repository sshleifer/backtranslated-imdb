This educational show focused on emotions, interactions and relationships. It is manufactured at Detroit's ABC subsidiary and syndicated in 90 markets nationwide. Last week, Detroit Public TV had a 1-1 / 2-hour exhibition program as part of their promise. Wow, the memories that have gained! As I remembered the show, there were segments that I forgot, but immediately remember a moment when they started. <br /> <br /> For more on public television special, do a search for "Hot Fudge Comin 'Atcha Concert"
