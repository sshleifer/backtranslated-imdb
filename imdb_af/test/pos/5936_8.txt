The 2005 Royal Rumble edition came from the Save Mart center in Fresno, California. The two top WWE championships were defended. The Undertaker played Heidenreich in a match. Shawn Michaels tackled Edge in a grudge match that has been built up since October last year and of course the man himself over rope Royal Rumble match itself. Who will take the prize this year? Chris Benoit? Stumpy? Eddie Guerrero? Stumpy? John Cena? Batista? Stumpy? Shawn Michaels? There was no shortage of contenders. <br /> <br /> It was Batista who fought the popular victory in the main event, but not without controversy, or should I say, a broken finish. Batista and John Cena were the last two men in the ring. Batista was supposed to shower the young Smackdown! star over the rope, but it all went wrong and they both threw to the floor. The referees were on their feet, as in 1994 we had a weapon match similar to that of Bret Hart and Lex Luger. This led the chairman of the board. Vinnie Mac walked to the ring just as he could, but hurt himself badly in the ring. It was unusual to see Vince McMahon sitting, legs out, telling the two men to start the game again. Batista then did so when he first had to do it and plunged Cena to the floor and sealed his own future with a championship battle at WrestleMania 21. <br /> <br /> The undercard for this year had Royal Rumble up a very solid line, with lots of WWE's biggest stars competing in games. Each brand has two major games each. <br /> <br /> Rou opened the night with the game between Shawn Michaels and Edge. It was a good technical competition. Back and fourth all the way to Edge has the fall. It was a smart discussion decision and kept Edge as a contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. <br /> <br /> The second game of the night was the feuding end game between The Undertaker and Heidenreich. The game wasn't a classic, but then they were a classic Casket game again? It was entertaining. Especially when Snitsky got involved and then Kane pushed the coffin to a big doll. The Undertaker did not surprise anyone when he got the victory, the lid on Heidenreich and this mediocre feud. <br /> <br /> The first of the two championships of the night was John Bradshaw Layfields' defense of the WWE Championship in a threefold threat match against both Kurt Angle and the Big Show. This game was very good. Again, not a classic but entertaining. JBL won the victory after cutting Kurt Angle. His celebration was short-lived, but when backstage teddy Long informed him of No Way Out, he would defend the WWE Championship in a Barbed Wire Steel cage game against Big Show. Not a great way to spend a Sunday night. <br /> <br /> And of course there's no show without Punch. Punch, of course, the prevailing World Heavyweight Champion Triple H. His performance of Unforgiven 2004 with Randy Orton was much better than the original encounter. It is a pity that they did not just click in the ring and it would be an excellent feed if they did. Orton played the concussion very well and came across in The Game. <br /> <br /> So the first big one of 2005 was a good one. It achieved its goals. Feeds ended and newcomers started. We were now officially on our way to WrestleMania 21.
