I've never seen a file in a language I don't understand just because I wanted to see the movie and I couldn't find it with English subs. I don't know how much I missed, but it wasn't much. Probably just specific details that sound stupid until you see the emotional level of this movie and how the characters work together. I want to call the Diceman from Germany, there is no reason to feel that he sucks when it comes to commenting on the emotional strength of the film. As I said, I do not understand Japanese - or at least just the small amount I come from, from reading the very long novel, probably my favorite journal I could not lay down and taking the next day from work just to read! I don't know if there is an English threatened or subbed version, but as the movie, but if there is, I'd like to see it. The movie was amazing in Japanese anything better is the cake of the cake!
