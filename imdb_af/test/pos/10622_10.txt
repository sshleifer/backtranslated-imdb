These movies made me suffer and I loved it! WAS ABOUT THIS! It haunts me for days. I think Erika is the kind of character you release at the same time and complain. The most frightening sex scene ever captured on film. This is the best of Haneke's work so far. He is the only live director who has been fit since Kubrick. The violence in this movie is beautiful. In a word, the film is about self-hatred. In a sense, the movie is trying to find love to stop you from hating yourself and finding it a hopeless hope.
