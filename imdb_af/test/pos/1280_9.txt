This is an interesting exercise to see the early works of great artists. Sometimes, even without the 20/20 vision that follows, you can see the gears and wheels these people make. The following is one such a glimpse of Christopher Nolan's past, one of the wonderful stories of today. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan's style of filmmaking places great emphasis on delivering the story. Although people can complain, it does too much on the back and forth shifting time, but I still find it fascinating to see how he uses one technique every time. Memento was probably the hidden piece of story I've ever seen. Consider the hardened cynics that say it's an old piece of meat wrapped in fancy dressing. Memento shows how even the simplest stories can be changed into a thought leg. The Prestige, which has been significantly stripped off, has still shown creativity in how its three stories are interwoven. Even in a rolled-up business like the Batman series, Christopher Nolan sprinkled some of his outstanding yarn weaving sticks and sowed new life in the dark knight. <br /> <br /> Following is an intense story of intrigue and mystery where we see a dilettante writer, who becomes a reluctant voyeur, who becomes an ignorant accomplice to a variety of small crimes, and finally sees " an end that no one could have expected. I've never heard of the next audience, I didn't know what to expect. At each point, the film guessed me where it led me. Ever since the mystery corner was clear, I constantly tried to find out what would happen next. And that's where I think the film succeeds so well. The film has many elements that have seduced me on many wild goose hunts. <br /> <br /> The movie is completely black and white and is told in various timelines. Both are considered gimmicky today. After that, all this can be done in the least formal or confronted way. There doesn't seem to be a reason for telling the story as it is, but you don't feel like you're taking a ride. The lack of pretense or self-conscious arrogance is what makes this style of storytelling work. Highly recommended!
