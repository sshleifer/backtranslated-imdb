The brilliant Chuck Jones, master of Warner Bro's cartoon comedy, brings us the first (?) Pepe LePew cartoon. A sidewalk cat, tired of being squeezed, relieves itself in the colors of a skunk, and with a healthy dose of Limburger, turn the tables on its tormentors. Then comes Pepe, and you know the rest. Many of Pepe's well-known gags were born here, including his hunting / hopping, in which he hopelessly walked while his prey entered into exhaustion. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Warner Bro's cartoons have become less resourceful and more Ho-hum in the 50's. This 1947 show is one of the few examples that Mel Blanc puts his absolute crazy voice in Pepe's mouth. But the kicker is the end, where Pepe is revealed to be an American "wolf in skunk's clothes"! A must see! Classic Warner Bros ...
