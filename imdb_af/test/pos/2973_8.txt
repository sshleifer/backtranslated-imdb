I also saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girlfriend friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to win the chance. The cinematography was very well done when memory served me right. The boy was a bit, but the girl's character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and it could have been my first friend for the first time. I didn't see the movie, and I wandered why it went to the side. I'd love to see it again to see if it was as good as I remember. The Elton John soundtrack was excellent.
