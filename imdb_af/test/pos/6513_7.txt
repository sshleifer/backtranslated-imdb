"Miss Cast Away" is a surprising little thing that unlocks with serious plot or character development to pack as many gags as possible. Best enjoyed with a large audience open to such entertainment and perhaps had a few drinks. Most of the jokes are based on current events. In the future, this film can become a time capsule of the 21st century pop culture references. <br /> <br /> In some parts, the 30 to 24 p conversion of the footage creates a jerky look, most notably the opening airshots. <br /> <br /> The appearance of Micheal Jackson is indeed a strange non-sequiter event. But I find it encouraging that Mr. Jackson proved a useful interest in one of his protégés even after he (the director) of the cute preteen boy stage passed. <br /> <br /> The effects work is not as bad as one review suggested. Most of them were done in a short time by a one-man crew consisting of animator William Sutton, whose name apparently was omitted from the IMDb credits. His work is an extraordinary achievement and really helps fill in the gaps in this movie. I hope he is finally paid!
