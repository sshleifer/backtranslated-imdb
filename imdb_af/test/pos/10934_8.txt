At the first show, this movie looks some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and meaningful white horse that has never been forgotten. But in the context of the story, but its implication of surviving in the immediate post-civil war America, one must have a horse, not an old horse, but a wonderful one. And Eagle's Wing is such a horse. But for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter. Who should own it? The native American or AWOL soldier? The story completely primitivism against civilization. As stated by other commentators, it is ironic that it has taken an English director to see this fact and then develops this simple theme into a western like no other you will ever see again. The film is basically about this animal and the fierce hardness of the environment and the people scraping a life from it. The photography and the soundtrack are beautiful. Martin Sheen's performance is a revelation. This film, released in the same year as Sheen's other big show as Willard in 'Apocalypse Now', indicates his abilities, which were somehow never again given such a free leg. More is a pity. A comparison of the two stories raises the surprising similarities between them - not least, that both films draw a man's journey in his soul to find salvation. While Willard is released, I will leave it to the viewer to decide if Pike is finally. The end is wonderful in the true sense of the word, and many move; be warned. Altogether it is an extraordinary movie.
