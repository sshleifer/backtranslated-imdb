Spheeris debut should be one of the best music documentaries of all time. And as far as I know, it is also the only one focusing on the L.A. Punk explosion of the early eighties. It's all there: not just big, big groups like Black Flag, Fear, X, the Germs, whose names do not mean much to you today, but whose influence on today's alternative rock music cannot be overstated, but also the promoters, the media, and the first of all audiences - the punks - are all portrayed in a way that makes you laugh, shake and amazed at the energy, anger and anger these youths put into their music. Where is it today? The eighties sucked much time when it was able to mainstream the music, but the underground was rock-solid. If you need proof of this, see Fear's performance in Decline. Unmatched. Great movie! How is it not available on vid, ld or dvd? P.S. The follow-up discount Pt. II is also hilarious
