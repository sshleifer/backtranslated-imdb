When I first saw this movie, it was about 1956 and although I recently saw it, I didn't change it. I think it was Robert Ryans best movie, because he portrayed someone like my dad, and he was a schizophrenia in real life (my dad), although he never killed anyone, but was more affected during the second world war which made him worse. Just to get him tempered just to come and get through the day was so adaptable. (My mother and brother had to do that). When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.
