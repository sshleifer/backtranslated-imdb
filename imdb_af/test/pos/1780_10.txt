The Decalogue 5 can be regarded as a violent accusation against the death sentence, according to the fifth commandment, "Do not kill": it does not coincidentally place the concept of a state fully in accordance with the provisions of an unfair law at the same level as the figure of a killer. "But the law must not mimic nature, it can rectify it," the defense newspaper Piotr says, a true catalyst character. "The punishment is a form of revenge aimed at restoring evil for evil, without preventing the crime. In the name of whom the law takes revenge? Actually in the name of the innocent?". The horrific and detailed series of the last half hour of a man condemned to death values ​​the futility of the deterrent function applied to the death penalty, with the aim of intimidating all possible criminals. "Desperate bystanders do not ask for desperate remedies," Kieslowski said in his message that we are teaching how unfair the act of disobedience can be to a commandment of God that punishes punishment just as crime is judged. There are three different moral attitudes here: the innate rebellion of the MURDERER, aimed at generating the hostile businesses of the surrounding environment; the strong sense of chronic indifference of the VICTIM tended to laugh at others' needs; The meritorious behavior of the COUNSELING FOR DEFENSE is always ready to fight against adversity, in favor of human life. The struggle for life has been relentless; The characters are immersed in scenes of tribulation and distress, in an urban landscape that is yellow-green, and seen in its own reflection through the windshield of a taxi. Everything in "Decalogue 5" carries a terrible sense of alienation and isolation: descriptions of a wilderness of violence and folly, scenes of uncertain working conditions, sinister appearances of buildings immersed in an anonymous destruction of desert, aimlessly walks through disillusioned environments . Jazek, the main character, is forced to fight with a stronger opponent: a town is completely wrapped up in deep indifference, apparently hostile, deaf to all his naughty calls for help, while a faded picture of a little girl in " a first nightgown goes on to gnaw his soul. He inevitably directs his steps to a disconnected route to damnation seen through the 18 mm deformations. wide-angle camera lens aimed at distorting all details, changing reality, causing it to fade into remote and alien echoes. Kieslowski does not bring down mitigating circumstances donated by honeydew tones of melodrama in favor of the defendant, unlike some Hollywood stereotypes such as "I Want to Live" (by Robert Wise). He does not slip on the banana skirt of useless pathetic scenes to eradicate Jazek's guilt and mitigate the cruelty of the crime, and is not interested in close psychological motivation to justify any exhibit of extreme or violent behavior and refuse any useless judicial proceedings. In other words, according to Kieslowsky, a crime is always a crime: according to the principle of "par condicio" he places the prosecutor on the same level as the convicted, using many signs or symbols to see a society in the most sinister light. And we cannot remain indifferent: even if we do not agree with him, Jazek's scream of anxiety becomes sad on our hearts, as Terri Schiavo's prospective eyes do.
