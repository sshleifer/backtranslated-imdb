The movie starts with three people on a play by an over-the-counter that decides to first visit a crocodile farm and then a little lighter activity, a "fishing" tour. <br /> <br /> You get some interesting information about crocodiles during their visit to the farm and the information just adds enough to increase the tension later in the movie, as you remember earlier. <br /> <br /> The action in the movie is well timed and no longer finished. Suspens are built by the "what if", the "unknown", and sometimes the angry decisions that make the characters in the movie. <br /> <br /> I found myself doing if I was in the same boat, no pun intended. <br /> <br /> The movie quality was really good and the effects where realistic, credible and not on top or cartoon looking and out of place, as you sometimes get with CGI. <br /> <br /> As a horror movie buff I just look at every horror movie I can raise my hands on, in just about every genre, and this is one of the best "crocodile" horror movies, if not the best I didn't see. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie and you won't be disappointed.
