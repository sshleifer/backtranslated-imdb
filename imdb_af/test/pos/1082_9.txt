It seems to be a given, but if a viewer forgets, it is possible to miss an opportunity. <br /> <br /> It is easy to carve off the heights of the 21st century on styles and prices of the Great Depression years; but the intelligent viewer will remember and understand that magic word, "context" and therefore enjoy it. "Accidents will happen." <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Ronald Reagan again showed himself a nice and pleasant man, and again delivered a fair performance. <br /> <br /> Earlier, a reviewer said Gloria Blondell had the nasty woman, but it was wrong. She plays the franchise-standing clerk who has a loved one at the Reagan character, Eric Gregg, but holds hands as long as he is married. <br /> <br /> Gloria was cute. Not as beautiful as her sister, Joan, she was still attractive and a good actress. Perhaps she's seen her anything like Joan, it was a disadvantage to have a more successful career, and that is definitely our loss. <br /> <br /> Sheila Bromley was Mrs. Gregg and played it well. <br /> <br /> Other actors include Dick Purcell, and the great Earl Dwire has to play something other than a rogue cowboy. <br /> <br /> Again, most of the players never reached the "household name" status, many of them earned, but they gave good performances yesterday, in a still active story.
