It was an excellent movie. I'm about a kid with whom I have the FAE and I look at this movie was more than the word could explain. I also bought the book and it was wonderful. I would like to have a copy for my own use, and so I can also watch my son's teachers. I want to know if anyone can sell me a copy of this movie, let me use it for a while or refer me to someone I could buy it for. Thanks, Myra I would recommend this movie to anyone who deals with children / adults with special abilities. This movie must be shown on TV again. The doctor's team that followed my son would also like a copy. His special Ed teacher also asked me to try to find a copy that he could have or what he could borrow. <br /> <br /> Thank you
