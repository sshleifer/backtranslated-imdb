It carries the tone that the book portrays in Vietnam's jungle and in the wild-eye view of Martin Sheen and Dennis Hopper and the mystical morbidity surrounding Colonel Kurtz. (I'm not telling Marlon Brando, because after watching the documentary, "Hearts of Darkness," I'm skeptical about how much credit Brando is paying for that quality.) The tone of voice I'm talking about is breeding and dramatic without persuasive to be: "Everyone gets what he wants. I wanted a mission, and for my sins they gave me one. They sent it with room service." It is indulgent without being narrow and alienated. A good example of this is Hopper's leniency in aphoristic madness, with great installation of lines by T.S. written. Eliot and Rudyard Kipling in his rocky monologues: "I mean, the man is a genius? Sometimes he'll walk right next to you without saying a word, and sometimes he'll grab you by the collar and say" did you know that 'If' is the middle word in 'life'? If you can hold your head while they are around you, they will lose them "and then" I mean he is a wise man, he is a good man. I had to be a few torn claws moving across the floors of the quiet sea. "(The first one is Kipling, the second one is Eliot.)
