Korean theater has the ability to turn genres on its head, and the latest by celebrated director Chan-wook Park is a story of a good pious priest who becomes a vampire. Add a tempter that deceives him and a bit of eccentric and you have a wonderful recipe. <br /> <br /> Partial in a style similar to the "Sympathy" trilogy, it's as cute as it is dark. Steering clear of clich√© it offers some new tricks in the exaggerated vampire genre. It is an existential film that tries to confront the moral confrontation of how exactly a person should live with their conditions, rather than having the blood need. However, the film does not take up too much, and there is unlimited humor throughout. <br /> <br /> Our leaders play their roles perfectly, playing with our emotions and excitement in the dark humor. There are moments of reflection on the whole moral confrontation involved in the film, but it is never a minister. Some may overlap it and it may bump into points, but it's worth giving it a chance to finish. <br /> <br /> If you like leftfield movies, there is less better than late ones. Dark and overwhelming, it will draw a crowd. One I recommend, you will try.
