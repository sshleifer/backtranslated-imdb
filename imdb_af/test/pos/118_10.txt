one of the best movies ever ... Fire ... it's not much about sociological description of India today ... this is the thought that uses light that never stops, never gets ... normal ... even when ... In this sense, the movie is almost unique ... both are of very good quality ... the origin of Das as a street performer is pretty obvious ... her performance is an excellent "cammeo" ... but using the light ... I looked at it and looked at it again and again ... still caring for the ages ... nothing in the story ... rather a pure way Confronting the subject ... In a way it is sad that in the bizarre world we live today, a great work of art is usually known as a sex movie. Fire can face to face with Dryer's Jeanne D 'Arc or Ichikawa's Biruma no Tategoto or some of the great Kurosawa movies, just to name a few. Wishing my input a little this movie can help to its merit.
