I was a fan of Larry King's performance, I think he does a tremendous job overall and I don't think he's ever going out a bit, as so many people seem to believe. He is a subtle Scorpio, he gets his songs in when he needs, just as he could with Paris Hilton last night during her first television watch after jail. <br /> <br /> The thing about this whole thing What really surprised me is that Hilton is still apparently why not, Judge Sauer gave her what she believes was too heavy a sentence (and it actually made her ). In the whole time she was in prison, she was alone in her cell for 23 hours. She never reviewed the events that led to her being sentenced by Judge Sauer. She never once realized that it could only make up a big red flag when she (1) appeared late in court for the original trial and (2) revealed him when he asked her, she did not know that her license had not been suspended, she did not get the papers in the post, that "I have people reading that kind of thing to me." <br /> <br /> All the time she was in her cell, she never realized that this act (pop up) and that statement - and more importantly, the attitude - the utmost cavalier respect for the court system and the law in general and her management privileges in particular that she showed - judge Sauer (forgiving the pun) could have made her sour. <br /> <br /> Last night, on King's show, after giving her a lip service on how she had been forever changed through her traumatic experience, how she learned her lesson, she answered his question: "Do you think you have a rough deal? "with a sounding yes. And in the course of the conversation (if you could call it), she said more than once that she didn't feel she had deserved what had happened to her. King asked lightly more than once, if she didn't feel she was creating the situations in her life that she found herself, after which she was just staring at him. She basically holds the conscious belief that she has been victimized in this situation; she did not understand how she had made herself in court the day, by her cavalier attitude with the judge. I feel it is very sad - tragic, even considering what a great "role model" Hilton is for some people, and that makes anything she said last night about her so-called rehabilitated state in the kingdom of complete and utter blamelessness, contradiction and hypocrisy . <br /> <br /> During the interview, Hilton indicated that he was spending a lot of time in her cell reading the Bible. At the end of the interview, King scored big by asking her what her favorite Bible passage was. She responded by pointing to her pathetic notes (totally superficial non-insights, which she had read on the air as if she were Nelson Mandella or something), and eventually provoked: "I don't have a favorite part." <br /> <br /> In my book, Judge Sauer is a hero, and after last night, Larry King is exposing Hilton to what she really is.
