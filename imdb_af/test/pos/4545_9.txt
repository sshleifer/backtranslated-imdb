Well, of course, the critics hated it. It's not a movie that goes for the big critical award. But the fact is, it's really good. <br /> <br /> Certainly, if you don't like Chris Farley's physical comedy, or the extreme drought of David Spade, you won't like it. But for the rest of us, the movie has lots of hilarious, and for that matter quotes, series, and the plot isn't half as stupid as that of "Black Sheep." The parts that aren't meant to be humorous are actually done well, not what you expect from a movie of this ilk, and the play is really pretty good. <br /> <br /> "Tommy Boy" is Chris Farley's best movie without question. I give it an A and suggest you give it a view.
