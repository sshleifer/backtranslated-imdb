On the way to a country house to hear a new play, a theater producer, his secretary and the playwright are captured in the mud. They make their way to a nearby house, just to end at the playwright's fiance's home. If you can't guess that murder and murder are on the point, you didn't pay attention. <br /> <br /> It's a great entry into the old dark house genre. Not only does it have a good secret, you also have some very funny one that wander through it. The film is excellent across the board and they are more than willing to have a good time with good material. <br /> <br /> I would like to say that this is one of the best of the genre, it should have been, but something happened to me that made my score to only seven out of ten. I can't tell you what it is, anyway not sure. Perhaps it is the sense that I knew where it was almost from the beginning, or maybe something else. I don't know what, but there was something I couldn't shake that made me like this movie, despite loving it. It just missed being big and somehow lacked. <br /> <br /> It said I suggest you see it. After all, it is a very witty movie, which is fully entertained, despite being just wonderful.
