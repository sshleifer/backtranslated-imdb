Life is crazy. You're crazy, I'm crazy, we're all crazy. We're all a little Minnie, and a little Moskowitz. Sometimes it seems to be meaningful ... but then, what can you miss? <br /> <br /> You must be yours. You don't have to park cars, but you can't hide yourself behind a veil (or dark sunglasses) and pretend and act like everything is good. And sometimes you really have to be alert to the wind, because why are you still alive? <br /> <br /> I'm not going to condemn this love compared to Cassavetes' other movies, because they are all absolutely 100% unique works and each their own individual act of expression and exploration of our lives. In that sense, they are all great, and comparisons are devastating. This movie is surely crazy, sometimes maddening, but ultimately wonderful and satisfying quality that all its movies have - you never know what will happen next, and you never know what the characters are going to think, do or feel next. The characters themselves do not, and do we really want to live our lives in any other way? Unlike Moskowitz, you can have a good job and bad money in your IRA, but still live the life of an adventurer inside your feelings, your spirit and your great experience of life. Yes, we can have both ways, that's what Cassavetes shows us. Thanks, God did somebody.
