One of Fuller's (a combat veteran himself) early-quality works, but accurate hits on the many conflicting aspects of life in post-war Germany. The main character begins the film in April 45 as a Sgt with C Co, 157 Inf, 45th Div, who really ended the war in Munich, as in the movie. (The same unit in the previous month fought heavily in Aschaffenburg and then freed part of the Dachau facility). For the uninformed, the movie may seem confusing by flip-flopping between the good and bad of the German people. But everyone there or at least read well will know that most of what is featured in the movie is what really happened in 45-47 Germany. The only inaccuracy I noticed was slight: while commenting on a crossing of the Rhine crossing the remagen from the Remagen Bridge, he was remiss. But his unit really went well south of there - north of Worms Germany.
