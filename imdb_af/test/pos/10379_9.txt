Don't quite know why some people complain about this movie not being a comedy and at the same time being unrealistic. If it were realistic, there would certainly not have been much comedy. I also don't think a comedy should make you laugh aloud 20 times. There was very subtle humor, lovely feelings, and Kim Frank just portrayed a dreamy character. In real life there are many people whose facial expression does not change much, so Kim Frank kept him, was pretty good. The end was rather unrealistic, I want to say, but happy. It's a light-hearted movie with a good end. I liked it. It really loved it. A serious part was Krueger to Schwedt, and I'm glad they didn't show what happened to him. He showed how he was when he returned.
