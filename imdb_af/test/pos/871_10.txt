The movie is a pleasure to watch, not only for the plot, but also for the beautiful performances of the actors, Deneuve and Belmondo. Although a 'flop' is considered its first issue, it's a critical success, and it's clear to see why. Deneuve's acting style fits the movie brilliantly. She continually gives the impression that she is bringing something back or hiding, and her character is in this movie. I won't spoil it by saying what, although it is released fairly early. Belmondo loves the fairly naive but in love tobaccoist. I would recommend this movie to all Truffaut or Deneuve fans. It is a brilliant Hitchcockian stylist with exciting twists and interesting relationships and characters that evolve as the movie does. The movie is about 2 hours, so you feel you are not sold short. Deneuve steals the show in this movie, and it is clear that Truffaut was very much hit with her when making the film. A certain must see for any comet or moviefan. 10/10
