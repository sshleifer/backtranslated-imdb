Everyone told me this movie was not good at all, and sick etc., so I finally rented it and I was surprised. I thought the torture would be much worse, but it got shockingly near the end, but it was about it. I don't call it a horror movie, maybe a riddle or something under the category Silence of the Lambs and / or Kiss the Girls. It sometimes became dumb, but the rest of the movie kept me on the edge of my seat. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R - for strong torture, violence, language and sexuality
