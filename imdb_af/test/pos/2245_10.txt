Again, Doctor Who delivers the goods through the bucket load. It has humor ("You do it just as you go!" "Yes, but I do it brilliantly"), action, monsters (in this case even more kick-ass cubs), tragedy and terror tactics. In short, just what the doctor ordered (pun intended). The way the emotions move from one to another is done so well that there is no sense of "going on". So, lime 3 from the last 4 episodes that made you laugh, you cried, and made you 'oak'. <br /> <br /> In terms of character development, it's clearly the clincher for Noel Clarke's Mickey (and Ricky). Being one of the doctors' companions, you know he'll do the right thing, and maybe even the way he suspects it. However, this is still an emotional key when he confirms his future path. <br /> <br /> While "The rise of the Cybermen" was more of the sinister build-up to terror, "The Age of Steel" is all out of bounds. Like 'Alien' compared to 'Aliens' - both true classics but in different ways. Can the series keep it at this level? Let's hope so.
