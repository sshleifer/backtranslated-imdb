It's basically a goofball comedy, with somewhat strange pacing due to dramatic elements. For Michael J. Fox and Paul Reubens it was their first movie (Fox was previously in a short-lived TV series and a TV movie). <br /> <br /> Since the movie is actually a race / scavenger hunting type movie, like "Cannonball Run", "It's a crazy crazy crazy world", or more recently "Rat Race", there is no main characters. Instead, there are groups of characters that split the time from the screen and allow for tons of mini-pots. Usually these types of movies are a way to scratch the maximum number of stars (or semi-stars) on a movie. <br /> <br /> This one has teams, one of which is Fox's primary team, who are the only characters to be developed. Their plot is more of a stereotypical Disney performance, about a college boy who doesn't pay attention to his younger brother, who he thinks as a lazy punk. Being co-operated with the older brother's girlfriend, they are forced to work together. Being the main grave, it gets the most screen time. <br /> <br /> Some of the other fools stand out. The Blue team is about an overweight rich child, whose father only wants him and his friends out of the house. They end up with a cool fit that has an on-board computer (in 1980!) To solve the puzzles immediately, playing video games with the time saved! A member, Stephen Furst, the Dr. Shoulderbone played on "St Elsewhere" and later on "Babylon 5". I will also admit that I still laugh as Barf, while trying to unravel a word 'Scrabble', come with 'Fagabefe?' It is much stranger than Bart Simpson's Qwyjibo, in my opinion. <br /> <br /> The other three teams have slightly linked plots. The green team is a bunch of frat boys, with mostly beer worms interrupting one when the hunt leads to the Pabst Blue Ribbon Brewery. They get the chance to tease the red team, with two feminists and two fun-loving twins. The white team of nerds is led by Eddie Deezen, who was previously in "Grease", but has a major role in "Wargames" and later plays Tim Conway's sidekick in some of the Dorf series. <br /> <br /> If you grew up in the 80's, there are a few classic moments in the movie that bring memories back. The early video arcade, from the back when they were cool, is always a plus in my mind. Look for Paul Reubens and his quart shooting rifles. There is also a mini golf course and a roller disco. <br /> <br /> The movie is actually a good family movie, just because profanity hardly exists, and the small amount of sexual humor is completely innocent. The strange pacing due to the yellow team's cute dramatic moments will bring parents to sleep, while their kids can giggle at giant melons at Fat Burger. (Oh, they actually have a special melon? It should be right?)
