However, Brian comes up with a good security device. This is known as CHOMPS, which stands for domestic dog security system. The device, which looks like a dog, is actually a computer-controlled animal with the ability to knock walls and siren sounds to catch burglars. The competitive owner sends out two bungling spies (one is Red Buttons) to learn the details of the new invention. Will CHOMPS Save Norton Security? It is a fun family movie of the old school of good, clean entertainment. CHOMPS is, of course, a real dog, played by the adoring and talented Benji. In fact, Benji has a dual role, as Brian also has a "real" dog named Rascal. Just watching this puppy in action is pure joy, as it can scale walls, "drag" trucks and operate machine buttons to catch the bad guys. The human role play is also very enjoyable, with all those who are contagious infectious displays. Costumes, scenery and production values ​​are also good. Although you may have trouble finding the movie, it will be worthwhile to look out for your closest loved ones. CHOMPS is a wonderful, healthy seduction from the world's misery.
