Since 1981, Nintendo has made great video games such as Super Mario and Zelda. Most ideas will be a bit boring after 20 years. Games made by Nintendo never seem bored because they always add something new. It went from arcade games to the Wii and I hear there is a new version of the Wii available in 2011. The thing that makes Wii games so different is the fact that you actually do something instead of just sitting on the sofa and pushing buttons. <br /> <br /> And I have more good news. Super Mario Galaxy 2 released in 2010.
