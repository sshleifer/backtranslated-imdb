Rio's Rio is simply a wonderful DVD. This concert is one of the highlights of Rush's history and they deliver their music brilliantly and with more power than ever. <br /> <br /> I was fortunate to be in this concert, not just that, I was in the first row grabbing the gate that neglected the audience's stage !! It is the first and only time I have lived a Rush concert and it was a dream come true for me. I have no words to accurately describe this experience, but I can tell you this is one of the highlights of my life. Some people complain about the sound of this DVD and say it's not very clear and polished, but the sound you listen to is real, where is it in the concert. It's raw and powerful and so authentic I go back every time I see it and live that beautiful moment again. Many artists play live shows and then they make a lot of tweaking, so the final product is far from what the real concert really was. Of course, you can achieve a very sophisticated and polished sound in this way, but you don't get the right thing. This is not the case with Rush in Rio, it's the right deal! I admit that I enjoy those fancy sounding concert DVDs, I love music and the sound is a very important aspect, but it is refreshing to listen to a concert that is so honest. You listen to Rush just as they sound in a live performance, no tricks, no tweaks. This is a real live concert DVD. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend Rush in Rio, the set list is fantastic and the performances by Geddy, Alex and Neil are thinking. Not to mention the crowd, you can see how much they like Rush and sing to every voice, even YYZ which is instrumental !! I actually sing twice; In Tom Sawyer I sing "always hopeful and dissatisfaction" and in the Earth I sing "just reflect". It's only a few seconds, but I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw myself in a rabbit DVD !! Awesome !! I hope you enjoy this beautiful concert of the greatest band on earth.
