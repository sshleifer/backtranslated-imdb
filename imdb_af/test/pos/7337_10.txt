This movie was beautiful and touching. It touches a place deep inside me and I don't know why. I am a happy married woman and I have never had lesbian tendencies, but me, this movie has almost made something I long for. The choreography, the storyline, the dialogue ... the film was a work of art. <br /> <br /> Without spoilers, the synopsis is that a woman gymnast is dissatisfied with her life and is looking for something. She is with a man who doesn't want a baby, but she does. He is not important to her, but he does not treat her like a woman should be treated. I don't think he really appreciates her. All these years she stayed and decided to go back to the gym. She meets another woman during her acrobatic training and unfolds an intimate and beautiful relationship. During the film she had another female friend with whom she had trained her younger years, and they had good friends. <br /> <br /> The unfolding relationship is .. I don't know the word, but very understanding, comfortable, intimate but sexy ... something that could only exist between two women. The kind of relationship that can really bring meaning back into your life. Someone who makes you feel special, exciting, beautiful, confused. <br /> <br /> The relationship with her good friend is beautiful in a different way. They have a close and intimate relationship. Her friend showed me what a true friend is. Someone who understands, goes easy, actually, is fun to be with, someone who is there for you, no matter what. Someone who is supportive, and you can help and tell your deepest secrets. Someone who shares your past but doesn't share your secrets. <br /> <br /> The story is simple in that it is not overdoing, but does not undermine in any way. It allows many sensual images to capture its moments. The dance and choreography were amazing. I could look it over and over. The way the artist captured the main character's feelings and emotions was. The dance and the images were very brilliant and magical to watch. What a fun, wonderful story! I fell in love with this movie. If you have a chance, rent it and watch it!
