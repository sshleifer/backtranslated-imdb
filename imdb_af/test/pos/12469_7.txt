I loved the first part of this movie in Africa for about an hour or so until the animal cruelty of civilized people in Scotland got me in the second half and made me so sad that I couldn't watch it no. However, it was done by the filmmaker to make a point that early scientists made everything that they didn't understand by literally killing it, without considering the rights and comfort of the animals being studied. . is studied everywhere, but in the natural world they inhabit, and as inconspicuous as possible. I commend this movie as it was a very serious and honest story of Tarzan and made a point of showing the cruel cruelty of the 19th century scientific world. The pure and simple, beautifully primitive life Tarzan lived as a young man found as a baby and found by chimpanzees after the violent death of his parents in the African jungle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Lambert was wonderful and very soulful in his life of Tarzan role, like Ralph Richardson in his last film role as Tarzan's ultra-rich, noble-reeking gramps in Scotland. Andy MacDowell was pretty and pretty good as Tarzan's gussied-up and civilized "Jane" in her first film role. From his charismatic work in this movie and his very haunting eyes I can't understand why Lambert didn't become a big star later, but his bad movie choice made him later possible. The great Ian Holm, a wounded Frenchman in Africa helped by Tarzan and who then accompanied Tarzan to his previously unknown ancestral home in Scotland, was great as always. <br /> <br /> I'm so glad Tarzan got sick and didn't stay in animal cruelty. civilized world and then went to Africa to live his life with his soft and loving monkey "relatives" who raised him instead of living in Scotland and living like royalty. It would have ruined him if it didn't. kill him first.
