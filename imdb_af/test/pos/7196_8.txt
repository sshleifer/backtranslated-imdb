I just managed to find a copy of "Mission Cleopatra", which is not as easy as you would think for someone living in the United States. So far I've only watched the movie for the first 10 minutes, and I can safely say I laughed more in those 10 minutes than I watched the full Asterix movie's first action. <br /> <br /> I'm looking at the print version, and while the dubbing is a bit disturbing, I found the movie to be very funny and true to the book. I see people here saying that the print version is much inferior to the caption version, it can be very good, and after watching the caption version (also on my DVD) I might have to come here and change my review . However, as it stands, I find it a very entertaining movie, and it makes more than the mess they made from the first movie.
