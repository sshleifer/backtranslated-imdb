Good Film. <br /> <br /> I managed to pick it up on DVD in a local store sale. Â£ 2.99 looks like a good deal and that is. Thing is the movie is called "To Kill For". It did some research to discover its original name. <br /> <br /> In the United Kingdom, it is considered an 18 and right, although the standard of films depends on the "ability to sell". After I saw Final Destination 3 last night, it had to be 18 according to me. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the fact that the glorious Traci Lords are in it tends to raise the rating board to 18. Such a shame. <br /> <br /> Traci is a great actress and has the chance to appear in bigger and bigger budget productions. She has the ability to turn what is branded a B movie, in a fine show, nothing less than wonderful. <br /> <br /> Long Live Traci Lords and her incredible talent as an actress.
