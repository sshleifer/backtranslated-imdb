Shout to all the wonderful fans of this movie who not only saw and appreciated it, but (based on the very literate commentary) it actually gets! I have always considered Paul Mazursky's "Tempest" as a spectacle to the Shakespeare game of the same name, as recorded in some other reviews above. On the other hand, if you are looking for a more simple adaptation of the play, look elsewhere. However, as an experiment, it only succeeds spectacularly. Charming, moving, funny, sad, dramatic ... it's all and much more. Cast, places, writing, music are just fantastic. Cassavetes and Rowland were never better. Susan Sarandon's turn is more than the good job of coming down from her in the future. Molly Ringwald makes her movie debut unforgettable and you just have to love Raul Julia's performance ... he steals the show in various scenes. Besides, the always wonderful Cassavetes were confident and he guaranteed enough to leave him! A study of what the thematic elements of Shakespeare's classic life can be if it is replenished in more modern times, "Mazursky's" Tempest "brand brilliantly!
