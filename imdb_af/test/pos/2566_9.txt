then you will be a big fan of this movie. It's almost the same basic concept, a nice mix of music, soul and drama. I will admit, I was a little anxious to see this movie, I just saw previews of a white rubbish mission connected to a radiator, but I'm a big fan of Samuel L. Jackson and I have Hustle & Enjoy, so I thought I'd give it a chance. <br /> <br /> I'm glad I did. It was more than just the surface story of a nimfomanian southern girl captured by a 60-year-old black man. The story had the heart and was very influential. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie also gave a nice touch. Craig Brewer blended his style of Hustle & Flow into this movie, except for a new twist and use the Blues. His musical plays are still at the top of the cards as performance schools go by. He also has many interesting flashback scenes and just gives you an overall crazy feeling during some of the more controversial scenes. <br /> <br /> No doubt, if you like Hustle & Flow, you'll love this movie, and if you're a fan of the blues you'll definitely have a look over here. I give it a 9 out of 10, very interesting movie, and it's much lower than the rated. shy. <br /> <br /> Go and rent this movie.
