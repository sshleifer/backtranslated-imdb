IMDb forces reviewers to type a certain number of lines, but all I really want to say is, "It's an incredible movie, and you can't see yourself as a movie fan if you've seen it." You should just trust me on this one and stop reading this review and get the movie and play. But I have to type something. So, let me point out the following: <br /> <br /> (1) Contains River's Edge that can still stand well as Crispin Glover's all-time funniest and best performance in a movie, and if you're Crispin Glover To all, you know it's just fair to give it a 10. Funny lines in general. <br /> <br /> (2) River's Edge is the second most popular show of Dennis Hopper's career (except the one in Blue Velvet), and it's really great. Dennis Hopper is very funny. <br /> <br /> (3) River's Edge has the best performance of Keanu Reeves' career, and it's great. It was the role he was born to play. He has very good lines, but one is especially funny. Now listen when his character and the stepfather talk to each other. <br /> <br /> Still the best Stoner movie, it's much more than just that. It tends to appear in the drama sections of movie rental stores, but if it's a drama, it's the funniest drama of all time.
