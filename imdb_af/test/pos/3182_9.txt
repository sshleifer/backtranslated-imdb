It was such a huge series for black people at the time. We loved it so much. It was the only show on black middle-class families at t.v. at that stage. Please release it on DVD. I know many ... many people who are still talking about the show. If released, I'm sure many black youth will find this informative as well as interesting. The show addressed many topics of racism, intra-racial discrimination, teenage pregnancy, brothers and sisters, single parenting, peer pressure and much more. The show ended in such a scary way and left his supporters speechless and wondered why it was taken out of the air. Since then, we have seen only a few of the actors and actresses. Please fix it on DVD ASAP.
