My one-line summary suggests that it's not a good movie, but it's not true. I enjoyed the movie, but probably expected too much. <br /> <br /> Adele, portrayed by Susan Sarandon, has not come across as a very nice character. She is fleeing and irresponsible for what would be an unforgivable degree if not for the tremendous love she has for her daughter. This is the one thing she knows how to do without delay. Adele's daughter, Anna, is a sad girl who is so busy making her mother's shortcomings that she is not just 14-17 years old. Naturally, this makes Natalie Portman the perfect choice to play Anna, as she also never turns 14 to 17 years old. Portman pulls this role out so easily that you almost forgot that she didn't make movies for 20 years. Still, even with the two solid leads, Wayne Wang never seems to pull the audience properly as he did with The Joy Luck Luck and even more with Smoke. Although I didn't read the book, the movie feels like it has changed the story to bring it to the big screen, changes that can drain the emotional urgency of the story. I enjoyed the movie for the pleasure of seeing two wonderful actresses do their job, but I never lost experience and I never related to their fate.
