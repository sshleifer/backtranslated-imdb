I was thrown into the beach scene as the Surfer Dude. Almost thrown as the muscular man, as the right muscle man was really late on that day. Pauly had my brother and I (the skateboarder in front of the tattoo site), and had some vj stuff between Venice's life as he was still doing his MTV thing. This movie is also really good. Would it have made me top 100 if I wasn't in it ........?
