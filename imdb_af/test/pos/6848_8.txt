Thirty pieces of silver and a kiss for happiness. This one was another totally unexpected gem. Usually I'm not even a thriller / thriller fan. These satisfying 100 minutes have more twists than a promenade pretzel. It features erotic romance, reminiscent of "body heat" in more ways than one; it has police and crime; political plot and just a day's soap. It only has the right touch of fierce violence that any professional "by-the-numbers" crime has to employ. Emma Thompson, (FBI AIC), delivers her role with grace and humor and gets my vote for the best fake southern accent by a Limey. Alan Rickman (local police officer), who always wants to steal the look of the show, is excellent but not offensive. They work well as a few. Many plot misdirections that never get out of control and are reconnected coherently at the end of the movie. And who is this wonderful woman, Carla Gugino? I want her to carry my children. Carla, if you're there, come for lunch
