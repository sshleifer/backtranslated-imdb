I loved this movie, the audience I was part of this movie, and the little 7-year-old girl who was with me loved this movie. We all laughed at the words, the visual humor, and the good feeling that you left the theater when it ended. I could easily see why it was so good in France. I plan to buy the DVD, so I can see it again and laugh at all the pieces I missed, because I laughed for the first time.
