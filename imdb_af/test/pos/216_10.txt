The inspiration for the "Naked Gun" movies casts Leslie Nielsen - who recently started comedy - as the incompetent but fortunate Frank Drebin, who must always solve an absurd case. Like 'plane!' and the series-based movies make the humor based on Mel Brooks-style spotlights and stupid comments (namely the "yes it is" remarks), along with the fact that Nielsen remains very serious despite the nonsense around him . And of course, the final framework in which something moves. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that the show had only six episodes. At least it grew the movies. You can't miss Leslie Nielsen in these roles. I suspect they all had fun filming it. Really funny. <br /> <br /> * Before the plane! Leslie Nielsen was in movies such as "Forbidden Planet", "Harlow" and "The Poseidon Adventure". Only in late 1987 did he play together with Barbra Streisand and Richard Dreyfuss in 'Nuts'. But since the first "Naked Gun" movie, it's all the comedy all the time.
