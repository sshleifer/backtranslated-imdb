I really appreciate what Jung won before he died. Everything. I want to say that his choice for love is selfless. If he chose Da-rim, it would be good for him. But Da-rim will need more time to recover from his death. Obviously he didn't want it to happen. As he did in the film, he decided to give up. So it was just temporary anxiety for Da-rim. <br /> <br /> In comparison, My life is very different to me. Their behavior shows great difference between Eastern Culture and Western culture. I can't say what's better. Everyone has the right to choose. It's completely up to you. Life is equal to everyone. We can only live once. Any choice is acceptable if you just think it is right for you. <br /> <br /> In fact, the slow pace of the movie cannot be the excuse for rejecting the movie. Just calm down. You'll get more of the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the best Korean movies I've ever watched. 9/10
