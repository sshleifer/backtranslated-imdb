It's the best 3-D experience Disney has in their theme parks. It's definitely better than their original 1960's acid-travel movie in its place, leagues better than "Honey I Shrunk The Audience" (and much more fun), scarcely frightened by the MuppetVision 3-D movie at Disney-MGM and can even beat the original 3-D "Movie Experience" Captain EO. This movie revives some of Disney's greatest musical hits from Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, and others, and has a smile on my face all over the show. It's also a totally kid-friendly movie, unlike "Honey ..." and has more effects than the spectacular "MuppetVision"
