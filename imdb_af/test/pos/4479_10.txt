I remember reading the original Balzac story in college French. <br /> <br /> I remember Ken Nordine from WGN TV in Chicago, and read it as one of his late night shows. <br /> <br /> Always love the story, but never believe they can or will do it. To my surprise they did very well. <br /> <br /> Few of any Balzac stories lend themselves to dramatization, which is unfortunate, and - cat lover I am, I always hoped it would be filmed without film. a lot of Hollywood sex. It's as close to perfect conversion as it can be done. <br /> <br /> The theater of the mind is always better than the eye can see, but it's as close as I think it can come to leaving the imagination. To read, meet the reality of seeing.
