Those who want to see movie noir remakes shouldn't see it as a remake, you'll always be disappointed. Instead, enjoy a nice show by Dennis Quaid and visual images to praise. The color drains from the movie (literally, not metaphorically!)) If the plot picks up, and the dialogue is sharp and eager. The opening dialogue is smart, and the viewer is taken along with a sharp script and a real, original film noir feel.
