I saw this fine movie soon to leave the college. As I sat there and watched Alice go from oppressed virgin to sexual adventurer, I wondered why her sexual encounters were known. Then I remember - Intro Psig 101 Reading! One of the lectures dealt with the psychosocial stages of development, basically shifting over time to what part of the body and its accompanying stimuli are receiving our attention, as well as the changing emphasis on what pleases us. Alice's first encounter is bathed, emphasizing the genitals and bottom. Her next encounter is an oral one with the Mad Hatter's thing. I forgot the rest of the reading and the sequence of Alice's encounters, but I remember how well they fit. It's interesting to see a skin spot with a brain behind it, rather than the click "I'm here to deliver your pizza. Let's screw." <br /> <br /> I don't see how Kristin DeBell's career can be. ruined by this movie because it was her first movie. And Reagan's tiring hypocrisy hasn't messed up this country when it was released, but somehow he and his stubborn Meese influenced Ms DeBell. When Meese established its anti-pornographic commission (to divert people from its own criminal activities), Meese hired anti-porn activist Judith Reisner. Reisner was obsessed with images that she regarded as child pornography. She saw the "Alice" cover, Ms DeBell, for Playboy and immediately announced that she had scientifically proven that Ms DeBell was actually a photo collage of parts of several adult women and the face of a ten year old. Yes, right.
