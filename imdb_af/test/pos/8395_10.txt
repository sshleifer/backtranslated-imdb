This is one of the most cerebral insightful movies I've ever seen. The writing language, costumes, landscape, plot, characters, etc. Everyone is supreme. You won't be bored. I watched intensively or even listened to this movie while working so many times, I lost count. Scarlett is aging gracefully and acquires wisdom beyond her years. This film takes you from Tara to Ireland where her family originally came from and you see the results of another civil war being played there, this time between Irish and English. <br /> <br /> This movie shows the dual standards of men at the time - a man is still respected if he has friends and whores, but not a woman. If she is only seen in a private place with a man, society budgeted her for impropriety. And of course, Scarlett always thought outside the box, broke rules when needed to create the necessary change, help people and / or survive. <br /> <br /> Scarlett's beauty is definitely up and running. Her strength, self-esteem and wisdom grow as she is eternal. <br /> <br /> I remember her lines when I was confronted too much on my plate, such as: "Tomorrow is another day" and the way she behaved herself, her determination and courage, and taught her has. experiences. It's a good movie to show your daughters because it teaches a woman how important it is to have respect for yourself and that men, especially very nice, can have two sides and can treat a woman differently, depending on how she acts and respects herself. An attractive woman should learn what this movie teaches. <br /> <br /> This movie is like therapy for me, and it's better than Gone with the Wind. The second part will take place in Ireland and everyone who is Irish will cherish the scenery, people and Scarlett's character in it.
