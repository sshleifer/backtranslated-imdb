Hey, it's just TV. Sure, it's STAR TREK, the most popular blah blah, and it's a good one, but it's relative. What it amounts to is a man in eleven ears grooving with a mushroom pizza-colored shag bakkie. <br /> <br /> There is a kind of THIRD MAN noirishness on the tunnel hunt, and it's more beautiful than many episodes of what is one of the better TV shows. The tension is actually tension. The danger really feels dangerous. As a little kid, I think I was crying when Spock told me that this delightful creature was so sad, scared and horrible than the people who ate it. It was one of my early empathy lessons, a lesson that was enhanced by the EMPATH episode. It was, if less exciting, even more melancholy. <br /> <br /> What bothered me when I was five was that this thing, like meat and tomato barf, somehow actually consisted of more or less rock. Now that kind of choice can be seen, an idea of ​​a hippie designer of the one-universe that is transparent, but it can only blow off the drug era.
