Tim Burton, the man behind the original Batman movie and Beetlejuice, brings the world the successor of Batman, which exceeds the original in more ways than one. First, Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny De Vito are a good combination of Batman's enemies. The dark, deadly and sexy Catwoman works well to rattle some heads in the story and work penguins just as the joker worked in the original. The sets are beautiful and immaculate. Gotham City has so many dark corridors that you can never know what happens at one time or another. The only thing that gives it a bad name is its script, which sometimes occurs and then does not recover. Tim Burton's direction brings superhero movies to a new world. Beat all the superman movies and the other Batman movies with a mile. Although the new Batman has started, it has a bite where this one is missing, but Burton is a more original director than Nolan.
