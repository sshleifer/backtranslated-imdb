There are a few things in life that we cannot experience more than once and the college experience is one of them. Especially when we live in a foreign country and in an apartment with 6 wackos from 6 different countries. Xavier's main character leaves his neat life in Paris, his former hippie mother and his lovely friend, and goes to Barcelona to study Spanish to get a job at the embassy. He falls in love with the wife of a French doctor and he makes friends who look at things differently. When Wendy's brother (Wendy is one of the roommates) comes from England, the movie starts to snapper. Well, anyway, Xavier starts things differently with all his new friends and he probably lives something he'll never forget and will change his life forever. Overall a very nostalgic movie, which is even more interesting due to the multinational cast. I thought it was very interesting that you could see all these children from different countries, all of them speaking different languages ​​and different cultures interacting with each other. I gave it 9 out of 10 because I left the theater with a smile on my face and thinking of things I haven't done while I'm in college and want to do it before it's too late.
