Real-life husband and wife Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly star in creation, telling the time of Charles Darwin's life before the publication of "On the Origin of Species" in 1859, his infamous, world-changing toms of evolution and natural selection. Darwin's research has created an enormous gap, a split between the believers of his day and scientists. He said at the time that he was going to fight God and even kill God. <br /> <br /> The movie revolves around Darwin's life with his wife and four children. Jennifer Connelly is excellent as his most loving and loving woman. A public scene at the beginning when she led the table in prayer, and Charles failed to say, "Amen" is a shadow of what will follow and the sharp differences between the two. She is convinced that he will forever be condemned and bring misfortune to their family by rejecting God. <br /> <br /> Darwin is torn between his strong love for his wife, her faith and his even stronger reason. There are beautiful moments of observing animals, tracing their behavior and explaining their lives, the phenomena of selection to their children, first born, Annie, with a very morbid curiosity. We see him interacting with England's first orangutan, Jenny, playing with it as if it were a kid, deciphering her every look and action. <br /> <br /> Annie, the eldest child, dies later and Charles is haunted by her death, closest to her. In my opinion, this part was too long, bizarre and drawn out. I didn't like the trippy scenes where he apparently lost his mind and was left behind by his daughter's ghost, screaming and ranting. Although Charles thinks his wife blames him for her fatal illness, she says very poetically: "The truth is, if I knew then what I know now, I would marry you tomorrow." Their band is solid and unbreakable, despite tremendous differences in faith. <br /> <br /> When Charles completes his manuscript, he gives his wife the final copy, telling her she can burn it if she disagrees. She stays at the end of the night reading and finally offers him a package, the book is ready to be sent to his publisher. In the end, reason and maybe also love, triumph, because he is an accomplice of his strongest opponent. <br /> <br /> It is fascinating that Darwin received a full Christian funeral at Westminster Abbey, proving his ground breaking ideas were obviously considered controversial, but has already been recognized as essential knowledge for humanity promotion . <br /> <br /> The movie definitely draws on Darwin's family life, his joys and troubles. I looked this aspect, but Fabio said it was like watching a documentary. I call it "Hitler's passion for table tennis". This is true in some respects and I disagree with his desire to learn more about Charles Darwin's theories from this movie than we do. However, it remains a well-executed and flawlessy acted drama. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 Fabios: 7 Total points: 14
