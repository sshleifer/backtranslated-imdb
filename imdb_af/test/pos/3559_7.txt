Bounty killer George Hilton, smooth Mexican bandit Gilbert Roland (who is wonderful), and bank representative Edd Byrnes, are trying to overwhelm each other as they search for a large amount of gold from one of Roland's train robberies by a treacherous member of his gang. <br /> <br /> Though not the biggest of the genre, it's still broad enough with lots of light, action-packed fun and a satisfying final. <br /> <br /> Any firearm can be remembered mainly for opening the ghost where George Hilton easily fired three apostates who look like Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Django. <br /> <br /> The following year, Hilton and Roland were reunited with Van Heflin and Klaus Kinski highly recommended The Ruthless Four.
