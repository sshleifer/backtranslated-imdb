This movie is funny and sad enough. I think it's a bit true. If you like Office Space, you'll love this movie because it's another Mike Judge hit, but it's nothing like Office Space. I told everybody to see this movie. I just wish it would have been in more theaters, so it would have earned the recognition it deserved. I love this movie and would like to see more of Mike Judge. Luke Wilson also makes this movie what it is. I'm so glad I wouldn't be alive in the year 2505, because if this movie turns out to be us, we're all in trouble. I just hope more people see this movie because I know they will fall with it too.
