Not a bad movie, but could be done in one of the opening styles without the full frontal nudity of a 10-year-old boy. This movie has excellent dialogue; This is certainly common among foreign films. Foreign actors still know how to act unlike American actors who let the CGI, stunts and special effects do everything for them. This movie is just a good old fashion play. Gerarde DePardieux has always done an excellent job. The costumes and scenery are accurate with time. My only complaint was that they had to use the English words about French instead of using subtitles; It can only be because I hate reading subtitles.
