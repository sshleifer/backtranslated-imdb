Bobbie Phillips, who in his own right picked up a huge list of credits as a hard-working Hollywood actress, appears in this third installment of UPN and Village Roadshow's Chameleon series. In this installment, the sexual innuendo was taken away with Kam pointing a caring mother's side to a recent orphan genius teenager. Bobbie plays this role to the big panache viewers. The action and stunts were the best in the series.
