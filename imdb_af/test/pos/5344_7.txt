There was something about the original three films that made them so special and delicious - probably their length. Unfortunately, it lacks the charm, but it still becomes a fun movie. <br /> <br /> The bright glittering side is that our favorite plastic figures still do a good job, there is good plastic animation used. There is a stupid but well-structured and entertaining plot, an exciting, fun adventure, a good plot idea (a rabbit and a huge recognizable competition) and good new characters! <br /> <br /> As well as the original charm lacking, the only other, bleak, gloomy side of the movie. The humor, though good, is slightly exaggerated, especially when compared to the original films. <br /> <br /> The popular Giant Vedgetable competition is close, and Wallace and Gromit help control eats to eat any vedgetables, now they are Anti pesto. They do a good job, but soon there is danger. A wash rabbit is close ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for all Wallace and Gromit fans and for people who love plastic films, enjoy "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Wererabbit" :-)
