I grew up in New York City and every afternoon ABC showed the 4:30 movie. Saratoga Trunk was one of the first movies I remember watching as a child. I loved this movie and it stayed with me for years. I recently watched it again and still thought it was great - maybe I'm just a romantic - but I thought it was well done. I don't want to say that this movie was just good because of the lead actors - I really didn't know who they were when I first saw it - I just knew how quality a child is. Both Bergman and Cooper were excellent. I especially liked seeing old New Orleans during this movie. If you ever get a chance to visit New Orleans, you should see movies showing the city during that time. If you see some of the old houses in the French Quarter (not just Bourbon Street) or abroad, you can really imagine your life as it was 100 years ago. <br /> <br /> I love old movies - this one for me is a great movie !!
