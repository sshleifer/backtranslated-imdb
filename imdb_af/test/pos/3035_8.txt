I saw Conrack on a night I couldn't sleep and I was never so happy to have insomnia! This story of a young white teacher taking a position to teach poor black children to an island in the Carolina is a good advertisement for teaching and helping one another. In the early 60's, with civil rights issues, Viet Nam and everything that came at the 60s, was forgotten that the Peace Corps and many young people had struggled to make a difference that helped the unjust. Concern with his open learning style is interested in these children as people and encourages honest interaction in his class that is the power that is scared. The biggest part was that Jon Voight said they had 20 years of reunion and 18 of them became teachers !! It's enough to make you think that we as humans might have a chance to survive, perhaps hopefully. See this movie.
