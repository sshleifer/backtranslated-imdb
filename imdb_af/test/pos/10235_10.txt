Nightbreed is definitely my favorite movie, I've worn more than one band as it is. The makeup is wonderful, the story is beautiful. It takes a few different twists and is not quite as deep as the story on which it is based (Cabal, by Clive Barker), but for a movie adaptation it remains very much true of source material. The only problem with this movie was the producer's futile attempts to change it into a teenage treasure movie, hence the changing end to allow for prosecutions * eyeglasses *. Apparently we will one day get a director cut that will (hopefully) clear this little nonsense. Until then, I suggest it to anyone who likes the dark fantasy kind of horror, unlike the Freddy / Jason / Micheal type slashers. I really don't know what would be comparable ...
