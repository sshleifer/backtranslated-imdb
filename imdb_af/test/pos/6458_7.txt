Axel Nordman (Cassavetes) points to the New York docks looking for a job, but with a hidden past. He gets one on condition that he repay a kick to Jack Warden. While establishing a friendship with black man Sydney Poitier, it unfortunately leads to a deadly moral dilemma for a man we teach is typical of his problems. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like Oscar winner At the Waterfront, feels like the waterfront, and most importantly it plays much like the 1954 Kazan production. However, the racial theme is groundbreaking for the time being. The Black Poitier and the White Cassavetes are treated in all respects as equals. It can even be called the first of the black-and-white "friend" photos that later dominate so many action films. <br /> <br /> It helps the two play so well apart. Nonetheless, the film's central mistake is not to indicate why the crew member Poitier is pushing a friendship with the Cassourists first. He really goes out of his way to befriend the newcomer. But why he would overcome racial barriers to doing so is never really suggested. One possible explanation is that Poitier wants to use Cassavetes as a pledge in his rivalry with other crew member Warden, but then really comes as the man. There is some indication of this in some of Cassavetes' suspicious reactions, but the relationship remains unmotivated. <br /> <br /> If there was a single shot in the whole movie, I couldn't see it. Everything is done in the ugly New York City, without the usual movie extras. In this respect, it is an anti-Hollywood production, carefully saturated to the nightclub scene that itself looks like a real after-hours crowd. I suppose sociologists will promise this rather raw cut-of-life a glimpse of the working poor. <br /> <br /> Yet, for all its virtues, which is great, the film remains too close to the Brando-Kazan movie for comfort. Here's a fine unknown actress Kathleen Maguire the role of the redeeming girl friend, Warden, the role of the corrupt boss, while Cassavetes, like Brando, has to suffer a bloody beating before recovering his moral status and doing the right thing. Yet, despite the derivative nature, the gritty urban drama retains enough of the original power to earn a watch-see.
