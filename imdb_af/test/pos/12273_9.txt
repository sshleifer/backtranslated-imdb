"Zen and the Art of Lanscaping", written and directed by David Kartch, is a short film about a young man named David (his friends call him Zen) and appear on one strange day of his life. Zen works as a lancecaper for a higher middle class family. The wife of the house tries to get Zen to help her fraud on her husband. Unfortunately her son walks on them instead of her husband. From this stage, the movie begins with many revelations between the characters and the ultimate involvement of the man of the house. "Zen and the art of landscaping" is written witty, clever and overall good. The comic timing of the actors is also very strong. It's a fun, light movie I highly recommend.
