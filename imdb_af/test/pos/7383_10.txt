It's one of my favorite movies of all time, it's great to watch in groups, I find. It's also nice for any Alan Rickman fan, he does such a wonderful job. It's annoying, entertaining, very surprising ... you should see it at least twice. I didn't watch it with anyone who didn't like it or at least found it worth it.
