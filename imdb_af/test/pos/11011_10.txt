During my teenage years or for the first time I have to say that I eat all kinds of SF novels every day of the week. It was in the Sixties and Seventies when TV was not such a major leisure killer as it was today, one night in the mid-seventies. I watched the movie on TV. I think it was ARD and I was amazed. I was impressed in a way I can remember every day at every scene. <br /> <br /> Today I see my kids playing the SIMS or something and I think we're close to what that Fassbender Movie has expressed. I would also appreciate if I could buy this movie on a DVD. But in vain I almost tried everything to get a tip. The movie MATRIX cannot be far from the quality and state of the art of this movie. And at the moment we don't have a glue if we were a superior reality, or just one of a few simulation models. Probably after our death we will definitely know ...
