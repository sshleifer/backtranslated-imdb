If you like Vampire Lore and are a fan of Gothic horror, you may be able to check Soul's Midnight. I didn't know much about this movie before I watched it, and I didn't expect much, but I found the movie to be fun and entertaining. <br /> <br /> With Armand Assante as leader of vampires Simon, Soul separates himself from other low-budget vampire flashes by weaving in the mythology of St George and the Dragon in a fun new way. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure what the budget for this movie was, but I feel that if it was a bit more, they would really hit the gore and effects in the house. <br /> <br /> When you get up one night, you're in the mood for a fun low budget vampire flick then Soul's Midnight is a good choice.
