I'm so impressed, really. I expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing else. <br /> <br /> OK, there is a lot of nice geeky humor. But the movie is so well done. The play is pretty good. <br /> <br /> I think the gamer crowd is not bad at all, though sometimes I am cute. At times it is even, dare I say, wonderful. <br /> <br /> When the female gamer, who built this non-traditional fighter-type character, gets the usual (minimum / maximum) type of all these additional attacks (looks right, I didn't check the rules .) It was cool. <br /> <br /> The sets are great for what a reasonably low production film should be. <br /> <br /> The story moves to the right. The transitions from game world to real world are well done. A man who plays a female character is sometimes played by a female and sometimes by himself. Well clever, I thought. <br /> <br /> The guy who decided to play a woman, but remember he was female, was good for many laughs. He even put one end tag and the female went to play the role (sorry, I didn't pick her name but she did well.) The man always tries to get a little, has a a little boring, but I think it was more gamer humor. <br /> <br /> There was just as much to keep the movie. Light-hearted. Fun! Very well done and I say this as a movie fan, not a gamer (and I'm not a D&D player.) As I said, I expected so much less. Movies often don't pay attention to me, I listen to them while working on my computer. This one kept my attention. I can't praise a movie much higher.
