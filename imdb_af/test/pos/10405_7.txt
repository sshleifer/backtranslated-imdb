I can't praise this movie enough. It has a very handshake camera with the first person I love (and some hate because it makes them sick), such as REC, Cloverfield and Blair Witch Project. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie for its kind, but I didn't even notice because the movie was so interesting. By just showing the footage of a paranormal reporter's work, the movie keeps pace and makes it a real-time experience for the viewer. <br /> <br /> While I will never mention this movie, the "scariest horror ever made", I will have to say it is definitely one of the best I have ever seen. The fear factor here is built by details in the images, camera glitches, related events, which lend a very mysterious and haunting tone to the film. The horror is more that is not shown, but left to our imagination. The end is perfect, and is warned that you may have nightmares afterwards. However, a second look is highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Watch this one alone in the dark, don't expect anything and you'll have fun.
