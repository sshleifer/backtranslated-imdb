It has become a great surprise to me. I have never heard of this movie when I first saw it and the title really indicated something other than a great terrorist / hostage situation at a high school. Toy Soldiers has the best of its early 90s, where action was light-hearted and very pleasant. The action is good, the plot is interesting and the top one, the bad man is a one-dimensional hateful douchebag (that's wonderful), Louis Gossett Jr. is in it, it's just a good movie I thoroughly enjoyed. . <br /> <br /> You can't miss this one if you like action. I give it a good score of 8/10.
