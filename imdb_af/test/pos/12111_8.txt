Klaus Kinski jumped into a considerable number of spaghetti westerns throughout the 60's and early 70's; He was usually thrown into secondary parts as nasty villains. Kooky Klaus lands himself a juicy starring role as Crazy Johnny Laster, a dirty, winding and distorted sex maniac that exploits a plan to deprive a beautiful heir to gain her substantial legacy. Johnny and his gang wanted refugees after the plan went wrong. Author / director Mario Costa is a bad compelling portrait of a heavily ill and twisted piece of life. The plot unfolds on a steady pace, the tone is correct and serious and the exciting action scenes are performed with the right skill and brio (the shooting in rock garments is particularly gripping and exciting). Ironically dressed in white, with oily charisma from every rotten pore, jumping on beautiful women every chance he gets, Kinski's Johnny makes for a captivating, scary and monstrous brute. Kinski is simply spectacular as this glamorous repulsive character; He received fine support from the gorgeous Gabriella Giorgelli as a nice salon girl Juanita, Steven Tedd as the joyous Riccardo, Giovanni Pallavicino as ruthless band-gang leader Machete, Giuliano Raffaella as clever lawyer Gary Pinkerton, and Paolo Casella as Johnny's sensible parties Glen. Kudos is also in order for Stelvio Cipriani's moody and enthusiastic score. Worth seeing for Kinski fans.
