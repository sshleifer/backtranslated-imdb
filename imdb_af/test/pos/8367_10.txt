I can never imagine I will love such movies. Having seen Yimou Zhang's 'Hero', I decided to watch his other movies, perhaps looking for something similar. The second Yimou Zhang movie I watched was "No One Less" and I realized what kind of cinema I was now. No wonder why I immediately get 'Cool'. It's a simple touch and brilliant piece of cinema. I pay my respect for the director. <br /> <br /> This movie shows it's not the amount of money film makes good. It's all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is. The story is very simple, a typical excerpt of a typical daily life, which is also shown in a very simple way. The camera's movements also enhance the impression and feel of the film. I give a top rating to this movie and wait impatiently to watch other Yimou Zhang movies.
