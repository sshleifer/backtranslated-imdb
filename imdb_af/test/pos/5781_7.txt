I was very happy this year to see several films at my university's art museum. On occasion, well, more than half the time, I can't see the movies there. I systematically tried to watch each of the movies I missed. So far plagues and pleasure on the Salton Sea and who killed the electric car? are the other movies I watched this way. The film covers an intriguing subject and is well-theoretical (emphasis later), but not as successful as pests and pleasures, but much better than electric cars. <br /> <br /> The film's thesis concern is the future of the American concept of suburban life. This calls for the feasibility of such a practice as oil prices rise. So, the film discusses the origin of the suburb, and it is evolution until the early 2000s. One theme the film discusses is the alienation that creates the suburb among its inhabitants. While several people can live together, they don't know each other as we define it. This represents the strength of the film: its appeal to real human emotion. We can understand the filmmakers' argument so much easier because they do not have to convince us of the legitimacy of their argument. This is also one of the reasons why Salton Sea is such a wonderful documentary. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Suburbia loses his message in firearm explanation in support of his central argument. As the interviewers speak, their arguments are becoming increasingly related to those made by militant environmentalists. We are told that oil production will hit its peak in this decade, but no scientific evidence (professional reports, statistics, graphs, etc.) to support this claim. We get little information on how this date was calculated. Luckily this was the only significant mistake I could find in the film's argument, but it was a brilliant one. Another less important contradiction I noticed was the liberal (political) bias that some viewers could polarize. However, this prejudice reveals thorough cuts of various events and not the filmmakers themselves. The cuts, especially those of the 1950s, were unnecessary for me. The film was no better with their presence and would be more consistent in their absence. <br /> <br /> If I thought more about this movie before I compiled this review, I thought why I found his argument more convincing than other documentary documents I watched recently. Finally, I realized that the filmmakers were actually analyzing the suburban problem. They propose a decentralized town system where the pockets of people will live together. They claim this practice would reduce the need for fossil fuels and reduce space savings. They define lost space than the long stretches of parking areas between shops, for example. What is incredible about this assumption is that it is actually conceivable. Most documentary documents vaguely indicate that some issues need to be terminated but offer no way to do so. Think more about the movie, I decided that this analysis is what saved the movie for me and why I give it a favorable review. <br /> <br /> Although not perfectly convincing, the end of Suburbia is a valuable investment of the time. Not only does it address the current problem of sprawl, it also offers realistic insight into how to change it. The audience can also enjoy the high production value with several cuts from the 1950s split with modern arguments. People living in Atlanta, Georgia or the Triad region of North Carolina will especially enjoy this documentary, as sprawl is the most established.
