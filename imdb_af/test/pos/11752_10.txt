I saw for the first time in the mid-60s when I was a teenager, and it brought me so badly, actually the final scene where Han Suyin hears from Mark's death and then jumps into the hill in disbelief, where you then Mark's voice heard and said, "Give me your hand," and then the image of him, the butterfly with its superstitious meaning, the music, the shattered emotions of Love of Han Suyin, just left me. I was bitterly crying, my mother and sister looked up and were shocked at my reaction. I just left the room to be alone. Fortunately, I no longer respond so much, but I always shout at the end. I love everything about the movie, the music mostly, Han Suyin's costumes, and the place. The beauty of Jennifer Jones and the handsome William Holden, they were both at their best. I have the VHS and DVD of this wonderful movie. I also have two versions of the music and lyrics by Arthur Newman and Sammy Fain. I also have the book 'A Many Splendored Thing' by Han Suyin. I recommend this movie to 100%
