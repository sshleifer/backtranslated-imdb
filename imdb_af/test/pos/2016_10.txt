I loved this movie. It is a very simple plot and from what I understand it is based on a true story. Growing up in the 80's with hard rock / hair metal can have something to do with my love for this movie, but even apart from the music it is a very funny movie to watch. Try it, you will love it unless you are the hardest of critics and just like Citizen Kane caliber movies.
