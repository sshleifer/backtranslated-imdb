Trey Parker and Matt Stone, creators of South Park, finally come out of their disturbing schedule to talk to the cameras while enjoying champagne in their hot tub. Only when I looked at it did I not feel as much sarcasm as it was in it. I knew they were joking when they were complaining about different actors on the show and when Trey said he was not going to give his mother his money, but there are so many sarcasm throughout, that this documentary is more of a cartoon full jokes inside. <br /> <br /> This "documentary" shows everything about South Park (until the second season anyway). It shows behind the scenes with the animation and the recording. It has interviews, many of which are fake interviews, but some, among all the manufactures, provide insight into the performance. Tracks of both Trey Parker's Spirit of Christmas shorts are shown as well as great cuts from the show. If you were a South Park fan, it had to be thirsty to show you knowledge at the end of 1998 when it was made. Now, of course, the show has changed, but it's still interesting. <br /> <br /> What we have here is an amusing documentary where Trey Parker (especially) and Matt Stone come as arrogant jerks and that's exactly what they wanted to get out of. They can be in this way in real life, but here it was a joke, a 51-minute insightful joke. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** from ****. 51 minutes. Not rated, contains language and sexual content.
