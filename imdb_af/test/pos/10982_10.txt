In a time when Hollywood thinks it's harder, faster, and bloody, Manna From Heaven comedies and touches look at something we all thought of: What would I do if a load of money fell out of the air? <Br /> <br /> Interestingly, the characters took many years to realize that the money didn't make a single difference in their lives. They all become what they are destined to be. Unfortunately, in most cases, what they have become, was unfortunate, despite their fortune many years ago. <br /> <br /> While Manna is the well-known Hollywood story of Good vs. Evil offers, or in the case, grace vs. Greed, which separates this film is that Good is gaining from the conversion of evil, not by shattering it. <br /> <br /> I think the important message of this movie is that you can change the world ... even if you do it one person at a time.
