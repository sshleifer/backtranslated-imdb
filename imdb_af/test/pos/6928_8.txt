Initially, I thought this movie would irritate me. It was as if I had seen this movie somewhere before. The disillusioned hero, the father figure and the 9-year-old sister who is older and wiser than her years (see Gregory's girlfriend), but not for 15 minutes, has become a laughable, comical gem of a movie. Dylan Moran (which I thought was going to just bug me) was excellent. Like Mr. Gambon and the crazy Scottish Hitman. Lena Headey was very sexy. For half of the movie I try to remember where I saw her before. The Parole Officer. She had the most wonderful smile. But the real hero of this movie is clearly Mr. Caine. This guy has to do much more comedy. It stands alongside some of its best comedy roles (without a clue, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels). He is a pleasure to watch in all his scenes, but especially the end. <br /> <br /> Nobody can say f ** k like Michael can't. <br /> <br />
