The title comes from a change that makes an adolescent resident in a correctional facility on the front page of his schoolbook on the government, titled "The United States". he adds "of (his name)." <br /> <br /> Many characters in this movie work well - the screens between Leland (Ryan Gosling) and Becky (Jena Malone), Pearl (Don Cheadle) and dad Fitzgerald (Spacey) as well as with Leland, Becky and sister Julie (Michelle Williams), among many others. <br /> <br /> But the central thread of this movie - the script on which everything hangs - is the character and motives of Leland. He is a somewhat shy, passive, high school student who at least introduces himself to Becky who (we find) is going to an alternative school because of a history of drug problems. In Becky's family she has a sister, July, who just graduated from high school and prepares to go to college; Julie's boy, July's age (and whose parents recently died) also live with them. <br /> <br /> Leland lives with his mother; his father (Kevin Spacey) and mother have long been divorced and his father is a well-known novelist. Leland is very remarkable. The young boy in "The Sixth Sense" saw dead people; Leland sees teenage lovers and admits that years later they will divorce, that pain will follow many people's present experience of happiness. BUT, for reasons that are never made explicit, his prospective gift sometimes seems, for some people, some relationships, not others. ??? <br /> <br /> Parts of the movie feel a bit like a derivative quilt - borrowing from "American Beauty", "The Sixth Sense," "The Graduate," and possibly others I didn't do . It won't be bad if only Leland's character worked. <br /> <br /> I think Gosling did Leland very well, but the writing and the story imposed limitations. Would such a striking, meditative young man ever be murderous? Even for altruistic reasons? Nothing in the movie gives a reason for that. I am a retired therapist with lots of experience with families and teenagers. while many of the responses shown in the film work - this part definitely does not matter. <br /> <br /> And there is at least one other element that, in my experience, doesn't fit right. live, though not so critical. The reason for the differences between sisters, Becky and Julie, is never spelled, but it is good. Once two sibs begin to occupy different roles (one the good girl, the other one is upset), the roles themselves can manage to more extreme positions. For the upset, Becky, is that kind of, "what do I have to love here? Give me and become Julie?" And the pressure to live up to the All-Good, parents-pleasing child, is no less intense on July. So why would she break with her son's long-time friend and with whom her parents naturally approve? <br /> <br /> Don Cheadle was good as Leland's teacher; All the others were good in their parts. 98% of the screens were good. What was missing was that important step in understanding human nature. <br /> <br /> Good acting; defective story and psychology; worth seeing; not a total loss.
