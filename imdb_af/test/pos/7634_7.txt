Italian soft X Exorcist clone. <br /> <br /> Woman buys statue of crucified thief. The said thief comes to life and appears to be the devil with rape fantasies. <br /> <br /> Ivan Rassimov plays the devil brilliantly. Mostly because of his gift of evil looks. And because he was never more naked. Good on him. <br /> <br /> The lead actress has done a decent job. Her wide eyebrows and the fact that she looks very naked helped. <br /> <br /> This one has a similar plate element for most Italian horror movies. The girl's parents are filthy and dry. Look to get the details. <br /> <br /> Laura Gemser's husband, Gabriel Tinti, also appears as a random stud. His part is basically introduced, but like a cheap beer, it did the job. <br /> <br /> Wrong the director for his failures. It could have been a horror / sex classic.
