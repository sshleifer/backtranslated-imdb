In the last days of 1999, most people died in Taiwan. A strange plague ruined the island. Supposedly spread by cockroaches, the disease sends its victims into a psychosis where they act like the insects. Eventually they die. The Hole takes place in an invigorating apartment building (which has been created exceptionally well, kudos to the designer!). His two main players live right above and below each other. The woman is on the lower floor, and the pipes above her apartment leak loudly and threaten to destroy her food supply, to call her common sense. She called a plumber to go it out, and he accidentally hit a hole through the floor of the man's apartment. The two have never met, and they come in contact with the hole. <br /> <br /> The writing is quite brilliant. Few films are simultaneously this funny while staying completely human, deeply exploring the human condition, especially feelings of loneliness and despair. Tsai's direction is simply beautiful. Like many other Taiwanese directors, he uses very long tasks. But, unlike, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Tsai doesn't use them too much. In fact, I don't know if I've ever seen them better. They are always effective and never boring. <br /> <br /> It would be wrong to review this movie without mentioning the musical numbers. Yes, the hole is also a musical, and a great one. In the best scenes of the film - which says something, predominantly how well all the other scenes are - the man suggests the woman is a singer, almost a cabaret singer. These numbers are fully choreographed, often with back dancers and singers. In a stroke of genius, Tsai took these highly-produced numbers into the crumbling building, exposing the signs of apocalypse and decay. It offers both a sense of pathos and absurdity. <br /> <br /> The Hole is a movie that is planned to be seen. It should be a classic cult, if nothing else. Before I see it, I was told it was a decent movie, but probably Tsai Ming-liang's least good one. Well, if that's true, I just can't wait to see another one! 10/10.
