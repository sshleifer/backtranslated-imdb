I enjoyed the movie and the fact that it was quite high in handling a sophisticated material. I saw the movie in a preview show, and it wasn't spoiled by any silly video boxes that spoiled the end. The performances were pretty good, especially Andrew McCarthy in a more mature role. I also enjoyed the look of the movie that gave it a mysterious, passing air. I also enjoyed some of the "twists" in the plot and didn't want to give away too much if the video boxes from other countries didn't give it all away! The script was sometimes a bit on top, but I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers were not afraid to challenge the audiences with interesting and mysterious queries about the role of faith in our world. And, while some may find the end slightly open, I appreciate the fact that the movie refused to tie everything neatly with a bow. This is not how life works.
