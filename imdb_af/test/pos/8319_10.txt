This series when the Dinosaur lived 65 million years ago. The Dinosaur looks very real and is very realistic as they move. It is also very interesting how the climate changes. <br /> <br /> I'm very interested in how the dinosaurs lived and died. I'm also interesting in how the dinosaurs behaved. <br /> <br /> The color of the dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discover. They think what color they have. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing is why the dinosaurs died and what happened next. <br /> <br /> The BBC has made a brilliant series of how the dinosaurs lived and died!
