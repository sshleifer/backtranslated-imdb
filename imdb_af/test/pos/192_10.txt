Mikhail Kalatozov's The Cranes fly is an excellent movie. Winner of the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival, it has excellent cinematography and performance by Tatyana Samojlova, the only Russian actor who ever wins a Cannes award for a performance. She plays Veronika, a teenager who is in love with her boyfriend, happy and worried, with plans to marry. Her life will be upside down when World War II beats and her boyfriend volunteers to the army. The film shows the effect of war on a teenager love and on the people who stayed and saw their loved ones go and fight, waiting for a letter or other information. It is a portrayal of lost innocence. Samojlova does a beautiful job, and her character transformation will break your heart. The camera movement is fast with many close-ups, it's a dancing camera. The first scene in the stairs is fantastic, but it's not the only one, there is later a scene when Veronika attempts to commit suicide, and another, in my opinion, one of the most powerful scenes in film history, the bombing of Veronika's house as she walks the stairs in the middle of the fire, to completely destroy her apartment. Simply good! 10 out of 10.
