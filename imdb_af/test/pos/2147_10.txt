I saw the Heaven Gate at its opening week almost twenty years ago. Tickets were sold in advance, based on the great expectation that Cimino's long follow-up on his 1978 masterpiece "The Deerhunter." The reviews came in and critics sharply scrapped the film. An influential New York film critic has led the way and most critics follow suit, and the 3 hours. 40 min. film was drawn from distribution. United Artists has shortened Cimino's film for about an hour and it has been released many years later for equally horrific reviews and fraudulent cases. The movie cost about $ 40m (now considered a low budget) making it one of the most expensive in history and Cimino has the project of endless recycling despite being just his third movie, free on the project. "The Deerhunter" also suffered a negative setback based on a perceived political ideology that was not popular. I call this all a possible prejudice against Cimino. Then I thought the movie was very good and when I saw the shorter version it was still very good, just less. The film appeared again in a museum in the early 1990s. They had to show the long version, but couldn't find an existing print. Nevertheless, when I watched the film years later, I thought the Heaven Gate was a masterpiece. Eventually, the long version began to appear in a few select cities, I had to see it recently and it was worth the wait. Hemelspoort begins with the graduation ceremony at Harvard University. Two of the graduates are Kris Kristofferson and John Hurt and we are early on the shortcomings in their characters. In spite of the mandate, Joseph Cotton, in his speech to the graduate class, uses their education to relieve and improve their country. Many of the graduates behave as if they were part of an elite country club. The film flashes 20 years before Johnson County in Wyoming. A cattle company called "The Stockholders Association" hired poor people to shoot 125 poor immigrants, claiming to be animal love. Kristofferson's side with the immigrants while John Hurt is part of the Association. Although Hurt is totally against this insane action, he is too ineffective to do anything about it. A massacre takes place, but the immigrants do well to defend themselves. A US cavalry comes to the rescue of the Association allegedly arresting them after the most damage was done when forcing the massacre. Kristofferson also suffered a great personal loss and the film ended years later with him as part of the elite class of his Harvard days, married, bored, on a hunt, but dead on the inside. <br /> <br /> It's a very complex movie that is brilliant in every section, such as themes, structure, direction, cinematography, writing, music, editing, set designs and acting. Kristofferson, Walken, Hurt, Huppert, Dourif, Bridges, Waterston, and Cotton are all excellent who portray many complex characters. Some of the great complaints I have read about this movie are ugly to look at, incoherent, too long for the characters to make sense, and the words are often incomprehensible. In his defense, the Heavenly Gate did the appearance of photographs of that period, just as "McCabe & Mrs Miller" did. Some of the screens are smoky to represent the industrial revolution or sometimes horses, wagons, people passing by on all sides create a sense of reality. (The critic who calls it is one of the ugliest movies ever made to love using his thumbs a lot.) But in spite of everything, the composition of each frame and cinematography is impeccable. The movie makes a lot of sense when you watch it. Everything is not spelled out for the viewer, and one must pay close attention to the motivation of the characters or its themes. As far as length is concerned, it is a beautifully structured piece, sometimes moving, poetic, exciting or devastating with almost one big scene to another. Sometimes some of the words are incomprehensible, especially in some of the activity screens. But one can understand such a movie like that by using movie language, the look between characters or their actions. One day, this film has to be released in full length so people and critics can give it a second chance. Don't let Michael Cimino be another Orson Welles - under appreciated in his lifetime and not be able to make the big movies he is able to make.
