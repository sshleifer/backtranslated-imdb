I have mixed emotions about this movie, especially since it is comparable to its predecessor, <br /> <br /> "An American Werewolf in London." That movie had funny moments, it was even more horror story than anything else. This updated version, now introduced in Paris, has no edge at all and is simply not in the same class .... but it does have good things the first movie and overall it is still fun to look. <br /> <br /> So, aside "purebred purists", most of whom think this movie is pure rubbish compared to the London version, I'll still give it proper marks, since I don't care what others think no. I liked it, though I agree, "London" is better and I also prefer the version. <br /> <br /> The first 30-40 minutes of this movie are played strictly, including a hysterical scene with a "balloon" in a restaurant. It also sets the main female character, played by Julie Delpy. I don't see enough of this actress. She doesn't look like many movies, or the least I hear about in America. This French actress has a face that is classic beauty, so the film has points to have in it, and she looks good. <br /> <br /> When the abomination starts, it can be frightening and the special effects are good. I also had the lack of wickedness in this movie, unlike the first one: no f-words and no Lord's name in vain - amazing! <br /> <br /> However, there are many sexual remarks and there is one play with a man walking out of the bar tied to a cross that was blasphemous to me. The soundtrack is heavy metal that doesn't appeal to a middle-aged guy like me. This movie is much more aimed at 20-somethings, if it helps anyone. <br /> <br /> It's entertaining. Just don't expect it to lead to the first movie.
