I also found "Oppenheimer" to be a brilliant series and one of the best deals ever on American PBS. David Suchet was especially effective as Edward Teller, as I recall, and the overall concept was spectacular. The only reason the range does not rate a full 10/10 is in some areas for low-budget production values. Real content is absolutely top notch in my memory. <br /> <br /> The Oppenheimer miniseries will be released in the UK on July 31! It will be a Region 2 / PAL set, but it seems as if a Region 1 / NTSC set should be in view soon. <br /> <br /> If you are a universal player in the US, you can now get the range from Amazon UK. <br /> <br /> http://tinyurl.com/znyyq <br /> <br /> Huzzah !!
