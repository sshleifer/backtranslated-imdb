Soul's Midnight star Armande Assante (Simon) staring at The Mambo Kings and Elizabeth Bennett (Alicia Milford). Along with the sexy vampire vixen, Lucila Sola (Iris), Simon attracts pregnant Alicia and her husband Charles in the world of Soul's Midnight. Assante writes his fangs in writing by writers Brian and Jason Cleveland and you enjoy watching him and killing Iris. Alicia and Charles (Robert Floyd) are trying to stay alive, while Gore keeps your desire for blood change. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler Warning) In today's vast landscape, it is not surprising that a backward pastor is being bitten. . Set looks cool? much detail at the Borgo Hotel and the cool special effects at the end. I had a lot of fun watching this movie? It doesn't take too much and looks good.
