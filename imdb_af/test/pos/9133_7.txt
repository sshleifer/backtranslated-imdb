After I finally got caught up with this "masterpiece", it seems to me that it had to be terribly clever in the day. It's French, arty, underplayed to the point of anxiety, and finally slack. But considering the prospect of 37 years in the future, it's just a little empty, pretentious, and unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> Others summed up the story, but I don't think anyone has revealed the dramatic lack. At the heart of this movie: the main characters, Corey and Vogel, really don't deserve what they get. They play squarely within their code, harming no one who didn't ask for it, and showing great courage and initiative. In addition, Corey is particularly harassed by his former gangland friend, who stole his girlfriend, who repeatedly tried to kill him, apparently just because he (Corey) had spent a few thousand francs. It's guys who really have to pay a break! Instead, things go much worse for them than they really need, within the logic of the story. <br /> <br /> One can argue that this is the whole point: the real villains are never caught; that they, with the police, if necessary, sell out their friends and always come up. But it is not shown either. Corey's old gangster friend is not shown to police. He is also not proving his victory. In fact, after being kept several times when he was needed, he was nowhere to be seen, and he had a dramatic tension (his feud with Corey) completely unresolved! <br /> <br /> Yet I want to say this movie is worth seeing for its beautiful photography, its slow, deliberate pacing, its great deadly performances, its extensive hoist sequence and the encapsulation of the art film style of the late 1960s.
