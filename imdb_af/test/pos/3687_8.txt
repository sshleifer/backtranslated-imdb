Small Spoilers <br /> <br /> In Chicago, Grace Beasley (Kathy Bates) is a housewife who spent 25 years with lawyer Max Beasley (Dan Aykroyd) and a hysterical and psychotic dwarf daughter-in-law, Maudey (Meredith Eaton). Grace worships singer Victor Fox (Jonathan Price), who will host a TV show in Chicago and will be giving five places on the first row in a TV promotion. Kate calls the show and wins a ticket, when Max asks for the divorce at the same time, claiming their lives are too monotonous. Grace becomes depressed, and when she goes to the show, the audience is informed that a Chicago serial killer, who uses a crossbow, killed Victor Fox. With a broken heart, she decided to fly to England to Victor Fox's funeral. There she realized that he was gay, and became a friend of his former girlfriend Dirk Simpson (Rupert Everett). They fly back to Chicago and try to find the killer. This movie is a wonderful, original and strange dramatic comedy with bizarre characters. It has a great potential to be a cult film, with the incidents of Julie Andrews and Barry Manilow himself and joking with Nicolas Roeg's masterpiece "Do not Look Now" when Maudey shares a red raincoat in Chicago's underground carrying the city. . The start of the movie, with Jonathan Price singing 'Hitchcock Railway', is wonderful. I repeated it four times in a row. The film has a beautiful show, with the emphasis on Kathy Bates, Jonathan Price, Rupert Everett and the unknown Meredith Eaton. Indeed, this movie is an excellent entertainment. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): 'Cupid and Toda Try' ('Love to the Proof')
