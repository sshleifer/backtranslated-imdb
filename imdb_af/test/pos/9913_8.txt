Kirk and the crew visit a federation mining colony on a remote mineral resources-rich planet. The devil in the dark is the Horta, a very unusual silicon-based life-form that tunnel through solid rocks. The Horta killed miners and decided to be destroyed. But how? <br /> <br /> It is difficult to continue this review without writing a fairy tale. Instead, I focus only on the technical aspects of the episode and touch the themes. The special effects are OK, but many of the screens with the Horta look a little absurd. The acting is pretty average for TOS. Some of the miners are a little uncomfortable. Nimoy has the most difficult role of everyone in Devil in the Dark, and he pulls it off well. <br /> <br /> Why is it still a favorite of mine? <br /> <br /> Devil in the Dark is really an anthropological and ecological morality game disguised as an adventure. More than many episodes of this great TV series, it brings home the importance of maintaining an open mind and at least some empathy for others. Plus, it involves one of the most interesting, if not likely, plot twists in the original series. <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
