In the book of life, Martin Donovan plays Jesus, acting at the JFK Airport on December 31, to fight the new millennium by fighting with Thomas Jay Ryan (Satan) and deciding the fate of the world. There is also David Simonds (Kurt, the accountant of Amateur) as a compulsive gambler. <br /> <br /> As usual, Hartley creates a surrealistic world in which the beauty of the ordinary strangely and globally flows through artificially framed scenes and urban / industrial landscapes filled with brilliant light and shade. As usual, he publishes preliminary details early on, and later brings them into hilarious and unexpected contexts - the humor is simple but clumsy and incompatible. Hartley has a wonderful ability to build on small and ripe moments of simultaneous, everyday and outrageous. As usual, he creates a tone that is different and world-tired, but at the same time vulnerable, open and honest. He moves within minutes of uneasy humor to language that is metaphysical and poetic. The kind of writing is so dead and perfect that it is difficult to keep tears despite the lack of obvious emotion. Another wonderful and highly entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> The Book of Life is shot (a digital camera?) with a vague effect: a sense of heavenly hand-in-hand with impending punishment and a hyper-awareness of the present as fragile and short-lived in his last moments. All of Hartley's movies have a way to prioritize the gift, but this unique effect connects it as the images on the screen are in a way that gets started, but is becoming more and more beautiful when you think about it. The last shot is spectacular. All this may be precious, but the movie is a comedy and it makes fun of itself, as it makes fun of the concept of Armageddon, Judgment Day and "Urbanity." Although it is actually quite deep, moving, and life-satisfying, it is mostly light-hearted and playful. The play is flawless in terms of the kind of muted tone Hartley developed in his films (a tone some people don't get and it asks them to judge such a scene as the same - the same people who have a negative reaction to Peter Greenaway). As always, there are bound to be people who respond to this movie with cynicism and mockery - people who see through Hartley's abrupt shifts and what they see pretentious or mannerist techniques - but everyone who is a Hartley fan will love this movie . (if they get the chance to see it, it is). It's hard to tell how it will be on video.
