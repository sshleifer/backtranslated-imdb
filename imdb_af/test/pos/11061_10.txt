I only saw this movie when I was in high school, back in the 1960s. I was fascinated by the character Ingrid Bergman played and that was my introduction to the French Quarter of New Orleans. The first part of the movie is best if she comes back to revenge her father's wife and daughter (her mother was outraged). During this time she met the wonderful Clint Maroon, played by Gary Cooper. The chemistry between the two is wonderful. The second half of the movie takes place in Saratoga, NY (the Saratoga of the title) and I never enjoy it as much as the New Orleans area, but it's still very good. I give this movie a ten - partly out of nostalgia, but mostly because it's just a good movie and the characters, besides Bergman and Cooper, are just as wonderful. (Flora Robson comes near the scenes of Bergman steal). It is frequently shown on television, but it is rarely shown - it will be a good one for one of the classic movie stations to pick up and place in their programming cycles.
