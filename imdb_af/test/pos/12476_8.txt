Pretty good movie about a man and his wife caught in the murder and the police investigate the case. It starts wonderfully, but similarly, a wall strikes at some point. We are sure we know what has happened, then a small plot that looks like a red herring, is up and down again. Still, Clouzot's direction is great, and the acting is pretty good. Louis Jouvet, who also played in Marcel Carné's Drôle de Drame, gives the best performance as the smart detective. I wonder if the Coen brothers were influenced by this movie when they wrote Fargo. Much like the movie, the police officer didn't appear nearly halfway, and then he almost became the focus of the film. There is also a lot of droll about him (although his methods sometimes look fascist).
