My 5 year old daughter is very much into the Barbie series movies. I had mixed feelings about it and didn't want her to buy the whole Barbie doll picture and admit that the movies are a marketing effort to convince young girls to buy more dolls and make more money for Mattel. This morning she asked me to watch this movie with her and it was a lazy Saturday morning and with nothing else to do, I agreed. I don't know if the movies were made to market the dolls, who rather lose their appeal than I have heard or if the dolls are there to market the movies (or, probably, a little bit of both), but whatever All in all, I must admit - it was a bit surprising, it wasn't half bad. <br /> <br /> It's a fun and imaginative story full of magical places and people and memorable characters (both good and evil.) In essence, Annika ("played" by Barbie) has to find a way to " to build the evil game of Wenlock's wizard, including her sister in a flying horse and her parents in stone. The animation here was pretty good - not Disney caliber (if one thinks of Disney as the standard to pursue), but generally pretty good, and while the movie is apparently aimed at young girls rather than middle-aged men, I have still found enough twists and turns to make me wonder how it all went. It is true that there were some holes in the story, or at least some logical inconsistencies, but again one has to remember the target audience, which would not really think such things. It's a very good family movie. 10/07
