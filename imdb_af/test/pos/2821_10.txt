I shot this movie. I'm very proud of the movie. It was a good experience on the screen. Halfdan Hussey is an excellent collaborator who has had a vision and was able to capture the film exactly what we envisioned. The sets are wonderful and well made for every character. John York and his team build sets that not only fit the characters, they worked well to shoot the film, so we can move seamlessly through walls and from one set to another. Each character has a wonderful bow, which makes a wonderful story. I feel like all the actors did excellent performances. I disagree with some of the other comments that the acting was not good. See it and decide for yourself.
