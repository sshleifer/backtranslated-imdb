Charlie Chaplin's Little Tramp or Little Man character wins World War I, the Great War then, with one hand, even the Kaiser, who could not do all the Allied armed forces. It's bad, it seems to be a dream, a little cop and the worst part of this stunningly quiet short (almost a movie in 46 minutes). <br /> <br /> There are ingenious gags including Charlie who has to put a gas mask to eat Limburger cheese sent from home, then use the cheese as a weapon against the Germans; Charlie sleeps underwater in a flooded ditch next to a soldier. He continues to irritate; Charlie disguised himself as a tree - one of his best sketches ever - and Charlie pretended to hit his friend who became a POW and then beat him when the enemy was out of sight. <br /> <br /> One wonderful feature is how Charlie, when dressed in hostile lines, looks like a German, Hitler has risen ten years before Hitler and his Nazi thugs to get German politics. dominate. It is clear that Hitler depicted his appearance after Charlie's from this movie.
