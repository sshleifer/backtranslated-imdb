This movie is hilarious. The laugh never stops. Each scene is packed with a hilarious comedy. Chris Farley is a comic genius, and Spade plays his character to a tea. Farley was one of the best slap slips ever, and in this movie (as with all his movies) we see how much time and energy he devoted to portraying his character as he saw it well. "Tommy Boy" is an excellent example of a comedy, it always makes me laugh, no matter how many times I've seen it before.
