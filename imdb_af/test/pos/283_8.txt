In the '60s /' 70s, David Jason was known for his many supporting roles in television competitions such as "Do not Adjust Your Set!", "Hark At Barker" and the "Doctor" series. It was in 1974 that he wrote his first star in London Weekend Television's The Top Secret Life of Edgar Briggs, written by Richard Laing and Bernard McKenna. <br /> <br /> Edgar Briggs is a secret agent of the "SIS" (Secret Intelligence Service). He really tries his job well, but always seems to solve it. Surprisingly, however, he still succeeds in the bottom of the case, to the astonishment of his colleagues, 'Buxton' (Michael Stainton), 'Spencer' (Mark Eden) and 'Cathy' (the lovely Elisabeth Counsel). everyone who answers to "The Commander" (Noel Coleman). <br /> <br /> Briggs is married to 'Jennifer' (Barbara Angell), a woman who, like Michele Dotrice's' Betty ', from' Some Mother's Do 'Ave' Em! "Have the patience of a saint and stand by her hair trained (but meaningful) man, no matter what. <br /> <br /> Like some mothers '' Ave 'Em' and 'The Baldy Man', 'TTSLOEB' was totally beaten with slapstick. Every episode has seen Jason perform stunts as he falls from a tall window sill or falls from the top of a ladder while decorating his flat. Edgar Briggs was not a big hit, due to the poor scheduling of I.T.V. A shame because it was an entertaining and enjoyable performance, well served by his star and the fine support. The front man, however, did not enjoy the experience of the show. David Jason vetoed the show's performances because he felt his actions in it were not refined. Granted, David Jason, who played 'Del Boy', 'Inspector Frost' and 'Pop Larkin', is different from those played by Briggs, but his acting was not refined. Most actors would have changed Briggs into a ridiculous caricature, but Jason's performance made Briggs a credible, realistic figure. Maybe, but not unthinkable. <br /> <br /> Jason's next vehicle was 'Lucky Feller', in which he played mummy's boy 'Shorty Mempstead'. It also failed to make the ratings. His happy break came in the form of ATV's 'A Sharp Intake of Breath', in which he ran four series 'Peter Barnes' between 1977-1981. So, while it's not great, 'Briggs' is an easy and valuable watch. Nice 'James Bond' style theme song too!
