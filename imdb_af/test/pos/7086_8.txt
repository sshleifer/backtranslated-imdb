I don't cry easily about movies, but I have to admit, this one brought me to tears. Although I'm not a streak fan, her performance was excellent. Define the title in a sentence that is a mother's love. For the first hour I didn't like the characters, but it changed as the movie went on. The film also explained why certain marriages last, although there are obstacles. A must see movie.
