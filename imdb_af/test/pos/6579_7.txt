I just wanted to say that I love this movie a lot, but I also want to ask something. Does anyone know the artist / song of the song that the young boy (can't remember his name) plays on his CD player when his father and 2 men come and take the TV and the CD player ??? that song is so freaking cool, though i can't understand what they say ... feel free to email me the artist / song name at hpn_x@hotmail.com !! =) --------------------- repeat -------------------------- --- I just wanted to say that I love this movie a lot, but I also want to ask something.
