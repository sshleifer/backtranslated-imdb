It will be great if a discussion about this medium-length movie is started with a short story about the hypocrisy of Hollywood people. It was in 1988 that Chuck Norris saw this film at the Cannes International Film Festival. He made a stupid comment by saying that the senseless murder depicted in Decalogue 5 is far more effective than murders filmed with him as a powerful action star in his Hollywood films. He talked about an innocent taxi driver whose face in Kieslowski's movie was brutally affected by a reckless psychopath who hit him cruelly with a huge stone. There must be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified human society. This is why Chuck Norris's statement appears to be a cruel joke, which defends violent means in a society that remains troubled. An honest reviewer will not make a mistake if he / she declares that Kieslowski's film Decalog: Decalog, Piec (# 1.5) has universal connotations. This is because the events depicted in Decalogue 5 can happen in any part of the world. The best lesson Kielowski gives us relates to the levels of violence that are acceptable in a just society. This is why the brutal killing of an innocent driver is capable of causing a sense of dislike in us. We will not feel the same hatred for murder when it comes to movies featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Damme, as they are far too artificial. One can easily understand the special effects and modern studio techniques. can only charm toddlers, but does not make sense for serious movie enthusiasm. Kieslowski is also campaigning for helplessness to save fellow human beings from the heads of death and misery. This is especially interesting because it is proven time and again that strict laws and capital Penalties are unable to prevent homicide.
