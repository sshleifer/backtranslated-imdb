I was lucky to see it at the Tribeca Film Festival. I was amazed at how well made and how entertaining this wonderful little movie was. Director Griffin Dunne has done a great job collecting this movie that contains several characters and various story lines that blend smoothly and seamlessly. The main story involves the family and it is a very moving and entertaining story that the viewer has involved in every scene. The film as a whole has credibility and integrity, but still has the commercial edge - an "indie" movie for the masses if you want. The performances by the cast are all excellent, but it is Diane Lane who shines the brightest. Diane Lane is simply sensational in this wonderful movie and must be nominated Oscar. Early days I know, but Lane works her socks down here.
