I was recently fortunate to see the Kite Runner in a small theater surrounded by seasoned filmmakers who knew how to enjoy a masterpiece of such sophistication. With all the controversy surrounding this film's central scene these days, I expect a lot of rough and violent. But the way Mr. Forster handled the delicate subject, touched and really moved deeply. Although the film's credits indicated China as the main place for the shoot, I could have sworn that I saw Kabul throughout the scenes that were meant to be in Afghanistan. The acting, by both non-professional and professional actors, is excellent and the casting is great. So, this is a movie I will see again and again, because while it is undoubtedly sad in its subject, the masterful way it has created a whole new hope in the modern cinema.
