One of the better films to come out of the 1980s tells this well-founded movie the story of a disturbed high school student murdering his girlfriend, leaving her bare body on a river bank, and later boasting to his friends. What is just as bad is their inability to feel something about it. <br /> <br /> Disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic children who have no respect for their parents or any kind of authority, almost doomed to living lives of rebellion and recklessness. This drama hits hard and is impossible to forget. The young actors do a deserving job - even Keanu Reeves, in one of his earliest roles, is better than usual. Of course, there's no reason for the character of Layne (Crispin Glover) to be as frantic and out-of-the-wall as he is, but it's just Glover himself. Veteran Dennis Hopper has a particularly good role as a loner who, despite his own sordid past, is saddened by the attitude of this group of children. I would like to call the cold performance of Daniel Roebuck as the young murderer; he is an underestimate actor and besides Hopper he is probably the best performance in the film. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw River's Edge when it first started. cable TV channels; But I didn't catch it; I've seen it for the first time a number of years later, and now I've seen it again, because it's probably the end time. <br /> <br /> Some of the strongest moments include Madeleine's (Constance Forslund) crash where she knows, maybe she should leave her kids just as their worthless dad did. I also liked the screens where Matt (Reeves) departed with his disturbed younger brother (Joshua Miller) and when the teacher, Mr. Burkewaite (Jim Metzler), sorry that the girl is dead and that none of his students seem to care. <br /> <br /> I will never forget this movie, not as long as I live. It's too sad for that. <br /> <br /> 10/10
