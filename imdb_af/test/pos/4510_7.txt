Yesterday I decided to watch this movie on DVD. I found a good story of loyalty, cowardice, betrayal and redemption, with a brief insight into the recent history of Afghanistan, from a peaceful period in the 70s to the present days with the Taliban. The actors and actresses have good performances and give credibility to the realistic story. The dry places in China remember the images we see in television from Afghanistan. In the end I found the "The Kite Runner" a good movie. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Ca√ßador de Pipa" ("The Kite Chaser")
