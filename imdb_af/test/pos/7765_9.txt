This is my favorite movie depicting African Americans in various lights. because it is another side of African Americans showing that it is not shown in the movies. It's not the gang-breaking, urban ghetto setting or dealing with deep race issues. It emphasizes the whole essence of young and trying to be successful and having trouble letting go of waiting and letting someone into your life, and the whole Bohemian atmosphere gives the good touch that makes everything so good, it's a good script dialogue that captivates you and you only get involved in the character. perfect casting with lots of chemistry and very good acting and I haven't seen any other movie with black characters depicted in this format. The only one getting close is "Sprung", but as it is a comedy, it loses it very quickly. I give this movie 9 out of 10 and I wish they would continue to make movies with this kind of attitude towards African Americans
