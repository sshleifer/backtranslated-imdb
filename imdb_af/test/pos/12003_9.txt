Columbo is a guest lecturer for a criminology class. The students invite him for their after-class meeting. By exploring the nearby parking garage, they found their regular teacher, next to his car, dead of a gunshot wound. (No, Columbo was not after the man's work.) As a class project, Columbo involves the students in his job. <br /> <br /> Two students, provisionally identified by the viewer as culprits, were in the classroom for the whole class. In addition, surveillance room ties of the parking garage show that no one other than the professor entered or left after being last seen, unexpectedly leaving the lecture room. <br /> <br /> To return to the normal routine, Columbo is the one who has been harassed by the evil (?) duo, eager for progress reports and an ear for their theories. Forensic evidence is almost inconsistent. Solution to the case depends on some ultimate and interesting happiness. <br /> <br /> At first sight, Columbo seemed to have devoured the misdemeanor of the perpetrators; However, on repeated viewing, small details revealed that this was not the case at all. <br /> <br /> This reviewer has been touched by "Columbo Goes to College".
