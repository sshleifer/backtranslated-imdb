It's not "direct cinema", and it's actually the opposite. The second episode of the movie maker Gatlif's gypsy trilogy, this French work produced by Mich√®le Ray-Gavras, is a film masterpiece, not pure documentary, no fiction in any way. Instead, Gatlif chose different places from the route from India to Spain, where the Roman people have strong presence. With the help of art directors, he presented several musical numbers telling us how the cigars live, sing, dance, struggle and survive. The film may have strong opposition to those who question the hypothesis that the Rom tribe is of Indian origin, mostly challenged by those who see a direct link with the Hebrews (so, in a way, it does not come as a surprise that they too not persecuted by the Nazis.) But above any anthropological argument, it is a work of great beauty, strong colors and wonderful singing and dancing.
