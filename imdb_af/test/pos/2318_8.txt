I really enjoyed this movie. I probably watched it 2 or more and still enjoy it. As an old Navy, I'm still agitated by the exciting version of Anchors Away! I also love the "McHales Navy" pirate atmosphere. I could have done without the female dive officer, but I'm just old-fashioned, I think. She was still nice to look at, lol, espesially after the crew had finished her laundry. The cook, sonman and electrician made the movie. Loved the salt old engineer and his first class too. And Grammer actually did a very laudable job of being a misfit officer. I loved the "driving scene" while they were on the golf course to Port, lol. Pure Navy! And I swear I had an XO that was just like that little weasel. I'm so glad it's on DVD, about bloody time. : 0)
