It must be so hard to tell a story where there isn't much, but still keep the attention of the viewers. I think this short film achieves it with effortless quality. Rutger has a wonderful voice that is very soothing, wise and paternal (I'm not gay). This is reminiscent of the features Robert Redford has in narration. The end is very sad, but beautiful. One wonders how long Harry is, will he be alone and will he take his farewell? Also, Mr Hauer is annoyed because he is no longer involved in more work of this caliber. Let's hope he continues with good work in Holland and stays away from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Worth Watching
