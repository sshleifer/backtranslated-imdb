It's a great movie, full of interesting characters and situations. While not in the same class as some of the better-known movies of his time, it is still extremely awake and memorable. The scene where Zachary Scott, sitting on a bus, threw the plane pin of the lap of a jacket next to the seat next to him, is frightening. It defines its character beautifully - a man so low will give something of invaluable value to a war veteran, as a prop in his various charades. He lies easily as the situation asks and enthralls the women in the Fenchurch household with his irresistible charm and that killer smile. <br /> <br /> I couldn't help wondering if this movie was made to capitalize on the success of Mildred Pierce. Scott and Bruce Bennett are back together and Faye Emerson is similar to Joan Crawford, with her facial legs and big eyes. Also, the Mona Freeman character is no different from the angry Veda in Mildred Pierce. <br /> <br /> I agree with a previous remark that the end of the movie was beating, with the convenient tumble over a wreath for "Ronnie Mason", Zachary Scott's character. Also in one of the final scenes, we see Bratty Mona Freeman reunite with the boyfriend she had in common with the older, smoother Zachary Scott. I think the writer had called her to be tested for her behavior and for her cruelty to her sister, instead of treating it as just a typical adolescent episode. But these are minor mistakes in an otherwise pleasant and well-made film.
