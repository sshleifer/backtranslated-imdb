ManBearPig is a very funny episode of South Park. It spoils Al Gore and his speeches on global warming, which only replace global warming with ManBearPig (a fictional monster that has parts of a man, a bear and a pig). He tells the boys about it in a school meeting and Stan feels sorry for him. So he and the boys decided to hang out with him. Gore eventually gets them trapped in a rock screen where he believes manly is to be and they are stuck for days. Meanwhile, Cartman finds treasure, but wants to keep it all to himself. ManBearPig is a good spoof on global warming and overall a funny South Park episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
