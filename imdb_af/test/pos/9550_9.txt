When fellini 8 1/2 committed to film, many commented that it was the most personal vision to ever find his perfect expression. When Dante threw past the flames of his ominous passion, the honest brutality of his unanswered feelings for a younger woman was very upset. when we tumbled and a happy band of wicked talented and filmed filmmakers - from the filmmaking mecca - together during two cold weeks in December 2000, many commented that nothing more sophmoric was ever committed ... much less on film. <br /> <br /> Well, for the dodgers out there, look at this original piece and find out why the ID is a beautiful and powerful thing. And if it doesn't, roll over and rub one out ... it's probably the time you've done it. <br /> <br /> Kudos on a wonderful artwork
