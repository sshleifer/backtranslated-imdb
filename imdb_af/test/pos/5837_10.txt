Oz is without a doubt my favorite show of all time! the best word to describe it is "genius"! The writing, the acting, the story lines. Everything about this show is absolutely wonderful! <br /> <br /> I just discovered the show and I immediately got addicted and I was really surprised it didn't get the recognition it really deserves. It's violent, and most characters aren't meant to keep you from it, but the show is so brilliantly written that you can see the violence and the criminals and see them as real people. They are the lowest forms of scum, but it still finds a way to understand your many characters and even care for their stories. <br /> <br /> The violence in the show is needed to be. as realistic as possible, but the show is not about the violence that some people believe. It is truly a work of art and I am sure who ever gives it will be as much as I do.
