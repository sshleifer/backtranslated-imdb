This movie should be one of the funniest movies in history. His cousins ​​a mighty wind, spinal tap and wait for Guffman are in their own right, but Best in Show takes the cake. <br /> <br /> A movie about the peculiarities of dog owners showing their dogs competitively, these are the intricacies of the characters who make it so good. After watching the movie about 75 times, I came to the conclusion that there is no bad character or actor in this movie. There is very little interaction between any of the "groups" of characters, but it just seems to add to the beauty of the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie and not finding it so funny, if I bill it, watch it again. The first time I saw it, I thought it was useful, but not too hilarious. This is a movie that grows on you. Definitely a movie that you will quote yourself. <br /> <br /> Characters: Hamilton and Meg Swan: A + If you get the DVD, see how these characters were born "wonderfully", that these two could hit the head. And to find out that they really didn't go through a roadmap and made it like they did. <br /> <br /> Gerry and Cookie Guggleman: A cookie is especially funny and she does a fantastic job of selling the Cookie character. Gerry (Eugene Levy) delivers his standard star performance from the hilarious discombobulated type of weaker half. <br /> <br /> Stefan Vanderhoof and Scott Donalan- A + Find me a cleaner character than Scott Donalan, I DARE YOU! He will be like this character for me forever, because he was so natural and did not force at any time. Stefan (Micheal McKean) was also very good and they changed here (and a short appearance with the Gugglemans) show why he is always in these movies. A big actor with razor like white. <br /> <br /> Harlan Pepper-B +, I don't want him to be funny, he's sure he's the only Solo act, but he can't be as funny as the other . above here. He uses the dog more than others and has some other idiosyncrasies for him. <br /> <br /> The rest is also good, there is no bad character. See this movie at least twice. Buy it, you won't regret it.
