That's right. Ohwon (the painter and the main character) is an exceptional person. What strikes me the most is the message this movie can address to all of you. And the message is sad. It says it is very difficult to do anything that is wonderful or maybe even genius without obeying the governments, settlements and other VIPs of this world. And even if you try, you can't carry it. It's about the struggle of a single person with a system. With many systems. <br /> <br /> A great film by this wonderful Korean director. Please check if you have an opportunity.
