Jean Dujardin gets Connery's ways of adjusting the claws: adjusting the cuff links when they enter a club, as all the women strive, the nonchalant arrangement and smoothness of the tie, the swaying, sturdy passage. It's uncomfortable and you just realize how much Bond was in the sixties Connery's creation and not actually Ian Fleming's character. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is a wink for the early movies. The film comes from Russia with Love and Thunderball. The main joke is how chauvinist the hero is, not only in terms of sexism, but nationalism and colonialism, and how he faces nose when sent to Egypt. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect - about 20 minutes in it seems a one-joke movie and bits of it remind one of the day's spoofs, many of which were. Morcecambe and Wise's The Intelligence Men presumably followed men in FEZ behind their heroes, and it goes back a bit. Unlike Sellers' Clouseau or Baron Cohen's Borat, Dujardin doesn't give his character that layer of reality or real pathos - he's too busy perfecting his Connery ways. It doesn't do enough with the credits or a big song, and there's no funny or serious villain like Mike Myers' Dr Evil or Ricardo Montalban's Naked Gun nemesis. <br /> <br /> But the scene where OSS117 wakes up in Cairo one morning, I laughed aloud in the three-quarter empty theater, and the whole thing looks great, and you'll never get Operation See Kid Brother on the screen, and the women are scruffy, very hot. It's a Bond spoof without falling into the crazy scientific / Ken Adam sets or funny gadgets. Often recommended.
