I think Vanessa Marcil is the best actor in the movie. She makes Sam one of the best characters on the show. James Cann is also pretty good. I love it when he was worried about Delinda. One of my favorite scenes when Ed and Delinda hit the crap from an old one. It was funny. Nikki Cox is also good and she has good chemistry with Josh Duhamel. Lara Flynn Boyle was wonderful in her role. I wish they didn't kill her. The show has a good roll with no bad actors, it's not something you often see on TV. I still think Vanessa Marcil is the best. She had to have an Emmy in my opinion. It's a pity that the show was canceled
