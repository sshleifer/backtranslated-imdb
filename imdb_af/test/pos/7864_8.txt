The combination of the conventions of both Western and Gothic horror, and often aimed at being an art movie, is one of Siegel and Eastwood's best co-operation. <br /> <br /> Eastwood plays a Yankee soldier who, after being wounded during the Civil War, retreats in an isolated southern seminary seminar. The women pull up their romantic fantasies to the world, responding with male manipulation. But jealousy and resentment raise their heads, and he finds himself in a world of cruel revenge. And the boy's revenge is brutal. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot by Bruce Surtees, and carefully played, "The Beguiled" is a haunting, elegant work that is the turbulent sexuality of Eastwood's own "Play Misty" Me and "Tightrope". /> <br /> The film is a gripping portrayal of a fierce battle of the sexes and boasts a dream-like mix of horror and sexuality, all of which are ambiguous and display characteristics of both good and evil. to choose who we need to root. <br /> <br /> Don Siegel left quite a legacy of fine movies, all from "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" to "Dirty Harry." white pictures well obsolete, most of his color pictures look granular, dated and badly shot, his eager "realism" had to look fresh and kinetic 40 years ago, but if I look today, I just don't think they have the test of the time has passed. <br /> <br /> The buried is in another league, adult, ambiguous and sharp shot, d It is a pity that this is no longer widely known. While the developing technology and technique have obscured most of Siegel's tough, male action thrillers, "The Beguiled" is still used today because of its surrealistic atmosphere and unique subject. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10 - Better than the similar theme "Black Narcissus", I think Siegel's best movie. Part of horror, drama, sexual odyssey, "The Beguiled" is a surprisingly arty movie (especially if Siegel views his films as "senseless"). Much of the film's artworks are due to Clint Eastwood, who from now on will seek to select adult material.
