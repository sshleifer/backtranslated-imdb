I haven't seen it since 1998, and yet I have never been able to get it out of my mind, or I don't recommend people to find it so it shows how an impression made it. <br /> <br /> Just a wonderful story. </ br /> <br /> I just hope to see the stairs at least once personally ... <br /> <br /> I didn't know much about Mr. Petersen before this movie, because I have nothing not seen from his previous works, but his subtle acting in this has impressed me and I think his portrayal of Grissom on CSI shows just about the same. He knows enough to make the character shine instead of the actor shining, making him much better off an actor. <br /> <br /> I can't remember enough about the "poor accent" to comment, but I have to say I always enjoyed Barbara Hershey in all her roles and I thought she also has a phenomenal done work in this movie.
