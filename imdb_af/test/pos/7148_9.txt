It's a wonderful movie ... it's funny, dark, offensive, mind-boggling, innocent, and generally entertaining. I don't know I've seen before ... "The Rapture" or maybe one of Todd Solondz's black-and-night "comedies" or even the recent movie "Teeth" comes to mind ... but it's all bitter , nasty jewelry. "Franklins," in spite of the darkness around the sides, manage a thorough and pure heart. <br /> <br /> The story is similar to John Waters '"Low Down Dirty Shame", but only this movie differs in that it actually has a story and something to say, beyond Waters' youthful "sex is dirty (snicker, nudge) message. A conservative, oppressed family is undergoing a drastic change due to a car accident and is suddenly not as conservative. Actually, it's actually actually happy, probably the only people in their town (or perhaps the whole world) who is. To talk about why this is the case would be to spoil the movie; Simply put, everyone should see it, although of course only people who are already selling what the movie's excited, hopeful philosophy will ever do. <br /> <br /> The acting is great - just this realistic side to keep the proceedings too heavy. Teresa Willis gives a particularly memorable and brave performance as a ceaseless mother emerging like a butterfly when she is freed. Both she and Robertson Dean earn kudos for their indisputably sincere performances (not to mention regular and extensive nudity and sex scenes); they turn what could be a capricious joke that includes a "deviant sex practice" in a touchy, credible and engaging moment. Aviva as the daughter is an outcome and someone to watch, perfectly capturing the attitude, anxiety and speech patterns of a girl's age. Vince Pavia as the "homosexual" brother with a secret is beautiful and functional, although his storyline and how everyone reacts to it is more rewarding than his real acting. As the clashing friend of Franklin, Mari Blackwell is wonderfully cold, confused and even compassionate in a role that could be on top. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie looks fantastic, bright colors and wide-open locales ... it may seem like it's shot Hi-def ... if so, the line has become very thin, it looks a lot like movie. There is a lot of talk and much of it is philosophical, which becomes a bit preachy (moreso, I think of a viewer who disagrees with the film's politics), but this movie says a lot of things that need to be said. If only people will not be afraid to listen and think. The arguments that take place are clever and well thought out, first of all refusing to demonstrate the religious OR non-religious parties. <br /> <br /> The end is on the ambiguous side that I am a bit of a disappointment in some way ... I think it would have been better than the author (like Jay Floyd since his essay, written and directed) given a more workable denouement, a kind of solution, but then there probably isn't one when it comes to people sitting with different religions against each other. The same, it was a moving, memorable final image that made me choke - a success. Meanwhile, I am very glad Mr. Floyd made this movie and is looking forward to sharing it with as many people as possible. Look at that.
