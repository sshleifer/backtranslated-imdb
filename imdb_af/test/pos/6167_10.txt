If you want to see the true, dirty nature of Communism, look at the movie DARK BLUE WORLD. (Tvamomodr√Ω Svet) It tells how the brave Czech pilots who refused to surrender fled to England to join the Nazis. After the war, the Communists feared that they had picked up dangerous Western ideas about freedom. So, they threw these heroic Czech pilots into a nightmare prison, where some of the guards were the same Nazis, risking their lives to defeat. <br /> <br /> If Hollywood wants to understand why so many of their movies fall flat, they have to compare the character drama parts of Pearl Harbor with this movie. In Dark Blue World, you really connect with all the characters. In Pearl Harbor, everyone is like a nice cartoon version of a real person. <br /> <br /> There are countless instances of brilliant writing in this movie. A funny scene that keeps me in mind is when the character Karel Engels is taught by a fairly formal English woman. When he can't speak a word, he mocks the lesson. In typical Stoic English fashion, the teacher confronts calmly, but powerfully, Charles, and scans him in behavior. <br /> <br /> The airline series in this movie are great, and they help keep the movie alive. I read that it costs $ 11,000 per hour to rent the aircraft, but it was worth every penny. <br /> <br /> Ladies, you are expected to cry with sad movies, but guys .... beware! This movie will make General Patton weep. And if you're a dog lover, you'll use half a box of Kleenex. Don't say I didn't warn you.
