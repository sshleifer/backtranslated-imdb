Some martial arts purists think the comedy was the worst that could have happened to the old-school kung-fu movie; and it is true that the introduction of comedy in the genre indicated the end of the "chop-socky" period in Hong Kong film. But the fact is that you can learn a physical display of competence for so long, and then everyone gets bored of it. And that's really why the shit sock is dead and how the Hong Kong New Wave action film was born: the producers, the actors, the directors all just got bored to hit people straight for ninety minutes. <br /> <br /> Given that, and since Liu Chia Liang is a professional director with a substantial list of films in his resume, this film should be seen as something else than just a kung-fu comedy. It is rather a comic book within the martial arts genre, and actually one of the best ever made. <br /> <br /> What Liu did with this movie is really a pleasant surprise: he has a martial arts plot and once again built it into the lines of a Hollywood-style musical! Complete with episodes of singing and dancing! It was at the time of making this film that some filmmakers and film lovers began to admit that filmmaking (really derived from the acrobatics of the Chinese opera) has more in common with dancing than fighting. (I will continue to point out this relationship until most Americans realize what they are supposed to see when they watch a martial arts movie - good-choreographic body movements, plotting an action film as an excuse for In any case, Liu Chia Liang made it clear and decided he would explore it near his borders. <br /> <br /> The result is an unbelievable charm, filled with amazing human characters who try amazing kung-fu (and their own shoelaces, as often as they don't). And the film set at the beginning of the 19th and 20th centuries gives Liu the opportunity to explore the nature of Western and modernization of China, which has contributed so much to making the China we know today. So the movie also has a significant historical input. <br /> <br /> Also, fans of Stephen Chow's recent Kung Fu Hustle have to watch this movie carefully, as Chow has clearly learned before making his own movie. br /> <br /> A very amusing, well-made movie. Oh, and that kung fu is really good. <br /> <br /> Purists won't admit it, but it's probably Liu's best movie.
