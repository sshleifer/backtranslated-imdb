Amazing, amazing, amazing. What more can be said? Jacobi is the best Hamlet ever to grab the scene and capture every inch of the character. Each nuance and element of Hamlet is well portrayed and portrayed. Some people have complained about his age, but you can't honestly say when watching the movie. As something, he looks drastically younger than 40. I just wish a more worthy Ophelia could be found. Her acting is acceptable, but she just doesn't look at the part. The only true exceptional performances come from Jacobi and Stewart, who are a good Claudius. The rest of the cast is good, but Jacobi is really raising this teleplay.
