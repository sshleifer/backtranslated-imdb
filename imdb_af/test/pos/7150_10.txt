I was surprised that "Forgive the Franklins" was no longer excited at this year's Sundance Film Festival. There were times when the laugh on the screen I saw was so hard you could hardly hear the movie. The movie has some excellent plays and a story that really makes one look at bigger issues. You know little problems like religion, sex and truth. Many comedies seem to rely on the same old, crown-faced situations. Many let you think, "I know they got rid of some sitcom." This film starts in its own unique direction. I really think Jay Floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this movie.
