"Uzumaki" takes place in a small Japanese rural town where people get angry. They go down on vortexes and spirals. The crisis is getting worse because people appear in snails and vortexes everywhere. "Uzumaki" should be one of the most bizarre and original horror movies I've seen. The plot is very clever and the gore screens are really funny, as the film doesn't take up too much. "Uzumaki" is wonderfully photographed and the use of colors is moreover. The characters are alluring and there are plenty of shocking surprises to satisfy Japanese horror fans. Despite some hilarious scenes, the overall tone of this movie is pretty dark. "Uzumaki" is not as good as "Ringu", "Ju-on" or "Audition", but if you like Japanese horror movies, you won't be disappointed.7 out of 10.
