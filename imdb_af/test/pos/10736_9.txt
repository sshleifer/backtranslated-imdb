I do not think so! I mean yes if you compare this movie to The Godfather, or maybe a little older movie like Casablanca, or maybe even a little newer movie like The English Patient. It doesn't have the camera or cinematography like these other movies, but doesn't it mean it's a bad movie or not? I think the reason why this movie is underestimated is because many people always compare it to other great Oscar-winning films (you should never do it) which makes it difficult to understand the beauty and realism of this movie. In the categories Best Picture, Best Actor in a Major Role and Best Actress in a Supporting Role, this movie really earned everyone. The beautiful Dustin Hoffman gives us one of his best performances. A few times in this movie I forgot that it wasn't his son, because it was just as real! I have never seen a film about relationships in different families where it was so easy for the actors to play that particular role, but still so beautiful. So Dustin Hoffman believes the test with flying colors in my opinion. There are a few actresses in the world who deserve the best mentioned: Katherine Hepburn, Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda and Ingrid Bergman (I can't help, I think she's wonderful). Meryl Streep, even though she is in a supportive role, is wonderful and real, and you just can't help but is recorded on her talent and the way she does it. Wow, that's all I can say. Justin Henry was wonderful about his age, his tears and his relationship with his mother and father were beautiful, so I'm saying good work to cute little Justin Henry. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie for the third time, alone, I couldn't stop crying. I tried, but I couldn't. Thanks, I was alone! It's probably the purest movie I've ever seen. Other films nominated for Best Picture were Apocalypse Now, Norma Rae, Breaking Away and All That Jazz. I am ashamed for not seeing either of them, but from what I heard, Apocalypse Now is great, but when I heard about Norma Rae, I just thought of Sally Field. I think that considering the other nominees, this movie has earned five Oscars, and that it will continue to touch and let other people cry for a long time in the future, just as it has been for the past 28 years. Good work, all the actors and actresses in this movie to give us good performances and memories to see this movie we will never forget. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time.
