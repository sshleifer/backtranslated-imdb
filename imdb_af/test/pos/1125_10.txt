I'm so excited that the Greek is back! This season really looks conscious. I'm glad Casey is trying to get serious about the school, but is still involved with the girls. It's really funny that she wants to go into politics and emphasize her 'twilight talent'. "I loved Calvin's new haircut! It makes him look more mature. They also have to shave Cappy's head. All the guys are hot, but Calvin is definitely the hottest! I can't wait to see more of him! I'm especially interested in what happens between Calvin, Adam, and Rusty! I also love Rebecca. She's really beautiful. Actually, I think Rebekah and Calvin should join. Go for it, Calvin! Join my team!
