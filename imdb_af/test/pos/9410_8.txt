Having seen it without knowing all the hoopla around the main character, without knowing that it was based on real events, I have to say I'm impressed. "Greenwich murder" is an above-average production for a TV movie - the play is equally great, especially Christopher Meloni, who offers a striking show and teenage actors excel in difficult roles. The idea of ​​the dead girl playing the movie is a brilliant stroke that elevates the film from just fine to excellent. The writing is exemplary for what is essentially movie-of-the-week feeds and cinematography is beautiful.
