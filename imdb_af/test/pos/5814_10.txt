I would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of late John Cassavetes. And for those who have never known Cassavetes. It's an excellent movie. I really don't have the time to go into the details of why it's my opinion, but if you're looking for something good, with lots of scenes to go over, then this one is for you. The cinematography may be one of the most interesting aspects of the film as well as the story itself. This review does not do the film justice. It is an experience that one must consider for themselves. Many characters. VERY BIG.
