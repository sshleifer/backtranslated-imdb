I was blown away when I saw "the best years of our lives". The play, script and master William Wyler's direction (winner of best director in 1946) is brilliant. <br /> <br /> The movie is about three World War II veterans coming home together on a plane and all happening to live in the same town. The first man, Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar winner role), has to adapt to his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and Children Peggy and Rob. (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall) is different from before. <br /> <br /> The second man, Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews in an excellent role) has to find a good job and adapt. . He began to find out that she was not the same. <br /> <br /> The third man has a much harder adjustment to make. Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his outstanding Oscar role) He lost his hands in the war and must react with his family and fiance Wilma's (played by Cathy O'Donnell) on the hooks he has in place of his hands . All these men and their families are reunited in different sketches. The stories of these men are all closely interwoven. <br /> <br /> This movie really defines the meaning of a "Classic". This memorable drama (winner of best picture in 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I was asked to choose a favorite movie, I would choose this one. <br /> <br /> Out of 10, I'll give you the best years of our lives. <br /> <br /> So next time you rent a movie this one rental, you won't regret it.
