If I only saw the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn't have touched it with a ten-footer. But after hearing some positive buzz, and I knew it made a noise in Cannes, I decided to try it. What I got was an enjoyable movie based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as a nurse "Betty, a woman who is sent to an offensive psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by the filthy comedian Chris Rock. <br /> <br /> The film constantly pushes between comedy, drama, romance and thriller. Yet, despite this apparent identity crisis, it is very good. I got my eyes from start to finish and always waiting for the next turn in the story. The whole cast is strong, if not spectacular. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who made a very impressive and dark spot in the Company of Men a few years ago) was far too much at many split Hollywood conventions relied on. The moody musical effects he put into our throat during every sentimental scene was unbearable! And he did the standard guy. "Let's take some of the minor characters and end them in an illogical and unnecessary romance", just to make sure everyone goes home with a smile on their face. Why should directors and writers handle their audiences like idiots? <br /> <br /> But the movie is still very enjoyable to pull away from these annoying irritations. In a very subtle year for movies, 'Nurse Betty' is one of the pleasant surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10.
