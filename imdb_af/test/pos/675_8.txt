Beware, My Love originated from a drama written by Mel Dinelli. He apparently liked to write about scared women. His first and best effort was the script for The Spiral Staircase. He also caused a Loretta Young thriller a few years earlier. The play that Dinelli wrote was originally called The Man and ran for 92 appearances on Broadway during the 1950s. It was Dinelli's only attempt at Broadway and it was Dorothy Gish and Richard Boone. <br /> <br /> The roles played by Gish and Boone are taken by Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan. For some reason RKO thought to eliminate the age difference. Dinelli himself rewrote his play for the screen, so I wonder what he thought of it. Certainly, the vulnerability issue has been completely eliminated from the story. <br /> <br /> It wasn't the only thing that was eliminated. The people all wear clothes from World War I, but there is no reference at all to the time this story takes place. I thought it was strange and later when the telephone company arrived at Ida Lupino's house, I noticed his truck was a vintage of the same era. <br /> <br /> The movie is almost entirely in Ida Lupino's home where she hired a travel companion in Robert Ryan. The movie is a great object lesson to not rent aliens without reference. It seems that Ryan is a schizophrenia that invades Lupino for about a day in her home. <br /> <br /> Both leaders do good work, even with the changes being made. Movies like Beware My Lovely are the things that a small studio like RKO did best. If it was done at MGM or Paramount, the slips would have overpowered a solid story.
