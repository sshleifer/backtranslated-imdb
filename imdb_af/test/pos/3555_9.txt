After checking 3 of the 4 Perry and Croft sitcoms, I thought I'd get them all now. Daddy Army, is my favorite sitcom all the time, it's not half warm. Mommy is also a classic as you rank M'Lord. I don't regard Hi De Hi as a classic, but it's still funny. <br /> <br /> It's about a holiday camp, similar to Butlins, but instead of red coats, it's yellow coats. It is run by Jeffery Fairbrother, a good sense man, but has the personality of a sock. The staff includes fun entertainment manager Ted, his sidekick Spike (he threw almost every episode into the pool), yellow jacket Gladys, carefree girl Peggy who wanted to be a yellow dress and the Punch and Judy man, Partridge, who hates children. Situations usually took place around the pool, where someone would be thrown into each episode (of course, clothes). <br /> <br /> Not a classic but still funny. Jeffery Fairbrother walked halfway through, so it, like a fool and horse, expressed his welcome. Jimmy Perry was actually a red dress at Butlins. <br /> <br /> Best episode: Peggy's Big Chance, Series 2, Episode 2.
