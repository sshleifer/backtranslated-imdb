Yes. Watch this movie if you like brave movies. This is perhaps the best Mexican picture since Midaq Alley, just because of the excellent role-playing, the outrageous direction and the sublime soundtrack. Many people do not have 'Cronica ?? Not that they are very aggressive, but they did not understand that it was merely a representation of hyper-realism of Mexican society, but similar to all the third world families. I hope Benjamin Cann and Bruno Bichir (who in this movie still give an example of his greatness as an actor) will soon come together with a new film. Just remember how Los Olvidados (Luis Bu√±uel) was misunderstood when he was released, but now we consider one of the best movies of all time. Prepare yourself and watch this movie.
