I loved this movie! Yes, it's pretty cheap and I'm sure many reviews will be on it. But my good, how much do they pack for the cash in question. I am reminded of the early work of Sam Raimi. Yes, it's rough, but has good energy and fun. The actor ranges from the very good in Scott Ironside and Shawn Paul Hasser, to the not so good in some of the smaller parts. Is this a cult movie? Well, it has grown on me. The first time I liked it, but at the 3rd show I loved it. The movie is probably a 7 out of 10, but I give it 8 for pure cheek. Anyone who can pull it for 8 Grand is worth watching. Almost I want to visit Scotland!
