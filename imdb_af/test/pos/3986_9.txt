It's a brilliant movie. The story begins in Romania, where Billy Crystal stars as an agent anyone can talk to do anything. There is a very funny scene here, where Crystal is a kid, and speaks to his father, who is a rabbi to eat pork (your filmphiles may know that it is a parody of Crystal's religion). He is mainly a talent scout, and he tries to find a suitable villain for his latest movie. After finding out that the whole movie has a terrible crew, he accidentally falls into a small river. To believe he was dead, some big hands came out to reach him. He later thinks he's in heaven. He finds out that he is not, but that he is in a monastery. To believe God saved him, he became a monk, seeking who saved him. He later found a 7 ft 7 in the man, who he threw as the perfect villain (he also calls Shakespeare!). See the movie and find the rest!
