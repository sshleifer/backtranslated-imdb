I grew up in Baltimore, so I was exposed to the movies of John Waters because I was too young to see it. And if you know John Waters is limited to Hairspray or Cry-Baby, or other family-friendly movies, then prepare yourself for Pink Flamingos. <br /> <br /> Clear sex acts, incest, an old lady who eats nothing but eggs, and immoral acts with chickens are just a part of some of the depravity in this movie. The film ends with Divine, Waters' 300 pounds. cross-decorating star eating dog excretion. <br /> <br /> The premise is about two families: one some innate trailer waste, which includes Divine and Edith Massey as the egg lady; and the other is a rich, swaying couple. Both families compete for the title of "Dirty person alive." Enjoy the best movie of John Waters, but just watch it if you are an outspoken person with a strong stomach, because some scenes in this movie will cut you off.
