James Stewart plays Dr Ben McKenna, who is with his wife and son tourists in an Arab city. They are caught in the middle of a murder scene. The victim whispers something in dr. McKenna's ear, and he is told to do something. <br /> <br /> Later his son is kidnapped. The kidnappers seem to be a man and woman he knew, but the woman is a bit softer than the man. <br /> <br /> The song, "Que, Sera, Sera" (Whatever we will be, we'll be, "is one of the best songs ever sung in a movie. <br /> <br /> Doris Day plays Stewart's wife, and she sings the song mentioned above, her performance is worthy of Oscar, not even nominated. <br /> <br /> My Score: 8/10.
