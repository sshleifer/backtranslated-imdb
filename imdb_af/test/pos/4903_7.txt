Although a "woman's story", I still found it quite interesting. It is unusual that there are three real sisters playing sisters in the movie! I refer to Priscilla, Rosemary and Lola Lane. <br /> <br /> Why national critics loved this movie was the presence of bad-boy rebel John Garfield. In their twisted Liberal-dominated minds, All-American characters are sick, but acid-on-life, poor-posture types like Garfield played here are people they can identify with. Despite this, this movie still has an overall sense of goodness, and therefore I liked it. Some characters may have done stupid things, but they have good hearts. Whose heart was bigger than "Ann's" (Priscilla Lane)? I agree with the IMDb user critic who says it is Priscilla's movie as much as the beloved (not by me) Garfield's. <br /> <br /> Directing the caliber of Michael Curtiz, the movie is better than it has been to anyone else. Curtiz made sure that no scene, soap or otherwise went too long. <br /> <br /> In addition to the Lane sisters and Garfield, we have Claude Rains (who adds the humor to the story), Jeffrey Lynn (the girls' main love interest), Gale Page, Dick Foran, Frank McHugh and Mae Robson. <br /> <br /> Apparently, this movie had to be a hit because there were several spin-offs from it, and neither of them approached this in content and skillful success.
