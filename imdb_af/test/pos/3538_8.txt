I saw MESSIAH 2 a few months ago and didn't see the original disappointment a few times ago and it's much better than the successor. Well, it's not a million miles away from SEWE's plot, but it's still compelling. Much of my praise relates to Ken Stott's performance as DCI Red Metcalfe, a policeman who led a very unfortunate life and someone who has a terrible secret. It will be easy for Stott to go over the top, but he plays the role in a rather subtle way. Similarly, the murders are very shocking, but unlike the sequel where the murders are carried out in a rather OTT way, there is really little violence. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that the red herring, of course, is a red herring which means I'm not overtaken by the shock twist. ) and that when the true killer was revealed, they both went a little far and caused some plot holes to appear in the story. If I remember correctly, the successor had similar problems after the killer was revealed. Maybe it's a good idea not to make MESSIAS 3.
