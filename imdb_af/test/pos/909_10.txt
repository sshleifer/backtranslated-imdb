Transcendental, sophisticated, insightful, emotional, powerful ... I could think of hundreds of adjectives to describe this fantastic artwork and intelligence, and I would still feel they were insufficient. All I can really say is that I ended up with this movie. Applause for Krzysztof Kieslowski, Zbigniew Preisner, Ir√®ne Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. May "Rouge" live forever.
