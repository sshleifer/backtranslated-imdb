I loved the movie "Eddie Monroe". The movie has all the components that interest me while watching it. I especially liked the plots along the way and the surprising end. Craig Morris has Brad Pitt's potential in both looks and talent. His blue eyes reminded me of Paul Newman. Fred Carpenter took this film to a new level. I loved the movie. The music score, cinematography, talent, places and script were wonderful. I loved seeing some of my favorite actors in Eddie Monroe. Fred Carpenter is an incredibly talented and talented director. He gives his work 200%. The film has good texture. I hope there will be an Eddie Monroe 2. I would love to see Nicolette appear to be after her windfall money. Fred Carpenter's Eddie Monroe is Hollywood level.
