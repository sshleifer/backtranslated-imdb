I always loved Sean Connery, but as James Bond I always favored Roger Moore. Yet it was Connery who had set the Bond standard and while establishing himself as something other than James Bond in 1983, the money had to be irresistible to him to make even more appearance and save the world from the evil designs of Specter. <br /> <br /> And what designs are they in Never Never Say Never Again. SPECTER, using a stupid young air force officer who appears to be Kim Bassinger's brother, stole two nuclear missiles during a war practice and now SPERTER led by Blofeld, played here by Max Von Sydow, is a threat to the blackmail of the world. <Br /> <br /> Von Sydow's business man is Klaus Maria Brandauer, who also goes to Bassinger's court and is a bit crazy. And he has a female killer working for him in Barbara Carrera, who makes Angelina Jolie as Nora Croft looks like Mrs. Butterworth. <br /> <br /> But before Sean Connery can even start, he needs a new 'M' to manage things at British Intelligence. Edward Fox thinks Connery is old in his methods and costs British taxpayers too much money with his violent ways. I really enjoyed Fox's performance, he is like Colonel Blimp's great grandson. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed Carrera, she is something to look at and very resourceful in her methods. When she dives with Connery in the Bahamas, watch her Shark in the case of 007 instead. <br /> <br /> Will Connery James Bond again? He was widely quoted as saying who would they throw him at the moment, Roger Moore's father? But I think Connery would still be formidable in a wheelchair.
