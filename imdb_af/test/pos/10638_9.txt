If you think the piano teacher Erika Kohut (Isabelle Huppert) in Michael Haneke's film "LA PIANISTE" is the final grade in the embodiment of extinction, perversion and darkness, I have news for you: the piano teacher in Elfriede Jellinek's novel "LA PIANTS "(on which the film is based) are twice as" repulsive "," disgusting "," confused "and even more engaging - although there are not enough words to translate the level of artistic skill achieved by Isabelle Huppert here , above all other mortal actresses today. And who else would have played this character with such emotional power, complete with the best piano playing / doubling that an actor can deliver? <br /> <br /> In the novel, as in the movie, there are two major antagonists of the "heroine" Kohut: her own mother (wonderful, wreck-spoken Annie Girardot, in a part originally intended for Jeanne Moreau ) and Austria itself. The mother embodies Jellinek's perception of her native Austria as a country that encourages racist / fascist (or at least authoritarian) behavior, sexual and emotional oppression, and misleading and perverse, and tells us: Ã¼bermensch ideals that are impossible to keep today without the danger of a mental collapse. <br /> <br /> "La Pianiste" also deals with a very powerful and delicate issue: how dangerous it is to reveal your inner fantasies to the one you think. We tend to think our own sexual fantasies should be so exciting to others as it is to ourselves, which can be a big, embarrassing and sometimes tragic mistake. Here Kohut teaches the lesson in the most painful and humiliating ways. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that Elfriede Jellinek is one of the best-known and most prestigious writers in Austria and Europe (well, now she has a Nobel Prize!) and those autobiographical passages can be derived from her novel, since she was a pianist herself and had a reporting relationship with her mother. The novel also contains long sections on Kohut's childhood and adolescence so you understand how she has changed in who she is now. Haneke chose to hide this information in the movie, and forced us to wonder how she was like that (don't we all know an Erika Kohut out there?). But he keeps the book's material in his film very good: unbearable honesty to the point where most mysterious, "terrible" feelings occur painfully - envy, cruelty, violence, jealousy, hatred, misery, sadism, masochism, selfishness, perversion, etc. . All of them undeniably human. <br /> <br /> I thought "La Pianiste" was a deep moving movie, very disturbing and thoughtful, with a handful of memorable scenes. And that's all I ask for movies. It also made me buy and excited about the book, discovered a fantastic writer I didn't read before, and listen again and again to Schubert - so thanks to Haneke, Jellinek and Isabelle !!! On the other hand, if you are looking for light entertainment, please stay away. My voice: 9 out of 10
