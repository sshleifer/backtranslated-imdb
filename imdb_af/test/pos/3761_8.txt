"Pearl Harbor, friend." This movie is brilliant! Certainly it doesn't flow exactly like a multi-million dollar comedy, but the jokes that are constantly thrown in are incredible. I'm one who goes psychologically, like Dumb and Dumber, Airplane and Wet Hot American Summer. I have to stand it very easily here. Movies are no longer written with this kind of sporadic comedy. Too many jokes in this is such a surprise to the viewer that it is frankly amazing that more do not know and praise this slapstick masterpiece! If you see it, you will easily get more than 20 quotes from it that you will see later ... and after you look at it again, you'll find even more!
