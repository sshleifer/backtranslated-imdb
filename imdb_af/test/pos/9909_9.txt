I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. For one, it didn't have the stingy special effects that the big budget movies have. The play was decent in this one, only you can say straight from the bat that it is called, but once you get it over the fact and you can't switch the language on the DVD version, it's cool. The plot line was very unique. You take a situation like a heat wave that is very common around the world, especially in Frankfurt, which I have done many times, and you make a garbage strike that often happens in this country and you have a recipe for the disaster. I loved how the rat hordes just went everywhere and how the idea that if you pick up the garbage is the last thing you want to do, you pick it up, the rats don't get what they want, they're in Essentially picking up the garbage, so you ask good or rubbish to stop men, picking up the garbage, private contractors, anyway military wants the city quarantine oops, the wrong thing to do, then you would take over all the rats the city, then throw a mayor who wants to keep a lid on the budget and holds her bags, you have a realistic movie and the female head is also a pleasure to watch, a very decent movie I thought , wish more Such a small thing is the presentation of Frankfurt, could have been a little better, but for the average viewer who had never been to Frankfurt ... I was born in Germany and was often in Frankfurt. It has, "It doesn't matter, but everything is a big big thumb.
