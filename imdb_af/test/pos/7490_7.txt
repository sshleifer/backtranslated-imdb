It looks a lot like movies like PULP FICTION or RESERVOIR DOG, which is impossible to imagine that Tarantino's films were not a source of inspiration until this THURSDAY. However, for a low cost B series movie it is not bad. The plot about the gangsters is fascinating and funny and it also has a bit of dark humor and sarcasm that we can find in PULP FICTION. The resources were not very sure, but the film was well produced. The acting is also good. I enjoyed the scene when the girl sat on the couch and teased the doctor. It was hot and funny at the same time! The soundtrack is also nice. I didn't hear too many songs, but I liked the one I heard. I estimate it 7/10.
