'Apocalypse Now Redux', Francis Ford Coppola's war scoop is probably the most beautiful war movie I've ever seen. Capt. Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) is a Vietnamese soldier who has tackled a very dangerous and highly classified mission to Cambodia for the position of Kol. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) to terminate, a highly ranked and highly valued army man who apparently became completely insane and disappeared from the army, established his own small society and helped by a cultured soldier. Accompanying Cambodia to the river is a handful of seaplanes, and on the way they meet several interesting people (especially Robert Duvall's Kilgore, a badass lieutenant colonel with some screws loose) and some terrible situations. <br /> <br /> 'Apocalypse' is less historical war film as a philosophical and psychological study. It's more 'Full Metal Jacket' than 'Platoon'. The rally of "Apocalypse" is more than three hours, but the film is so wonderful and compelling that when the end of the film arrived, I was actually surprised at the amount of time that passed. The beautiful cinematography is surely what most stands out for me. After watching this movie, I am convinced that Coppola is one of the masters of light and photography in film history. The Godfather movies were all with a nearly sepia tone, and shadows created the feel of a Baroque composition. With 'Apocalypse' there is an incredible use of natural light, and the shadows, especially in the scenes in which Brando and Sheen are involved, become almost a living character, they are so pervasive and effective. Another beautiful scene was then Cpt. Willard and Jay Hicks (Frederic Forrest) were in the jungle looking for mangoes and came in a tiger. The sheer magnitude of the surrounding leaves (let as big as a house) made the characters almost Lilliputian, but the color of the scene was incredible. While everything was almost subdued gray, the leaves were an incredibly lively green, an especially noticeable effect. Another very small positive moment in the film was the wonderful scene when the helicopters carrying Duvall and the company attack the small town while they play Wagner. It could only have been an ultra-dramatic underlying soundtrack on the scene, but Coppola turned the song into a real part of the scene. Duvall mentions that he likes to play it as they approach to scare hell. . <br /> <br /> The performances in 'Apocalypse' are first class. Much has been made of the amount of money Brando earned for the film, and the amount of trouble he caused. Regardless of this, he has shown a powerful performance for a relatively short amount of screen time. Sheen is totally outstanding - this is the first time I've ever seen him in a movie? and Duvall is very fun to watch as the wage Kilgore. 'Apocalypse Now' is a film that has been so pervasive in pop culture (most of them know several menus from the movie, 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning' et al), but I didn't know much about that There are many surprises to experience. I didn't see the original track of 'Apocalypse Now', so I can't compare it to this newer cut, but it's a movie that must surely be experienced. 8/10 <br /> - Clear
