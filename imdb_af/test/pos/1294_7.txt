A beautiful story about two evacues, has turned into a nice little movie, by the BBC. Most kids who love a good story will enjoy it. The characters are really well played by a very good role. Not sure if our American friends will appreciate it, but they get a mention, as Aunty Lou runs off with a beautiful American soldier.
