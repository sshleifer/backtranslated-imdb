The film is about Paul (Paul), a young man who sinks into the harsh world of madness and his stay at the spiritual hospital Kleppur and his friends. Victor (Viktor) who began to think in England during his training he was Adolf Hitler. Peter (Peter), who took too much LSD and tried to fly from a roof, did not have the broken legs or physical damage, just madness, he cut with China. Oli Beatle (Óli Bítill) Oli spent most of the time at the hospital, although Viktor is slightly older than he, he claims he wrote every Beatles song and sent it through telepathy. <br /> <br /> The novel is better than the movie and covers all of Paul's life from birth to death. There has been a long time since I saw the movie, but if I remember correctly, the film does not cover Paul's childhood. <br /> <br /> "Angels of the Universe" is funny, sad and powerful if you haven't seen it, watch it now! and read the novel first, it makes the movie better
