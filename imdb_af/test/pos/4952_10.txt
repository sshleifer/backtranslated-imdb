Lou Gossett, Jr. is great like 'Chappy Sinclair', a super pilot of the American Air Force that rescues a nice but undisciplined Doug Masters (Jason Gedrick), the son of a prisoner, who is determined to F-16 fighters to use in an attempt to save his father from a dictator (David Suchet) from an enemy's overseas country. <br /> <br /> Better than 'Top Gun', this Air Force aviation movie has excitement and lots of explosions - you know, all the cool things you want from a contemporary military adventure movie. <br /> <br /> Cool music, including the twisted sister's Dee Snider, who is breaking out "We're not going to take it" and King Cobra's excellent "Never Say Die". <br /> <br /> Goal High! Air Force!
