The subject is banal, even in 1942. This is war propaganda. The fascists are among us and they do everything they can to sabotage the war effort and prepare their victory and their seizure of power and their establishment of an effective totalitarian state. But Hitchcock must make it a real thriller. He is therefore investigating a first sabotage which is successful, but one of the victims, the friend of the one who dies in it, becomes the first suspect and breaks away for the sabotage. It enables him to explore the country and discover the difficult organization of local Nazis who have celebrities and support in the best-of-the-kind community and use the small, disgruntled whites to do the dirty work. The pursuit of the true saboteur takes our young false suspect from Los Angeles to New York and to the top of the organization. He meets a blind pianist who believes his senses know the hood is not guilty, his cousin starring the billboard, but also a frenetic and fanatical patriot who is just going to the police. Then the rich farmer and his nest of plotters. Then, on the road, there is a sympathetic and friendly truck driver, and the long caravan of a circus goes around their dwarf, beard, Siamese sisters, and some other grotesque of that kind. And he discovers the target in a Soda City, an electric dam that supplies Los Angeles and its war industry with the energy they need. He participates as a gravel in the organization in the sabotage of a USS Alaska military ship when launched. And finally, with ingenious ingenuity, creativity and elbow fat, he and the pianist's cousin can clean up the whole lot, most of them are arrested and the first saboteur, a certain Fry, falls out of the torch of the Statue of Liberty. That one won't iron on the old electric spark plug. But Hitchcock isn't yet in the habit of having a personalized cameo look in his own films, so don't look at him.

It's well built and well behaved, but it's just an extra-style propaganda movie. <br /> <br />
