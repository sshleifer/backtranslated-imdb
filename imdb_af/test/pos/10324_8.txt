Clyde Bruckman borrows the prospect of this short from Buster Keaton's "Seven Chances", which has recently been turned over as "The Bachelor." In the original, Buster has 24 hours to marry to inherit a large amount of money. In this version, the musical teacher has prof. Shemp only 7 hours (it's short!). This is one of the better Stooges shorts because of the storyline and wonderful routines (including the phone area scene with Moe & Shemp, reminiscent of Laurel & Hardy's "Berth Marks" and the Marx Brothers famous statue screen in "Night At The Opera - here's the boys keep their own in their variation of this routine.) I'm not a big Stooges fan, but this one should be noticed by any student of comedy as one of their best since the early 30s shorts.
