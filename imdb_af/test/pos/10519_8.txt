I've been trying to remember the name of this movie for years. Lastly, read something today, 03/09/2005, which named Stacy Keach's name, and it reminded me that I saw a movie he was in at the Atlanta Film Festival in 1974. So I did a Google search for Keach's movies and found The Gravy Train. We had to see Duddy Kravitz at the film festival, but for some reason they couldn't show it, and replaced The Gravy Train. We were very disappointed that we couldn't see the Duddy Kravitz, and didn't hear anything about The Gravy Train and didn't hear it. <br /> <br /> However, I remember being pleasantly surprised at how good the movie was, and as I recall, it was rather humorous. Would like to find it on tape.
