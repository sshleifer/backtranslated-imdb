The cast is wonderfully chosen and well-balanced. This cinematography is excellent. The music is beautiful, as all of Burt Bacharach's music is suitable for the plot line. Making a musical version of Hilton's story is a welcome change from a plodding re-make. We see seasoned actors who add real depth to the emotional content and meaning of each scene. I disagree with the critics who overlooked this brilliant jewel of a movie. This is a treasure of the silver screen! Find it if you can - and leave its magic past the printing of daily worries and inspire you to find your own "Lost Horizon".
