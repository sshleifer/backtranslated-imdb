I am a fan of B-Grade 80 movies in which the hero is a bit of a bad man, a strong man who finds love - and delivers this movie! <br /> <br /> By the end, you don't know how Sharky won't be murdered (and he doesn't! Realistic depicted I believe). But he does and it's not via an exaggerated 'The Hard' stunt. The 'past' team with which he works comes together, hence the title. His team are all characters - people on the sidelines at work because they don't quite match. These depictions are funny and sympathetic - they have a real feel for them. They are against a murderer of a killer, with a good team of his own. The result is a good movie noir.
