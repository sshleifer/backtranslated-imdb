*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** I loved the intent and consistently laughed throughout the movie. The acting was wonderful, with my favorite part being Howard's (Kevin Kline) efforts to be a "male man". The fianc√© and parents played a good job as a supporting role. Spoiler Warning: The conduct of his conservative family's acceptance and efforts to be polite was heartwarming and credible. My only problem in the end was the fact that Howard was actually gay. The movie is set to be "who you want to be", but the movie does the opposite. Howard's logic behind his "discovery" is the fact that he likes Barbra Streisand's movies and enjoys music. His ways and taste seem to be gay, and that is not until it is pointed out that he realizes it. Rather than release Howard, the pigeon falls. Oh, he likes to dance to music than he has to be gay. His confession to marriage was like a bow to the wishes of society. Eventually, the movie became a gay real movie, which was not the original course. It's almost stupid with the rest. I believe the movie would have been better if Howard were straight. It would have been the message rather.
