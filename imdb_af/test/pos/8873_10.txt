Larry (Billy Crystal) and Owen (Danny DeVito) lead a very fine spin on Hitchcock. Unhappy Larry's ex-wife became rich by publishing a book he wrote, and Owen imagined the most distorted mother. When Larry Owen tells to calm down by "watching strangers on a train", Owen gets the idea that they have to do crisis murders as in the movie. And just like in the movie, Larry thinks it's a joke, but Owen is serious. <br /> <br /> How they got the idea for "Throwing Momma from the Train" I'll never know, but it's a hilarious movie. There is not a dull moment in it. And it ended up being a hoot. Crystal and DeVito are at their best, and Anne Ramsey is so much in favor here as she was in "The Goonies". A modern classic.
