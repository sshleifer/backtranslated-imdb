Danton was a hero and one of the founders of the French Revolution of 1789. This movie was established five years later and the revolution made something ugly in the morph. While initially revolutionizing freedom, the small committee running the country is at this stage extremely repressive and a dictatorship. Danton and his friends were angry at how the country was no better than it was before they got rid of their king in 1794, so they began to criticize the government. The film starts out as the printer that makes critical government pamphlets, and its business is destroyed. So much for "freedom, equality and brotherhood"! So, because of the silence this way, Danton et al begins to criticize the government. Eventually, Robespierre (the leader of the committee) and his beloved trumpet on charges, heard a show and got rid of the difference. Some mentioned that the Polish director, Wajda, also meant to be a criticism of his own people - who were also Soviet-dominated and very oppressive at the time. It makes sense as you see how the film unfolds - especially when the government destroys all divisions "in the name of the people." <br /> <br /> The play is good, the story is compelling and I have no major criticism of the movie. However, I wish the end was handled differently. Especially because others like history lovers and French people probably have no idea that this performance helped to end the government. After this explosion of Danton in April 1794, Robespierre himself was executed in July 1794 because the country had just enough - plus the surviving Frenchmen knew that they would face the guillotine sooner or later if this ill system remained in place . One kind of epilogue would have been nice - like showing the soldiers to Robespierre. He responded by first killing himself, but he only managed to blow off a part of his face - still alive, shortly afterwards he was guillotined. It would have been a dandy little epilogue and could be done in five minutes. However, if you don't show a connection between Danton's death and the fall of the government, it's a strange thing to leave.
