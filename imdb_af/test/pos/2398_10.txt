I just saw Eddie Monroe and I was very impressed. The story was easier when the plot unraveled to a surprise. Heartwarming performances, action, humor and drama filled the screen. Topnotch observed by some talented Long Islanders. Great writing. This is the best movie that Fred Carpenter has made to date. He must be very proud of this work. Doug Brown's score is on the point. Craig Morris is the next Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt. Hard to believe is a low budget, independent film. Just think what Carpenter can do with a Hollywood level budget. Paul Regina's last movie and he is much missed and loved by everyone. He was a wonderful, successful, talented actor and good person. He will watch over us all and we will never forget his dynamic smile and spirit. Great work for everyone who participated in this movie. A few cherished plays, and humorous comos to break the serious content. You will enjoy this movie, see it!
