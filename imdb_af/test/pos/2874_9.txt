Sea No Evil is the first film of WWE films. Yes WWE, Wrestling Entertainment, pro wrestling. Of course, this is a WWE movie that a wrestler must die, the warrior is Glenn Jacobs aka Kane. What is not really important as if you do not know Kane or what WWE stood for you will never know that it has anything to do with the wild word of wrestling, because the movie has nothing to do with wrestling. See No Evil is a brutal horror movie, it has a few moments where people can jump, but mostly just say it, hey, watch how gross we can! Not that something's wrong with that. Jacob Goodnight (played by Kane) is kind of a Jason-type character, his mother tortured him as a child with understatement and distorted his mind. Now he's a big, scary killer. 90% of the movie takes place in a deserted hotel where Jacob is surprised by six boys and a handful of adults. I can explain why they are in a creepy old hotel, but who cares? Despite the lack of originality Sien No Evil was made good for what it was supposed to be. Kane plays an incredible killer and needs little makeup to be scary. One mistake in the movie is the most annoying possibility that people survive. I'm really looking forward to killing them terribly, but unfortunately it doesn't happen. I wish the movie did not attach the stigma of wrestling, although as I said the movie had nothing to do with wrestling, people were still closed enough to not see it because of course, if they were a wrestling is enemy. Then the movie can make money again, because Wrestling fans will want to see it. Anyway, See No Evil has top effects and little CGI, and as I said, it's pretty brutal, so I say it's good stuff. If you want something like that.
