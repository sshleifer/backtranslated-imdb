I feel with a loss, so brilliant is this movie. Kieslowski is a writer, a philosopher; and while being an excellent filmmaker, his greatness lies in his writing; and "Red" is his paradigm. This film is a metaphorical study of the artist's judgment in the creation of his fictional world; of how an artist can try to restore life - even his own - through his art, even if he cannot escape the knowledge that, no matter how he engages himself in his story, it is still fiction and he is still outside his revived world, still busy with his unreality and the reality of life he tried to restore artistic. And magic is not to the slightest at the expense of a wonderful story about the mysteries of love and fate and the characters living this story, this pre-determined fate. If I had to choose, I could nominate it the biggest movie ever made.
