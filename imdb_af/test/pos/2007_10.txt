Signed by Pain is easily one of the best movies I've ever seen. Here are my reviews of the episodes released so far: <br /> <br /> Episode one was even better than I expected and of all that I heard about it, I expected a lot. I am very impressed by the actors. The dad was creepy and played perfectly. The girl is so expressive, she uses her eyes to convey such emotions. The animation was wonderful. The cinematography was wonderful, every camera angle perfectly captured the feel of the scene. The editing is done so well, every scene seamlessly in the next. The music caught the emotions very well and pulled you into the story. I just can't say enough about how wonderful this episode was. It definitely makes my appetite even more so! <br /> <br /> Episode 2 was even better than the first one! Carry on everything I said about the first episode, just seeing even more of the character development. I can't wait to finally see episode 3 or the rest of the series. Developed is an intriguing, character-driven storyline with all the bumps of a great Hollywood production, but without the pretense. There is so much said, with so few words. This series is something you have never seen before and it has become a huge success. <br /> <br /> This episode was FREAKING AWESOME! No other words describe it! WOW! Everything I said about the previous episodes is true for this one, and yet it was even better! I don't know how to make something great and make it even better! The further character development proves that this is a completely character-driven piece. The cinematography performs as it always has and draws you into Emily's pain, fear, hatred and emotional rollercoaster. I can't wait to see Episode 4 ... or the rest of the series for that matter. You've really outdone yourself! <br /> <br /> As much as I loved the other episodes, episode 4 is still the best. I love the character progression. I feel like Emily, her pain, and her internal struggle. The other themes I mentioned in previous reviews continue. GREAT cinematography, the writing is great, the actors continue with their portrayals and made the characters their own and the animation is simply amazing! Another good job of the DbP team!
