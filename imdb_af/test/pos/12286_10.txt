"It's not a movie," because it is so true in what it is trying to say. If you ignore the dynamics of the plot and focus on the message, you'll see a bit of yourself in the main character, Michael. Whether male or female, we have all come to our lives where we want to look back and explore a situation or relationship. Did it really happen as we remembered? What went wrong? Michael's desire to find grace is completely selfish. More than anything he wants to make himself feel better about how things have turned out. Yet, he is a sympathetic character because everyone is selfish about relationships. We will not be different in them. As the film ends, I'm not sure Michael has learned something new about himself or not. Our best measure of relationship is through his friend, Nadia. She is the soul of the movie and reminds us how there are always two sides to each story. I found that Michael was pompous, arrogant, and just unclear. That's exactly why I liked him. He is a true character. If you ever wanted to go back and analyze a previous relationship then it's a movie for you. Ultimately, it's a movie for everyone.
