The Bothersome Man is a clever, surrealistic movie that revives what you do with your life and makes you mark. When you see these people in a zombie, such as doing the daily events and realizing that this is what we do and what we want in real life, it really gets close to home. This is a surprisingly effective movie that will end up asking you about your direction and not so much the movie. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the main character whose life we ​​see as a third person as he tries to adapt to a new life after he has moved. In the beginning it looks like he is the most popular man in town, as everyone meets him and he is invited to meals. A good example of this is in the scene with his new boss saying him an envelope of an unspecified amount of cash "here's a little something to get you started". Andreas even gets a girl 20 minutes in the movie, after which he finally enters. It seems to be an ideal living situation, as his girlfriend is an established interior designer, attractive and never night on something he does. But Andreas is unfinished with their relationship as with all others in this world. He then starts a relationship with a colleague called Ingeborg, whom he eventually leaves to Anne and claims he is in love. After Ingeborg told how he felt, she told him that she also saw other colleagues and said all the relationships were "nice". Soon after, we see Andreas at a train station where he tries to end his misery and to the audience's disappointment. Still looking for salvation, Andreas Hugo, who has found a hole from which music can be heard, meets. So they start a mission to get to the other side, will it be better or will it be worse? <br /> <br /> "The Bothersome Man" shows us society's obsession with appearances and its materialistic attitude. It makes a great job of making us fill our homes with IKEA products that hand out the characters every lunch. I think he mostly wastes fun on dull Scandinavian society and his high suicide rates. For example, there is a scene in the movie where Andreas comes across a man who jumped out of a building and jumped on a nailing fence. Also, Andreas who experiences this world, cuts off his finger and then jumps in front of a train; this is one of the strangest / scandalous scenes I've seen. This world created by Lien is equivalent to purgatory where there is no punishment or reward. Drinking in this world after drinking Andreas never got drunk, sex was unfinished and no matter how many times he tried to kill himself. This movie reminds me of "Fight Club" and how both main characters were kind of out of sync with the world around them. In "Fight Club" Tyler Durden creates a second person who does everything he doesn't want and in this movie is the awakened Andreas the equivalent of Tyler Durden. After a while he wakes up and tries to escape the bare life he now escapes by escaping through a hole in a wall. <br /> <br /> Lien does a good job with continuity in this movie, which means when a character has a half-full cup in his hand and they cut away and come back, they have the glass in the same hand and it is not full Empty show that the shot has been done another day. At present, directors are more concerned about the sound effects and look at the little things like the character the bracelet carries on the same hand as the filming of the past? Being in high school for three years, it's hard for me not to look at continuity or chattering my nuts. Lien does the little things, he has good lighting in every shot, never lets you wonder why something is in a shot and results in an interesting subject. This movie really worked for me because it doesn't just scare Scandinavians, but Western society and what's wrong with it. The only real problem I had was with the man who committed suicide by jumping on a speckled fence. Because you finally realize that this world has no death, but he lay motionless to force you to accept he is dead and it is never answered in my opinion. <br /> <br /> Andreas is the only main character to come and go and never do more than support him. His first friend Anne Britt is an interior designer who looks perfect on the surface for him, but later appears dull. This leads him to Ingeborg, where he starts with a relationship and falls in love. He soon realized that she was with a handful of other men and that what he felt was not really. Andreas finally meets Hugo in the bathroom of a bar and complains about how nothing more tasty and how he can't even get drunk. He followed Hugo's house to find the hole in the wall, full of children's laughter and birds chirping. <br /> <br /> Lien doesn't have much on the CV, but "The Bothersome Man" is more than a jump starting with a good career, but a preview of an upcoming director. If it's an indication of his talent and potential as a storyteller, Lien has a bright future and we can only hope his future movies won't take so long to make it overseas for our viewing space. So sit a seat and enjoy the ride as director Jens Lien takes you from the comfort of your home to the dreamy world, which is "The Bothersome Man".
