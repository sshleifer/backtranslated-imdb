I just went to see this movie because I always liked Kevin Costner. I felt that Ashton did a good job in the Butterfly Effect. Unfortunately, although these two actors were able to be good, if not great acting moments, some of them were missing. Some of the screens were just not credible and didn't have enough storyline support. <br /> <br /> Although the movie was influenced by hurricane Katrina's claims, there was very little (none) in the movie. <br /> Overall, I liked the fact that the movie brought some of the things that save people's lives from a water perspective. <br /> <br /> The special effects were pretty good and more than a bit intimidating. Not sure, I'll ever go deep sea fishing again ... <br /> <br /> I expected a bit more emotion in the movie than was offered. <br /> <br /> Definitely a movie "I've seen on DVD.
