Abe Zwick made the one-off, beautiful, perfect. He has never made another film, but has created a brilliant portrait of homosexual self-hatred in this film that is both biting and influential. He recommends the screen to break the crumbling debris of a man under the pressure of an increasingly meaningless life. <br /> <br /> Paul (Zwick) is an aging queen who is somehow convinced that Stanley (Wayne Crawford), an obvious idiot without a sense of future, follows his star. He is a little-hatred who recently hated hate. He was forced to cross the town and move to Miami. Like a disguise, he dressed up like an old blue stocking, with as much sexual agony as the Churchwoman. He tells Stanley to tell his friends that he lives with his "Aunt Martha". Paul himself has no friends, spends far too much time alone in the house and has to deal with Stanley's dissolute lifestyle. It will be enough to cross any man in transgender murder. <br /> <br /> Again, Zwick Paul shows as a tragic figure who has completely lost any understanding of how to relate to other people. Nonetheless, there is a certain poetry in his anxiety, which burns slowly over the course of the film. He is tragic, but also elegant. It's finally a very sad movie. It certainly has very hilarious moments, but there is such a downfall of hopelessness and despair, that humor is bittersweet. This movie is worth watching for the performance of Abe Zwick. He could really have built his career on Martha. She is quite a guest as soon as you get to know her. Make sure you cut your hair and stop making your horse. She really hates it!
