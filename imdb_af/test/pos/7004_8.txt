I have to say that I didn't expect to sit down much to watch "Pitch Black", but I got a lot back in terms of excitement and pure fun. It's the kind of movie where you can just sit back, relax and enjoy a good time just being entertained. It's not a deep movie. Anything it offers is retrieved or ripped off from other movies like "Alien," "Predator" or so. But if I look a rip-off, I want it to be good, and this rip-off is great. <br /> <br /> It opens with a galaxy of stars. Some of the best movies of all time open up with this kind of scene - "2001," "Star Wars," "Alien," "Predator." A ship crosses through space when the entire cryogenic frozen crew is awake. The ship was hit by something. They land on a nasty little planet with three suns. Everyone flies out of the ship when they find their prisoner feed, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) escaped. They are looking for the desert plan in search of him and eventually finding him, but they can't get their ship to fly again. They are looking for the planet for water and civilization, but they all seem to have disappeared from the planet for too long. <br /> <br /> Then they find out that every 22 years the planets are in a solar eclipse and the whole planet becomes black. There are also many aliens who flourish on the planet in the dark - what are the chances? They happen on the planet just as the eclipse happens - what are the chances? And Riddick has a rare talent - he can see in the dark - again, what are the chances? <br /> <br /> There seems to be a lot of co-ordination in this movie, but a movie like this isn't out to get Oscars for originality or credibility. It is there to entertain the audience - it does it with ease. Vin Diesel is a great gorilla of a man with no acting talent whatsoever. But I have to say if there is anyone who can fit the part of a trashy, murderous offense, it is Diesel. Listen to him, mother, "He didn't know who he was with him." Great things. <br /> <br /> The aliens in this movie are a mix of hammerhead sharks, those of "Alien" and Predators. They have long, horizontal heads such as a hammerhead, the rapid mobility of the strangers, and the villain of a Predator. I suppose David Twohy (director and writer of the movie) didn't expect the audience to believe his creatures were really something that had never been seen before. At least I hope not. <br /> <br /> Aliens Redux can be a better name for this movie, but then it's better than both second and third Alien films. At a time that apparently ended, the series is revived. - "Terminator 3," "Alien 5," "Predator 3," "Alien vs. Predator" - "Pitch Black" stands out as a new series entirely. Another two successors are planned. Let's just hope they're not taken away. I can only depict it twenty-five years: "Aliens vs Predator vs Pitch Black Aliens: * The Battle of the Year." <br /> <br /> * Battle of the Year title can be shared with the upcoming movie "Freddy vs Jason vs Michael vs Leatherface vs Norman Bates vs Alien vs Predator vs Terminator vs James Cameron vs Barny the Dinosaur." <br /> <br /> 4/5.
