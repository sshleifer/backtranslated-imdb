"National Velvet" tells the story of Velvet Brown, a young English girl with dreams of entering her beloved horse in the prestigious Grand National Horse Race. The film follows her as she trains her horse with the help of a former jockey and the support of her parents. <br /> <br /> While National Velvet is a family movie, it should not deter people who are typically looking. such films with spotting. The film is indeed one that will appeal to the whole family, not just attention-addicted young people. It even managed to land five Oscar nominations, almost a sign of a general audience. <br /> <br /> In the part of Velvet's mother, Anne Revere actually won an Oscar for her performance. She was, in fact, excellent in the role, but it is the 12-year-old Elizabeth Taylor stealing the show. She is a beautiful presence and displays a talent outside her years. Also Oscar winner Donald Crisp as Velvet's father, Mickey Rooney, as former jockey Mi Taylor and Angela Lansbury (in one of her earliest films) as Velvet's older sister. <br /> <br /> The film's glamorous Technicolor makes for an attractive viewing experience while editing ensured the second of the film's two Oscars. In addition, the film was nominated for his direction (by Clarence Brown), cinematography and art direction. The score of ten-year-old Oscar nominee Herbert Stothart is also worth mentioning, though it is inevitable. <br /> All in all, "National Velvet" is a wonderful family movie that deserves a higher rating. I realize the prospect of watching a movie about a girl and her horse does not excite some people, but this one is worth taking a chance.
