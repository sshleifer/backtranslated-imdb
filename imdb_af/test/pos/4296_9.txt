Well, what's wrong with the title "Separate Lies" (accused elsewhere of not being "exciting"). It is cunning, subtle and a little poetic. (Of course there is a Phil Collins song and a James Belushi movie called "Separate Life", referred to here.) <br /> <br /> But the real point is the ethical dilemmas of lying at different levels to tell what the movie probes. Okay, it's not a hilarious title in your face, but then it's not a hilarious movie in your face. Please give British movies like this a chance. They try to make people think about important things, like here: how far you go to protect your life (even if it is slightly rotten) against unexpected disasters. Maybe you're telling lies. Maybe you ignore your loved ones' lies. It can carry many people out. <br /> <br /> American movies about this theme are plentiful, but they usually go much further by using firearms, which are not part of everyday life in Europe. <br /> <br /> Perhaps we're not so "exciting" here, but we don't expect slogan movie titles for movies that aren't aimed at a massive public.
