I'm from Texas, and live very close to Plano where the real deaths occurred, so I can be a little biased by saying that "Wasted" is a movie you just can't get out of your mind. <br /> <br /> Stahl, Phoenix, and Paul all play their characters very realistically. You really believe they are daily high school students who only find heroin addicts. The drug content is also handled very graphically - although everything that happens in the movie serves a purpose, and every moment the characters are downward heartbreaking. I recommend this movie to everyone. Once you see it, it bumps you!
