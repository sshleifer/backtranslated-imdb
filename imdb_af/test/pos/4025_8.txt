We saw and enjoyed La Spettatrice at the Siracusa International Film & Video Festival. <br /> <br /> This movie has buried the fear we all have. Fear of rejection, fear of intimacy and the main fear of our own shortcomings. <br /> <br /> The three main players, Barbora Bobulova and Valeria, Brigitte Catillon as Flavia, Andrea Renzi as Massimo, are in agreement with their roles and are excellent. It was a joy to see the dynamic among the three, as it really looks. <br /> <br /> I believe Barbora Bobulova is a vantage point. I hope we'll see much more of her in the coming year. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't make the easy way out. Thumb to the Italian team who put this movie together. Highly recommended.
