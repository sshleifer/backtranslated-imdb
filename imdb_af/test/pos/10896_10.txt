Since I once again allowed Goldeneye, it was impossible to get my mind out of it. I'm surprised I could have gone without it. This is without a doubt one of the biggest games of all time. I have never played any other shooting games, but I know this one is above all else. Most people blame it for too much violence, but I find it ridiculous. There may be some graphic antics, but there is much worse out there. <br /> <br /> Most importantly, it's fun. With a vast array of weapons such as the RC-P90 and the classic Golden Gun, you go through various challenging levels of the movie, completing key goals and the absence of guards. There are tons of wonderful cheats to get and even two secret levels that you will only earn if you have the real skill. Goldeneye is also one of the biggest multiplayer games. You can select multiple characters from the movie, classic villains from old 007 movies (Baron Samedi, Oddjob, May Day and Jaws) and guards in the game. Chances are you and your partner (s) will laugh as hard as you blow each other so that you, like Bart and Lisa Simpson, will look like you watch an Itchy and Scratchy show episode. <br /> <br /> If you don't have the game, don't rent it: just buy it. It's too good to be true. For the cool Goldeneye stuff, go to Detstar.com's Goldeneye website. Every James Bond lover will dig this game big time.
