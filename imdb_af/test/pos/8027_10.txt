This movie is overshadowed by 'The Jackal' (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere) released the same year. After watching both movies, I can honestly say it's the superior movie. <br /> <br /> Allowed, the production cost of 'The Jackal' was very good, it probably had a considerably bigger budget. However, the command is well written and has a fascinating story. Aiden Quinn is flawless in dual roles. Aiden Quinn and director Christian Duguay did a good job of establishing a deep and multilayer relationship between the title character and his family. I especially liked the end. <br /> <br /> I am reminded of the Jack Ryan character in the Tom Clancy movies. Both have been cast into fleet riders in incredibly dangerous roles, as they work illegally on behalf of the National Security. And yet, both Harrison Ford and Aidan Quinn unveil their respective characters as a hero who is versatile and gentle. They have genuine tenderness and vulnerability in their relationships with their families. <br /> <br /> What I don't understand is how the opinions of everyone who posted this movie (including myself) can be so much more positive than the luxury reception that the movie received. It's a movie that has enough complexity and subtlety, which is still compelling to many views. If you're a fan of spy genre movies, I recommend the "enthusiastic" command.
