After his earlier film "Videodrome", which certainly shows similarities to this movie, David Cronenberg directs him back into the world of virtual reality, mixing truth and fiction. This is the virtual reality on a completely different level. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a highly original, well-directed, well-written film. The movie has a fascinating and well thought out concept that is largely performed by director David Cronenberg. <br /> <br /> "eXistenZ" is a movie that knows how to constantly trick you. Just when you thought you got things out, another surprise awaits you. Things are never like you think they are, especially when exploring the line between truth and fiction. You never really know what reality is and what is the game world to the end. This makes the characters and events very unpredictable and also offers the movie with a good ending that will make you think more. <br /> <br /> The movie has a perfect kind of game storytelling, mostly with its character appearances and its puzzles. They must first complete a certain step or task before they can continue in the world and find out what their purpose is. <br /> <br /> The movie knows how to create a perfect balance between realism and surrealism, without ever having to go over the top. The storytelling keeps the movie as simple as possible, but of course the movie is not always so easy to follow due to its events, dialogues and unusual environments. <br /> <br /> The movie is not just strange. I was actually surprised to see "Videodrome" here has a higher rating, thinking it is a much more inaccessible and "strange" movie. The movie is also made enjoyable and has a good quick fit. It does not always leave the film in its more philosophical moments and deeper meanings. It also makes this movie perfectly viewable for people who don't normally watch these movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautiful, with subtle effective special effects, a good visual look, which also offers the movie with a certain required gaming feel. <br /> <br /> The movie is well-cast, with Jude Law in a role you don't see too often, that of a shy insecure person. It shows how versatile the actor is, and that he is much more than just a pretty Hollywood face. Jennifer Jason Leigh was also a good female head. She didn't really play so much in big productions, but with this movie she shows why she was still considered a big movie star. The film also features other well-known actors, in much smaller roles, such as Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe. <br /> <br /> A very original movie worth watching, especially if you've previously seen "Videodrome". . <br /> <br /> 8/10
