It is definitely one of the best Western films produced in the new millennium. It is a tribute to all the stars of major TV Western classics, and this is the ultimate revival of the Western movie. The story of two brothers meeting after the war between states and ending on different sides of the law, however, is not new, but the shooting and atmosphere are good. There is a graphic violence like bad guys being killed, with an ax or woman being shot in cold blood. Lee Majors didn't take part in the action until the end, so I gave it 9 out of 10 points. . But it's still one of the best new western productions I've ever seen. I had the honor and pleasure of meeting Chris McIntyre at the West Festival and having a fun conversation with him, and I had the opportunity to meet Buck Taylor playing the role of city doctor. In my opinion, our Chris McIntyre should be very obliged for his efforts to get as many stars from the classic TV westerners and SASS to collect him to perform in a new western like this. Chris also has an excellent talent for choosing the right actors for the main characters. Both are young and promising, and I think we should see more of them in future western productions. I enjoyed this Western movie. This was worth every minute. I hope Chris McIntyre will continue to work on other Western movies and present us with some more great productions like this one. Great work, Chris! Jasper P. Morgan (Pete)
