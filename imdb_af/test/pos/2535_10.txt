The film opens with the director talking to the camera and says he will show a story about Brazil street children whose families live and have to steal and kill to survive. In fact, the main character (Pixote) was only playing 11 years old by a real street child. What follows is one of the most brutal, depressing and horrible movies I've ever seen. I saw it about 17 years ago (on a double account with "Black Orpheus") and never forgot it. I don't think I want to see it again - it was just too much. <br /> <br /> SPOILER AAD !!!! The scene that doesn't leave me is when Pixote meets a prostitute who has to break down her own fetus. You don't see her ... but you get a quick look at what she came up with. It's almost 20 years later and just remembered the scene upset me. SPOILER END !!!!! <br /> <br /> The movie becomes more brutal as it goes and ends the only way it can. What is increasingly harrowing is stories like this that happened in Brazil in 1981 ... and still happen today. <br /> <br /> A harrowing brutal movie ... but it must be seen if you can handle it. . I'm surprised it has an R rating. I saw X-rated less graphical film. A 10.
