I've been sitting here many times, mainly because the synopsis sounded so cheesy, so "Love American Style". However, it was very good, very well done. The two stand-out features are the dialogue and acting. Great throw. The point of departure is actually well executed and there are not too many weak moments. I think my biggest surprise was how often you thought the wheels were going out of the car, and instead the car just blowed, so to speak, and the movie was flying. There are some pretty little sub-plots, especially the relationship that develops between the character played by former Conan sidekick Andy Richter. Also, you want to mention that the music that goes with it was good.
