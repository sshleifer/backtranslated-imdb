Perhaps the deepest cartoon made in the US is short of 70 episodes shortly after 70 episodes in four seasons. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the often innocent criticism found in The Simpsons (a pretty good performance in its own right), and the rude-for-rude humor in "South Park", every part follows of this series a plan. The criticism of American society, from its mercantilism to its selfishness, contributes much more than any other animated series. <br /> <br /> The cultural references in Duckman also tend to be unclear. those fan sites will realize that most are not even caught. It differs from "The Simpsons", which usually uses pop culture instead of the high-brow stuff that is often hidden in Duckman. As others write about it, there is a growth in the characters (Bernice, Duckman and Cornfed). Also, by not only making the main character an offensive neurotic, but actually someone experiencing a personal tragedy (as made clear in episodes such as "The Once and Future Duck" ("You will love her to the end of your days ...) and in "Bev take a holiday" (when he gets a chance to tell Beverly what he couldn't tell Beatrice), the series is embedded in a deep sense of reality . <br /> <br /> One cannot avoid being sorry for him and his brightness. <br /> <br /> All in all, the best cartoon ever made in the US is and one of the best series ever, it will ever be on DVD, too many things make the duck much more meaning today.
