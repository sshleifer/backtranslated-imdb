I'm not sure why I chose a Nurse Betty mother loan. I just think I heard a bit of this movie. But I'm glad I did. "Nurse Betty" is an original and clever film that has humor and a darker side. <br /> <br /> It was one of Renee's first big one before raising it in Hollywood. I can see why she is an amazing actress. The scene where she finally realized what had happened and she was on the set of her favorite soap, saw pain, confusion, fear and embarrassment on her face. Just to let you play the movie, she plays Betty. An oblique and unsafe woman standing by her abusive husband, she is a waitress and is in love with soap operas, especially one where a certain cute doctor, dr. Dave Revell. When she accidentally saw her husband's accident in a separate room, the murders she saw were two clients she had just had, Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock. She just lost her mind and left the town after talking to the police and said she had to get her former fiancee, dr. Dave Revell, find it. So, she travels across the country to California to get Dr. Find Revell, and want a job as a nurse to work with Dave. She saw the show so many times. Somehow, she's just a nurse if she's a woman's brother. Despite everyone telling her she was cruel, she looked at them as if they were crazy. When she plays the actor playing Dave Revell, George (his real name) thinks she's just a crazy fan trying to get on the show. She just looks at him with confusion and believes that he and she belong together. <br /> <br /> Renee was great, she was so credible to losing her mind in the movie. She has come so far, and you want to admit it or not, she is rich and a great actress. <br /> <br /> Morgan Freeman plays one of the killers, Charlie, who is the father of the two. He is so charmed and beaten by Betty and as she chases her over the land, he is almost abandoned with Betty, after which he almost falls in love with her. He and his son Wesley have to find Betty if they find out she is at the murder scene and can give away their identity. When Charlie Betty sees and finally catches her, she is busy, but calm down and they know they have a real connection. It was a beautiful play scene, my opinion is that Morgan gave a stronger performance. He's just fantastic. <br /> <br /> A surprisingly decent performance by Chris Rock, son, Wesley. He is such a "gun" - it is just to do the job quickly and to take care of business. I loved the end of his comedic show, where he and the gang he was holding hostage were just watching the soap opera together. Classic. "Nurse Betty" is a great movie I would recommend for a good laugh and just in a nice honest little movie I think anyone can enjoy. <br /> <br /> 9/10
