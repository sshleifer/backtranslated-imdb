For those who love their films of explosive planets and extreme violence, it's certainly not one to see. In fact, there is very little plot (or at least, very little that cannot be summed up in seconds: A meets B. Mr. A falls for Mrs B and has a relationship with her. A and B then fall love and wonder (largely) whether they want a relationship themselves.) <br /> <br /> This is Cantonese Visconti. Story there is nothing, but what you get is a succession of wonderful images and terribly trivial music that convey the slow course of the central characters' emotions. There is also the chance to see one of the most beautiful women in the world in a range of beautiful elegant outfits. For my money, it's worth seeing alone. How could this woman ever become an action heroine? She looked as if she had walked straight out of the pages of Vogue.
