Andaz Apna Apna is by far my second favorite comedy of all time, the first being Namak Halal (although technically a drama). Story is not groundbreaking, but the complications attached to it make it wonderful. Aamir Khan is a total cartoon. Just look at his expressions in the song Yeh Raat aur yeh doori. He is incredibly good at comedy, I never knew. Salman Khan was also good as the somewhat thicker of the two characters. The sounds he makes are almost as funny as Aamir's faces. Raveena and charisma serve their purpose, but nothing is wonderful. The true choice of the lot is Paresh Rawal as usual. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, Amar (Aamir) and Prem (Salman) are useless sons of poor fathers. They do not believe in hard work and just want to get the easy way to get rich. Both of their brains come up with an idea to preserve a rich man's (Paresh Rawal) daughter (Raveena Tandon) coming to India to look for a man. So Amar and Prem meet on the journey and join hands to try and marry the hundreds of other men with this girl. When they succeed, they must now get rid of each other. Somehow they both get in Raveena's home, Amar as an injured man and Prem as his doctor. From here they try to emit each other. But things are complicated when Raveena's friend (Karisma Kapoor) falls for Prem and strives. And the rich man's evil twin brother (Rawal) also tries to get rid of the heir and her father, so that he will inherit the money and send in his two most reliable but clumsy fools to do the dirty work. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you don't want to miss. Beware! It will be worth it. I even own the DVD, it's so good. And if you like this movie, I would also recommend Gol Maal if you haven't watched it yet. Other good comedies are Namak Halal and Hera Pheri (new).
