Brett Piper makes another very good movie that is being scrapped by the so-called film "experts". It's a low budget, but fun, and the top lady is very sexy. I wish I could see more of Irene Joseph. Good reading pleasure. I bought the DVD and enjoyed it. The special effects are stop motion animation, and much better than the computer generated crap they call effects today. I always enjoy Brett Piper movies, and if you like, I recommend Bite Me, Screaming Dead and anything else he did. I look forward to seeing more of his work as well as more of me. Joseph. I simply can't see why this woman is no longer movies, as her play is excellent.
