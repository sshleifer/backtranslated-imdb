I just watched this movie for the first time after completing the book last week. What is the problem here? People admit that the performances are great - I mean, Lange is stars! - and that the movie looks good, but it has less than a '6'! I don't get it. Come on! The writing is not that bad! <br /> <br /> Having read many Pulitzer-winning novels and seen many of the movies, I thought a better-than-decent work was done to bring the screen together. I thought the merger of all the dialogue in the novel was almost perfect. This story had a very big dialogue in it, and the story really got on the screen despite the fact that only part of it was used. <br /> <br /> ** BOOK SPOILER SHARE ** I was, but a little disappointed in the Ginny try-to-death Rose subplot is omitted. I thought it was one of the more emotional broken parts of the book, but it was probably a good bet to leave it out. Strange filmmakers, more than zealous readers, I think, tend to give less forgiveness to protagonists who are antagonistic. It is suitable to confuse Johnny Lunchpail and Joe Sixpack. <br /> <br /> If you loved the book, you'll love the movie. If you hated the book, you probably hate the movie. <br /> <br /> ******** <br /> <br /> Rog
