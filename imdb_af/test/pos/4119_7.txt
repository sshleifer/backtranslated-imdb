George Saunders is a forger who steals a scarce copy of Hamlet and kills a guard in the process. Months later, an associate of his book sells large amounts of money. One of the counterfeits is being sold to a man who works for the Nazis. Not happy to take the Nazi frontman, insists on getting his money back. At the same time, an investigator appears working for one of the other swollen clients. The midwife in an effort to keep herself safe, both sides play against each other and sit in the New York Public Library between different parties, but as people start dying, the library is closed and more murders (and perhaps a few scarce book facilities seem to be close to happening. Complex murder mystery is a good little thriller with a good cast (Saunders was assisted by Richard Denning and a solid support players). If there is a mistake, the movie is almost too complicated with plots and everyone is pretty much out of themselves. The layers of theft, forgery, murder and war-time plot (that was 1942) are almost too much for the short 70 minutes. Yet it is a pleasant little film with a darkness and a sense of inevitable punishment for some of the characters who clearly call it one of the first films. Until Denning comes up, we are among some beautiful thieves, whatever we want, maybe even more than the hero, but it is clear from word and deed, it is not going to be quite happy, and they know it, even though they are fighting it. A good little movie worth looking for.
