Absolute grab of a movie, and its age, years before its time. This week I saw the first time my dad came to the neighbor's television, that the man threw himself on the scullery. A Tinkerer with everything electric, Dad worked it within two days. It was July 1955 ... and then it's probably just the third house in the street to have television! The first thing we ever saw on this grain and flickering old 12-inch screen was this movie. "It's cute, dear," I remember, my mother told me! <br /> <br /> Almost 50 years, and it doesn't look older - rather like the First World War in that respect! Fantastic little fantasy about a London omnibus carrying thirteen passengers, crashing and killing one of them. Then, in the jump back, we pick up the lives of these people and what they brought daily on this bus. <br /> <br /> Back to the end of the movie, the victim's identity is revealed. , perhaps the inspiration behind the 1960s movie THE LIST OF ADRIAN MESSENGER. <br /> <br /> If you ever come across this gem, I suggest you see it!
