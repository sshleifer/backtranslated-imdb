I started looking at this one that was very tense because I heard so many different things. Somewhere I read it was a drama about child abuse and PG-13 for violence. Another critic said it was a fantastic and nostalgic adventure of children (and I thought it was also for kids to watch). Well, now I've seen it so many times and still don't know which category to put it. It is sometimes extremely funny, but terribly sad and depressed the next moment. Because of the good relationship and adventures, I would recommend this movie to all the young people I know, but I fear that the gloomy atmosphere is not suitable for children. Because of the perfect performances and the magic of the movie, I have to say, look at it, especially the kids! The last thing I have to say is that I hate the scriptwriter for the fact that poor Bobby never sees his family again after he fled from The King (who did not even return to terrorize Mary and Mikey). It is very good for this movie not to make a perfect happy ending with everyone who is happy - and I didn't expect it - but this solution left me very, very sad!
