This movie was a pleasant surprise to me. In all honesty, the previews looked terrible, to the point where Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman appeared. So I rented it with discussion, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It had good acting, some good plot moves, and of course Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. It is definitely worth checking out.
