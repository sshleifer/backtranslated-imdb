It is difficult to use words for this movie as it does not contain any of its own. <br /> <br /> But the images it carries, both powerful and cattle, is the one that reminds us why we watch movies. And you can say, "Well, Leonard Maltin doesn't like it, it can't be that good." But you're wrong. See this movie. French film shine and ensemble.
