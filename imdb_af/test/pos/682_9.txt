Beware, My Lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and is directed by a man, Harry Horner, better known for his set designs. Robert Ryan plays a man hired by Ida Lupino to do her homework. The problem is that he is a psychopathic killer and doesn't know it. Miss. Lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to conquer Ryan, to no avail. He is not the kind of man who can help or heal compassion. So we have an interesting situation of two people who are basically good, but one of them can't do well because there's something wrong with him. He suffers from periodic deviations during which he commits acts of violence, which he later forgets. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the effect Ryan has on Lupino is that of the hunter and his prey, or in another sense a sadist. The audience earlier finds out that Ryan is a crazy killer, but Lupino takes it much longer. We must therefore live with this knowledge, as we see how poor Miss. Lupino does everything in her power to win Ryan to make things work, get work, to live with life. But to do things is not in Ryan's makeup, because he is not capable, but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and once there is an opening, she claims paranoia. <br /> <br /> As a study of mental illness, the movie is not too impressive. What is striking is the effect of headache, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. In this regard, the film is realistic and compassionate, but inexorably logical because we know that Lupino Ryan can't fix, but we want her. The result is that if one is prepared to become emotionally involved with this film, one can set aside his melodramatic structure. <br /> <br /> Horner gradually shows us the layout of the Lupino House, a ban on gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. We are familiar with the stairs, kitchen and pantry; and we'll find out which windows mrs. lupino can use for an escape and what she can't.
