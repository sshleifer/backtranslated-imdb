WrestleMania 6 took place on April 1, 1990 at the SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. <br /> <br /> Match 1: Rick Martel vs. Koko B. Ware - For this it was a very solid opening game. Koko has always been quite popular with the fans, and at this stage, Martel has still become a slope talent. In the end, Martel can cut the victory in a decent memorable match. <br /> <br /> Match 2: The colossal bond (Andre The Giant & Haku) (c) (with Bobby 'The Brain' Heenan) vs Demolition (Ax & Smash) for the WWF Tag Team Championship - At this stage André's health was terrible, so his actions were really nothing special. The crowd is 100% pro Demolition in this game. In the end, Haku gets nailed and we have a new Tag Team Champions. After the match André Haku and Heenan are out and face what his last WrestleMania will be. <br /> <br /> Match 3: Earthquack vs Hercules - Very short game. Big dominant heels were a popular thing at the time. TEAR. to both men in the game. John Tenta (Earthquake) did not pass so long ago and the same with Hercules. In the end, earthquakes Hercules for victory. <br /> <br /> Match 4: Mr. Perfect vs Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake - The first very good game of the night. TEAR. to Curt Henning (Mr. Perfect). Actually solid back and forth action by both of these talented guys. In the end, Brutus wins, thanks to many of his great fans during the game. <br /> <br /> Match 5: 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper vs Bad News Brown - Not a technical classic, but a pretty decent noise for WrestleMania. Piper comes from half black / half white, which is a very classic moment. In the end, both guys fight at a double score without a clear cutter. <br /> <br /> Match 6: The Heart Foundation vs The Bolsheviks - Complete Squash Game. The Heart Foundation gets an easy victory. Surprisingly, WWE previously had a team breakdown. <br /> <br /> Match 7: The Barbarian vs Tito Santana - Bobby Heenan's Heenan family performs better in this game as Barbarian wins the victory against Tito Santana. Not to remember, but good to go back and look years later. Match 8: Randy Savage & Sensational Sherri vs Dignified Rhodes & Sapphire - Great inter-generation team match. Dust Rhodes wears the awkward polka dot outfit to the ring. In the end, Rhodes and Sapphire get the victory over "The Macho King" and Sensational Queen Sherri. <br /> <br /> Match 9: The Rockers vs. The Orient Express - Surprisingly another marker team game. Tag wrestling was so much better in this period. A young Shawn Michaels and his partner Marty Jannetty are losing money by counting to the Orient Express in this game. <br /> <br /> Match 10: Dino Bravo vs. Jim Duggan - Duggan gets a decent response despite his US patriot gimmick. Bravo, a member of Jimmy Hart's group, joins Hart en Aardbewing. Although he has support, Duggan takes the victory. <br /> <br /> Match 11: "The Million Dollar Man" Ted DiBiase (c) vs Jake 'The Snake' Roberts for the Million Dollar Championship - The First Big Event Of Night. Roberts was very over with the fans. Game was pretty good for what it was. DiBiase can add an outreach to Roberts. But Roberts ends with DiBiase's money and gives it away. <br /> <br /> Match 12: The Big Boss Man vs Akeem (With Slick) - One Man Gang's Sad Trying to Be an African Dream named Akeem. A very short game that needs more time to develop itself as a game. Boss Man wins with a slam. <br /> <br /> Match 13: Jimmy "Superfly" Snuka vs Rick Rude - Heenan joins Rude for the match. Well, it never really got any good at WrestleMania. He always seemed to be at the end of the end. After a short 5 minutes, Rude gets the win over Snuka. <br /> <br /> Match 14: WWF Champion Hulk Hogan vs Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior - Double-press as the "Ultimate Challenge", we get some interesting promotions from both men. earlier in the night. The game was really good, as people tend to think Hogan can't struggle. Very close to the falls that the crowd really got and people who looked at it at home. In the end, Warrior wins the Hogan victory and wins both titles. A murdered crowd looks like Hulk Hogan is suffering his first loss at WrestleMania.
