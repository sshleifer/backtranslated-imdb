David Lynch's ninth full-length feature film, Mulholland Drive, is a deep touch of betrayal and betrayal. If it is something, it contrasts our ambitions cruelly and hopes for the often bitter truth. Every frame of this movie has interest and links to other parts and to themselves at the same time. Nothing seems to be the first and you've left a real puzzle when you finally try to put the pieces together. This is a movie that is not compromised, and it fails to fully cope with the challenging shape and camera language, as may have been the case with Lost Highway. <br /> <br /> Although one recognizes classic linchic motifs and devices, the movie remains highly original even in the light of being a Lynch movie. Lost Highway marked a new way to tell a story; bred an unconventional means of creating emotions on the screen. With Mulholland Drive, Lynch not only managed to control this technique, but took it to new levels to make it much more complex and multidimensional. By doing so, he creates a framework of different layers in time and in human mind. In a press conference on the Cannes Film Festival 2001, David Lynch said that the pursuit of perfection could at best produce a result where the whole is larger than the sum of the parts. Talk about synergies like these are highly relevant to Mulholland Dr, where the various rows and many details contribute to the total; distorting dream habits and parallels to create the story. In some art its beauty lies in its simplicity. This is not the case with Mulholland Drive and has never been to Lynch. This is the complexity Lynch creates and builds, the same complexity that characterizes the real world. <br /> <br /> It is never forced, as, according to Memento, for example, using an original way of communicating with viewers. Further comparing Mulholland Drive to other movies, I think it proves David Lynch as a master of what he does and bridges art and film in a way no one has ever done. Compared to, for example, Alejandro Jodorowsky or contemporary Matthew Barney, I believe Lynch makes it clear that the artist does not dominate the artist, or more likely, understands David Lynch and performs filmmaking better than an art form. <br /> <Understanding the plot is not a small thing, but Lynch's way of working with sound, perspective, chronology and shape paints an artwork so dark and frightening that it sometimes feels more realistic than real life . The Lynchian theater is often, and certainly in Mulholland Drive, a revival of human emotions. Working with emotions is a delicate craft that requires understanding and depth. As Lynch puts it: a little too much, and the emotion goes away. A little too little, and it doesn't. " In Mulholland Drive, David Lynch has no problem making this balance. Lynch's portraits span all sorts of dimensions and take different directions and create amazingly realistic characters and situations. Looking at Mulholland Drive is a journey through the subconscious. It's a truth and naked movie with undisputed artistic value. That is why I love Mulholland Drive and what made it the highlight of cinema history. The ultimate movie.
