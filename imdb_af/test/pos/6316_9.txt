There are movies that are just another version of another, not remakes, but like others, it's not. Although talking about Mafia, it is looked at differently and it often looks like a secondary theme. I watched that movie for the case (because the other's theater was full) and I was happy at the end. It surprised me because of his black irony or cynicism and there are more and more interesting items to analyze. It doesn't follow the classic ways of movies, it's just different and I don't think it's the only one. I'm also very happy because it is Italian, and I was afraid that Italian directors and producers were not brave enough to change themes. In this movie you can also see a new Italian style, but it is not blocked in clich√©s. I hope this is understandable enough, I know it's hard, I also hope that this movie can be exported from our borders, it's a good product to run. I also want to point to the music, very good soundtrack, the movie needs it because of its long quiet break and they are perfectly covered with that music. Many compliments to the director, and thanks, cinema needs these movies.
