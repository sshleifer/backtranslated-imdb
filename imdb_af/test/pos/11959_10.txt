What can I say about this movie, except it's great fun! <br /> <br /> John Cusack plays Hoops McCann, a recent high school graduate who has two choices, learns to occupy or spend the family business on the street Summer at Nantucket with his father George Calamari (played hilarious Joel Murray) and his friends. <br /> <br /> If I say, imagine, it can't be much zaner than the Stork brothers, Egg Bobcat Goldthwait) and Clay (Tom Villard) and Ack Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong). Throw a little girl named Squid and her weirdo mutt and a good performance by Demi Moore and you have the makings to make a cut from your sides, movie. <br /> <br /> The laughter flows freely in this movie and the story line, although the typical good versus bad and good wins, is great with the turn of a regatta as the revelation. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a lot of laughter and a good time. If you like to enjoy your movies * enjoy * you can't miss one crazy summer!
