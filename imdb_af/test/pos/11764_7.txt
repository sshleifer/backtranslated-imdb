After seeing the trailer, it was an easy decision not to see this movie. I mean, I don't mind stupid stoner comedies. I'm sure it was also an easy choice for many people to get together, smoke a bowl and watch this movie with The Simpsons man and a guy named "Billy Bob." Must have been a good time, but the movie is just not that funny - too bad is someone who has to run. Unfortunately, I found out that the trailer was misleading after it had already left. the theaters, so I had to wait for the video. I really enjoyed it. Fun places, quality production and excellent performances of the whole role. The background to this was not entirely unexpected, but I did not find it cumbersome, because the point of departure was so tempting. <br /> <br /> So why was this absorbing drama marketed as a comedy? Has something happened to the producer so that the associated producers can do the marketing themselves?
