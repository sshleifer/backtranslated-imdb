I recently started to look at this show in syndication and find it a little hit and miss. Some episodes are stupid - Doug is upset about some trivial / youthful things and does dumb etc. <br /> <br /> Still, others are quite amusing and sometimes touch. This includes the episodes that face the complexity of the characters. For example, the "young overweight lovely man married sexy woman" theme is found in several sitcoms. (Carrie also has something about her, look-wise. Not just a run of the mill's sexy girl.) But Carrie has a head start - she can be nice on the eyes but has a few too many personality traits too far no different from her father. <br /> <br /> And she recognizes it right away. For example, one episode revolves around her lack of desire to work together well. I find her b * ness sexy in person, but you have to be the right kind of person to live with. Amiable Doug is a great game. And, deep, see also the simple things. Maybe, not so much as Doug whose nirvana TV is watching and a big bakkie next to his big screen. eat, but no culture she bells. This lack of an overly sensitive side is one of the reasons why the two do not have children. <br /> <br /> Of course, the simple enjoyment of a man is of course nothing to cut, and adds to the charm of the show. They live an ordinary working class of life in Queens - it's realistic in that sense. And generally, amusing and pleasant sitcom rate, especially. if you just want to relax. It gets a little tired at the end, so it's probably good, it ends. It had a good run. See also, Becker.
