When HOPPITY GOES TO TOWN he discovers nothing but bad news for his little neighbor in the Lowveld. Can this honest, natural locust save his darling, Mrs Honey Bee, from the allegations of evil C. Bagley Beetle - and also lead his friends to a safe new home - before it's too late? <br /> <br /> While not one of the great animated features (a lot of new art is currently created this movie). HOPPITY is a pleasant movie that will bring pleasure to uncritical viewers. Technically, it is well made, with animation of a generally high quality. The main drawback of the movie is that none of the characters really has a heart - they don't come alive on the screen as Jiminy Cricket did a year earlier in PINOCCHIO. <br /> <br /> However, it is ultimately unfair to compare Fleischer Studio output with that of Disney. Max & Dave Fleischer had their own star to follow; their contribution - and that would be a considerable one - would be in the realm of the one-line cartoon. With their POPEYE and BETTY BOOP series, they created alternative realities as viable as any other cartoon studio. HOPPITY was their second experiment with feature length animation (after GULLIVER'S TRAVELS in 1939), and henceforth they will spend their energy on the cartoon short box. In fact, the first in the highly acclaimed SUPERMAN series was already released. <br /> <br /> HOPPITY's story owes Frank Capra a lot, with his energetic, being the hero against powerful social forces. Indeed, the original title of the film was MR. BUG GOES TO TOWN, which immediately reminds one of Gary Cooper or Jimmy Stewart and their Capraesque adventures. <br /> <br /> Jack Mercer, known as the voice of Popeye, speaks here for two very different characters, old Mr. Bumble & Swat the Fly. Movie Mavens should be able to catch veteran voting actors Pinto Colvig & Mae Questel, both in unsaved roles. <br /> <br /> The movie has some nice songs provided by Hoagy Carmichael and Frank Loesser, of which "My Little Baby Bumble Bee" is the best known. "We are the couple in the castle" is a fine romantic show that needs to be rediscovered. <br /> <br /> It is unfortunate that the original animation of the movie, with deletion from heaven and beyond the in depth New York skyline, was obscured by the opening credits.
