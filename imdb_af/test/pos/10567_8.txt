This movie is definitely one of the best of its kind. A Victrion age story of love, and, grit. The depth of his story line is one that will stir and hate the inner most emotions of love. With some very interesting twists, this is a movie for not only lesbian audiences, but for all viewers. I can't say much more, or I'll spoil the experience for a new, young audience who might just come out. Another good job for Sarah Waters. It's also a great way for Sally Hawkins to win over audiences, who only get a brief overview of her talent in another work by Sarah Waters, in "Tipping the Velvet". It's also a must see.
