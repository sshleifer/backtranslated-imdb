Okay, so I love foolish movies. If you enjoy clumsy sci-fi movies, over the top movies, or if you're a fan of Mr. Bruce Campbell, I will see this movie. This movie is all I wanted it to be. To be a fan of the top movies, apply it to the account. Every time I thought myself, "this movie would be the sillest, best movie ever if * white * would happen ..." then I would just * think * like * it. It's a wonderful stupid "b" movie. If you're a fan of Campbell, I'd say "see it", bring your friends, laugh at it. It's fun. It's not classic, or anything, but if it's a night on TV, watch it. It has become a movie for me that I would find under "careless movies". Movies that may not be good, but after a hard day of work, I could come home and watch. (This list also includes harold and kumar in a white castle, 'army of darkness' and 'unbearable cruelty') br /> <br /> If you feel like an overhead, wonderfully slightly bad movie, watch it. if not, go rent "Bubba Ho-teep"
