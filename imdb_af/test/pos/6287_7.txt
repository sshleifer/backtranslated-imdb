I've been through several Pauly Shore movies, but that's the only one I wanted. Of course, it helps to be much less irritating than usual, perhaps even a bit similar. The rest of the film has a good job, especially underestimating Carla Gugino. The movie itself is basically a harmless and stupid comedy, and although few of the jokes are especially funny, the movie is total entertainment.
