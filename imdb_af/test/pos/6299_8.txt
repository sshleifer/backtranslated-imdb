Someone in these councils indicated that the whole thing was dreamed by the best friend of the protagonist, even though it was a friend he hadn't seen for 20 years. I am reluctant to give it up, but it does bring viable questions. Why would a phone engineer - or a shoe seller or butcher for that matter - want to create a mythical world and weave it into a friend who populates it with a set of equally mystical supporting characters? With an imagination so good to write to the friend, do not dream. Dream or not ANY, and the obvious candidate is director Paolo Sorrentino, has created a very viewable world in which Tony Servillo makes silence a fine art. We are asked to believe that Titta La Girolomo (Servillo) a few years before we met him and Titta La Girolomo (Servillo) a "virtual prisoner" in a small Swiss hotel after which he went to a local bank every week management With a suitcase containing nine miles in used notes. Unlike this weekly trip, he is free to do as he likes and is what he likes, is smoking, playing cards with a man who is cheating and a woman who reminds the man how far they fell socially and ignores the friendly reviews of Olivia Magnani, who spent two years grabbing a smile and / or a "good night" from him. For reasons that are best known for themselves and which are inconsistent with a man who is not interested in anything or anyone, Servillo spends a stethoscope on the wall of his bedroom every day and listens to the private conversations of his card games partners. . Eventually he responds to Magnani - he has to do it or they won't be a movie. It's plot 6f: the one about Destry, who never wears a gun, or Sean (Duke Wayne), the 'Quiet Man' who refuses to show up and fight to the mandatory scene where the gun is tied and chased the fists - But instead of experiencing himself with a polite come sting oggi, he removed 100 000 from the suitcase and bought a car. The final contradiction takes place when Magnani tells him she'll pick him up at her car at 4pm the next day and they'll drive into the mountains to celebrate his birthday. We found out she was living locally, so why did she drive away from somewhere, ignoring a police roadblock to drive off the road and turning the car over, anyone's guessing. These inconsistencies remain a fine piece of filmwork with excellent head performance and a very good supporting one.
