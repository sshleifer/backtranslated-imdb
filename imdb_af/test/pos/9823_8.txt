Like many others, I was attracted to the combination of Pollack, Ford and Scott-Thomas. I enjoyed the work of Pollack and Ford at Sabrina, a well-made film and a careful rewriting of the old material. When I heard that this movie was in production, I ordered and read the book. Immediately it turned out that it would be a harder story to film. The characters are not always sympathetic, there is little or no humor and the author makes very short shortcuts to focus on his main theme: because each one will see the other as the only one sharing the unique combination of loss and betrayal. , the adulteress's totally astonished wife, will find each other out. In addition, he imagined that the resolution could come through a bitter exploration of the hidden lives of the adulterers and that this "thick and thin" experience could give a deeper love than each one had before. Although much of the book deals with their bitterness and their hatred of their former partners, eventually acceptance and forgiveness are found. The film script only retains the air crash and spouses' shared problem. Where the woman is the research agent in the book, this is the man in the film and the woman is never a willing fellow researcher. The movie features a completely new dramatic subplot for Harrison Ford, which is even more confronted with the double accident of the air crash. The women's "re-election congresswoman" is also new, but it works better. Audience's expectations of pure romance or romantic comedy cannot be satisfied, as this story focuses on a very bitter pill. However, where the book reaches a solution and forgiveness, the burden of bitterness of the reader is lifted and the lifetime allowed. There is no corresponding moment in the movie. Although forgiveness is never addressed, we must assume that healing following a shooting is double. Ford's character doesn't have to be such an unconditional man with few words and Scott-Thomas's accent change is a bit disturbing. This film is not the dead loss suggested by others. However, this is a difficult movie to appreciate because the rewriting and customization of the screen is lower than the standard previously passed by the director.
