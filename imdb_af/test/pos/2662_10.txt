This movie is definitely one of the greatest films ever made. It's a story that is told at a steady pace, mostly not by words, but by cinematic means of expression. The perfect combination of spectacular special effects and classical music brings vibrant creations of human imagination in a realistic and poetic way. The story itself is fairly simple at first glance. As the title suggests, there is an archetype journey, a motif repeated thousands of years. This motive has always been used to portray not only a journey in space and time, but also a rich philosophical meaning. The film is a poetic view of the most exciting eternal questions. It is not just an odyssey of a person; it is an odyssey of our species. The film is in itself excellent, but in my case the impression will always be mixed with that of the book. I read it at the age of 10, and I really don't think of issues such as 'what is the relationship between human evolution and human morality development'. But the impression was big enough to drop me the whole genre of science fiction. <br /> <br /> The day I learned "2001" has only special effects, Oscar, and is not even nominated for the Best Picture, was the day when "Academy Award" became two words that nothing to me.
