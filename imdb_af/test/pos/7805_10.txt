There are a few movies that are loved by almost everyone. Andaz Apna Apna, an intelligent and hilarious comedy falls into that category. For a while, an Indian director kept the audience's sensitivity in mind and didn't characterize Kader Khan's stereo-typical hoax. The movie is about two guys dreaming of wealth and trying to reach it by cheating a millionaire's daughter. A humorous drama unfolds while many complexities occur in the story. The complexities add to the mere comedy of the whole plot. Aamir Khan plays the street-smart man, while Salman Khan gives an unexpectedly good performance as the stupid man. The villian played by Paresh Rawal, and his henchmen, Junior Ajit and "Kaliaa" let you sleep in your sleep. Although the movie is borrowed from many other movies, despite a rogue camera, and despite being "hard", it remains one of the rare "funny" movies. Bombay originated after movies like Padosan, Golmal and other Amol Plaekar movies. . It's sad that it didn't do well at the box office, as it means producers are turning back to formulas and leaving creativity.
