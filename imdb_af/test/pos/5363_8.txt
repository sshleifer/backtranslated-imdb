Just before World War II, it is a pleasant and understated romantic story loosely based on an actual event. <br /> <br /> It's about a German rocket scientist Gerhart Zucher (Ulrich Thomsen) working in Britain in the Second World War. While Hitler fears him, he can call him back to Germany to help him prepare for war. Zucher and his smooth assistant Heinz (Eddie Marsan) are evacuated by British authorities to a remote Scottish island. They are appointed to build a rocket mailbox that will allow islanders to communicate with the continent. <br /> <br /> The islanders live by the local girl, Catherine Mackay (beautiful Shauna MacDonald), with whom Thomsen has a relationship, but complications arise when Germany calls ... <br / > <br /> The central novels between Zucher and Catherine played subtly and sincerely, and the supporting role is a colorful bunch with an array of respected Scottish character characters, including Gary Lewis and Clive Russell. <br /> <br /> Fine cinematography and a brilliant central theme song sung in the local dialect. To film this movie. <br /> <br /> Intelligent but inexorable, It's good for a quiet evening.
