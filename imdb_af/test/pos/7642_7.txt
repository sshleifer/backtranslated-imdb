Like a winding country road, "Tough Luck" the viewer takes a ride. There is nothing wrong with plot curves, as long as credibility does not fly out of the window. Unfortunately, the film discontinues the obedience of the audience. Yet it is easy to forgive this mistake due to the superior acting character development and wonderful carnival atmosphere. Don't like any characters. Armand Asante, Norman Redus and Dagmara Dominczyk play shady artists, not exactly the kind of person who is easily admired. The double crosses come fast and furious, and the last cross is a bit of a stretch. Recommended. - NOTE
