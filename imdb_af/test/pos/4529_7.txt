This is the thirteenth Falcon movie. Tom Conway did not lose any of his humor and style and did not show signs of fatigue. The film has a very satisfying story, with many red herring, suspects and ladies. Madge Meredith is the good girl of the story, she plays it adequately, but does not set the screen on fire. Myrna Dell is a bad girl, and she sits on an excellent rocky ground, with agile eyes, and you are just waiting for her to kill as many people as possible to encourage herself. Edward Brophy is back as Goldie the sidekick, but surprised surprise, his manic overtaking strike stopped and he is actually under control. It is a good tribute to William A. Berke's legal acumen, who has done so many Westerners, he was probably not prepared to take any nonsense of a Brooklyn dummy. The result is that Brophy is packed enough for the first time, possibly in his career, to actually add something to a movie, rather than trying the patron's patience with the annoying behavior of a delayed but illegal six-year-old. . It all goes well together and is thoroughly entertaining.
