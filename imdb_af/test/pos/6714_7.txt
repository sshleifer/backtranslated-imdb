No, "Life Force" is not a good movie. <br /> <br /> It's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> However, this is an average movie with some good effects and a compelling storyline (and of course Mathilda Mei). It can actually be one of my favorite SF / horror flicks for the very simple reason they are trying to save their way through the science of space vampires. How often do you see it? Not even in "Alien" (the SF / horror flick of all time) science comes into the story. In "Power of Life" they try to make an unreasonable world for reason. <br /> <br /> Now, do I think it's successful? No. I think the movie has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that Hooper is collecting and keeping on track and that viewers should focus on more than one "villian" and there is one too many outings. <Br /> <br /> To be honest, the movie is eye-candy and fun to watch. but there is great potential here for a better remake to hold on which Hooper is trying to do and really create a strong, frightening, SF / horror movie. <br /> <br /> If the remake does happen, I demand that Mathilda have a cameo.
