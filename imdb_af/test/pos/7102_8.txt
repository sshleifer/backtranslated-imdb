I liked House of Dracula much more than Frankenstein's house. Carradine is much more acceptable and its play is not as ridiculous and overboard as in COURT. The actors deliver solid enough performances. The subplots (eg, the monster, the townspeople, the village idiot, the sister union nurse, etc.) are well mixed so that no one becomes a strange splinter as in the court. Better run than the merged court. The hunchback nurse is as nice as the hunchback in court. The doctor is very good. Also, Lon Chaney adds a classic touch to his wolfman. Worth watching twice. A classic universal horror with those typical 1940s, long lost flair. Especially good is the doctor's performance before / after his blood is contaminated with Dracula's.
