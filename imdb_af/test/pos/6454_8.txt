I watched this movie last night at a "pre-code" film festival, and I must tell you that when Gary Cooper turned his head for his intimacy, the whole audience took hold. He was just as beautiful. <br /> <br /> Cooper's appearance, this film shows Rouben Mamoulian's legal philosophy to perfection. Wonderful scenic blur, creative camera angles, symbolic touches - Mamoulian continues to explore director media and innovate. <br /> <br /> It was Sylvia Sidney's first role in Hollywood, following her success in New York. stage, and she is just as nice as a Gary Cooper leading lady. It's nice to see her in a role with a harder edge than many she's given - so often she or she seems scared she's about to be hit by someone. <br /> <br /> There are many familiar faces in this movie, including the wonderful Wynne Gibson. The most notable is Guy Kibbee, the best known for playing fat rich men, as a grumpy and brave hit. <br /> <br /> There are not nearly enough of these pre-code movies available on VHS or DVD, so if you can't find a pre-code festival near you, try Turner Classic Movies for a broadcast! What the judge thinks Gary Cooper was too stupid to have dialogue more complex with "Yep" or "No," he may have to consider Coop's performance in films such as "Mr Deeds Goes to Town" or "Meet John Doe" . Although heaven knows somebody who approves it, don't be smart either.
