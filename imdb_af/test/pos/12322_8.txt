A beautiful movie. They just don't make them like this anymore! We begin in the early part of the 20th century on an upper middle class family in Dublin. They offer a Christmas dinner for their friends and family. Their table talk is just a limb, but it's so well written that one is busy. Away from the table top, a beautiful piano play helps create an intimate atmosphere as if one of the guests were. Perhaps a little too perfect for an amateur player, the strange mistake here and there would have contributed to the magic of this movie. No real story, but real entertainment and an object lesson for emerging filmmakers.
