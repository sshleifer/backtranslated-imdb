Eisenstien's Potempkin, (Bronenosets Potyomkin), is one of the best films ever made and possibly the best of the quiet era. Eisenstien was a pioneer of film form and his use of editing editing influenced movies to this day. The Odessa steps massacre footage is as powerful today as it was when it was only seen 70 years ago. Don't get the chance to watch this movie!
