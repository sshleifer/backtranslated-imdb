Beginning in 1942, the Sherlock Holmes character, depicted by Basil Rathbone, settled in the then 'modern' Britain. Many Holmes purists produced the first two entries in the series (manufactured by FOX), but released the 12 features that followed. For one, I was never an avid reader, so I appreciate these movies as they are without any prejudice. In fact, the establishment of the Second World War for this entry places it as a time of British propaganda in the whole film. The performance of the modern Holmes is handled with much more care than the previous entry (Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror) and compensates much better for two reasons. First, Roy William Neil is about to launch (and will be for the rest of the series), and the second, although Holmes is deployed against the Nazis, makes the inclusion of Prof. Moriarty felt this feeling more like a battle of mind between two rivals. Lionel Atwill's performance has been criticized by many as far inferior to that of George Zucco and Henry Daniel, but I feel as though it is more of a font than the character layout. Especially after being seen, Atwill was able to be much more diverse and enthusiastic in other horror roles. Basil Rathbone on the other hand is extraordinary in this entry. He looks like himself in the role of Holmes, but for that I owe the writing. For example: The launch of Holmes in the Voice of Terror is trying hard to determine immediately how wonderfully intelligent Holmes is on the screen, while this movie shows Holmes's brilliant deductions, but also its shortcomings. Even in the climax, Holmes initially prevailed, only then did his blood drain slowly from his body. Now there are some mistakes in this movie that I thought I could point to. First the opening; Are the Germans Not To Fail? Maybe it's just me, but the book seller just fake in the bar, says he'll get Tobel to not even hide his door for weeks, but let him come and go with him? What !? Secondly, Tobel certainly seems to put everyone at risk. Leave the secret bomb parts with genius scientists. Leave the note with his fiancee. Like what does he think? He threatened them all. I thought he was this wonderful scientist trying to save England? And it's not the whole concept of 'use it on them before they use it on us' a bit harsh. Clear propaganda. Third, how in God's name was Holmes supposed to fit into the bottom of the chest? It's really small! In fact, the whole performance of Holmes who finds Moriarty in the ex-con disguise doesn't explain him so well. I have seen this movie well over fifty times and there are still parts like this that I find very confusing. Fourth, okay, so Holmes finds out that the first three scientists were dead, and immediately assumed that Moriarty could not know the name of the fourth man, because he had not yet died. Well, if Holmes doesn't know the name, how can he accept it? The man could have been very good at a more face. Happy guess. Fifth, again with the confusion. When Holmes presumably dies at Moriarty's operational table, how can he recover so fast? He worked as if he had lost some pints of blood, but not enough to stop him from saving the day. Despite these mistakes, it is a highly entertaining movie. The disguise was well done, the secret of the dancing men was well done (especially the back-to-back screens of Holmes and Moriarty who found out they had analyzed them) and Dennis Hoey as inspector Lestrade is always a plus. And as a final note, the interrogation scene is quite difficult for me, I always thought it was one of the most sought after rows in the whole movie. Overall, this movie holds a special place with me, because it was the one that strengthened my Rathbone as Holmes obsession. A classic. 10/07.
