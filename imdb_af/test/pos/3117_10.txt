What can you say about a short film filled with secondary actors and no stars, with absolutely no bad performances, not one poorly rendered dialogue, and with the cold violence on the one balanced by the warm heart of The protagonists in the story? <br /> <br /> It's a gem, a diamond, a small precious gem of a western calling the spirit and legend of the American West. A West that is not arranged by wholesalers such as Hickock or Cody or Masterson or Earp, but by spreading the everyday man and woman, farmers and farming hands, traders and miners and carpenters, whores and bartenders, and day entertainers. for wealth, some for peace and quiet, some for religious freedom. <br /> <br /> It may be a very spiritual story, although it does not promote any particular religion, because even the non-Mormon cowboys are portrayed by Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. The story, regardless of religious affiliation and beliefs, goes out of their way to promote tolerance and charity when the wagon train comes across stranded medicine shows. And in true biblical ways, such as David and Goliath or Samson and the Philistines, they are the guardians who are sent to the wagon train that eventually has to go with the evil carnal Clegg tribe, bringing them to the serpent in the Garden of Eden. , and regret what it is, they must do afterwards. It's a lovely folklore story from the West that hits every target John Ford aspires to. <br /> <br /> Currently, I have a western Santa whose red outfit is covered with a denim dressing gown, whose red hood is being replaced. by a colored Stetson, who wears a cherry bag of gifts and a rope string. At my Father's Day I added a Winchester rifle with a sling to put on one of his shoulders and a Colt turret. When people at the office ask why my Santa should wear guns, I just answer: "Snakes!" After all, isn't the spirit of the Christmas season one where everyone should get what they deserve? <br /> <br /> Fifty-five years later, especially after 911, the philosophies and attributes demonstrated by the characters and story of this movie are still as relevant today as they were at the time.
