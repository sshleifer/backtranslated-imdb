As I watched "Wirey Spindell", I couldn't laugh at what happened on the screen. Wirey probably played a lot of both boys and women, but I was confused about why the actor did Wirey in H.S. played. was 10 years old. Then the actor changed age to play 20 like Wirey when he was a senior in HS ... but whatever, I thought it was funny.
