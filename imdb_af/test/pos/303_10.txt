I always loved the ironic symbolism and brilliant cinematography of Coppola's masterpiece. I was fortunate to meet Martin Sheen outside the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium one night in 1981, as he was waiting for Charlie and Emilio to leave a concert. He was very humble about the praise I shared with him for this artwork, especially his portrayal of the young Captain. This is undoubtedly a must see, a full 10 and an important part of American Film History. Not Charlie Surf. Robert Duvall's famous line (the other one) does not have to be repeated, as it has become an often-repeated national anthem and his Pattonian character will be remembered for a long time as a classic American angle of war in the John Wayne tradition. It is a surprise to see how young Laurence Fishburne looks.
