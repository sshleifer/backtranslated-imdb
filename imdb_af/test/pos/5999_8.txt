Swift's socialism and pacifism come through all chances in this well-renewed remake. (Did you know there is no hyphen to "good"? Fact.) He meets war miniaturies, socialist giants, philosophers-in-the-clouds (literally) and pacifist horses ruling over Yahoo - almost neanderthal humanoids. (Is that where "yahoo" came from?) We also meet the brave Dr. Bates, the dedicated Mary Gulliver, the sweet and dedicated son Thomas, and the full cast of a truly terrible 19th century mad asylum. Suspension of unbelief comes easy, and our 7 and 12 year old girls enjoy it as much as my husband and I. (Sorry for the length, IMDb needs 10 lines.)
