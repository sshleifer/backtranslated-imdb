When I first saw the movie, I was both surprised and a little shocked by the blatant vibration of the story. It's a very artistic drama with amazing special effects, spectacular acting, not to mention a very good job in the makeup section. Jennifer Lopez created herself from the past that dug her role in this career. He portrayed a very sensitive child psychologist who works with a team of engineers to treat the thoughts of comatose patients to treat them. Vincent D'onofrio played incredibly well. His depiction of a sadistic serial killer was perfect for a T. The mere emotion conveyed by his performance is amazing. Vince Vaughn is not my favorite, but still extremely good. The symbolism and artworks were intriguing and titillating, sometimes surprising, and shocking at other times. Overall, I say it's a great movie, with great acting and beautiful artwork.
