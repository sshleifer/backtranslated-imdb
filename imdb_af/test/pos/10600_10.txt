One word for that. Hilarious. I haven't been watching such a movie for a long time. At points in the movie, I totally forgot it's a movie, I just felt like I was back to watch Viva La Bam, or even to say, my own friend is going through something like that. It was realistic and I liked how Bam, Ryan, Raab, Rake and Brandon and the rest of the guys didn't really try to act. They, like me, were just like their famous idiot. There were a few scenes that I loved more than others, like Raab in the shower, holy, I laughed so loudly. He was honestly probably my favorite character besides Bam's. He really made the movie a little more hilarious, in my opinion. It's basically a must see for any CKY fans:]
