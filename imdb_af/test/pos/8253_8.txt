Pretty! It never seems to be a masterpiece, but it is a small jewel of British comedy in the late seventies. Given that the producers wanted to sell it overseas, it's an American (late character actor Richard Jordan), but he's not the usual dull Hollywood hunk type. Surrounding him is the cream of British character acting talent, led by a wonderful waspish and superior David Niven. <br /> <br /> Of course, Niven's Ivan the Terrible gets the best one liners and all the best reaction shots. He also drives surprisingly threatening and intimidatingly dangerous. The moment in the snooker club when he drops and threatens the beautiful facade, Richard Jordan will come as a shock to the viewers who think of Niven as just a light room comedy star. He is full of true power and ruthlessness, as we see everything Ivan deserves his nickname. More and more surprising was how sick Niven was at the time. Shortly after filming this production, he lost his speech ability to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (known as Lou Gehrig's disease). This is the last photo Niven made where you can hear his own voice, which is then called by the comic impressionist Sid Caesar. <br /> <br /> With him you can see many well-known faces from the seventies movie and television. Every summer (blazing her breasts in the seventies, politically wrong bimbo mode), Oliver Tobias, Michael Angelis, Brian Croucher, Davy Kaye, etc. Etc. Davy Kaye gets one of the biggest laughs because he is holding a security guard caught to make a phone. call. "Who are you calling ?! .... Bloody Dial-A-Disc! You gormless git!" <br /> <br /> Great shots of London street stands; make the movie a patina time capsule of red phone boxes with chunky round-dial manual, black taxis powered by "Cor blimey, gov!" cockroaches, and ladies and gentlemen who model all kinds of deep-dodgy late-seventies retro-dress and hairstyles. <br /> <br /> Unlike the classic Ealing earlier era comedies, the "hero" can get away with his crime and escape after a life in the sun. How times have changed! The code of morality according to which crooks in film were always to be punished was long ago in the seventies, with anti-heroes such as Pinky Green earning status through their zealous anti-authoritarianism and determination to establish a snoek on a stuffy capitalist of suitable vetkat businessmen. We are encouraged to be cheerful because Pinky is unpunished and free as a bird with its poor performances. Compare it to the end of The Lavender Hill Mob! <br /> <br /> Very entertaining, beautifully dated in its fashions and attitudes, and the things late night cultures see. Ideal to watch after midnight after the bars have closed; If you are of a certain age, you are nostalgic, and you always wanted to see David Niven in a McDonalds branch, and silently intimidated an American using a retractable telescope!
