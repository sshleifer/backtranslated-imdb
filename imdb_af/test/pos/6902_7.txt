This movie was fun if it was across the board. <br /> <br /> It follows mainly the comic skirt of two tombs in England of the 19th century, moving from conventional body throws to trading vampires, zombies and death Roswell. strangers. (I have no idea what the Roswell alien did there, nor the producers.) <br /> <br /> But was it funny? You bet. Even Ron Perlman, who is often the coast from Direct to DVD Death, was pretty good at this one as a priest who apparently is the forerunner of a competitive gang of bodies. <br /> <br /> A real joy to watch this hilarious little movie, and a good example of what you can do if you have no bigger than life egos on either side of the camera.
