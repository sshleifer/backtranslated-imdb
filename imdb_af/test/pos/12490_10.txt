In the first place there is a detective story: 'legitimate défense' by the Belgian Stanislas André Steeman, whose 'Assassin Habite au 21' Clouzot was transferred to the screen in 1942, along with Pierre Fresnay and the same actress, Suzy Delair. about Clouzot's adaptation for both movies. The 1942 movie was excellent, but the "detective story" side was preserved, so why complain? As for Claizot, Clouzot was now in a new phase of his brilliant career. He had "le corbeau" directed and blacklisted, and he had much more to say than a simple whodunit. Setageman basically complained about the poor detective who was eventually not disclosed, but Clouzot focused on social vignette on his characters' psychology, and he did not give a damn about the puzzle of Agatha Christie. He became the true predecessor of CLaude Chabrol, who has always been closer to him than to Alfred Hitchcock, whom he has admired a lot. Suzy Delair has a big screen presence, and you'll love the song she's really singing (she was also a singer) 'avec son tralala'. Bernard Blier, as always, spares gestures and vocabulary, and he really pulls it off. Two characters are especially interesting and disturbing: the first one, Dora, the photographer: she takes photos of female models, and Clouzot, with subtle touches, Let's see she is a lesbian. Of course the word is never pronounced in 1947?) The police chief (fabulous Louis Jouvet) tells her, "You and I, we are not happy with women." The portrait of this policeman is very detailed: we learn a lot about him, not necessary. With the Delair / Blier plot: he is a widow, with a boy he worships and who runs into school problems, especially in geometry. So we learn all the characters in depth. One of the most important manifesto of the post-war French theater. .
