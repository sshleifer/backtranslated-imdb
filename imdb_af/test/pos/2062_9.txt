I didn't plan to leave a review, but to see some of the other horrible reviews for this movie, I had to say something. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to give the end, anything, but in this review I give some important plot points, so be aware. The short (non-spoiler) version of my review - Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis both kicks in this movie, and it's great fun. Look at it. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites of all time. Geena Davis is perfect as the action heroine, torn between her existing life as a housewife and mother, and the memories of her past life as a CIA Assassin. Her performance is excellent, as she plays both facets of this relatively complex character perfectly. <br /> <br /> As always, Samuel L. Jackson's performance is excellent, as the private investigator who hired Geena Davis's character to look at her forgotten past. play its tough character. Some of the lines he performs in this movie are the best he ever used in any movie he was in. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you haven't seen it, do it. It is a fantastic story with many unexpected turns and turns, and it is extremely well-directed and actionable.
