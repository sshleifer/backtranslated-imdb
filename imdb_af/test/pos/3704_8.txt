Mom has to be one of the most uncomfortable movies to watch all the time. It features an elderly lady you will love if your Nanny becomes the most beautiful mom you'll ever meet in a dark night! <br /> <br /> This dinner Nanny eats the inside of a young lady at the opening of the movie and it gets worse as it goes on. A cross between the crying and the brain seems dead to be described to Mum! <br /> <br /> A possibility for horror fans who have the stomach for it (if you watched re-animator or brain-dead, it will float your boat) and are ready to switch off the brain for an hour or so ... Let the gore throw! ... 8/10
