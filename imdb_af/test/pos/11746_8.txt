This movie immediately catches the eye, with the atmospheric airways of a very beautiful Hong Hong. Filmed in the rich colors of 1950s movies that modern blockbusters never look like. Probably a sign of those times, because it is not a high-powered, seen all before the film, full of devastation and violence. However, the devastation and violence are in the background with thousands of refugees trying to get out of China. It is a very moving and compelling story, full of hope and love in a tragic time, in recent history. The story of two people from different cultures falls in love. And building them trying to overcome them is the heart of this very fine and moving film.
