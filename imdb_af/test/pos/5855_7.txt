Cassie (Sandra Bullock) is a hyper-serious police detective. As an ex-boyfriend once tried to kill her and indeed left her seriously wounded, she was determined to bring those who harm others to justice. Due to her near-death experience, Cassie also has one-night stands and no one trusts. One day a woman was found dead in the bush near Cassie's community. She was completely murdered, severely beaten and left alone to die. Of course, Cassie won't stop finding the killers. Dedicated to helping her is co-officer, Sam (Ben Chaplin). He quickly discovers Cassie's relentless attitude and overall instincts when asking him to retrieve a sample at the scene for analysis, among other actions. The route soon leads them to two high school students, Richard (Ryan Gosling) and Justin (Michael Pitt). Can these teens really be responsible for the planning and execution of the perfect "joy" kill? It's an intriguing movie, but viewers should be warned that the subject is indeed grim. Death for its "sport" is rarely the subject of films that are of the "all sweetness and light" variety and this one is no different. That said, the throw is great. Bullock, without a hint of her comedy talent, is awesome as the police officer whose own past forces her to close the evil people of the world. Chaplin is also pretty pretty like the detective who both lured and repelled by the powerful Cassie. As for Gosling, he gives a memorable performance as a brilliant mind with a satanic soul. The movie's production value is also good, with fine costumes, settings and photography. If you're a fan of Bullock, you're looking for a laugh, it's not the one for you. But if you worship mysteriously, even those with the worst of the plots, you'll find this story surprising.
