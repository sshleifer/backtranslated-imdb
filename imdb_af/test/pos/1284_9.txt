Or maybe it gives Bill someone to look after and care for and be responsible for himself? Bill has a simple rule that he follows religiously when he follows someone: after you have followed him or her to their home or workplace, you stop. <br /> <br /> One day, Bill Cobb, Alex Haw, comes home and instead of following his line of downtime, he still follows Cobb.

Compared to "Momento's" which was once confusing and when you realized what the movie is telling you, this backward story is very complicated. What makes "Reason" so much better is just because it's simple, but at the same time brainy in it affects those who watch it. The movie is much more direct and devastating and you don't have to watch it over and over to get just what it is trying to tell them like "Momento". "Follow" is a story in a story within a story with one of the most surprising as well as the manipulated end, if you watch the movie again and see the clues you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> Made with an incredibly small budget of $ 6,000.00, it's less than most Hollywood movies budget for coffee breaks, with a black and white name and just over an hour, 71 minutes long. . Hollywood as well as the Hollywood movie industry can learn a lot from Chris Noland in how anyone with nothing more than talent and imagination can reach millions of dollars in most cases; makes an intelligent and at the same time intrusive film with nothing in money and no big name stars.
