Duchess is a beautiful white cat who lives with her three kittens in her rich owner's house in Paris. When the evil butler hears that the rich old lady leaves everything in her will to the cats, the butler is angry because he wants to get everything first. So he puts them to sleep and leaves them from the side of the road. When the cats wake up, they start on a long draft house. A street-wise cat named Thomas O'Malley meets them and offers to help them. When Edgar saw them coming home, he was furious and began to post to Timbucktu. But Thomas's friends come to help save the day. The rich woman decides to leave her house for every alley cat in Paris. <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie. The songs, including "Everyone wants to be a cat", are lively and optimistic. The voice story is excellent, with Eva Gabor (who will later play Miss Bianca in Disney's The Rescuers movies) as duchess, Phil Harris (Baloo in the JUNGLE BOOK, Little John in ROBIN HOOD) as Thomas, who are interesting characters to their characters give. Presumably, Walt Disney, before he died in 1966, gave the film the cutting edge. Recommended for Disney fans or cat lovers everywhere! 10/10.
