The problem with the other role players in Dorian Gray is that they were too old for the part (Hurd Hatfield, Helmut Berger, Josh Duhamel, David Gallagher, Ben Barnes) or that they couldn't draw the English aristocratic way. without being stylized. Dorian is the eternal 19-year-old (or so), all the milky skin and honey'd locks described by Wilde. The challenge is to find an actor who has the maturity and extent of the part (ie who can portray the naivety, recklessness and manipulation), but at the same time it looks like someone in his late teens. And Peter Firth puts it all off in this excellent British TV adaptation. <br /> <br /> Yellowheads like Henry Wotton, while being much older than Wild had in mind, do wonders with his scenes. Wild's aphorisms have never sounded like that. of course and casual. Especially George Sanders in the 1945 version was fairly vague in comparison (and his costume didn't fit). <br /> <br /> Finally, Jeremy Bratt Basil, as the most masculine and at the same time the most gay of the trio, again plays an appropriate interpretation. Generally, the movie contains enough gay subtext without gay Dorian. He is all things to all people and presumably there is no drug or sexual perversion that he has not tried in the 18 years covered by the story, but it makes him more narcissistic. as homosexual. He looks equally devastating on both sexes, as he says according to the novel. <br /> <br /> Of course, the budget for this production wasn't very big, so everything feels a bit stiff. Especially Dorian's encounter with Sybil's brother suffers from the obvious studio appearance. Dorian's last shot (a puppet I suppose) in his white mushroom makeup is also more hilarious than convincing and Basil's death scene is accidentally funny. (As far as I remember, Basil had to be seated at the table.) <br /> <br /> But that's all a very worthy adjustment. I'm sure Wild would have liked it. The only thing missing is the sensual side. Not so many sex scenes, but Wilde's decadent world of fragrant flowers, luxury patches and precious jewels is not really explored here, ie aestheticism is completely lacking. But like "Claudius", the excellent play lets you easily forget about these deficiencies in production values.
