If you repeat a lie, is it enough to become the truth? 15 parking is the story of an alternative reality of a schizophrenic (Mithi). The film is about her search for her home at a fictional address where her imaginative husband and 5 children live. Aparna Sen is delivering another masterpiece. Every actor of the movie was better than the other. Konkona Sen looks incredibly convincing as a schizophrenic. She pulls out the role with such ease and maturity beyond her age. Shabana Azmi is incredible as usual. She plays the dominant and fiercely independent Mithi's older sister who cares for her sick and sick parent. She refuses to accept it, despite all her strength and courage, sometimes she sometimes feels lonely. It had to be a very easy movie for Rahul Bose. The role was the least demanding and anyone could have done the job. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie was the most surreal part of the whole park avenue experience. It took me a while to digest that movie ended. It left me confused and perhaps even disturbed a little. But later it started to sink. My eyes are black. But if everyone says they are blue, will I still believe she's black?
