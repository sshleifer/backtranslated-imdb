Visconti's masterpiece! I admit I am unfamiliar with many of his work, but I can't imagine his other work surpassing this fantastic movie. Last night, after an absence of about 25 years, I watched death in Venice and was completely enchanted by everything I saw. This fascination was a multi-element pastiche: The extraordinary shots directed by Visconte, mainly his love for long, cowardly shots of people who eat, swim, walk and have a significant character moving through this mass of people. the filmmakers' brilliant interpretation of Visconti's shooting selection; It is true: young people watching this movie for the first time should be aware that they are watching a unique look. film, a film that cannot be made in 2006. A film whose time rests in those short handfuls of the sixties and early seventies of last century when artistic licenses were passed to film directors and cashiers took secondary roles. As many of the recent IMDb commentators wrote, this film is in their opinion long, boring (too little action) and pretentious. I think of the standards of Hollywood porridge, this comment contains merit. Unfortunately they tragically reduce the wonderful beauty and depth of this work, and others keep it from those years. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Death in Venice, rent a copy and immerse yourself in a movie and story of another time. You will be rewarded.
