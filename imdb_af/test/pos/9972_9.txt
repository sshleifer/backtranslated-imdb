The inherent problem with any staging of 'The Merchant of Venice' has never been the pseudo-controversial anti-Semitism, but the fact that there are two story lines that are very different in different tones and content. a foamy romantic comedy and a tearing tragedy. While mixing genres, all the rage in the sixteenth century (and mocked by Shakespeare in Hamlet), it seldom succeeds in stirring with modern audiences. As a result, most directors are obliged to focus on one story at the expense of the other, and it is no surprise that the decision falls in favor of Shylock. <br /> <br /> Like so many Shakespeare's great tragic heroes, Shylock remains fascinating after 400 years because he is such a difficult and complex character. Bitter, proud, evil, shaky, weak, arrogant; his behavior simply denies analysis and is still argued. He is defective, not because he is a Jew, but because he is a man. Modern writers hardly write their creations with such rich-infested contradictions, and it is for everyone's benefit that we have Shakespeare to inspire. <br /> <br /> The Shakespeare language is wild and lost, saturated with multiple meanings, word play, and metaphor. To be understood, it must be immersed by an actor with the strength and knowledge to do so. When an actor fails, the words are thrown into a stream of incomprehensible words, but if he succeeds, the English language jumps to life with an immediacy and vitality that takes your breath away. Al Pacino is one such actor, and here shows an incredible level of order and control that there would be any justice in the offer. He meets the challenge of presenting Shylock's head and delivers an exceptionally subtle and nuanced performance. It will be a crime if we never get the opportunity to see what he does with King Lear. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is remarkable. Jeremy Irons is launching an original attack on the renowned Antonio, representing an older, quieter figure, displaying the unpredictable contradictions between medieval knights and ugly prejudice of the time. Josef Fiennes is a revelation, as he matures past superficial eyepieces to preserve a character one day. Lynn Collins is the only disappointment. Many of Shakespeare's wives are endorsed and require an actor to work really hard to bring them to life, and Collins Gwyneth Paltrow impersonation looks a little flat and unsuitable for the dark tone Radford intends. <br /> <br /> The design team must be recognized for creating a unique and thorough credible vision of Late Renaissance Venice. The city did not see this ominous as 'Do not Look Now'. With full advantage of existing locations and natural light, the film has an appearance of authenticity that is greatly enhanced by the dark and timber costume design. Both are worthy of recognition again. <br /> <br /> The financial fans of movies like this must be praised. With a $ 30 million budget, they have to go into such a business in full and certainty that they will never make a profit and yet they invest. We can all be grateful because the result is a remarkable adaptation that will surely be a measure for many years to come.
