"Un Gatto nel Cervello" / "Cat in the Brain" is one of the guriest horror movies ever made. There is a lot of blood and gore, including chain saw butchery, bloody stabbings and numerous decapitations. The film is also interesting as "self-parody" by Fulci, but the gore and violence is the key element of it. Some of the Gore FX have been taken from Fulci's own movies "Quando Alice Ruppe Lo Specchio" and "I Fantasmi di Sodoma" (both 1988), plus Gore FX taken from Fulci oversight "The Snake House" aka "Bloody Psycho" by Leandro Lucchetti, "Massacre" by Andrea Bianchi, "Non Avere Paura Della Zia Marta" by Mario Bianchi, "Non Si Sevizia i Bambini" by Giovanni Simonelli and "Luna di Sangue" aka "Fuga dalla Morte" by Enzo Milioni (all 1989 ). The scene where Brett Halsey pimped the woman's face is from "Quando Alice Ruppe Lo Specchio", a movie made by Fulci in Italian TV for 1988. The chain saw of the female body at the beginning is taken from the same movie, like the head in the microwave and the old tha you are driven over and over again. Highly recommended, especially if you want an extreme theater!
