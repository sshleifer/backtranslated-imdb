Cooley High is considered one of my best all time movies. It reminds me of the days of my youth that grew up in the cities of Cleveland and Chicago in the early, mid and late 1960s. What ever happened to Brenda and Pooter? There is one needed to keep the two off. Brenda for her beauty and Pooter for his innocent white. They both earn 31 years after recognition of this film. I think many of the fans of this movie would like to find out what happened to them, as well as others who performed in this fun movie. I definitely think that this movie should be entered into some sort of MOVIE HALL OF FAME. All the movie of this movie was wonderful. My opinion of "Cooley High" is the hands of time back, it was the fun years.
