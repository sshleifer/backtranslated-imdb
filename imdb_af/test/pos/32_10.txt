LACKAWANNA BLUES is a fine play by Ruben Santiago-Hudson and a finer film if the writer adapted his own life story for the screen. This brilliant movie ignores the screen with rich colors, fine music, brilliant editing, great direction by George C. Wolfe, and a movie so beautiful that they make an encore display compulsory! Yes, it's just as good. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the author's life as the child's "Junior" (Marcus Carl Franklin) who is in the incomprehensible home of psychic empathy Rachel "Nanny" Crosby (S Epatha Merkerson), " a lady who dedicated her life to helping the disenfranchised by transporting them from the south, from mental hospitals, and from the streets to Lackawanna, New York. The boy recalls all the lessons he learned about the lives of home residents - strange characters with painful passers-by - and the disintegration of his racially mixed biological family saved by Nanny. The many characters of the house are too much to sketch, but they are portrayed by some of the best actors in the business: Terrence Howard, Rosie Perez, Mos Def, the beautiful Carmen Ejogo, Louis Gossett Jr. Jeffrey Wright, Ernie Hudson, Charlayne Woodward, Jimmy Smits, Patricia Wettig, Macy Gray, Liev Schreiber, Kathleen Chalfant, Lou Myers, Hill Harper. The list goes on and on. <br /> <br /> During the film we are introduced to the atrocities of racism, the history of desegregation, the dynamics of drug abuse and violence, the infectious joy of African American music contributions to our musical culture and the courage from a fine woman who can eliminate all the difficulties facing the world to the dignity of those with whom she came into contact. S. Epatha Merkerson is completely submerged in this role, a role she shines as a beacon of reason in a world of chaos. She presents one of the most wonderful performances of the past year, and if this film was released in theaters instead of a HBO movie, she will undoubtedly add the Oscar to host her Golden Globe award. <br /> <br /> The whole role is exceptional and Wolfe handles the play and the story like a master: like riffs in a jazz piece, he sticks small moments of conversation with each character and Junior with flashy scenes from the story with the matrix of dance festivals at local clubs hopping over the top, with incredible blues, jazz, dance and joy. The production crew, with the utmost caution, mounted this little miracle of a photograph and never came a moment of the momentum of the story. Highly Recommended, Nearly Mandatory Look! Grady Harp
