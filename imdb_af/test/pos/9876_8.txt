It was a very interesting Halloween movie. I wasn't excited about the whole Thorn theory, but it still makes a good movie. I liked to see Tommy Doyle back, but unfortunately Donald Pleasance died after the shooting. The film had a really really bad director who didn't give the movie about the series, from what I heard, Donald treated badly. Danielle Harris won't be back if Jamie does. It's as if he just tried to bring down the movie, but I've always liked it. There were many cuts and music changes and if you are lucky, you can get the Producers Cut for over 40 minutes. of never before screens. With these scenes, it becomes a whole new movie. Check it out if you have the chance.
