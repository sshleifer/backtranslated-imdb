When Precious Bane was broadcast in America, I was amazed by this beautiful story. All the actors were brilliant; Clive Owen really understood the character he played. I immediately went to a bookshop and ordered the original novel, which is even nicer, and just came out of the book, just after I bought the book - although I've seen it online a few times now. I also hoped to win the Oscar by Janet McTeer and the great popularity of Clive Owen, the BBC will of course get this good production on DVD ... I can't believe all these years, we still have no DVD. It should be the only production ever created by the BBC. It is NOT for sale. Come on BBC - you have money to make our fans here. Please get it on DVD please!
