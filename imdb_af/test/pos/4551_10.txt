Peter Segal's 1995 commercial hit and now cult classic 'Tommy Boy' is a hilarious film, an evergreen entertainer. Chris Farley is a talent we will never forget !!! <br /> <br /> 'Tommy Boy' is a simple story, telling in the funniest and as much as possible. Farley & Spade takes a journey filled with unstoppable laughs, even the Rob Lowe section is damn funny. As a child I remember again and again Tommy Boy. It was from my childhood favorites, and it will always be happy. Even today when it comes to T.V, I like it as a naughty hard-going fan. I'm very possessive about this movie. <br /> <br /> Segal's direction is super. Chris Farley may have died in 1997, but at least stay alive for me. What an actor! Look at his work in 'Tommy Boy', he is very comfortable. He later performed fantastic performances in films like 'Berverly Hills Ninja' and 'Almost Heroes', but his work remains the best! Love you, Farley! Spade, on the other hand, is as good as ever. He is an excellent actor in every respect! <br /> <br /> 'Tommy Boy' rules .... 100 inches from this author!
