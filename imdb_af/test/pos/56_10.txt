Lackawanna Blues is so emotionally powerful in the portrayal of urban blacks during the 50's and early 60's. A culture of joy and sadness specifically for working class Blacks who exist outside the mainstream culture. The characters of Santiago-Hudson's game portrayed black individuals who live imperfect lives but retained strong positive values ​​of love, loyalty and honor. Although the characters moved away at times, they did not deny the importance of the values. Instead, they recognized and accepted their own imperfection and that of the other characters. , without judgment, passed through the life of "nanny". The central characters were strong and credible, the institutions were realistic and brought back personal memories of a passing era. Pre-integration urban life was a time of sensory drunkenness, sight, sound and smell, which can almost be experienced by watching the drama "Lackawanna Blues". I'll see it again.
