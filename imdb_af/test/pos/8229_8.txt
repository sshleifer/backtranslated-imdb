I read Ashton's comments and thought they should have looked at a completely different picture! <br /> <br /> I just watched the morning and was rather surprised. <br /> <br /> Addressing ashew's remarks: <br /> <br /> Trail Street is a very well done western. <br /> <br /> And Randolph Scott was a bit in it! <br /> <br /> Gabby Hayes was more beautiful than I ever saw him! <br /> <br /> The bad guys had very good appointments as far as I was concerned. <br /> <br /> Plus: <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see Robert Ryan straight ahead <br /> <br /> In everything, a good western, very well maintained and wrote. <br /> <br /> I like the background story of Kansas and the "winter" wheat it also helped become a state. <br /> <br /> I thought the girl Susan played has been beautiful - can't think why she didn't become a bigger star!
