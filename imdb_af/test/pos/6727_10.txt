I saw early in the early 90s early in the morning when I was about 12. I tried to find what it was and finally I did it today. I remember enjoying it and a little freaked out at the end when it was the tombstone of the young boy and his haunting face! Can't let anyone down if I can get a copy of this because I'd love to see it again. I remember that the child was trapped in a cornish tin mine and then became related to a boy. can't remember that the children were with miners, but had to be. The boy helps them out of the mine and seems to be the spirit of a boy who died while working there.
