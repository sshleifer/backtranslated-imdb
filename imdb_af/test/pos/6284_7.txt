I think it's Pauly Shore's best thing, he played the part perfectly. I really enjoyed this movie, Patrick Renna is really funny as Zack, the annoying little brother. Boy in law is a good comedy worth your time, but the only thing I wish Tiffany Thiessen was was the farm hunter instead of the one they had.
