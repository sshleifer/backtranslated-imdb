The 1990s movie with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger was praised, and I really enjoyed it, but this TV original is just as good and in some ways more appropriate. Claire Bloom is not very happy, but she is still confident and throws her cap on her favorite author (played by Joss Ackland in one of his best performances). Quieter, quieter and less emotional. as the Attenborough movie it can be, but it makes right what a wonderful play is full of meaningful dialogue. You will still cry to this version, but maybe you will not have the musical commands to set you up. <br /> <br /> There is room for both - and since I saw it on stage, I would say that Ackland / Bloom is a little more faithful. But they are both excellent.
