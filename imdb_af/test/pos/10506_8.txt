This movie will undoubtedly not go well with some, because most of the horror is mental. But it does have a little something for almost everyone, including some very abducted scenes with strangers. The film makes extensive use of alien abduction mythology, while also showing a little more intelligence about some facets of kidnapping myths than you would expect from a movie. Jillian McWhirter is excellent in what had to be a great achievement.
