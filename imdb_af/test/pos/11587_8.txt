The true story of a Spanish paraplegic, Ramón Sampedro, who fought for decades for the right to become euthenized. This film, along with the best picture winner of the same year, Million Dollar Baby, caused a stir that year with their portrayals of disabled people who desire death. Both advocates for the disabled and (unfortunately for the disability advocates) conservative pro-life groups protest both films, and their Oscar nominations. The nominations also came during the entire Terry Schiavo debacle, just to put it in a historical perspective. The protest, especially of the disability groups, against Million Dollar Baby makes sense? the film is clearly portrayed, without shaking, the life of a paraplegia as worthless. The film's central character, Maggie Fitzgerald, becomes a paraplegia, apparently no advice whatsoever, no help whatsoever and wants to die immediately. The film is honest, stupid and uncomplex. The sea inside, based on the true story, is certainly much more thoughtful about the subject. It probably brought in the same category as Million Dollar Baby, without even its protesters seeing it, an incredible general phenomenon. The movie gives time to many different sides of the argument. And it immediately states that the desire to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone. However, it is guilty of a few crimes, and I still understand why disability groups can have a problem with it. First, there is the chief's meeting with a paraplegic bishop. I don't look at the way he is portrayed. His orally-powered wheelchair is portrayed as absurd, and there is almost a comic sequence where his similar rodent servants drag him in his chair on the stairs. He can't even reach the room where Ramón is located, and one of the children's toys is forced to hold the conversation between them. I had to think, give, maybe if Ramón lived in a slightly more wheelchair-accessible household, he would not spend his whole life in bed, and life could be more fulfilled (who knows how the film portrays reality ). Director Amenábar (The Others) also features some laughable scenes that try to make this movie about suicide more life-pleasing, such as a cross-enlarged sequence in which Ramón looks thoroughly and his lawyer's baby is born. But besides a few ugly moments, the movie is very good. It hurts that someone might want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others. But eventually our lives belong to us. Shouldn't we have the right to choose? The movie's strongest asset is its supporting characters, and the actors they play. It shows how Ramón's struggle and decisions influenced those around him with beautiful precision. The family members in particular are wonderful, and Ramon's last departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking and tears me. My favorite show in the film comes from Lola Dueñas, which I also gave the best, or at least probably the most undervalued, performance in Almodóvar's Volver last year.
