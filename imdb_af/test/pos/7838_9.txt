I just saw a couple of eleven-hour episodes, but I must say they were enough to impress me. This series is just as impressive and interesting ... I will definitely follow it. <br /> <br /> First of all, I must say that the play is top notch. Patrick Stewart plays his character - Ian the scientist - credible and cool, and he lets the audience believe in the character. Other characters, such as Rachel, are also credible, and although they are sometimes a bit cold - due to the way the series is filmed - it's interesting. <br /> <br /> The stories told by this series are also interesting. For example, one of the episodes I saw was about cloning and a man trying to clone people. The way the episode was developed, and how Ian-Stewart - people's clues and salvation followed, was wonderful. In addition, it has made you think about ethics and how good or bad it can be. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think this is a good TV show. I just hope it goes that way - interesting, thought-provoking and with good acting. Even though it's filmed in a cold way - a bit of lightning, cold photography, lots of close-ups - it never ceases to be interesting. Highly recommended.
