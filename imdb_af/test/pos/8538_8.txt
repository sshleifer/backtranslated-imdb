Evil Ed is a Swedish film about a man named Ed (of course) and his total madness collapse after editing a series of B-horror films known as The Loose Limbs series. Ed gets so angry that he thinks he sees demons and monsters, but in reality it's people he knows and people who are close to him, like his wife and daughter. <br /> <br /> I first saw the movie first. 1998 and was amazed by what I saw. So far, this movie is considered one of the darkest comedies out there. Since the movie is almost stupidly funny with its gore screens, there are still some creepy moments. <br /> <br /> It's a cool movie, but don't expect anything wonderful. It's just a fun movie that's good to show your friends a little laugh. 8/10 stars
