This is probably a year since I saw Uzak, but it left strong memories to the two main characters, photographer Mahmut and his naive cousin of the village of Yusuf. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie with very little dialogue and a fairly limited plot. It apparently irritated a meager few viewers. But the film builds such a painfully credible portrait of Mahmut and Yusuf that there is just as much emotional tension as in the paciest thriller. <br /> <br /> Just to be clear, there is no padding in this movie - in the long breaks where nobody speaks so much in the characters' emotions (and yours, they look) as you can carry. Go see it awake and watch, and you will be addressed rather than numb. <br /> <br /> Uzak is true in so many ways, and sincerity is probably the greatest achievement. People do not struggle with events and problems, as much as with each other. In fact, throughout the film there is probably not one point where the main characters (Mahmut, Yusuf and Mahmut's ex-wife Nazan) are not opposed. <br /> <br /> Much of it is true all over the world: Yusuf's cousin's country's perhaps deliberate naive expectation is that a ship's work will fall into its lap; Mahmut's urbanized cynicism and reluctance to sympathize with Yusuf. <br /> <br /> Other truths are more specific to Turkey: Yusuf's misconception that Mahmut can endure his torn teeth, distorts Yusuf between macho ambition and widespread appearance when trying to get to know a woman. <br /> <br /> Uzak is undoubtedly a pretty pale film, and one of Ceylan's strengths is not to hit us over the head. themes he explores. For me, I completely believed in the behavior of his characters. All the little unsuccessful attempts to join and small atrocities are so true. And yet I did not leave with a message that "The world is so" but instead I have "This is how we sometimes treat each other."
