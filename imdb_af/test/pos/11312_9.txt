This movie was a riot, making fun of "Madonna - Truth Or Dare" in all the right places. I love Madonna and I love Julie Brown. How can I ask more. Julie's "Vogue" spoof, "Vague", was hysterical. "Kelly LeBrock thinks she's wonderful, she's just cold bowlers on a paper board." "Brooke Shields, Dawber, Pam personality of Spam" !! I could have been dead! And just wait until you see what she can do with a watermelon !!
