This is one of my favorite movies, EVERTER. I saw it about a million times and will never turn off the opportunity to see it again. In fact, I love it so much that I really wanted to check out the resort where it was filmed on my upcoming holiday ... does anyone know its name? If so, send me an email !!! I watched this movie for the first time when it was first released and I have about Nikki's age and for the longest time I've been bending my dad to take me away somewhere because of course I was expecting the same thing with me to happen! It's just such a wonderful environment and such a cute puppy love story. It's a definite DVD collector's must!
