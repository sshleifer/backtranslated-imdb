Imagine the "Dragnet" section where Friday and Gannon go in a typical 1970's hippie inequality, but instead of giving everyone a lecture, they get a few. It's "Joe" in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> This movie of a working class and a rich man who just killed his girlfriend's drug dealer's boyfriend, was very terribly dated and most of the supporting plays were styled, but it's still interesting to look. Peter Boyle, then about 35, plays Joe (the bigot), and he looks like James Gandolfini. In her film debut, Susan Sarandon plays the do-it-yourself daughter, and while not necessarily hinting at her future greatness, you can't take her eyes off her.
