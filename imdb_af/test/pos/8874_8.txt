You don't see the meaning of the title much later, but you get the point in the first few minutes. Danny DeVito, who also plays Owen / Ned 'Little Ned' Lift, is a terrific Hitchcock movie about one man's hate for his wife's book (she stole) and one man's hatred for his mother. In fact, Owen wants to be a good writer, such as his teacher Larry Donner (Billy Crystal), and he has been inspired by murder stories. Larry suggests he sees a Hitchcock movie, very ironic, and that is when Owen has the idea of ​​killing Larry's ex-wife Margaret (Star Trek Voyager's Kate Mulgrew). Owen is inspired by 'strangers on a train', to swap murders, so Larry Owen's horrible mom (Oscar and Golden Globe nominee Anne Ramsey) must kill. Larry was convinced that Owen had murdered Margaret, and that he wanted to kill Owen's Mum, but there is a happy ending when both Larry and Owen bring out books, Momma is of course dead and they have with Beth Ryan (Kim Greist). Also starring Rob Reiner as Joel and Oprah Winfrey. With hilarious moments, a good director / actor and his support, it's a must-see comedy. Very, very good!
