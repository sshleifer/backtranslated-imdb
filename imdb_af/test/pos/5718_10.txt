It was very energetic and well played. I saw it in 98 and my friends and I'm still joking about it. Every time I look, it's always as funny as the first. I also love the way everyone can handle it in their own particular way. I look forward to seeing more of John's own scripts and productions. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I can't find it anywhere, and I've been looking for a lot. If someone knows a website or store to refer me, I would appreciate it if I also search for other live shows. Send me a message if any of you have information on the subject. Thank you.
