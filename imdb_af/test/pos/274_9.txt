The Stepford children are the second best Stepford movie in the Stepford series. I saw the original The Stepford women in the theater when it came out in 1975. I was absolutely blown away, it was fantastic. I've seen the Stepford movies, and I love them all. I think the Stepford kids are such a nice and fun movie. I just watched it on tape recently, and I really enjoyed it. The movie in this movie was really good to watch. Barbara Eden did a percussion as usual. Every role she ever played was very good. Barbara Eden is very good at playing roles where she is a kind and nurture type person. Murray as the man and dad were just perfect in this movie. He was especially effective at being the irritated father for his two teenage children. I made sure I had the Stepford movie on tap to enjoy. If you get a chance to see this movie, you have to do it.
