This surreal, absurd movie is the first movie I saw of the cult Swedish director Roy Andersson. He is a veteran filmmaker who made his live filming competitions. He only ordered four films in the past forty years. This wallpaper shows: the movie looks like a collection of fifty 2 minute arty commercials. There is no story linking these vignettes, although some characters appear in more than one vignette (there is a theme throughout them, though: the absurdity of modern life). Some of the film's ways (with the actors appearing in light white make-up) are more irritating than enlightening. Some of the sketch amounts to very little (a man uncertain in which row to stand?). However, other sketches are better. The best is the one about the rock chick who dreams she's honeymooning with her rock guitarist bride at a house that touches a train (you have to see it to get it). A movie worth seeing looks like comparisons by some film critics with such a great movie maker such as Keaton, Tati and Kaurismaki are being exceeded. Andersson has the vision of them and the lack of a story connecting the vignette is fatal to the film's prediction that it is a masterpiece.
