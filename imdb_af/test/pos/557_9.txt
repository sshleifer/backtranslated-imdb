Wayne Wang's direction can be the ingredient that makes this film much more impressive to me than "Slums or Beverly Hills", which covers remarkably the same ground. The interaction between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman is disillusioned. True chemistry there. This film managed to bring me into the dysfunctional life of these two women without dragging me into depressing frustration. Susan Sarandon's character hammer at all the nerves that a narcissistic parent can touch in an insecure adolescent. She manages to do this unbelievably without being foolish or deliberately sadistic. And Natalie Portman defects every attack on her character's ego with the thankful grace of an intelligent coherent-dependent child, uncomfortable by the smuggling cynicism of the Natasha Lyonne character in "Slums or Beverly Hills". Portman's character is an adolescent with dignity under stress, an unusual creature in modern films. The movie reaches a very satisfactory resolution without trying too hard. I recommend this movie to the viewer who wants to be challenged and entertained.
