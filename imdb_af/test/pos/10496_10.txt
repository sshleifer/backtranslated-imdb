Enigma is a computer part that scratches Russian messages so America can't understand them. They can only be read by the intended recipient. The Americans know that the Russians will send a message revealing the plans of five political murders they want to execute. <br /> <br /> So they send in the former defective Holbeck (Martin Sheen) to grab the scrambler and substitute. a false part so they can decode the message and block the murder attempts. <br /> <br /> But if we listen to Americans' heads of the spy organization, we find that they already have the scrambler, and they want Holbeck to steal Enigma, just to convince the Russians that they don't already have. They do not expect Holbeck to succeed. That way, the Russians, who have stopped transmitting Enigma, will just start sending again. <br /> <br /> Enigma is in the computer in the office of Dimitri Vasilikov. Somehow, Holbeck must get access, and to do this he must find out when Vasilikov comes out. He sends in his former friend Karen (Brigitte Fossey) Vasilikov, so she can look through his papers and find out his scheduled movements. Karen is happy to do so, as she killed her father, a university professor. <br /> <br /> Knowing it's better for Americans if Holbeck fails, the movie becomes even more intense than a spy thriller. We think we hope he can survive against the odds, especially as he uses ingenious methods to beat the Russians in every turn. <br /> <br /> But what is it? Are Karen and Vasilikov falling in love? Will Holbeck win Karen back, or will she actually end up with Vasilikov? The romantic strife raises this spy thriller, already a ten, even higher, for its originality. The writing, the direction and the acting all combine to make this new and fascinating turn a compelling realistic one. <br /> <br /> Find yourself at the edge of your seat and grab your armchair, not just for the excitement. of the spy story, but also for the intensely beautiful romantic love story. The two themes are perfectly interwoven, to the end. You really want to win both sides. So who eventually wins? You have to see the movie and find out, you won't!
