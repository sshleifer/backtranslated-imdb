If you overlook the technical problems of this early (1930) sound movie, such as the sound quality and sporadic stiffness of John Wayne, one will find this movie to be an epic that is more realistic than almost any movie made since. Starting at Missouri, a large caravan of Conestoga wagons, people and animal heads west. The wagons are drawn large cliffs and drawn over a flooded river, with great risk for the riders in the wagons. Indians meet with Wayne and let the train pass through their land. Later, Indians gather west of the train to fight them. The wagons form a large circle with horses and cattle in the circle and fire their guns that create a veil of smoke with the circling Indians. <br /> <br /> When the battle ends, the dead are buried in the place and the people and wagons leave. This scene is remarkable, as the camera stays at death like the living room. It is unique in the way it connects the viewer with the dead and separates the viewer from life. The wagons experience a great thunderstorm with windy precipitation and mud everywhere. They eventually arrive at their destination near a rooibos or sequoia forest in Oregon. The film is made in 70 mm widescreen at approximately 2.0: 1 ratio (in 1930!). <br /> <br /> I didn't mention the plot because it's secondary to the spectacular grandeur and vast amount of work involved in making this movie. Movers will never work hard to make such a movie or a movie. Given the technical limitations of the sound, the music sometimes moves, like when Wayne leaves his girlfriend to hunt down his friend's killers and eventually. <br /> <br /> While all the critics about The Searchers raves and Wayne's psychology, racism, short temper and complex characters, The Big Trail gives us a story of simple people experiencing extraordinary hardship. One of the best westerns I've seen.
