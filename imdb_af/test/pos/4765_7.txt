What you've seen in BULLITT and the French connection is nothing compared to what you have here. The chase lasts for almost 15 minutes and is the best you will ever see. This movie has become a classic crime drama of the heights of the 70-year-old movie. It is a fierce and realistic depiction of the average streets of New York. With one of the smartest wise guys ever to be on the screen, Tony Lo Bianco's performance in this movie is cool as ice. He ripped off his own co-workers and made it appear as if the police were responsible. His youth friend Roy Scheider is a street detective confused by the disappearance of gangsters. You can see Lo Bianco enjoying the game throughout the film. However, sometimes the movie gets boring, but then it's right when you like to give up. Something big happens and it pulls you back. The Don Ellis score puts the cold, gray winter time in New York City and to take it all off, my husband Joe Spinell in the early role of Toredano shows the garage man. <br /> <br /> Score, 7 out of 10 stars
