For those of you who have wondered what an art house monster movie can be, don't wonder. The DAIMAJIN trilogy, about 1966, was just such a series. More time samurai epics than anything else, these three movies also just happen to be one of the most (literally) monstrous deux et machinas ever. There is not a single facet of these gems that have not been polished, from the scenario (s) to the performances of the filmmaker's craftsmanship. Even the special effects are handled with an above average skill and are, in most cases, almost seamlessly integrated into the film (s). If you are a GOJIRA fan or a fan of samurai movies or one of us who just likes a good movie, regardless of genre, I strongly recommend the DAIMAJIN trilogy.
