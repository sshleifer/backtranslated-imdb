Widely known as "Don't Look In the Cellar" - it's pure 70's horror, B-movie goodness that can actually succeed as the genre's version of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest". Although the movie doesn't go anywhere in the first hour, I enjoy the peculiar group of peculiar crazies and their different personalities and shortcomings - such as the former army sergeant, a chick obsessed with providing a plastic doll, a sweet man-child, and a rewarding nymph. After their chief doctor was murdered by a patient, a small sanatorium hires a new nurse on their sub-staff who is immersed in the resident's various "ticks" and outbursts. Things are getting strange, but when patients start to behave more abnormally than usual ... you never know or care about where the movie is going, because it is still entertained until it ends completely! Several of the "twists" have a little to force and I could have used a little more blood, but I dug this much to underestimate humor and horror. Look at this ...
