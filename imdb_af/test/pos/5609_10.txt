This is my favorite Hal Hartley movie. All his movies are little jewels. I love independent movies and I hope Hal Hartley never runs or sells. What if the Lord Jesus returned and loved his people so that he could not open the final book and destroy the unbelievers? It was nice to see P. J. Harvey in a movie since I was a fan of her music. Don't watch it if you're a fan of cookie Hollywood movies, you'll be disappointed.
