Wow - Most of the audience just shook their head with many of these documentaries at the mere wizard shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Moving the early days as a New York-based black-American phenomenon to current days as a racially diverse subculture (and mainly West Coast-based) is well profiled. <br /> <br /> The humble turntable is not given the respect of any traditional musical instrument, but it can be so much more versatile and technically complex. These DJs take the required skills for any musical instrument - including craftsmanship, rhythm and timing - and apply it to a new technology with multiple variables. <br /> <br /> DJ Qbert's remark that he has to make photos of what "music" sounds like on advanced planets and then works out, seemingly stupid, begins to feel more and more when you watch these guys go and spit out a many sounds that no traditional instrument can ever create! <br /> <br /> Some critics have said that this film focuses too much on certain 'stars' and gives a chance to profile the broader hip hop culture. One movie at a time people!
