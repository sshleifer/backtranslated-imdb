I didn't pretend to be a big Asterix fan, just watched another movie adaptation and just read two of the comics, but it was a fantastic movie. I just saw the English version and found the voices to go perfectly with the characters - Brad Garret as Obelix and Sean Astin as Justforkix. The story itself was interesting and really funny (especially the conflicting name ends - all the viking names end in "down", while all the Gallic names end in "ix"), with a little romance thrown by it. ) the story strengthened, though it did offset overall production with unnecessary clichés. <br /> <br /> The plot is it - the Viking chief, Timanah, is sick and tired of going to the villages and then emptying them. So, he consulted his "wise man", Cryptograf, whose entire repertoire consisted of old proverbs, and Cryptograf told him that "fear the inhabitants' wings". By literally accepting it, Timanahaf believes that fear actually allows people to fly and go on an expedition to get the "Champion of Fear", an expedition that naturally leads him to the Gallic village where Asterix and Obelix live. <br /> <br /> The couple are currently very frustrated - Chief Vitalstatistix's cowardly, petty cousin, Justforkix, has been entrusted to them so they can train him to be a man, and the boy makes little or no progress no. When Justforkix unconsciously confesses that he is "scared of everything" in the presence of the brainless viking Olaf, he is believed to be the "Champion of Fear" and is kidnapped. Asterix and Obelix are sent by Vitalstatistix to save Justforkix before his father returns to town to bring his son back. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, it's a good movie with few errors along the clichés and sometimes, faulty dialogs. I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite the fact that it wasn't the cartoon.
