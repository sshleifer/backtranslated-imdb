I remember remembering to watch this movie over and over when I was a kid. I loved it. While I didn't watch it recently, I'm sure I'll enjoy the same today. It's a very light funny movie that is guaranteed to make someone laugh. The situations with each of the characters were so funny and imaginative! I especially had one with the girl who was driving with her mother (who eventually picks them up on the highway after the explosion), the robbers and the nuns. This nice humorous style is much missed today. This film also proved that actor Paul Keenan (Dynasty / Days of our Life) was a good start. I recommend it to anyone lucky enough to find it in their local video store.
