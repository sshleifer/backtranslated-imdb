There are many well-known Hitchcock elements (from previous and later films) and this time they blend into a jolly, but hardly exciting piece of entertainment. You can see that Dorothy Parker had a hand in the script. The most memorable scene is the dialogue of hero Cummings with the blind man and his encounter with a little bizarre group of circus people. The well-known climax on the Statue of Liberty looks a little heavy-handed - judged by today's standards, but also in comparison to other Hitch monument finals (eg Blackpost, North by Northwest).
