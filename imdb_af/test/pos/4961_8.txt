To get a D.B. Sweeney fan, I've been looking for this movie for quite some time. I recently rented the video and found it very enjoyable. It had some very hilarious scenes. The dysfunctional lives of some of the characters were disturbing, but I think the movie also showed that it is possible to keep your life on track or to get it back on track if derailed.
