Dolemite is an object of my deepest love to me. It has everything: a gang of karate fight prostitutes, Dolemite bumps his fist through the stomach of Willie Green (Mr. Martin), high pumps and 100 liters of dalmatia pressure hats. Moore's unique comedy rap, actually toast, is close to the roots of hip hop. No wonder Dr Dre has called Dolemite on his classic album The Chronic 3 times. Add the best list of characters to ever give a movie, like the horny preacher, the hamburger pimp and, of course, the one nobody knows until it's time. Credit must be given for style to director D'Urville Martin, a fella who doesn't get as much attention as he has to be around movie circles (I watched a copy of his and Fred Williams's movies from the early years. many people are really down on this movie and say it is really bad, and it is true that you can see how the tree trunks occur everywhere (see DP Nicholas Josef von Sternberg, for whom I think it was a very early attempt), there are many things for this movie. Number one, there is no other movie like that. Number two, you will see that Rudy Ray Moore needs a (highly purified, all who did not see Moore's outrageous living act, use their imagination). Cinematic version of his toast, plus he lives the life of his comic book character superpimp. come to life. The action scenes are pretty poor, but the characters' dialogue when they talk more than dirty makes it right. It's full of strange little details (such as the fact that the Hamburger Pimp wears a Dolemite T-shirt inside - was it deliberate or just picked up the guy who put the shirt on the set and incited?) back to watch it again. <br /> <br /> At least I have. <br /> <br />
