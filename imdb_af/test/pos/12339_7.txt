A lot of girls from girls make a new promise the night in a creepy mausoleum. Of course, the recent deceased did not stay long and the whole hell broke loose. "One Dark Night" is a pleasant 80's horror with some cruel dead bodies controlled by the spirit of a dead psychologist Raymar. There is no gore and nudity, but the atmosphere of a mausoleum is very ominous. The play is solid, but the writing takes too much time to develop the characters to the last 20 minutes that Raymar eventually breaks out of his grave. The cinematography is impressive and the mausoleum is a good place for the climate. The movie lasts so long to go and it's his biggest mistake.7 out of 10.
