While making this movie I once caught a statement about television. Something like, "Is Killinggänget now Nazism?" <br /> <br /> So, my understanding of this movie was from the beginning an idea of ​​Nazism. When I watched this movie recently in the TV version, I had this filter in front of me and it wasn't hard to see. <br /> <br /> Oddly, I haven't met this way of interpreting the movie since. it only heard. <br /> <br /> These are the things I found in "Four shades of brown". In all four stories, the lack of empathy leads to disaster: <br /> <br /> 1. The crematorial worker shows no realistic empathy to the dead or to those who had to part with their goodbye. In the crematorium in dealing with death and fire, it is almost like a cheerful game for him. The father and his son do not emphasize the seriousness of death and the fire, but in ignorance a button leads to the disaster that his father seriously injured. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: The importance of showing the young enough emotions. When they grow up, they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good. <br /> <br /> 2. The wizard maneuver his wife like an invisible puppeteer. Just as she thought she had started cutting the strings after the master's hand, striving for personality, integrity and joy, he was pulling hard and she was again in desolation and despair. <br /> <br /> Their son tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and "good" taste in contrast to his parents' bad taste. The real problem he is carrying inside is far from understandable. The behavior of his fathers is adjusted if he suffocates his own wife in his spotless environment. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: Repression breeds slavery. <br /> <br /> 3. The father abused as a child betrays his children to sadism when he deceives them about their inheritance. He robs them of their childhood and eventually even of their inheritance. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson: If no love you gave, you can't give it. <br /> <br /> 4. The fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a relentless devil with sadistic aggression. Here, the ice-cold Nazi sadism becomes very evident in physical violence. It gives a possible background and a little probable explanation of the behavior of young "kick-head" researchers' behavior when they suppress others. <br /> <br /> Possible lesson? : Can the Nazis be born in a perverted house? <br /> <br /> Can the terrible consequence of ignoring empathy in family life be that the room is given to sadistic Nazism? <br /> <br /> Very seldom contains such a movie. It reveals something to me as I meditate on it. I regard it as brilliant "painted" and the actors are excellent. Especially the beautiful apparent block played by Ulf Brunnberg seems to be the worst of all.
