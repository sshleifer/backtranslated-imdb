This short has all the elements of a big movie. Every time I show it to friends (on DVR), they also love it. The dialogue is so, 'real'. The acting is wonderful. While the effects / props themselves were not so convincing, taken with everything that was still in the lap, they were expertly placed / used. The music is so haunting, perfect for this kind of "instant" movie. People who hold their beliefs and thoughts are shaken at the core of what they see in this movie. Most are going "it's it?" But in the end they bloom with new understanding and leave the movie with one word to describe it: <br /> <br /> "Beautiful." The beauty of the film is also deep. I love the fact that there are no conflicting views, no other voices, and the voices you hear agree with each other. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And in the end I loved myself more! Hard reality is sometimes worth more film than any plot device, or turn. <br /> <br /> (Wasn't Joshua Leonard the man in Blair Witch Project?) :) Filming through a fictional dead guy .. great!
