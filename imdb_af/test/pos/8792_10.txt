I just love this movie! I love all the characters and I can see it again <br /> <br /> and again ... and I use to listen to the soundtrack again and again. <br /> <br /> Although I've seen it about twice years after it's been made and I have never been so young, <br /> <br />, like Jip and the company I <br /> < can understand and I love their stories. And if anyone thinks this movie is crazy, I don't agree and I say it's <br /> <br /> full of positive energy and friendship and love ... and full of youth! <br /> <br /> The weekend landed ... enjoy it!
