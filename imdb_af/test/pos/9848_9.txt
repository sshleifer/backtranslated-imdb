I mention that there might be a spoiler here just to be careful because of what I'm discussing, though I don't really think I'm giving anything important. Any "surprises" are really unimportant to the success of this movie or viewer's ability to enjoy it. <br /> <br /> While not without some very small flaws, it is a beautiful and very moving movie about friendship, time, uncertainty and the choices people make about their lives. Yet, at the same time, it is also a very humorous film, with small, mostly understated, comedy-wrapped pieces. For many of the film it progresses at a fairly quiet pace, but it does not look long, as the film draws the one in it and into the characters' lives, and it is initially light-hearted. Some have commented that much of the movie looks slow, but it's such a wonderful portrayal of the life of such sympathetic characters that they can almost see it endlessly. As it progresses, the film becomes more emotional and moves to the end and the progression is handled wonderfully. <br /> <br /> Eventually, some characters decide to rob a bank and although it may be difficult to believe, it's next to the point. It's a great addition to emphasize the love that these friends have for each other while emphasizing the humor and adding a little more irony to the film. And while it's not original to rob a lot of old guys, the context and details are pretty original, and it does great, and also makes it very funny, as Ismet (if I remember correctly) exaggerates his aggressiveness to "disguise" the fact that he is old. <br /> <br /> As I said, most of the other comedies are pretty low key, but still very humorous, so I kept covering all the time. <br /> <br /> Actors are probably the right key to this movie. They carry the characters with deep personality and sympathy and exude them with great care and warmth. There are some small transformations or small details of the characters' personalities that are smoothly and beautifully subtracted. Of course, the film is about the personalities of these many characters and how they care about and interact with each other. It did so well because of them and if few actors had the roles, the movie failed. <br /> <br /> Yellow Yellow is not without sadness, but it simply offers the full range of emotions and offers a more powerful experience. In fact, the film is so moving and filled with so much love of so rich characters that it is ultimately a very heart-warming, satisfying and even happy movie, despite its sadness. I could look it over and over.
