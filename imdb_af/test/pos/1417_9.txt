Stephen Hawkings is a genius. He is the king of genius. Watching this movie makes me silly. But it's a good movie. Not very entertaining, but very intriguing. The film is about wheelchair-bound Stephen Hawkings, a man who makes Einstein's average and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe, time, galaxy and black holes. Everybody at somewhere or another during a very intense high comes after a moment when they think they have come out of the universe and the cosmos and they swear as soon as they sober up, they will write it all down. Well, here's a man who actually kept that feeling for more than six hours. Here is a man who, despite the suffering of Lou Gehrig's disease, has become the greatest thought the world has ever seen. Look at this and listen to how he formulated black hole theories. Awesome. You won't be the same if you see it.
