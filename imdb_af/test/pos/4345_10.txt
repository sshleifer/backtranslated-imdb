This movie is really a classic 80's movie! A must have in any '80s' movie collection! Guns, bad guys, CREEPS, gangs, CHARLES BRONSON and more CREEPS !!!! <br /> <br /> I think it's the best Death Wish movie. Numerous unceasing action! <br /> <br /> And stick to the classic 80's "bad old vs good old" movie - this movie is about anything but the norm and all about guns and CREEPS! We see Bronson pruning boefies and CREEPS with a 30-caliber Korean War heavy machine gun! A HEAVY MACHINE GET FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! When Charlie runs out of ammunition for the heavy machine gun, he goes back to his manger and picks up his arms with his long-range high caliber gun! This pistol can stop a freakin OLPHANT and Charlie makes holes in the size of hubpaste in bad guys with it! And if that's not enough, Charlie also packs an anti-tank grenade launcher, which is only good if he can hit the CREEPS together. <br /> <br /> The play in this movie is "ha ha" big and many off the wall actors (especially CREEPS play) appear throughout the movie! The movie is loaded with memorable one liners and scenes! Heck, my favorite scene / line is where CREEP leader Broson confronts in jail and quietly explains to him: "Tell you what I'm going to do ... I'm gonna kill a little old lady ... just for you! ... catch it on the six-hour news. "<br /> <br /> Is this movie violent? Heck yes! But you will all the way and laugh!
