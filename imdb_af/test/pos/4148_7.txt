An interesting look at the immigrant experience has spoken as a fable with some very weird images. <br /> <br /> I pulled on this movie because it tells of immigrants from Sicily traveling to America. I think much the same as my grandfather did at that time. If you're in the battle to provide ballast for the ships, I can't imagine it was very comfortable, as shown in this movie. Laws that restrict immigrants exist. I would guess that these laws were stricter on those who came from the Mediterranean and Africa. Immigrants had to be free of infectious diseases or hereditary diseases. In the film we see physical and spiritual exams, the latter because of the view that low intelligence is hereditary. Single women could not come to the country, suspected of becoming prostitutes. So most married single men are already in the country, as pre-arranged, on Ellis Island before access. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a British immigrant (Charlotte Gainsbourg) who arranges to marry a poor Sicilian (Vincenzo Amato). He tries to spend his family with a dumb son and a mother (Aurora Quattrocchi) who is poorly regarded. She was also fantastic in the role. <br /> <br /> You'll also see the character actor, Vincent Schiavelli, in his next appearance. I don't know if his last movie was released. He plays a matchmaker and is also very good. <br /> <br /> It was a strange but nice movie. It's not for everyone, because I think those who have no interest in immigrant experience will find it fairly slow.
