Jean Paget, Joe Harman and Noel Strachan - all are unlikely heroes and survivors. Petite but strong Jean whose strength and set-up helps save lives, move hundreds of kilometers and with quiet self-discipline and convincing powers, Joe Harman ("oh my") who made Jean and the other prisoners dangerous, just for the worst to suffer pain imaginable, and Noel Strahan, who trusted Jean, regardless of the chance. Her good humor and hardness inspire everyone around, and those with the courage to go with her are rewarded. The beautiful scenery and musical score adds to the adventure. Despite the length it was never boring for me. These ordinary people have done extraordinary things and it is based on a true story. Someone borrowed my VHS a few years ago and I never saw it again. Learn my lesson, friends, and buy another copy if it can be found. It's a pity that the miniseries aren't on DVD.
