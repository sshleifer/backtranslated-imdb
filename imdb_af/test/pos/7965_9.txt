I was very happy and at the same time quite surprised by other positive comments made by non-Koreans below. This movie is incredibly sad, and shows a lot of 'sad but warm' views on the life typical of Korean people. I thought other foreigners would not understand this delicate feeling and underestimated this silent movie as a boring one, but I was wrong. The appeal of this movie can also be difficult to avoid foreigners. (Even without subtitles ...) <br /> <br /> I would like to mention a few points that others have missed. Of course, this movie shows love between a man and a woman. However, the theme is over. Actually, it's about time, value of memory and death. In this film, the focus does not fall on the "love relationship" between two people. As some pointed out, they didn't kiss, they didn't hug each other, even without holding hands. So love itself is not complete (either positive or negative) in the film. Rather, Jungwon (a leading actor) is rather his approaching death. He walks out of time, he can't keep it and leaves some behind, including his dad and of course, Darim (a mermaid). So the problem is how he can experience death and leave something valuable in his short life, not how he can love Darim. <br /> <br /> This kind of theme is very familiar to us. There are many movies related to patients with unknown diseases such as 'Love Story'. But what makes this movie outstanding is the way Jungwon deals with his death. He's a loser, but tried to do his best while living, IN A SPIRIT AWAY. He tells no one about him about his death. He hides something in his mind, but without anger, hatred, revenge. He just tried to do the best while he was alive. This limited communication and obedience to fate is the typical mindset of Koreans and the point that most Western people do not understand or misunderstand. <br /> <br /> This theme is very effectively expressed by the director of this film (surprisingly, his debut). Some say he is very much influenced by Japanese director Ozu Yasujiro, who manages Tokyo Story. Indeed, I remember reading in a magazine that the director himself acknowledged that he was influenced by Ozu. I'm not so well known to analyze his style with Ozu's, but they have some in common and some not. Low angle and static camera reminds us especially Ozu's style. But as far as the theme is concerned, this Korean director seems to have a somewhat warmer and hopeful vision. <br /> <br /> It is succinctly expressed with Jungwon's last photo. Very well done and very heartbreaking scene, I think. Actually, the director first had the idea of ​​this movie when he took part in the funeral of a very famous Korean folk singer who died young of mysterious suicide. They say he saw the photo of the singer during the funeral and the thought of a movie about death and memory. (And maybe hope for the remnants, I think ...) <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who has a lot of interest in filmmaking as well as Korean culture. This movie, I think, can be competitive with other movies like Tokyo story and a kind of American Beauty. It is as good or without language barrier. DVD version will be on the market this February, so it may help a little for foreigners with English captions.
