This film was filmed, filmed and premiered in Oxford, Miss., The hometown of W. Faulkner, the place of the 1948 book. Most of the extras were locals. I was in Oxford, and it has changed greatly. This movie has Will Geer as the sheriff, and later he is blacklisted. These were the authors and actors of social dramas such as this film, and Grapes of Revenge, which was a few years later targets of the HUAC. I don't remember if the actor who played the young Mallison boy (Claude Jarman Jr) did something after the TV series Centennial (1978), but he was great in this previous movie. And don't miss Elizabeth Patterson who later played in Little Women.
