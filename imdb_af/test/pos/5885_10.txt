The film includes another exceptional collaboration between director William Wyler and the movie Gregg Toland, the first after Toland worked on Citizen Kane. But the talent of both of these men was focused on achieving a perfectly crafted film, understood in the good old American sense as a great story. The technical aspects of the movie are covered so that the viewer is recorded in the action on the screen without subjecting to the power of the image. Technique is seen as a means of representation, unlike in Citizen Kane, where Welles's baroque style almost told the story of the story. One of my favorite moves with deep focus in this film is the drama that is conveyed by the returning home welcome of Homer and Al. As Homer's girl, Wilma comes in full focus, even though his wife is also in focus. This is a brilliant move, because it only shows the nature of these relationships as we see them throughout the film: Wilma loves Homer and she accepts him as he is. Everyone's wife also loves him, but she feels unprepared to welcome him completely at home. Later in the film, we find that their marriage is not always a bed of roses. <br /> <br /> Wyler is a director whose strength lies in being true to his work without boasting. He wanted to show his audience how difficult it was for the American soldiers who returned from the war to fit into a society they didn't understand or treated with contempt. With a perfect role and a good dialogue, Goldwin and Wyler made a movie that will forever be the template for any other homepage. The three hours that coincide with the "rough cut" because the test audience never felt for a moment the action was slow and indeed every play from the movie seems perfectly justified. The whole thing is beautifully built up, every character gets a good amount of exposure, nothing is left to chance and it is quite sad that Hollywood never brings so much character conflict to the screen. TBYOOL explores the depth of the American way of life, from the American family and society to an extent that looks like other films like "the childhood".
