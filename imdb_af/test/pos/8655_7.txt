Grab my attention on Netflix Instant Play because it was only half an hour (it's 4:00 am afterwards), and because it's Norwegian, I wanted to follow up with Dead Snow and see what the country is offering even more in the international cinema . right now. This movie has a man, Andreas, who is sent to a Fire Fire from a Brave New World city, where everyone is happy and greasy, and food has no taste, no smell and even sex loses his appeal. . After a hilarious attempt at the latter, Andreas kicks off a man with similar complaints and the two discover a small, vagina-shaped hole in a concrete wall from which music originates. The two attempts to break through to see what is on the other side, follow a little light that they can barely see. But of course, in fantasy allegory country, desire and deviations are not allowed and the elements of the city work to end Andreas's attempt at freedom and sensuality. <br /> <br /> Jens Lien and crew create a simple, straight-forward move to the story, one that flows well with its themes and moves on just enough of a pace to love. The similarities in other similar science fiction are not worth picking up, but the film still has a unique feel and balances some very funny scenes with some terrifying kids. I like the limited but effective use of gore in this movie, a little evasion and flagellation that will get your heart harder than the Passion of Christ, simply because it is so completely out of place of the gray tinted mise-and-scene . Trond Fausa Aurvaag is a reliable squirrel actor who physically feels his environment, which works very well. Despite the fact that the concept itself is nothing to write home, everyone is involved, and the film realizes its own world. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
