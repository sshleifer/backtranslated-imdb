There is a Third Man look at the shadow B&W photography of STOLEN IDENTITY, a thrill produced by Turhan Bey, ex-star of Universal Pictures during the 40's. It is a knowledgeable filmed story of jealousy that leads to murder when a well-known pianist (FRANCIS LEDERER) is excessively owned by his wife (JOAN CAMDEN) and is soon planning to kill a scheme to kill a man over she has a relationship. /> <br /> A taxi driver (DONALD BUKA) gives the woman's lover a lift to the hotel when he steps within a moment to talk to a worker digging the street. Lederer uses the sound of the drill to mute the sound of the bullet he sits in the back of the passenger in the back of the car. When Buka returns to his taxi, he finds a dead man in the passenger seat. <br /> <br /> To report the murder to the police, he changes his mind and decides to change identities with the dead man who has a US passport which means that Buka can realize his ambition to return to the United States. The stolen identity plot becomes thicker when the man's friend (Lederer's wife) appears at the hotel to accuse Buka of impersonating the dead man. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of plot moviegoers have probably seen many times, but it gets a nice workout here, with a lot of tense scene like Buka and Lederer's wife planning how to run from the authorities to a final confrontation with the killer and the police. <br /> <br /> It is extremely absorbent, well done and keeps an eye on some excellent atmospheric photography from Vienna that will remind most movie-goers of "The Third Man". <br /> <br /> Worth seeing.
