WEEE it's still great fun! As with most of my friends, we saw this movie on HBO when we were young, and then we've been looking for a copy since. When they finally read it a few years ago, we had a Midnight Madness party ... and the movie got up well. Sure, it's pure cheese, but it's still a lot of fun. If you didn't see MM when you were young, you might not appreciate it.
