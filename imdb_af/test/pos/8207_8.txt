It is a solid, understated, small thriller, with excitement. A lot, with a cool story, is Sandra Bullock great! All the characters are great, and I was amazed at how unpredictable it was, as there were only a few predictable moments, plus Sandra Bullock is simply incredible in this! Jeremy Northam played a wonderful villain, and I know what Bullock's character is all about, because I'm kind of the same kind of person (I almost never go out), plus it's pretty well made and written for the most part . It should be higher than 5.5 in my opinion, plus Denis Miller was surprisingly better than he expected in his small role. The scene where Northam Bullock terrorized his boat was quite exciting, and was one of my favorite moments, and I also kept the pursuit scene in the carnival, and I also like the end because it was pretty well done. even if I did. think Northam is defeated too fast. There are also many other good hikes, and it is also clever, and there are also some shocking moments. It is a solid, underrated, small thriller, which has a lot of tension, with a cool story, Sandra Bullock is great, I recommend this one! The direction is wonderful! Irwin Winkler does a great job! working here with excellent camera work, adding good atmosphere, good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace. The Acting is fantastic! Sandra Bullock is incredible as always and is wonderful here, she is very nice, tough as nails, but rather vulnerable, and I was able to feel for her, because as I said I am like Angela, I almost never go out no, i enjoy her work really in this movie! (Bullock Rules !!!!!!!). Jeremy Northam is excellent as the villain, he was sneaky, unpredictable and very threatening, he was wonderful. Dennis Miller is surprisingly OK and not annoying in his small role, and has managed to bring a comic relief. The rest is good. Overall, I recommend this one! *** 1/2 out of 5
