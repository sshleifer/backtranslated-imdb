* SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> I don't care what someone says, this movie is friggin 'hilarious. It's the sequel to Jack Frost, a movie about a killer snowman. The snowman is created when a convicted serial killer is allegedly being taken to the execution room, but the truck falls with a truck containing DNA manipulation chemicals that contaminate human DNA binding, or in this case snow. The first movie was just boring, and eventually the snowman was destroyed by throwing moisture free on him. <br /> <br /> So they thought. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a year after the second. Some scientists suggest Jack Frost by mixing the antifreeze with chemicals. No explanation is ever given why they do it, they just don't. Meanwhile, the sheriff who arrested Frost first went to the Bahamas. Unfortunately, the snowman comes with him. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything. It speaks of roots that can rise, ice cubes that explode when you put them in your mouth, and killers snowballs. Yes, killer snowballs. They even say "Dada!" like babies. I will have to give the makers of this credit. The snowballs are some of the cutest little things that have ever dreamed. I wish I could get one as a pet. Frost finally freezes the island, as if a killer had snowman's ability to influence great weather patterns. <br /> <br /> Then there are the actors. There are Manners, the FBI agent of the first movie, except here he carries an eye patch. YARR MATEYS, SHIVER ME TIMBERS, I AM A FBI AGENT! YARRR! And then there's the stereotypical British adventurer and the stereotypical black Jamaican with dreadlocks. And finally, Captain Fun. The fertile man on the planet's surface has left no one. <br /> <br /> This movie is not scary, but it is hilarious. I walked my skirt throughout, and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good "bad" movie. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
