This movie is absolute gold. If you haven't seen it, do it. Mani Ratnam knocks him out again. This film also introduced me to Nandita Das, although everyone in this movie shines. My only regret is that I never found a copy with captions to the lyrics of the songs. We are led from the jungle of Northern Sri Lanka to the tranquil beaches of South India, as well as from the terror of war to the ultimate conquest by the love of the human heart. Beautiful, subtle, witty, with a few hidden surprises awaiting the viewer, this movie stands out again and the story in the story, The Umbrella, is done so well, as we watch the scene unfold from drawings. in a book. Pretty. Beware.
