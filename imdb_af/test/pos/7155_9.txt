In this story of a tightly wounded Christian family that "born" three of its four members after a car-driven car accident, it is clear how most of it is based, where there is so much potential to be over the top, and how real inspired most of the acting is. Where most of the film's moments, especially the honest and "innocent" sexuality talks after three of the four family members removed their guilt and shame, are hilarious, it is also tempting and the characters stay with you. <Br /> <br /> How often, for example, is a character in a comedy from the near caricature to full-fledged emotional being in the course of one scene? How often do we see a role that can be drawn from the midst of the boaters, to show a bit of humanity under the character's skin? Even many of the "bad guys" in this movie have moments of heartbreaking honesty, even though a lot of what they do can be absolutely ridiculous and horrible. There is truth and history behind even the most dubious acts in this film, which is a difficult task in satire. <br /> <br /> How refreshing it is to see a dark comedy that dares to dare. How nice to be actors so completely committed to character that they can dare to be ridiculous and sublime. <br /> <br /> And as a gay person, I don't think I was touched so much by a heterosexual sex scene as I was at the first sexual encounter between parents of this family after their accident. <br /> <br /> Bravo. Bravo. One of my favorites at Outfest this year.
