Well, sorry, I can't help but feel a little disappointed after my very, very, very anticipated "Just Before Dawn" viewing. Jeff Lieberman is a tremendous filmmaker and he can undoubtedly do good things with a small budget, but I still expected to see a much more sadistic and horrific early 80's skater. But actually I think Lieberman is not the one who is guilty of this, but we are gorehounds! It is more than clear that Lieberman intended to make his bakkie appear on the backwood screen, such as "Deliverance" and absolutely not like "Friday the 13th", which made the subgenre one year earlier. The horror and constant sensation of threat does not come mainly from the demented maniacs with their machetes, but from the truly dishonest and isolated Oregon forests where this film was shot. If the film looks slow and unpredictable, it's just because Lieberman takes his time to portray the dark forest and terrifying mountains as extra characters in his film. We barely see the killers personally, but there always seems to be someone behind the trees or from under the mountain lakes. With this in mind, "Just Before Dawn" becomes a highly admirable horror attempt and actually a lot better than its contemporary blood-stained colleagues. In the midst of an almost infinite selection of gory and sickening slashers, Lieberman emphasizes stress and character development. The plot turns on five twenty-one friends who are heading for a camping holiday in the Oregon Forest, where one of them owns a small piece of land. The forest is deserted and, of course, the campers ignore forest guard Roy (George Kennedy!) To return to civilization. Shortly afterwards, they brutally touch an innate family, the twin boys of which have murderous tendencies. All five main characters are surprisingly nice and convincing! No annoying stereotypes for which you don't feel sympathetic anyway, such as messy girls or soccer jocks. Because of this "natural" character, you automatically encourage them, even when they eventually change themselves into the wild. The sublime camera work offers the movie with a sometimes unbearable level of tension and Brad Fiedel's cold electronic score adds just that. "Just before Dawn" is a fine cut from the early 80's horror, as long as you don't want blood to drop out of your TV set.
