Boogie Nights is one of the best movies to come out of the 90's and I'm going as far as to say that it should be in the IMDb top 250. I can really understand why many of them don't like the subject. Personally, however, I feel so much and judge the acquisition of this film by viewers and critics. This is the best movie maker. <br /> <br /> The direction and acting in this movie surpasses well and reaches the level of brilliance. There is not one scene in this movie that is not wonderful. The individual characters reach out and touch you. Being a movie about the porn industry, one cannot think that sex scenes can be dealt with with such sensitivity, but it is. The direction is one of the best I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> The movie is not about a particular individual's story, it's about a lot. This is a character study. about people who are very low on them and who may find the most aliens in an industry, but who still dream the same and have both good and bad for them. Boogie Nights draws you from the beginning into their story, and although the movie is long (I believe almost 3 hours) you don't even see it honestly. And when it ends you don't want it .... <br /> <br /> I'm not easy to impress, which means there aren't many movies I will give a 10 out of 10 rating but this is one. Apart from the multiple character study, the use of music is in the film. I have never seen music in the past years tell the story, but also in this movie. There was such flawlessness, you know it's not something you will see every day. <br /> <br /> Burt reynold's performance was perhaps the best I ever saw him, and Mark Wahlberg is incredible (I'm amazed there are still people who say he's not doing well. I don't know how anyone can don't see) The person who really surprised me was Heather Grahem (Rollergirl) who is absolutely fantastic in her role, especially the one memorable scene with Burt Reynolds in the Limo, to the end. <br /> <br /> Again, I'll echo other IMDb reviewers to say this movie isn't for everyone. But I still think it was top notch.
