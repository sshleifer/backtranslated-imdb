I saw this movie twice on the cable. The first time I saw it, it surprised me. The skaters I saw were the guys we followed in the pages of Skateboarder magazine in the late 70's. These were the guys we copied and tried to skate. I'm glad a movie was finally made that gives an accurate picture of how it all became. I am now almost 40 years old and I think a nice kind of man with all the problems of life. This movie did a good job of taking me back. Back to the open pools, the backyard half pipes and the road trip to Cherry Hill NJ. I suspect you really had to understand this and really appreciate this movie. Otherwise, it probably won't have the impact on you as it did me. But for those of you (and you know who you are), who lived it, you know exactly what I'm talking about! Anyway, I don't care who you are, if you get a chance to see this movie ... do it! I thank the Z-Boys or Dogtown for the memories of my youth and thank you Stacy for making this movie! JOB WELL GONE!
