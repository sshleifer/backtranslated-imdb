The movie does not take him seriously, and if you follow his lead, you will have lots of fun (as long as you don't mind, your murders have really bloody and your horror covered with extra cheese)! <br /> <br /> This movie looks at every horror fan, and then gives them the finger. It knows it sucks, and that's why it's far from the best of the "Child's Play" series. <br /> <br /> It plays so well, you find yourself more than just laughing at it, but with it. And, trust me, the whole time you're laughing, it laughs back atcha. <br /> <br />
