This movie is a masterpiece. It was exciting from start to finish. The writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's story about a pornstar is told with style, grace, humor, even poignancy. The actors and the characters they play are all prominent, including Mark Wahlberg, who has previously been a solid actor and can carry a film. Burt Reynolds may give his best performance ever as a porn director Wahlberg discovers. The film revives the late 70's and early 80's with a deadly accuracy, from the disco scene the film begins on Wahlberg's Don Johnson "Miami Vice" outfit he wears in the final scene. Most regular filmmakers watching this movie will certainly compare it to PULP FICTION, but it has much more in common with the films of Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese. The movie is a triumph in style. The opening track that launches the movie is just as impressive as that in THE PLAYER and ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS. The editing by Dylan Tichenor is simply phenomenal. I couldn't believe the editing didn't receive an Oscar nomination (GOOD WILL I was a better edited movie?!). The best scene in the movie should be the one with the crackers. I had butterflies in my stomach, because the scene is incredibly intense. When I saw the movie a second time, I had exactly the same reaction to the scene. Unfortunately, it may not have the same effect on TV as in a theater with good stereo sound. It is a pity that many people have not seen this movie during the theater career, as this is the best way to see it. Anderson's use of widescreen will suffer from TV (so get the DVD or a mailbox). It's amazing how easy Anderson looks like this, because it's just his second movie. The music, sets, costumes, photography, horrible characters, sex, violence, happiness and sadness are caught by a man who clearly falls in love with movies.
