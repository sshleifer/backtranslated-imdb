The 13th and last RKO Falcon movie begins with the mutual command of Tom Conway, since Tom Lawrence is the Falcon and Ed Brophy as Goldie of "No Ladies!" Name. while preparing to go on holiday. While still wondering where they are going on vacation, since they have not worked since the start of the 1st movie in 1941 (with Sanders as Gay and both Jenkins and Goldie), they bump a woman and are dragged <br /> <br /> They promise to help her when her uncle is murdered by using an envelope with the details of a formula to replace industrial diamonds at his Miami business college. Do everyone here except the police donate to Lawrence? and Goldie for the murder. To comfort himself, Goldie keeps paraphrase travel brochures: "On the coldest day, you can always enjoy the warmth of a nice cozy electric chair". Some nice atmospheric nightclub scenes rub shoulders with some very bad behaviors from bad things. Favorite bit: the dignified game of hide and seek / search the roof that has the unwavering and sober Lawrence with the bad things on the sleeper train. Least favorite bit: the most embarrassing in the whole series in the crocodile battlefield? definitely thrown in for the kids! <br /> <br /> All in all, not the best in the series, but another entertaining outing, with an overall satisfactory plot and many episodes, even in this which I wish, could go on for just one few years like Columbia did with Boston Blackie, although RKO works out faster. Absolutely no sex, not much violence (actually not at all to today's high standards) and positively no message all make this kind of movie anatomy to serious people who can only see films as art forms that must be dependent on these three pillars. <br /> <br /> Three Falcon's Diet was later made in the title role with John Calvert. I don't care, but never tell me to count them in the main series, which Tom Conway made his own. time. It is also sad that both were downhill for Conway, who moved in the TV, voice review in 1953 and even played Norman Conquest in Park Plaza 605 in 1953. He also developed serious eye and alcohol problems? I don't know if they're connected? Poverty hit and after hospital was hospitalized in 1967, it was found dead in his girlfriend's bed. For our least-wanted people, we still have his 10 entertaining Falcon's plus a number of other worthy, even classical RKO movies from 1942 to 1946 with which he can remember him.
