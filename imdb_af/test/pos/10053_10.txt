I saw this movie as a child and loved it. I loved how speckled and full of energy Nikki is, and how she destroys Louden's perfect perfect yuppie life and damages him and changes her crazy ways. As a child in the 80's I saw New York exactly as it was portrayed in this movie, the domain of Madonna's character, with wild animals running and chasing naked naked men and destroying people. Now as an adult, I find that I love the movie for the same reasons, and even more for the love story that is in the mad antique of Mrs. Nikki Finn was cursed. Although I still want to go and find an indoor atrium like this movie. Pure beauty and genius.
