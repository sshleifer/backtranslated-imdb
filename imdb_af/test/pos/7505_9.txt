Being a retired medical / health field, "toiler in the vinyard", never gets tired of seeing this movie. Paddy Chayefsky was a friend of my college teacher and visited him in various classes in 1958. His writing ability stood the test of time and the hospital is as fresh as in 1971. I can see it every week and get something new. So many of the supporting role players went to bigger and better roles in both TV and movie. George Scott just made a few comedies, but his timing is as good as Jackie Gleason & Steve Msrtin. Spiritual humor rather than physical / slapstick wins every time in my book. And still a family movie with only 1, four letter word throughout the movie
