Free from one scene to another, from one story to another, just as if you walk from a shady path to an open space, like the wind in the leaves, from the tree to the other, how many different sounds? Just as when traveling, people meet their stories and tell them forever, who knows this? And just as we go through these places through the lost expectations of another time, the human thickness of the world takes away the breath. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie with my friends, not everyone liked them, maybe they were used to scenario-based and ready-made stories, I don't know. So this movie is for the crazy ones who love the sun shining on the sea, running without haste in the hills or through the small towns, listening to the growing grass telling stories from the bottom, six feet below, in the hot wind of summer.
