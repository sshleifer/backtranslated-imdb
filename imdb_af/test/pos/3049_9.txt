This movie played me tonight. Thanks to Fox Movie Classics for showing it continuously. John Voight, the film of little-known black actresses and especially the children, made it a worthy way to spend a Sunday night. How wonderful to see the early work of this seasoned actor, as well as Paul Winfield's excellent portrayal of Mad Billy. I can't see why anyone would say that Hume Cronyn is in the role of superintendent wrong. Who would have chosen them? The shrill character actor, Charles Lane? Although his career is commendable, an actor like Lane would have made the role cheap. Cronyn was an excellent choice for the part. I will count this movie as a true treasure to keep in mind.
