THE STUDENT NURSING is not a typical sex flutter movie. Certainly, the nakedness and sexual openness are there, but not everything to laugh at. Stephanie Rothman has written a socially compelling, well-written tits and donkey film confronting the topics of racism, socio-economic inequality, rape, abortion, medical ethics, public health issues, human rights, the Vietnam war, free love, LSD and drug. experimentation. Four sexy college roommates are taking their nursing education at the same time. Sharon (Elaine Giftos) is assigned to the terminal care ward Lynn (Brioni Farrell) to public health administration, Priscilla (Barbara Leigh) for gynecology and Phred (Karen Carlson) to psychiatry. These four beauties have plenty of opportunities to eradicate and fornicate, of which they benefit greatly from male viewers. These are liberated women at the height of the sexual revolution. After all, they are as intelligent as they are horny and beautiful. Visceral, but low-budget ranges are spread throughout. There is a very bloody gun in the headquarters of the resistance movement in which two policemen are shot dead, along with several members of the group. An anti-Vietnam war protest consisting of haunting young people of all races painted like skeletons becomes violent, with policemen defeating protesters. The effective beach travel range consists of beautiful, strange and confusing sensory and memory settings with hyper sensual overtones. In short, the STUDENT NURSING is a thoughtful and compelling reflection of the times, expressed by the real women's perspectives (as it is written and directed by a woman). But it is still fun and engaging, despite its excited treatment of the subject.
