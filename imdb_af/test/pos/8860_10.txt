Redesign of the classic 1951 "The thing of another world". 12 men are in a completely isolated station in Antartica. They are invaded by something from outer space - consuming it and completely duplicating everything they choose. It starts out as a dog, but gets loose - and has a chance to duplicate any of the men. Soon no one trusts anyone else - they are isolated - the radio is destroyed - their helicopter too. What are they going to do? <br /> <br /> The 1951 movie had the thing, just a big, superhuman monster. The movie was scary. This one is too - but the story is different (and more based on the source material - the novel "Who's Going There?") And it's differently scary. The movie starts out with Ennio Morricone's most ominous score just right and when the thing is attacked, the amount of gore is astounding. There are blood and body parts that fly completely over. The arms are cut off, heads are loosened and in the strongest one man is first faced by the thing. The gore effects are strong and real nightmare material. I'm not scared easily, but I had to sleep with the lights when I originally saw it in 1982. Rob Bottin's effects are just incredible - how this R-score picture is outside me! <br /> It also has a very creepy feel aside, it's very exciting. You are not sure who is what and Carpenter's direction and score really build up the tension. One complaint - nobody gets any distinctive personality traits. Their actors just stay straight and say their lines. It's annoying ... but the movie is still working. <br /> <br /> It was a critical and commercial disaster in 1982 - it competed with "E.T." and many critics have complained about the amount of gore and there are no female characters in the movie. It is now considered one of John Carpenter's best. A must-see ... for a strong stomach. Not a date movie! <br /> <br /> An amusing note: when released, Universal sent a note along with all the prints of the movie. They suggested to theater owners that they play the movie in an auditorium near the restrooms. They were afraid that people would be so bad by the violence that they had to be near a facility to throw up!
