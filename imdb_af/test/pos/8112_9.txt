This film entered production before World War II began, but was not released until it was well underway. With significant fascist sympathy in the US, and Chaplin himself suspected as a communist sympathizer, the Great Dictator was a very courageous pursuit. Such risks in filmmaking - thinly veiled political statements - will be almost unthinkable. Imagine the fall-out if someone today makes an equally satirical film that criticized the US foreign policy. <br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious, poignant and tragic. The tragedy is that Chaplin makes a plea for the madness to end, but it is too late - for him and us. A must see if you have any interest in history, film, politics or sattire as an art form.
