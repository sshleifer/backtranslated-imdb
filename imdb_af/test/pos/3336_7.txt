This is better than the average entry in the Saint series. It keeps you interested and, like mysteries, you end up and guess several suspects. <br /> <br /> Many movies from the Golden Age are not for all tastes, especially younger viewers. They date themselves through clothes, cars, settings, etc. Who is asking for a highball today? Or carry a suit and tie everywhere? And the legal process was so much simpler - had a lack of lawyers. Honestly, much of the value is missing from those days. <br /> <br /> Anyway, go along with it and enjoy. It's good - in an old-fashioned sense.
