Honestly, when I saw this movie at the Rave Theater in Plainfield Indiana, I didn't expect much. I just went to this movie because I thought it was a WWE movie, it would be good for a laugh. Then I sat down and watched why they chose Glen Jacobs (Kane) to play Jacob Goodnight. He's probably one of the freakiest guys on the big screen (much worse in my opinion than Freddy or Jason) and has one big advantage for other movies that make me a horror movie. It shows Jacob Goodnight as a human being. He has a heart, no matter how twisted and creepy it is. He feels pain, something Jason never does or does not seem to show. He feels sad and happy, even though they are insane again if you see the movie. All in all, a different experience in my opinion than many slashers, and it has surprised me in a few ways, like in who eventually lived.
