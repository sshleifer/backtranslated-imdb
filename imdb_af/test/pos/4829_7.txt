"Wicked Little Things" really separates him from other zombie movies. First, not all the zombies in the movie start biting you and tearing your flesh apart with their bare hands. They kill you with either a pickax or kick and eat you after wards. Second, they can't die. In most zombie movies you can shoot a zombie in the head and kill them, but it just won't die. Third, which is the main reason why this movie separates itself, all the zombies are kids. How did they die exactly to become zombies? They worked in a coal mine when they were all killed in a crash. Now they drove the bushes and carried their feet and kicks, waiting for someone to come and kill them and eat them. Oh, they also come out at night. Yes, only at night. This made the movie even more enjoyable, then it would be if they came out in the morning. Despite all the violent and greedy chaos in this movie, 'Wicked Little Things' is a good choice if you are looking for a movie about zombie children. Don't expect something big like 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'Land of the Dead', but expect lots of gore and violence that makes this movie a real zombie fan pleaser. Rob Zombie's All Scout Taylor-Compton's "Halloween" gives a big hand for delivering a good performance like the one she did in Halloween. She really needs to start in more horror movies.
