Please let me know of any versions of Precious Bane or Gone to Earth on video that people may be aware of. I love Mary Webb's books and will be very grateful to have any information on VHS or DVD. <br /> <br /> I've read Precious Bane and Gone to Earth, which are my favorites by Mary Webb, many times, and have also collected other novels by her. I was lucky with her poetry and essays, "Springs of Joy", but I have never seen the Editable Track version on Masterpiece Theater or the full version of Gone to Earth, although there was a US movie. Classic broadcast by The Wild Heart which was a chopped version of Gone to Earth's original movie. <br /> <br /> If someone can help me get copies of one or both of these movies (full versions), I'd be so grateful!
