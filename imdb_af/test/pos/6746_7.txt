It's a very dark movie. Noir indeed. The title character is smallpox, which was unknowingly brought by Evelyn Keyes in New York City. <br /> <br /> She's on one mission when she arrives and on a rough one after she's no longer talking to her innocent sister. But she is not intentionally a murderer herself. That doesn't mean she doesn't kill. This does not mean that her presence will not throw the city in turmoil anywhere among eight million people. <br /> <br /> Keyes is excellent. The supporting role is also very good. There are several few well-known people involved - the director included. Don't be put off. It's a movie to be considered! (And how nice to see a Columbia picture. Columbia and Republic turned out wonderful comedies and noirs, but we never see them again.)
