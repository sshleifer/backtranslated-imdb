This movie is basically a very well-produced production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its impact on those involved. It's always interesting to see the story of the 'other' side for a change. This movie focuses on a group of German soldiers sent to Stalingrad, Russia, in battle in the North Africa campaign, where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of World War II is being fought. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to see the other side of this battle as we see only the Germans only as the 'villains'. In this movie, these "villains" are given a human face and voice and it makes you realize that the only real enemy in the war is war itself and not necessarily those with whom you are fighting. Initially, it is difficult to concentrate on the movie, because you always just fall back that the Germans are the evil villains. But of course you get used to it quickly and you quickly adapt the Germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start caring and interested in them. <br /> <br /> The way this story is told is not But the best. It's hard to keep up with the story, as it jumps from one order to another. The film is not always logical in its storytelling and has a bit too many rows that remain too vague. It is also very difficult to keep the characters apart most of the time and see who is who. It doesn't always make this movie easy to watch, but on the other hand there are plenty of sequences and moments in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one, but not the most coherent one. In this respect, Hollywood movies are always better than European movies. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are high and have some good sets and locations, although the film was not even shot in Russia. It helps to create a good war-time situation atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The character is mostly interesting, though perhaps a little bit of formula. But I don't know, for some reason, characters always formulate well in war movies and strengthen drama and realism. It also helps them to be played by well-thrown actors. All the actors are not the best-known actors (Thomas Kretschmann was still a fairly unknown actor at the time), but each one fits their role well and gives his characters a unique face and personality. <br /> <br /> Overall, not the best or most consistent WWII drama, but definitely worth a look thanks to its original approach on the German side of the Stalingrad battle and its good production values. <br /> <br /> 7/10
