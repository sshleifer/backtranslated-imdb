I saw it on a VHS band in 1993, but couldn't find it at any source. It is a very dark and uncompromising look at the last days of the Japanese army in the Philippines. Anyone with an interest in the Pacific War will do well to see this movie and see what conditions have fought the other way. From what I can tell, it is historically accurate and shows how easily people can fall into full barbarism. I understand that in 1945, the Japanese army was completely cut off from any re-offer in the Philippines, so there are undoubtedly many of the terrible incidents depicted here. I may not have been able to identify with the film's characters, but I appreciate their humanity and struggle to survive. If I had to compile a list of the ten greatest war movies, this movie would be on it. See it if you can find it.
