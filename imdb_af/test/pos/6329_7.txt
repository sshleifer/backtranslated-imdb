Bergman and comedy are not quite together. Some of his comedies are so naff you almost win. This movie has the strange naff moment - the last 30 seconds is the nadir, but in general it's a beautiful (rather than funny) piece, pleasant. Bergman throws out several of his usual suspects that perform well. There is a big scene on the train between David, Marianne and an unashamed salesman who will remain in memory. Typically, marital material is cynical Bergman, but it is Bergman in a light, rather than a dark mood. <br /> <br /> This movie has its moments and is worth 90 minutes. Not one of his classics and not the place to start if you want to fall for Bergman.
