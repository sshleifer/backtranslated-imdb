I'm not sure why this movie on average is so low on IMDb if it's absolutely all you ever want in a horror movie. This is the definition of a horror movie. I consider myself a big horror fan and I have to say that this house is delivering the goods. House of Wax Is the story of a group of college kids heading for a soccer game that decides to camp out for the night and enter a local weirdo. When they wake up the next morning, they make a horrific discovery and decide to go into town for a broken car. The town is creepy and I just stop there. Because that's when the real horrible death begins. trust me when I say if you are looking for a horror movie, then you will love it. It is wonderfully deadly and inventive with the deadly scenes, the story is interesting and the characters are recorded with the actors with the actors who give their personalities. Paris Hilton included who is doing well with her. The film is a bit on the shallow side, but it's so much fun and caring. This movie has to eat the box office and all horror fans have to participate. See House of Wax the film containing the peeled skin, chopped lips, dead animal carcasses, hot wax spray on a stationary person, a finger cut off, a defstal, a pole through the head and still much more. I was lucky to see this movie at the Tribeca premiere and all the actors were on hand to promote the film. And boy has something to be proud of. Home of wash is the scariest roller coater ride of the year! 9/10
