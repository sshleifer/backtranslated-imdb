I love Sarah Plain and Tall: Winters End. It's such a good movie. It tells of the hardship of life on a farm. I live on a farm so I know what it is difficult to find. <br /> <br /> I love the Kansas area. It's such a beautiful place. My favorite country star is Kansas. I love the country in Kansas, it's just as beautiful. I'd like to live in Kansas. <br /> <br /> Sarah Plain and Tall: Winters End I think it's a love story. I love love stories they are so nice to watch. I like to watch them because it's nice to see people fall in love. Falling in love is not as difficult as most people think. I once fell in love. Sarah Plain and Tall: Winters End is my favorite love story
