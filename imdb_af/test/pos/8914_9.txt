And a hard place somewhere else. I didn't see this movie because I was quite young, maybe 12 or 13, who knows. But what I do know is the movie that taught me to masturbate. I don't kid you. I have no idea if it is right with any real standards today, but for me it was all again. <br /> <br /> The only reason I feel comfortable writing it is because I'm sure One will ever come around to read it. Really, I mean, who's going to look up this movie these days? <br /> <br /> I just found out that I haven't used the ten line minimum for the amount of length I record most in a review. I had no idea there was such a minimum length, but there, as a student tries to fill a page in a magazine, I'm going to fill in my ten lines. thank you very much.
