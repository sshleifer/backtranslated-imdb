Tiny Toons is the first cartoon I remember to watch as a child and I loved it every minute. When I was four or five, my parents bought the video. How did I spend my holiday. I watched it over and over until I was new to every word. Well, a few days ago, my three-year-old cousin came and had to entertain him. I decided to show him this old relic of my childhood. <br /> <br /> I'm new, he'll laugh, but I was surprised how much I laughed. Like every Tiny Toons movie and episode, the humor is more based on wackiness and slapstick humor and succeeds. Bugs, Babs, Plucky Duck, Maton Pig and Fifi endure incredible adventures of Bugs and Babs waterplanes with some help from Superman, Plucky Duck and Maton pig to the biggest amusement park just to drive the monorail, and Elmyra goes on a strange quest to find cute kittens in a safari country. <br /> <br /> Some of the classic humor is in this Tiny Toon Adventure and is the best wacky comedy I've ever seen. My favorite gag needs to be one when Hamton and Plucky arrive, drive and leave the monorail to Plucky's dismay. No matter what your age is, you will be laughing at tears while not having language and nudity. <br /> <br /> Tiny Toons Adventures: How I spent my vacation. Play the voices of Charles Adler, print MacNeille, Joe Alaskey and Don Messick. <br /> <br /> 5 out of 5 stars.
