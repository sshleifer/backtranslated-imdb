I ran to the library to check out these miniseries after listening to the wonderful "talk books" changed version of the book. The first half of this TV version is really good, but it beats quite a bit in the second half. The relationship with the trustee is overplayed and conflicts between Jean and Joe that do not exist in Shute's story are unshakable, as they significantly reduce the power of their love story. I was disappointed to find that the wonderful Bryan Brown's Joe looked much shattered and much less attractive than the man in the book, but Helen Morse's Jean was really pretty good. I think they would have to make it a 10-hour miniseries to properly develop the outback story. But all that has been said, I have looked at everything in more or less and appreciated his merit, all the desire for someone to do a less soapy remake.
