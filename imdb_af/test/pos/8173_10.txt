I have nothing but good things to say about this tasteful and heartwarming movie. I think the effort of the film's director / writer is courageous and inspiring. I didn't just love this movie for the fantastic story (but it also had to be told), but also for the way the actors delivered the story. It's not a shallow gay movie depicting stereotypical characters in humorous situations. It was an unforgettable and flawless effort to show that people who love love really have no boundaries, and love is as beautiful and wonderful as it always was. <br /> <br /> Another thing that touched my heart was how good I could relate to the emotion portrayed in this movie about the outcome of one of the main characters. We all need to feel through similar situations living in society in which we live, and through the feeling of detachment from everything that is right and normal. I give my heartfelt praise for this fantastic and courageous story.
