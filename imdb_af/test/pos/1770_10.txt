The cast for this production of Rigoletto is excellent. Edita Gruberova sings Gilda beautifully and passionately. Luciano Pavarotti also sings beautifully. Vergara is a fine Maddalena; Fedora Barbieri is a well-known older singer singing the girl, Giovanna. Weikl sing Marullo; Wixell both sing Rigoletto and Monterone. As Rigoletto, Wixell is probably the most convincing acting singer in this difficult ensemble of great singers. Kathleen Kuhlmann in the Contessa. All principals are known and world renowned. <br /> <br /> It is an exciting Rigoletto visual and musical. <br /> <br /> I have it on both laser disc and DVD. You must have it too!
