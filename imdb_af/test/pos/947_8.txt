First of all, you should only see it if you do not worry about the shortage of captions, pornography, kinky sex and utterly horrible and truly shocking depravity. I called kinky sex, but to mention sex in the second half of the movie "kinky" would be a great understatement. It is more like a punch in the face if you are not prepared for this type of disease. That being said, I can go back to reviewing this morbid piece of pseudo-snuff genre brought to us by our fellow Japanese. <br /> <br /> The plot looks pretty basic, almost inconsistent: a girl is hired to perform in amateur porn movies. Don't expect much in the first 30 - 40 minutes. There is a dialogue - if you do not speak Japanese, it will not mean much to you - it seems there is an opportunity to chat between the girl and the crew and performer, then there are some porn ( straight sex), and after The scene is finished with the artists and the crew take a break. And then ... it starts to happen. <br /> <br /> It seems as if the girl is being spoken to performing another play - this time tied to the rope. The abuse starts: beat, sleep, warm ... In the end, the girl breaks down and cries. They dissolve her. <br /> <br /> Then we see artists and crew sitting at the table as if nothing happened - except for the girl. She is visibly shaken and looks like she wants to leave. She walks to the door, sits on the floor to light her shoes ... and that's when hell breaks loose. <br /> <br /> She is hit in the head with the baseball bat, her wound is treated, she is tied to the bed. What consequences can be briefly described (I will not spoil everything for you) as rape during dissolution. Think of "Flower of flesh and blood", mix it with porn and you will get the idea. It's about 20 minutes or so. SFX is very good, also make-up. Everything is shown, without mercy to the viewer. You're warned. <br /> <br /> I thought "Visitor Q" was a very sick movie. After looking at Niku Daruma, it saw me as a fairy tale. This movie is so sick, so corrupt, so twisted, so disgusting that the hardest words are pale compared to the final. Sorry, this is only released on VHS, so no captions are available. But the movie still works without them. So, if you are in ultra illness, extreme sadism and other beauty of this beloved genre, look it out. I hope you won't have nightmares.
