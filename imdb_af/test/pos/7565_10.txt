Behind the nostalgic music we see a young boy from a train. He comes from Yugoslavia to meet his father, a man he hasn't seen in a decade. At the train station we meet the man. He never smiled. <br /> <br /> So we start our journey to "Four Friends", Arthur Penn's powerful and wonderful movie. You might ask why I started my review. Well, that's the way the video box describes the movie. You may have figured out that the film will be the story of the boy trying to work with this emotional man and eventually he will flee his cover and expose friendliness. <br /> <br /> Well, if you bought me, I have a bridge that I want to sell. You see, modern Hollywood will make that movie. Penn has always been an outsider and never made use of typical storytelling. He always tells interesting stories about people. He also has interesting stories about people (Bonnie and Clyde, The Chase, Alice's Restaurant and the subordinate Mickey One) and "Four Friends" is no exception. <br /> <br /> A typical Hollywood movie will focus on the boy named Danilo. But Steve Tesich's writing only focuses on it for about 4 minutes and then leaves him. We meet the adult Danilo, played by Craig Wasson (who may recognize you from "Body Double" and "Nightmare on Elm Street 3") and his friends, Tom, David and the passionate Georgia. The movie takes us through the sixties. Now in a smaller movie, the events will get attention. But in "Four Friends" these events happen, but Penn and Tesich are more concerned about character study than plot and I think the movie is better like that. We know the events; We don't have to live on them again. <br /> <br /> I know I didn't describe much of the plot, but I don't know if you can describe "Four Friends". It is not one of the "high concept" films that can be described in one sentence. It is a movie of many moods and textures. It's also a real emotional experience. The last twenty minutes of this movie moved me to tears. I'm not ashamed to admit it. Rarely does a movie have so much power that it can reduce me to tears. The acting is the first time, especially by Craig Wasson, who is one of the most underutilized actors working today. It's such a difficult, emotional performance and Wasson pulls it off. He had to receive an Oscar for this. Another great show is by Jodi Thelen, who has an even more difficult role than Wasson. But she handles it very well and gives Georgia a certain dignity that most Hollywood actresses will not have (they will be too scared to even try, they will be more concerned with the image rather than having a good performance. give, that's not what it's about.). She also earned an Oscar. <br /> <br /> "Four Friends" did not receive much of a print in 1981. Maybe people just didn't have the emotional ability to handle it. And clueless drivers can't print it as another "American Graffiti" (it doesn't have the "Four Friends" wall). So they killed it. It is a pity, as it is one of the best films of the 1980s, a decade where more and more dirty garbage was created and great art like this was without a home. I ask you to give this movie a chance. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
