Frequently threatening to turn into a supple and softcopic drama about the incomprehensible middle-class youth, John Frankenheimer (his first, although in television, including a previous version of this directing script). <br /> <br /> We're still in that semi-mythic ?? 50s when teens drove jealousy and jeans were still dungarees. James MacArthur (acting son of playwright Charles and actress Helen Hayes, and later pop culture as Hawaii 5-0's Danno enters) become involved in a small incident in a movie hit by a driver (Whit Bissell) . and is being dropped off at the police station. His father (James Daly), a large-scale film producer, has the call, doesn't listen to his son's version of the story and pulls strings to get him off. <br /> <br /> But MacArthur holds a chip on his shoulder, which even his sympathetic mom (Kim Hunter) can't beat. Things worsen in the basement of the Coldwater Canyon to MacArthur, trying to defend itself, repeating the original incident .... <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't quite avoid the attitudes? and cliches ?? of his time, but offers them a considerable nuance. Every character gets an honorable hearing; every point of view has its merit (and reactions to the movie will depend on what viewers bring to it). There are errors (the word "crummy", a standard rebellious euphemism of the era, used about 30 times too often), but they are exceeded by strengths. The film benefits from a strong role play (known as the excellent character actor James Gregory, as a police detective) and a definitely non-exploiting way to tell his story. From a vantage point in the new millennium, the hot water MacArthur may find it a little lukewarm, but The Young Stranger remains honest and honorable. <br /> <br />
