Keys to the VIP are one of the most entertaining, informative and hilarious programs currently on television. The idea is original and well executed, as it retains the reality aspect but remains entertaining. All the judges have a razor white. They are not at all beautiful at all times, but if you are looking for comfort, look at a chick fly. Say what you want about the validity of the show, but it is absolutely real. I know people who participated in the show, and they confirmed it. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh, watch this show. These are some of the best comedy shows ever made.
