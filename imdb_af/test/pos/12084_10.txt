I just looked at "who will love my kids" to buy when I came across this site and a co-Briton entry! I'm a big fan of this movie and would, and have recommended it to everyone. What I have found satisfactory is finding someone else who finds comfort in the good will of others. I also have a son with Aspergers and it is also my fear to think if anything ever happened to me and my husband, that someone not only wants to accept my beautiful 'normal' daughter, but also my special and gifted son . Missing at home and having people with the same values ​​as myself are more meaningful than you know. To stay here in the US, I met someone who saw this movie. So for anyone who reads it, if you haven't seen it, make an effort to do so. It's a very moving experience, especially for anyone who is a parent, or even if you only have a sympathetic leg in your body, you will cry and beg. Then you will count your blessings, and for everyone who has ever been through an experience like or near this one, my heart goes out to you. It makes me realize no matter how difficult or stressful it is, remember that there is always someone worse than you. A wonderful movie and what makes it more powerful is the fact that it is based on a true story. Don't be frightened by how sad it is, at the same time, this movie is heart warming and encourages you for the strength and goodness of humanity.
