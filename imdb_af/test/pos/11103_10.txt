There is something about real stories that makes them so much more interesting than fiction. I think it's the fact that truth is always strange as fiction. The Falcon and Snowman tell the true story of Christopher Boyce and his friend Daulton Lee. Boyce (Hutton) is a former alter boy and intellectual, trying to find a career that can support and entertain him. His FBI father can pull some strings and his idealistic son gets a job working in the defense department. Boyce has few responsibilities and seems struggling to drink and to go with his co-workers. However, as time goes on, Boyce begins to learn with top secret information causing him to doubt the morality of his government. The idealist Boyce soon sees the illegal activities that the CIA performs in all places in Australia. Boyce finally decides to leak some of the top secret information he owns to the KGB. Of course, Boyce's mistake is the assumption that because the US is doing bad things, the USSR is the good man. Over time, Boyce and his drug dealer, Lee (Penn), start selling their top secret information to the KGB. What once was idealism becomes capitalism and espionage. The strength of this movie is the incredible performances of Hutton and Penn. Although one of them starts with the best of intentions, they will soon find themselves in an eternal downward spiral. Great direction, music, everything. Not just a good movie, but one of my all-time favorites.
