It's an amazing piece of drama and powerful that hits you. I found that the movie was very good and became unsuitable with the two main characters, it was represented by both Michael and Rory in a big show. Whether the story is based on a true story. I feel the story has been trying to give the audience a message that must, as a whole, respect and feel the general public for the needs of the disabled and that they should have the same chance as any other person. Generally, this film comes into my soul and I also feel touched by the actors and the director sends creativity to it. The whole picture is that some actors play the play outside their character and only show part of the character that is promising to the audience, but I feel that these two have been very good at their talents as their talented talent to play a masterpiece drama. image. Surely one that should not be missed!
