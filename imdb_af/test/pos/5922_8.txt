Billy Wilder continues with his strong run films during the 1950s with a biography of Charles Lindbergh, the young American pilot who became the first man to fly solo across the Atlantic in 1927. Jimmy Stewart plays Lindbergh and while he may be too old For the part, he still brings the genuine warmth and confidence needed, as well as his trademark of earthly goodness that makes him an iconic movie star. Wilder stays solid and balances the background story with humor and drama to give us a clear description of what Lindbergh opposes when he decided to tackle this challenge. It's definitely not his or Stewart's best job, but it's a jewel of a movie. It lifts your spirits by plane and makes you proud to be an American. Overall, this is not good.
