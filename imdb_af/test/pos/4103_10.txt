I am surprised that production companies will sue because of reproduction they will not provide. I've been on the DVD for DVD and VHS for a while. One can get all kinds of movies on the right path ... old movies, new movies ... but they are all aimed at a particular group. This movie is very nostalgic for many. I'm not sure why I can't get a copy. Perhaps if enough people enter, the copyright holder will get an idea. It's about time to make it happen. Yes, it's date, but so is the wizard of OZ. It doesn't seem to be that hard. So, for now, I will see the illegal copies on search engines like many others.
