I saw the cable for the first time in the early 80's. It was unique as a statement about the sixties, culture, war, music, race, and a lot of things I was sure I missed. But about a year ago it came to my life again when I started enjoying it with my son. He is a little young (9) for many of the themes in it, but he understands dance hippies are fun to watch, and he gets the idea that the end is ironic. While I can't think of other movies in this genre, it does have a single genius that I love. It also offers a unique justice to Central Park. Most of my music is lost in some way. "Tommy" was up and down in the direction, "Oliver" looked like crowd controlled on the silver screen, "The Wall" was so much abstract self important and indulgent dribble, but listen to "Failure of the Meat" of her sound right for our times today, as it did in the eighties, as it should have in the sixties ... truly timeless.
