I was very impressed with this movie, than for nothing but for the comedy. It may not be the most noble, wittiest humor at all times, but I do it for every scene. <br /> <br /> The flow of the movie is definitely a bit jumbled, sometimes confusing, but that's how the characters feel. Sometimes we look at some slapstick and other scenes revolve around a crucial discourse on relationships. It may be a bit frustrating for some viewers, but it has brought me closer to the characters' dilemmas of irregular chaos. <br /> <br /> The acting is wonderful from everyone. I'm a big Andy Richter fan, but I wasn't head over heels as everyone seems to be. He did very well, but Julianne Nicholson and Lauren Graham stole the show for me, both in their respective ways. Jay Mohr does as expected, if you've seen him in other movies. I've always loved him. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is very funny and offers some good foundations for some types of relationships. As for relationship issues and problems, try some movies to surprise. There is nothing surprising about the conclusions presented here, but it is entertaining to see how it is revealed by the film.
