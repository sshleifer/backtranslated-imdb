I'll have to say it's a good movie. <br /> <br /> Mike Judge has an eye for things no one will ever see. Declaring the eclipse of society and survival of the strongest is a mere pipe dream in 500 years. That pop culture and mass marketing by wealthy companies tend to rule the day. Yes, there is a lot of potty humor in it and it is to make the story move and its point over. But the real frustration on the face of Private Joe Bowers is priceless and some may all connect with one another at some point in our lives. <br /> <br /> If you don't enjoy the humor then look from a different point of view and watch it again. It has twice looked at me to really appreciate this movie for what it is ?? And having said that after watching it twice? I'm going to read a book now.
