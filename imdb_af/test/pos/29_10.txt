<br /> <br /> What else can you ask for? A great screenplay based on one of the best plays of the second half of the 20th century, two fine emotional performances by Courtney and Finney, a realistic vision of wartime London, a major supporting role. This movie takes you on an emotional roller coaster through humor, sadness, loss and fulfillment. If you're in the theater, it's even more effective. It's a real 10 on the rating scale!
