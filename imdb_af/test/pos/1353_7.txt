The title role of these westerns is played by Robert Walker, Jr. He is a young rifle that is divorced with partner David Carradine after completing a contract report on a Mexican general. To avoid their pursuers, Carradine and Walker are divorced. Walker comes across the camp of lawmaker Robert Mitchum, who enjoys Walker and is a protégé and recycling project of all kinds. <br /> <br /> This is the first of two films Robert Mitchum has with author / director Burt Kennedy. The second was the more humorous The Good Guys and the Bad Guys. <br /> <br /> Not that Young Billy Young doesn't have his moments of hilarity. But it's a triple story about Walker Recycling, Mitchum's hunt for the bad murder of his son and a romantic triangle with Mitchum, Angie Dickinson, and city boss Jack Kelly. <br /> <br /> The movie is abundant with nepotism. David Carradine is John's son. Dean Martin's daughter Deana is here, Walker is the son of Robert Walker and Jennifer Jones and Mitchum's son. Chris plays Mitchum's son in a few silent flashbacks. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum has started in the West and always looks right at home in them. Angie Dickinson essentially repeats the role she had in Rio Bravo. Walker had a short career to play rebellious youth and do a good job. I often wondered what happened to him. He looked like his dad hurriedly. Maybe he didn't want to come like a tragic early end. <br /> <br /> And that wasn't enough, Mitchum fans hear old messy eyes and sing the title song at the beginning of the movie.
