If you are looking for an original horror flick, this can be the one for you. It is strange and sometimes depends on stupidity, but it is just such a nice, fine-sounding and original film, it never fails, except perhaps during the ear long climax. Farmers (Craig Sheffer) had dreams of a town called Midian full of mutant creatures. A night game is a must for horror fans, or for fans of monster movie decorations. <br /> <br /> Boone (Craig Sheffer) In his therapy dr. Decker (terrorist director David Cronenberg), his psychiatrist, concluded that Boone is a killer and gives him hallucinogenic pills. He says he must penetrate him. After almost killed, Boone ends at the hospital. , where he is in a mental patient who also knows Midian, and tells Boone where to go. Midian, located in a cemetery, is inhabited by filthy mutant creatures that don't allow Boone. After escaping with a nasty bite, Boone is shot dead by police, dr. Decker was led to his place. But Boone is not dead. The bite causes him to live, and he goes to Midian. Meanwhile, Boone's girlfriend, Lori (Anne Bobby), tries to find Boone and comes downstairs. When dr. Decker also finds out about this place, comes chaos. <br /> <br /> The plot looks long and complicated, but it's not really difficult to understand. The plot, among other things, makes this movie very interesting. The makeup effects are amazing. The creatures look unique and wonderful, making it a very attractive film. To add to more sense appeal, we have a musical score by Danny Elfman, it is both lush and bouncy, and fits the movie like a glove. The shots in the movie are also beautifully set up. The cinematography is beautiful, and the movie creates an atmosphere that is never broken. Even the acting is good, with the greatest surprise as director David Cronenberg, who gives a big, threatening performance as the man who wants to see Boone dead for some reason. It's strange that a horror movie is doing this well. <br /> <br /> The trouble with the movie ... Well, there are a few, but the positives are heavier than the negatives. The script contains the occasional lame jokes to try to add humor, but almost everyone falls flat. The mutant creatures look good and for the most part, well behaved, but sometimes they feel that they just represent their wonderful makeup for the camera. The worst part of the movie would be the climax. It lasts so long and is just constant chaos. It's part of the movie that moves from individual characters to nice sturdy shots, fiery explosions of every direction and violence that happens to characters we don't know or care about. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is great to watch. It's a well done horror movie, but even with that said, it occasionally has a failure in character's lines, and a messy climax. Yet it is one to check. <br /> <br /> My rating: *** from ****. 101 minutes. R for strong violence and language.
