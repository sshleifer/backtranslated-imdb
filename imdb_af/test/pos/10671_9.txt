I'm a big space buff, and nearly 44, I first discovered this for the first time. I came in a roundabout from space 1999, when UFO came. I went for other Anderson creations and found it to be their first live action. What a home run! I heard from this movie many years ago, but never knew what it was called, so I'm glad to get it by accident. <br /> <br /> This Andersons was nothing too wonderful in their writing, performing the completely credible and realistic models, the quality of acting, and so on. <br /> <br /> I don't think it doesn't look dated at all. Let me tell you ... I'll take good old models about the fake-looking CGI crap today! Seriously, most of the rocket scenes look pretty real. They gave it to a science! If you choose to think about what you actually consider, it's hard to believe it. <br /> <br /> Also the amount of detail in set designs, beautiful photography, the whole look. Man, I wish I could go back to that time! They knew how to make movies in the 60's. Personally, I lost all interest in Hollywood movies today. Anyone with a budget can do CGI. I hate it! Bring back the models! Think of all the people who used style! Anyway, I'm ranting. :-) If you like good sci-fi, this is very well done, you will do a service yourself by watching it.
