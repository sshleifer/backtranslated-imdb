This is just my favorite movie. Nothing special. It's just as incredibly detailed. Make me cry, just think about it. Geronimo Bill is the nicest man I can imagine. Money is not important. Bamboos are important. You don't need money to get what you need. If you need something, it just comes to you. If people would realize that the world would be a much better place. Whatever you do, don't do it for the money.
