I was recently happy to see Ingrid Bergman's name on a movie I have never seen from AMC. What a happiness. <br /> <br /> Wondering about her flawless and seamless performance is not the only reason to stay late and watch this movie. The writing is wonderfully comical and the performances are excellent. <br /> <br /> Walter Mathau (not my favorite) was almost perfect and Goldie Hawn (surprisingly) was fantastic. Tender at times, demanding, then just plain goofy. There are times in the movie that even the most hardened movie viewer will be trapped in the story and forget that it is a movie. <br /> <br /> Being able to steal a dance scene among a 20-year-old crowd was great to watch. She is effortlessly returning to the screen (at age 54?). The supporting role was great and the lines ... the lines are beautiful. <br /> <br /> A top 5 romantic comedy of all time.
