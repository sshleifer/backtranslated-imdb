Since I watched the trailer in "The Little Mermaid II: Back to the Sea" DVD, I felt this movie was going to be good because I'm a big Disney fan. And guess what? I'm right! This film is a very worthy successor to the original classic "Lady and the Tramp". <br /> <br /> It tells the story of Scamp, Lady and Tramp's mischievious son Scamp, who wants to be wild and free instead of living. a domestic life. Although the movie may not be as good as the first one, it has a great moral that you could not find anywhere else until you see it. <br /> <br /> I admit that the movie is not for everyone, but those who hate it, all I can say is that you don't have a spirit for this and I suggest you don't should not see. But hey! It's really a wonderful story, full of brilliant animation, music and star-filled voice talents with Scott Wolf (Party of Five) and Alyssa Milano (Charmed). So if you haven't seen the movie, why are you standing there? Go grab the copy!
