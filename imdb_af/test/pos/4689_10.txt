I remember remembering every series of this series every Saturday night. It was the highlight of the week. I liked it all, the place, the costumes, the actors and the wonderful music by Clannad (I still have their Legend album). I loved how they solved the problem of Michael Praed to leave by creating another Robin, this time the Count of Huntingdon. I believe there were legends of several Robins in the Middle Ages. Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors. I'm sure Robin and his men will be young, and yet people didn't live that long in those days. Other Robins always look too old (Kevin Costner with his ridiculous accent looks like Robin's grandfather). The only sad thing was the end, it is a pity that they could not at least do a one-off special to tie all the loose points and make it a happier end.
