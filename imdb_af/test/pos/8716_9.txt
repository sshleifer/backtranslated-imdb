I have to agree with all the previous commentaries - it's simply the best of all scary comedies, with Bardot as sexy as Marilyn Monroe ever, and definitely with a more beautiful face (maybe there is less mystique, but watch Marilyn pay for it. ) I don't think I've seen such a succulent woman on the screen, so perfect that even a gay man like me got excited - and not just for pure aesthetic reasons (if the idiot really wants evangelists to get them) convert-a-queer number to do, they really need to improve their standards, as no church mice are needed here.) Her breasts, the rest of her figure, her lovely voice, the hilarious way she shakes as his ear. walking a room ... just to get in front of a man, breasts literally seemed like it was in a beautiful confrontation ... <br /> <br /> I think Boyer is one of the greatest leading men in all film history . No one has played the opposite more great female stars than he had: Garbo, Dietrich, K. Hepburn, Colbert, and here Bardot, among many others. And he was also in 'Fanny' with Leslie Caron, and has small parts in 'How to steal a million' with A. Hepburn, as well as in the Deneuve movie 'The April Fools' (though not to her. ) The only thing I cannot disagree about is that even the harsh, unpleasant music about the opening credits is appropriate. Bardot is not meant to be subtle, above all and her essential hardness (I don't mean her voice) is part of her irresistible and even exemplary charm. <br /> <br /> Vidal is really attractive, even though pouty Brigitte says to begin with: â€œI don't know why I am in love with you, you are not even pretty. '<br /> <br /> Dear, dear Bardot! Actually, one of the wonders of the 20th century, not to mention the joy she still has with us, when so many of the truly characterful pass away so quickly in all her eccentric glory.
