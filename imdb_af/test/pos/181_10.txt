While Boris (Aleksey Batalov), in a war against the Germans, fights his mother Russia, his beloved Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) marries, in a moment of weakness, with a chick cousin Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin) soon after her parents in air was killed. attack on Moscow. Through various trials and treason, Veronika will wait for Boris's word or letter, no matter how long it takes, hoping to return to her. <br /> <br /> Powerful film work simply boasts incredible photographic work by filmographer Sergei Urusevsky. Some of the very beautifully framed moving shots include the scene where the camera Follow Veronika goes through a crowd of loved ones who say goodbye to each other while running through the gang of bodies to say goodbye to Boris .. and don't reach him right even if we look at Boris looking impatiently in the swarm without luck. The series to the air report where Veronika walks up the steps and the ruined building she once brought home, and the scene where Mark makes his lovely move on Veronika, as another air attack continues just outside the building like the wind The curtains stir and flashes of Light radiation are just two of the many examples where Sergei Urusevsky shows his genius at the images of images that will last forever on film. But without the power and the tragedy of the story about how war can forever form the fate of a couple who just love the love of each other, this movie cannot hold the beauty of the visual alone. Together, however, we passed an incredible movie. Just a ghostly masterpiece of the Soviet Union after Stalin took his last breath. I feel honored, have seen such a good movie.
