Another in the long line of "Do not" movies of the late 70's and early 80's, this one is much more than that. This movie is a highly understated low budget slider with a twist. It has the grain quality and bizarre soundtrack characteristic of horror movies of the period, but it is the highly understated performance of the surprisingly talented actors / actresses that make this movie good. A young nurse comes to dr. Stephens's progressive mental hospital after being murdered by one of his patients and it doesn't seem to be. Dr. Masters, a fairly ambitious female doctor, took over her duties and began to implement her own ideas. Each of the patients uses their own unique personalities and have their own personality traits and errors that provide for highly entertaining interactions. There is the nymphomania, the crazy fair, the woman with an unhealthy obsession with babies, and a man who has returned to his childhood. There is also a strange little twist to this bizarre story that later gets the young nurse trapped in the asylum with the patients running around and piling up bodies. If you're a fan of cheap 70's sleaze if it's the movie for you!
