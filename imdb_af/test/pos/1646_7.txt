It's not a bad TV movie. Shtrafbat is short for Shtrafnoy Batallion, which means Penal Batallion. Such battalions were formed as a result of the increasing demand for soldiers, as the Soviet Union had undertaken heavy casualties through the war. These battalions consisted of prisoners and unjust soldiers who were given the chance to remove their names by proving themselves in battle. They were looked down on as foam and were easily spent during fighting without much regret, or much honor, on the military side. They were often sent on suicide missions and suffered tremendous casualties. Those who refused to fight were sighted. Needless to say, their lives sucked. <br /> <br /> There were some very good performances by the cast, especially by Yuri Stepanov who played Antip, Aleksandr Bashirov who played Stirah, and Roman Madyanov who played Major Kharchenko. However, the range is not really addictive, because it is too long, it can be much shorter and so effective. <br /> <br /> Although it's about war, Shtrafbat has very soft violence and almost no Gore. It is solely for the actors to make it work, and that is a TV series, so the producers did not want to deter the viewers and the sponsors. <br /> <br /> Shtrafbat examines the cruelty of the Soviet regime, explaining why so many men chose to fight the Nazis instead of joining them. Personally, I'd rather be a fascist, then a communist gave the circumstances presented in the film. One character declares that the Soviet Union has stripped its farm of stripping and died of famine. Out of anger he burned it, which arrested him for destroying Kolhoz property and ended up in the criminal battalion as a criminal. Antip recalls how his mother killed her youngest son to feed the rest of the family. Both men explained that they fought for their motherland, rather than the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The criminal battalion had one Naval Infantry that raped a girl, killed his comrade, threatened others. comrade to keep his mouth over both trials, and then suffer injury when it comes to fighting. In addition, the girl committed suicide because of shame. I suggest if enough Marines watched this movie, they would pick up banners and street riots and get calls for a boycott or an official apology from the producers. <br /> <br /> To say the least, I recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the former Soviet Union or World War II. I don't think I wasted 500+ minutes of my life.
