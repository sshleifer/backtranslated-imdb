"Crossfire" is apparently a murder mystery, but what distinguishes it from other similar films of the era is the murderer's motive, which is anti-Semitism. The story highlights examples of the kind of ignorance that offends burns and contains references to a "hillbilly" and an Irish immigrant who also suffered abuse because of their ethnicity. <br /> <br /> The movie's plot is based on Richard Brooks's novel "The Brick Foxhole" that deals with a hate crime where the victim was gay. It is ironic that this story about a form of intolerance with intolerance needs to be addressed by the censorship officers, which stipulated that screen type should be the type of wizard involved in anti-Semitism. Another irony is the actions of a soldier who is very proud of the fact that he served in a war against the Nazis and yet embraced their hatred of Jews. The director and producer of this movie also had another kind of intolerance when they were blacklisted after being called to appear before the "Un-American Activities Committee". All of these points seem to portray the deeply entrenched and unbearable nature of the whole story problem as depicted in this movie. <br /> <br /> When police chief Finlay (Robert Young) investigates the murder of Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene), he discovers it on the night he was murdered, Samuels had a group of soldiers and one of These people, Morgan Mitchell (George Cooper), are quickly identified as the main suspect. Further information is also collected at Montgomery (Robert Ryan), who was one of the soldiers present that night and Sergeant Keeley (Robert Mitchum) who is a friend of Mitchell. Keeley, with the help of other soldiers, then searches for Mitchell and, when he gets him, hears his account of what he did on the night of the murder, including his encounter with a dance vase called Ginny Tremaine (Gloria Grahame). <br /> <br /> Keeley helps Michell prevent him from being arrested and tries to identify the killer. Ginny Tremaine is questioned but her information is insufficient to prove Mitchell's innocence, but Finlay's investigations have taught him to recognize the motive for the crime. After that, he made an extensive fall, leading the right culprit to exposing his own debt. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is a movie with a message and the identity of the killer is revealed at a very early stage in the story. The "message" is conveyed in a way that is undoubtedly suitable for the period in which it was made, but according to today's standards, it seems rather heavy handed. The cinematography by J Roy Hunt is just wonderful with low key lighting and creative use of many strategically placed table lamps that combine to create a look that is perfectly compatible with the screenplay being played. <br /> <br /> Despite a low budget production, "Crossfire" was a good cashier success and benefited from an absorbing and highly relevant story with a wonderful role, two of which were nominated for the Oscar Best Supporting Actor Awards (Robert Ryan) and Best Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame). The additional nominations for Edward Dmytryk (Best Director), producer Adrian Scott (Best Picture) and John Paxton (Best Writing, Custom Screening), are just further evidence of the positive recognition this film is justly receiving.
