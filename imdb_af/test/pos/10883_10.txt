This game requires stealth, clever, and steady hand. The game is simply the best; In addition, the interesting extras - bullet holes remain in the walls, enemies respond to specific points where they are affected by dots. There are tons of moves that are captured, which the enemies look very real (for example, when you look through a window at a guard he will stand there, swing flies away, sneeze or scratch himself), the list goes on. This is the best licensed / movie conversion ever and puts you in the shoes of the supreme super spy. This game is the best reason for owning a N64.
