This big movie never appeared in my town, so I didn't really have the opportunity to see it until the late 80's when I caught it on German television. I expected something of a disaster, and instead had a well-educated backyard with excellent work. The small tube could not really damage it and there is almost no dull moment in this 4-hour movie. I hope to see it again on the big screen. What a spectacle would be! Don't miss it if you ever get the chance. Unfortunately, the hard handling of the Heaven Gate at his opening destroyed Michael Cimino's career, and he went from the Year of the Dragon to the annoyingly ridiculous (The Sicilian) and the screaming stupor (Desperate Hours).
