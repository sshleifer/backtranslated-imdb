I have never read a good review for "Vanity Fair" and I can't understand why. For something rushed in ten days, everything comes out surprisingly well. Although Becky Sharp is a better movie and Miriam Hopkins is a better Becky, there's nothing to stop this one from getting a solid 9/10. Sometimes Myrna Loy can just be too cute and fun to play a full bitch, but at other times she just has to move her eyes and the air temperature drops a dozen degrees. Meow! The move to a more modern environment didn't work against "Vanity Fair" and the only thing that really causes conflict is decisive. Barbara Kent (Amelia) was less than 5 feet, and very few of the top men were also very long - all of it to make Loy look like an absolute Amazon woman! <br /> <br /> "Vanity Fair" is similar to "Craig's Wife", to what extent the main character is, you must love her. And you know she deserves her turn, and then some, but you still feel sorry for her when she gets it. Although based on the same story as "Becky Sharp", this version had a different end, which is interesting to see because most of the movies were almost identical. For the fun value, the ending of Becky Sharp is finally better, though aesthetic, and from the flow of the story, there is no doubt that the end of "Vanity Fair" is the better, or you really want it.
