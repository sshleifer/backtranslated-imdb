Battleship Potemkin is a celluloid mill. The direction of <br /> <br /> Eisenstein is really a face. The film chronicles a ship of dissatisfied <br /> <br /> sailors who are tired of being abused by their commanders. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the sailors finally got enough of the abuse and sent the <br /> <br /> officials packing. During this period there was a shortage of films <br /> <br /> in the Soviet Union. The government wanted to issue their message <br /> <br /> to the people, so they started a National Film Company and one from <br /> <br /> the members were Sergei Eisenstein. The movies were shot at minimal <br /> <br /> budgets and the shortage of movie stock forced Eisentein to be careful <br /> <br /> and selectively with the footage he shot. In the end, Eisenstein <br /> <br /> reused the footage to make a picture of the feature. <br /> <br /> The best known of the action pieces in this movie is the much <br /> <br /> talking about massacre on the stairs. This scene is paved in Bananas <br /> <br /> and most recently in Brian De Palma's The Untouchables. If you <br /> <br /> want to make movies, I strongly encourage you to see Battleship Potemkin. <br /> <br /> This is one of the essentials. <br /> <br /> A +
