Mary Pickford plays Annie Rooney - the daughter of a policeman who lives in the difficult part of town. She is a rough and tumbled young woman of indefinite age (somewhere between 12 and 16) who loves to scrap, but deep in the deep is a heart of gold. <br /> <br /> It's a very typical movie style for Mary Pickford. Like so many of her films, she plays a young girl - even though she was almost 40 when she made LITTLE ANNIE ROONEY. And like many other stories, she was brave and courageous. As a result, I had a strong sense of dough. Now if you haven't seen her other movies, it's not a problem. However, she actually plays a character like the one in SPARROWS or DADDY LONG LEGS - although these two other films are much better. Now it's not to say it's a bad movie - just that it's definitely not below her best work - mainly because of a scary story that is very much in the mood but not very convincing. Entertainment, but not essential, unless you are a big fan of silence.
