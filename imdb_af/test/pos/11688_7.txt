If you like this movie, have a look at others directed by Hrebejk. Unfortunately, it's not his best, but still millions of times better than an average movie from the mainstream theater. It explores relationships, especially the offensive, has some powerful as well as sweet moments and great acting. Some sudden inconsistencies, clich√©s, and hollow moments descend the overall effect. To the previous reviewer and his comments on the Czech psyche: an interesting approach, but I do not see this movie becoming a Czech blockbuster. These people are rather spoiled by their filmmakers (see also things by Sverak, Gedeon) and this one goes a bit behind.
