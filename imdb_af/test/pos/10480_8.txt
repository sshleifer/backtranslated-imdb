If you find this movie so slow for the first 30 minutes that you wonder why you're watching it, don't give up. The Danish language is also a little new to most North Americans, who do not see and hear many Danish films. Anyway, as the film progresses, it gets better and better and the viewer is rewarded for his / her patience. <br /> <br /> As a fan of the movie, "Out of Africa," this film attracted my interest because it was based on a short novel by Isak Dinesen (Karen Blixen), the main character in that movie. <br /> <br /> The meal - Babette's feast - was wonderful. I'm not a chef, but I was impressed! How one also interprets, varies the story, I suppose depending on how much you read here and where you are religious. If the latter, how you look at the definition of "legalism," it can influence how you interpret this story. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a fine movie, but don't watch it if you eat diet. .
