As "Love Me Tonight" is "the musical for non-musical people," The Gay Desperado "is definitely not a musical for non-opera people. In fact, despite being based on comic operetta, it's not really a musical, but a spoof bandit story with interpolated non-related arias to portray the voice of one character; and what a voice it is. <br /> <br /> Nino Martini, as the young singer Chivo joining the bandit troop to get a spot on the radio (no, the plot doesn't make much sense either later or ...), has a glorious golden tenor whose style has not dated a day since the time it was recorded. The vibrations and warblings of some of his musical contemporaries are in an early fashion, but it is very easy to portray Chivo that Nessun Dorma is running to a World Cup crowd and adding cards to the process. Unfortunately, while having an engaging grin and a decent dramatic series, he can no longer act and sing. The result is that the otherwise fast-paced movie begins to knock off a shocking stance every time Chivo puts his hand on his chest and the viewer's tolerance of the result is likely to depend on his appreciation for operational performance. <Br /> <br /> Apart from this, the film is a pleasant broad-brush satire on Hollywood conventions and especially the Mexican bandit stereotype. It achieves the important goal of all such spoofs to make its characters enough in their own right to keep the viewer's interest when the joke would otherwise have been outdated. The bandit head and his sidekick have the traditional dual aspect. There is a mysterious pony with a cut-teak face and an enthusiastic heroine (a young Ida Lupino) who performs the generic. "You say you hate me, but you love me. Really" routine with a refreshing twist. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is entertaining and pretty funny, and I feel that I got my money's dignity - but it can't be denied that the musical interludes, while admirable in their own way, pose serious pauses for.
