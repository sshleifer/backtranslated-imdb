This movie was an incredible tribute to anyone who suffered this kind of pain and suffering. The acting was not the greatest, I will admit it, but it was passionate about his message, sending people into prisons without so much as a lawyer or any kind of trial being cruel and unusual. They even had a damn trial for Saddam, so why doesn't every suspected terrorist have a kind of fair trial or trial on why they were marked in the first place? I'm going off the movie, but I think it's worth noting this sick, twisted idea that the government has. The film's way of telling the story and the background was a wonderful secret. The whole movie, I tried to connect the girl with the plot and it eventually became very clear. There is no doubt that directing was incredible, but the one thing I didn't mind was that there was not so much emphasis on Reese Witherspoon's character's interest and struggle in the ideal she liked. Otherwise, it was actually quite entertaining, and most of me kept my attention and interest for the two hours it played.
