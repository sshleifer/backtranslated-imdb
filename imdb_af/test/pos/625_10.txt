It is definitely one of the scariest and most thrilling films ever made. From the start to the end, you are sitting on the movie. Although there are a few plot holes, it remains exciting for the final jump. Apart from "8 MM" and "Peeping Tom", it is one of the best films about "Snuff Movies", a taboo theme of our culture. If you like the SCREAM Trilogy, you'll probably like that one.
