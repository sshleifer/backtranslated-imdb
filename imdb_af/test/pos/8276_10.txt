I wasn't - not most of the judges - born in the 80's. I was born on May 14, 1994. Despite this, my life was very much in the 80's style. When other kids were playing, I played Zelda on my NES. Now this movie has a special place in my heart, although I was only 15 years old when writing this review. Because of my 80-year-old style, I watched early childhood, many TV shows and watched many movies that other children did not see, and this movie was one of them and also one of the biggest. <br /> <br /> It starts in the Los Angeles home of Alvin Seville, Simon Seville, Theodore Seville and David Seville. Dawid, the Chipmunk's adoptive father, is in a hurry to go to the airport as he goes on a business trip across Europe. His taxi is almost there and The Chipmunks help him pack. As they speak, Alvin expresses his will to come with Dave to see the world (Although technically Dave just goes to Europe, so to Alvin, apparently only America and Europe qualifies as "The World"). David leaves the chipmunks in the care of me. Miller, much to the dissatisfaction of the boys. Soon Dave is coming to the airport and the Chipmunks are left at me at home. Miller. Later, the Chipmunks in a local cafe play a 30-day match against the Chipettes (Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanore). After losing the game to Britain after his Hot Air Balloon was eaten by a crocodile from the sky, Alvin got an argument with Brittany about who would really win a race around the world. Two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table, Klaus and Claudia Furschtien dominate their argument and have a safe way to transport their diamonds all over the world, deciding to trick the children into delivering them. They set up a race across the globe, where each team must deposit a doll in their own parable (Secret filled with diamonds) on drip tracks around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team's conformity (secrets filled with payment for the diamonds) to verify that they were there. The winning team will then receive a $ 100,000 reward. They do this because they believe Jamal (an Interpol agent who has been hot on their heels a few times) will never suspect them because they are just children. (However, it seems to be superfluous, because on their travels the kids I don't have to make sure, and are never even questioned about the dolls, I suspect Klaus or Claudia would not personally take the diamonds there.) And so a great adventure begins. This movie is a classic and I see no reason why anyone would not want it. It features great animation and top-notch voice acting, not to mention the Kick-ass music (Pardon my French: P). My favorite song is undoubtedly "The Girls and Boys of Rock and Roll" a wonderful rock song that can't be at the top. It's also my favorite moment in the movie. Other notable songs include '' Lucky '' (Kind of suggestions for a child's movie?) And '' My Mother '' as well as' Wooly Bully '' and '' Off to see the world '' Don't speak not the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the Royal London Philharmonic Orchestra. The scene with "My mother" still brings a tear to my eye. Regarding the song '' Getting Lucky '' I didn't even think about it, but when I got older and learned about life, it became clear that the song was a bit suggestive. The song, along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the Chipettes panties. This is especially evident in the scene in Egypt when the Chipettes are being chased by the Arab Prince's men, while Eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her dress suffers. Although it has nothing to do with the overall quality of the movie, it is one of those inexplicable things such as why no one in the world thinks that 4-foot-long Chipmunks are walking around and talking and treating incredibly high voices just like any human child would have. Anyway, a little bit to the scene, the Chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to get the chipmunks and go home. The direction of Janice Karman perfect this movie because she and her husband, Ross Bagdasarian Jr, know the characters better than anyone. They even do the voices of the Chipmunks and the Chipettes. Ross does the vote for Alvin and Simon (as well as Dave) and Janice votes for All the Chipettes and Theodore. Talking of male characters spoken by female voice actresses, Nancy Cartwright (The voice of Bart Simpson) makes a appearance in this movie. She plays the part of the Arab Prince, a very small but important role. Of course, the end is a happy one. The crooks are caught, the loose points are tied up. The movie ends when the kids, Dave and Mrs. Miller riding in the sunset. Alvin complains that he did not receive his $ 100,000 reward to win the race, which Dave annoyed until he finally shouted "" ALVIN! '' And the screen fades to black <br /> <br /> Classic ends, casually. I hope you found my review of this movie useful, and if you haven't seen this movie, give it a watch. It is worth the effort. These 80's Nostalgic classics get a solid 10 out of 10. <br /> <br /> "Headin" for the top, you don't know! we never stop believing now "
