John Ford made the wagons his tribute to a special photo, "Wagon Master," after two great Indian cavalry epics ... This is a beautiful poetic movie, full of romantic reincarnation of the pioneering spirit ... It doesn't To top it off too much ... <br /> <br /> Photos are very simple ... The camera only moves once or twice in the whole movie, and never when a director made it not moving to underline a shot. Ford resists the temptation to locate his camera in the breathtaking twilight of the women pulling in the dust behind their carriages. They come and go while the camera remains immobile and the audience remains a spectator after the march of history, not a participant in it. Of course, if Ford wants to engage his audience emotionally or dramatically, as in 'Stagecoach', he just knows how to do it ... But 'Wagon Master' is a soft, nostalgic look backwards ... <br /> < Filled with traditional Western songs by The Boys of the Pioneers, it tells of the draw West to Utah (in 1879) of a Mormon wagon train led by Ward Bond in the role of Parent Wiggs, and two Young Horse Dealers (Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr.) And in a series of beautiful images, such as the wagon train the foreigner fight, Indians and nature are struggling to reach the "Promised Land", the modest "Wagon Master" "able to capture the history and legend of the West ... /> <br /> Ford himself said that" Wagon Master "(of which he wrote the original story) was one of the three films of his" the closest thing I wanted to achieve 'came. <br /> <Ford's career as a Western director was astounding, more than anyone else could use the genre to protect his feelings about the family, society and the American way of life. Ford saw the border as a country dubbed by a special class of settlers and legislators, whose big sacrifices made the country safe from those who follow. These early Westerners were giants who deserved the legendary status they deserved and the civilized townspeople who followed, should always keep them in fear and respect ... Ford's Westerners often use flashbacks that emphasize historical All the authenticity of its approach ... <br /> <br /> For example, in 'Wagon Master', folk songs on the soundtrack tell us about the hardship of the pioneers of a century ago, and Ford shows them to us in almost documentary fashion. In one order the train was camped in a circle and the settlers decided to hold a square dance. To form a dance floor, they have to put boards over the desert sand and with this ritual festival Ford shows the desert defeat through the metaphor of aboard the land ... <br /> <br /> It's a beautiful movie full of wonderful light optimism and easy to understand why Ford found it so satisfying? It never breaks faith with the mood and style made in the first few rows? But there is another question whether the ultra-romantic best fits the chosen theme. <br /> <br /> The wagon train experience had to be one of the most physically demanding and nervous trials man (with his wife) ever set himself? It had to be doubted? Was I wrong to sell and get everything? How can we hope to survive? How will we fight the other side ??? Almost every other hurts from the road? <br /> <br /> However, nothing in this feeling really comes across in "Wagon Master". The trip ?? so is the general ebullience? Do not strike one as particularly dangerous? It could be that the Mormons were so high on religious spirit that it tended to work as an anesthetic? In other words, their reactions were not those of normal human weakness. If so, Ford was right and the doubters were wrong? <br /> <br /> What is undoubtedly the right and proper ebullience, especially at the first meeting of Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. This is the essence of the light adventurous youth, especially one of the Western youths of those extraordinary times? This is a remarkable relationship and it remains in the mind?
