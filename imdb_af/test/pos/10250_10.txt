This film kept my interest from the beginning to the end, with lots of laughter and really on the earth acting through the whole casting. Glynn Turman, (Preach Jackson) is the star of the picture playing the role of a smart guy who loves poetry and has a very sexy girlfriend. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs (Cochise Morris) was an excellent athlete at the Cooley H.S. and even won a scholarship for a well-known college. There are scenes in this photo with the Chicago Police Department pursuing all of these dudes in a Cadillac and visiting the Lincoln Park Zoo with Monkey Mop being overturned. The music is excellent and there is fantastic photography around the city of Chicago. Great Movie, Enjoy.
