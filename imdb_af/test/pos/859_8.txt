I saw the movie yesterday and really enjoyed it. Although there were a few clues I could realize after the second time, I couldn't wake up the Dow-Dawn case. Maybe it was my indifference. The subconscious of a woman has become concrete with personalization. Let me get the key judgment of the movie. Let me get out of the deep deep of your brain and we'll both be free. A discrete film that forces the limits of human consciousness and brain. Anyone who has seen the 'Machinist' will realize the agreements with the dawn. A man who cannot escape his conscience (again a psychological and abstract concept) meets it in a man And he will only be free from acceptance and realize that there is no way of escape. Also, I would like to mention the actions of 'breaking dawn's stuffs.Thanks to not having many experiences, from actors and actresses to directors, each has a separate display of reasonable performance that has created a synergy that will enhance the quality of the movie
