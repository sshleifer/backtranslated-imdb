This is the movie that finally pushed me over to register with IMDb so that I could vote for (and comment on). I recently received well-projected "war" movies, and this is one of the most thoughtful things I have seen. <br /> <br /> "Stunning" is the word that comes to mind when I think of this viewing experience. My husband and I first watched the movie last night. It moves lightly but exciting at the same time (not a contradiction). This story in Hollywood's hands just became another smarmy, action packed Top Gun time warmer. <br /> <br /> The two main players playing Frantisek and Karel played each other wonderfully well. and Krystof Hadek is a very "beautiful" boy without exaggerating or exploiting it. In terms of Hadek's acting ability and appearance, my husband (tongue-in-cheek) said, "Well, he's not Tom Cruise." I replied, "Thank God!" If you appreciate beautiful and subtle acting, see this one.
