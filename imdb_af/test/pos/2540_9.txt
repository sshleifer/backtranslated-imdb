In his descriptions of CAA, platinum card meals in Hollywood, psychoanalysis, a vacation in Provincetown, have never taken, and free trips to Nicaragua, funded by Columbia images. <br /> <br /> It sounds narcissistic, but Spalding Gray (possibly because of his unusual personality) enters the audience, laughs at himself (perhaps because he didn't take the Hollywood thing so seriously) and cares. <br /> <br /> This monologue is not just about "The Murder Fields" or "Swimming to Cambodia"; it is more a pastiche of events, as he sees it. Some of the lines are classic, such as when Gray meets with the valued talent agents at CAA. The conference table is ... "full of them, brown, healthy, fresh to drink blue-green algae from an Oregon lake ... there's no drugs now." <br /> <br /> It was before the tragedy took place. Many of us will miss his off-balance humor. 9/10.
