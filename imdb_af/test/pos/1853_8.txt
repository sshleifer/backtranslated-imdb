When I saw the trailer for this movie, I didn't say aloud to anyone: "This movie is going to bomb." I also said that about the matrix and looking at what happened. Now I'm not a box office guru by any stretch, but I usually have a pretty good gut about what is going to be good and which really sucks. In this case, I was blinded by my complete and absolute apathy to David Duchovney. Let me propose this to you another way: I don't like her as a person (from what I read from him in interviews, he is incredibly pre-madonna like and he is full of himself considering everything he's done is X-File) or as an actor. PLAY GOD was a very poor movie, but he found out that for some reason he earned big money on the big screen. But I'm glad to say that although these things are still true about the man, Back to me is delicious and has the heart in the right place. Bonnie Hunt addressed a beautiful story and she told it with class and grace. This is one of the most romantic movies I've seen and although it may look a bit sad and maudlin in sight, it gives a chance and you'll be addicted. <br /> <br /> It must have been said (and it hurts me to do that) that the reason why this film works so well is because of the story and the cast. Duchovney and driver are so wonderful and credible that I honestly wanted to cry with them. There is a particularly powerful scene when Duchovney comes to the house after his wife dies and falls to the floor of his house. As it always does, the family dog ​​looks at the door to wait for his wife to come in. She didn't and with his shirt board still stained with blood, Rob (Duchovney) told me she didn't come home, ever. He then calls the dog to him and they seem to want to share a cry. The dog leaves a small cripple and then Rob calls. And this is one of the most realistic moments of pain I've ever seen in any character in any movie. You can feel his pain and at that moment I forgot I had watched an actor I generally didn't like, and I felt I was watching someone I knew he had lost his loved one. These are powerful things. <br /> <br /> Another strength of the movie is the supporting role. Bonnie Hunt combined an ethnic crucible with Irish and Italian characters who have a common bond. They share a bar called O'Reilley's Italian Pub. It is a wonderful name in itself. And the diametric scale of conflicting cultures is Carol O'Connor and Robert Loggia. These are two proud old men who love their homeland, but their granddaughter and cousin (respectively) believe them respectively. And that's the character Minnie Driver played. This scenario is ripe for comedy and Hunt doesn't miss anything here. <br /> <br /> Bonnie Hunt and James Belushi also share some funny moments as the middle-aged married couple and Belushi also gets points because he accepts humility gracefully. and pointing out of his spacious jaw of a stomach to laugh. With his family consisting of three or four children, there is very little time for him and the woman to have quality time. And again Hunt handles it with perfect elegance. <br /> <br /> It's a great story to find true love, to know how happy you have true love and the power of friendship and family. Back to me is a wonderful romance and although I don't have a great admiration for David Duchovney, I have to admit that he was perfect in this role and I couldn't figure out someone else's character. He was sensitive and credible and the movie was good because of him, not only because of him, but he certainly added to the taste. <br /> <br /> If you are a good romance and you want a good cry, then this is the movie for you. <br /> <br /> 8.5 out of 10 I will see anything that Bonnie Hunt is sticking out with her in the director's chair.
