Hynkel, dictator of Tomania, is a spoiled child who gets angry if he can't get what he really wants. And what he simply wants is nothing less than the world. <br /> <br /> In one of the extraordinary scenes of Chaplin art, Hynkel performs a ballet with the "world" that bursts when he thinks he has it in his grip. <br /> <br /> Chaplin also has some biting words about war and war films. In a scene at the beginning of the movie that takes place during World War I, the Tomanian messenger falls down and thinks ... He is going to die. In a state of delirium he starts ridiculous words ... The empty double talk continues in a brilliant run-off on all the heroic acts of War Movies ... <br /> <br /> In a different scene than he becoming a refugee in the Jewish ghetto and he commands the resistance that rebellion among the old men appears, he plans to kill the dictator. One of the groups must kill the relentless winner of Austerlich. Whoever is chosen will of course die, but his heroic death will be rewarded and his name will shine like a star in Tomanian history. <br /> <br /> The order in which he and four other characters contain cream cakes containing coins to determine which will sacrifice his life to kill the dictator is a bitter hilarity filled with great fear ... <br / > <br /> For all its disappointing shortcomings, the Great Dictator is another important film for the ironic sounds of the film. add something that Chaplin or else could have given: the irony of history ... The need to kill Hynkel prevents the murder attempt against Hitler by his generals ... The power of the original satire is only surpassed by history 's imitation of art ... <br /> <br /> With a beautiful series such as the duck shooting accident that causes the dictator to become the humble Jewish hairdresser and the other time wrong, "The Great Dictator" is Chaplin first talk film. This time, 'Charles' and not 'Charlie' doesn't want to say more through his movie and not through an amusing comedy, the last to use his celebrated 'Tramp Character'.
