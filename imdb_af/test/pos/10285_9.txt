In this time and character-driven romantic tragi comedy, we are given insight into the tangled lives of four thirty-and-eight Paris. In the middle is Vinz Cassell's depiction of Max. A star eye Romeo, he falls head over heels for beautiful stranger Lisa (Bellucci). Encouraged by his pleasant best friend, Lucien (Écoffey, in an understated but effective performance), he wins her heart and fortunately lives again ... it is up to the twilight, neurotic and obsessive Alice (the versatile Romane Bohringer) involved in the lives and love of the other three. <br /> <br /> The rich plot is thickened by a curious chronological jumble, and the movie appears as a complicated jigsaw, the candy of postcard Paris in the heart of it all. The use of color does not go unnoticed, especially in Lisa's spectacular apartment (probably taking into account the film's title), where the red and yellow cause the passion of passion and lust. <br /> <br /> The audience can relate to Max: he carries his heart on his sleeve and is constantly punished by irony and circumstances. In an unforgettable scene we miss our fiancé lovers (agonizingly separated by a choreographed misunderstanding) the opportunity to reunite themselves. Independently of each other, they travel to the same destination: her on the Metro, him in a taxi, almost tête-à-tête. Yet the fate seems to them, and the audience is fascinated. <br /> <br /> The performances in this movie are really what L'Appartement stands out. I still can't understand why Vincent Cassell is not a big star outside France. He has abundance of presence and diversity. Monica Bellucci (Cassell's real husband at the time of writing) recently found fame in the Anglo phone movie industry, but perhaps for the wrong reasons - where is his divine beauty, but behind it is a talented actress who can dominate a scene in classic "leading-lady" style, which rejects many British and American actresses in favor of the all too easy "subtle" approach. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch this movie! I doubt you will be disappointed. It is tempting, satisfying, amusing, sad, abundant, and a lesson in artistic films.
