I just came back from the European Premiere of the Gamers: Dorkness Rising. <br /> <br /> All I can say is that if you are a gamer (CRPG, RPG or LARP) then this movie is for you. And if you're not a gamer? Well, it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The acting is definitely not Oscar-worthy, but in the whole element of the movie it adds to the charm. The humor is everywhere, along with some very nice touches (the tribute to Gary Gygax is especially well done, if you can see it). The movie is a lot on Earth, with ordinary people enjoying a normal hobby. <br /> <br /> The quality of the movie's sound and vision is adequate, but it only adds to the atmosphere that helps to define this movie as the Dungeons and Dragons movie written by gamers for gamers carried out. <br /> <br /> Not afraid to use terminology specifically for one system, but they still manage to allow product placement. to be part of the film, but in a very understandable and completely just manner. It also affects some of the perceived prejudices that some gamers can have over other gamers and handle it properly. <br /> <br /> All in all, the movie is driven by a well thought-out balance of character, plot and entertainment (the Bard is incredibly good value for money). <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie makes it very difficult, so I gave it 2 scores. <br /> <br /> Score (for non-RPs): 7/10 (A few moments can go over your head, but the main sections of the movie work just as hard and reach so much more.) <br /> <br /> Score (for RPs): 10/10 (Everything fits together, in the perfect amount and with the perfect charm and sentiment)
