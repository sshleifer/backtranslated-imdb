I was amazed by this movie. I rented / rediscovered Antonioni's films, and this film has shown me the climax and fruits of his 50 year directing. What an eye for the setting, color and detail! I have never seen such visual beauty and poetry before. I had to stop after the first story and hold back the tears. Yes, beauty moves me, as if it moved Keats to write Ode on a Greek Urn. This movie is made for the adult, emotional and intellectual audience. Those who hope to see physical action and soap opera will be disappointed. I will have to watch this movie a few times before I really appreciate and judge it. This film should be required for all movies and directors. <br /> <br /> Maybe a really good movie, in the order of Kurosawa's Dreams.
