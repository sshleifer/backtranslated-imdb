In fact, Hans's isolation and despair are caused by a stereotypical-cute bourgeois mother, a nighttime woman and a lovers rejection. And despite the complex depiction - Hans himself does not actually make these demands - the above must also be an important part of Fassbinder's thinking (his use of Freud and Marx). But the viewer cannot look beyond Hans's gender and sexism to find the more difficult cause of his crushed spirit. <br /> <br /> Firstly, his mother's lack of love is highly unlikely in signing the Foreign Legion. It was much more likely, and was partly indicated as a quest for adventure, male companionship (escaping from the female world of mother and sister) and male identity itself - both the Legion and the war. <Br /> <br /> Second, Hans loses his successful work as a policeman because of his own sexism. Falling to a prostitute's will at work, he not only stompes prostitution as a repressive institution, but shows that he can't even control his sexuality in a professional arena - and even willing to make a desirable jeopardize career. <br /> <First, he commits serious verbal abuse against his wife in front of his sheep-like male friends, and makes no distinction between her absence or when she is looking for his presence. In fact, he is more brutal in her presence. <br /> <br /> A few hours later, in a violent and drunken state, he beat his wife in front of their daughter, interfering with her mother. The terror he puts into her and his daughter is significant. But both he - and the audience - are moving with a sniff of conscience or protest. Why? Because his wife is cruelly characterized as both crunchy and sexually debaucherous (yes, this can be Fassbinder's view of what capitalism holds for women, uncertain and commodity - but Hans lacks or Fassbinder's exploitation in the battery scene). <br /> <br /> And then there is this male rollover, which Hans can choose to reject and protest, but rather accept. He is too short for a masculine and also non-heroic to achieve worldly success that masculine role recommends. But how can it cause despair if he not only wins his lost love as a lover, but marries a tall woman who is considerably more attractive than himself. Finally, Hans Harry, his warship, left his wife's convincing stay Unlike them in their home. Through this decision he not only makes it clear that he is more connected to Harry than to his wife, but that the male band replaces his wife friendliness. And eventually replace his own life, because it is Harry's superior ability and spirit around the house that Hans's star is dropping. Hans, the trader, may to some extent be the victim of capitalism, but more on the point, he is the victim of his own confidence in his own male identity. His inability to let it go is the ultimate cause of his isolation and despair. <br /> <br /> It's something that is lost, I think, not only on Fassbinder, but also on Han's sister Anna. , only to some extent lost. For Anna's (and Fassbinder's) support of her brother - about her mother, it goes so far. She is very urgent that he can only save himself - that her support and love cannot prevent it herself. Unfortunately, she does not offer the same support and love for his wife, who must be much more embarrassed than Hans, but who can eventually pick up the pieces and save herself and daughter and offer a strong contrast. after Han's fall.
