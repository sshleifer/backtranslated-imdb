Australian helmet Alex Frayne, born by the United Kingdom, calls attention to his stranger, and requires a careful reading, visually beautiful Modern Love (2006). Following the steps of a man who is unable to control a drastic personality change caused by the death of a close relative, it offers a fascinating investigation into human psychology. Distributed by Accent Film-Australia. <br /> <br /> John (Mark Constable), his wife, Emily (Victoria Hill) and their son Edward (William Traeger) arrive in a small southern town to take care of his late uncle's (Don Barker) property. While Emily and Edward went to look at a local hotel, John began questioning locals about Uncle Tom's death. Some say he has committed suicide, some are unwilling to speak. Astonished John comes up with his own theory. Uncle Tom lives and hides in nearby forests. <br /> <br /> If not occasionally a dialogue used to alleviate its heavy atmospheric tone, Modern Love can easily be neglected for a Sokurov movie. Shot with a 16mm camera, its elaborate color scheme is strangely appealing to the Russian director's reflective commitment to human anxiety. Perhaps it is no coincidence that it was at the Moscow International Film Festival where modern love had its premiere. <br /> <br /> Look beneath the surface of this unique collage of intoxicating footage, revealing a slightly different picture - while Sokurov's movies tend to stay painfully intimate to the point where they deliberately loosening the surrounding area by blurring everything in a blast of director's leading yellow, Modern Love, many of the Australian countryside. John's gradual psychological transformation is dependent on it and the more the story progresses, the more it becomes clear that nature is an integral part of Frayne's vision. <br /> <br /> In Sokurov's Second Circle, a young man returns to the Russian countryside to bury his late father. In the cage where the old man once lived, everything was covered with dust. He collects the few scattered old clothes and puts his father's body in a coffin. Then he prays goodbye and bury it. The rest of the film is a long reflection on the collapse of the Soviet system. Loneliness and dissatisfaction remained. In Modern Love, somewhat ironic love is nowhere to be seen. On the contrary, it is pain, loneliness and dissatisfaction with the "modernity" that John's life suddenly enters. Unlike the Second Circle, but the main character has the opportunity to embrace his modern life. His wife and son were waiting for him, but he walked away. Slowly but surely, the family is starting to gain weight from a somewhat confusing past. <br /> <br /> I doubt Frayne intended for modern love to be as striking as Sokurov did in the Second Circle. Yet, the pacing, and especially the enigmatic framework, is exactly what makes this movie into a close meditative experience. A difficult and very fragile approach to deconstructing human psychology perfectly mastered the two directors. <br /> <br /> Mark Constable delivers outstanding performance as John adds even more depth to his highly challenging character. His facial expressions are outstanding. Both Victoria Hill and William Traeger fit perfectly into their performances, Pic's tense visual style.
