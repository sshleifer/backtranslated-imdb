This movie has 4 parts and each one is about 170 minutes long. It is based on the true story of Joe Bonanno's life and it tells everything he saw. So in some cases we can see that we have heard about it differently. Movie captures you for the chair to the end, I think it's possible to watch all 4 in succession, and not noticed that I watched 2 in one row and 2 next day in a row. In some movies it is good, but in general it may be better, but this movie is not about acting or special effects and shine. This one shows real thing and story is the key to this movie. So the one that looks for the same spectacular Rambo / matrix / titanic movie can hit this one. Good thing in the movie is what follows the main story so you won't have long and boring love scenes or any other break with something that isn't important to the Bonanno crime business.
