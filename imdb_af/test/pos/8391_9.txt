Whilst talking to Mary about this, Mary McCormack, who flops a milk tray on TV, the rest of the show is fantastic! Phil Hartman was in a profesional way wonderful and taught the celebs the ins and outs. Foley is a nut, but in a good way. You never know what self-presenting humor he will come up with next. As far as the game is concerned, it is entertaining, filled with a spicy bang, and ideal for any newbie who may even have an interest in the game. It's a pity, it's no longer :( I checked the schedule after August and it doesn't seem to be scheduled in the future. Bad Bravo! You deserve a beat!
