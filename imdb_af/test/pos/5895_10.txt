Thirty years before the DEER HUNTER came this movie, an excellent meditation on the effects of the war that the American family sustained, as seen by both the war heroes and their wives. A true ironic title, THE BEST YEAR OF OUR LIVES, is nothing but since those times have disappeared into still pictures and everything that remains is an uncertain future for those involved. <br /> <br /> Surely, an ensemble thrown in spite of Myrna Loy's top-billing, the best years of our lives focus more on the stories of the men. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to a household that has changed irrevocably as his sons grew, though he received support from his dying wife Milly (Myrna Loy). Fred Derry cannot get a decent job at his return, despite being a war veteran and trapped in a marriage he does not want Marie, a happy happy girl who wants more from life and hating him increasingly. Homer Parrish, on the other hand, has bigger problems because of his loss of hands in the war and feels the whole world - including the girl he loves and her family - thinks he is a freak of nature. <br /> <br /> For almost three hours, the film never looks long and stretched. There are so many emotions that happen even in small moments where the plot breaks; nothing seems to be wasted on the screen due to lack of editing. Not a show is fake, although the views of Dana Andrews are like Fred Derry, Harold Russell as Homer Parrish and Virginia Mayo as Marie Derry. Even though each character has his or her moment on film, and time was right to talk about all the pain and suffering that has not been seen in American films so far (including those made around the First World War such topics) . Although there is never illegal violence, it is all there, in the ghost expressions of the three male leaders' faces, in the fate where the aircraft now live, ready to change in the sense of (and therefore forgetfulness) into cynicism from the shop owners who cannot be bothered to use these scared men who have seen the battle or even worse, to ask them to wonder what it was worth. This is the film in which KOMING HOME and BIRTH ON THE FOURTH JULY owe debt. At a time when America fled war movies, it came about when the end of World War II was still fresh, a necessity to make a fairer movie.
