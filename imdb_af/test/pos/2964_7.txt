Making or breaking a love story for me is whether I like the characters or if they click with each other. Matt is pretty unlikely: separately, braggart, seemingly lazy, and a misogynist. He is severely hit by his dysfunctional mother and it makes him a little easier to take. I think I kept the details of his dysfunction - he was credible. He compensates by mocking that he has the nail Amy. He looked so cool about Amy that he came out twice. When they talk, he can't show her who he really is. She empathizes and stonewalls him at the right moments. She looked so mature and strong that the characteristics of her coming out later did not seem to fit. (To me.) I found her to be incredibly sexy and beautiful. . . Girl next door nice, I call it. So I'm going to keep this movie unless it's really screwed. <br /> <br /> Funny things happen to the coach, but Matt's relationship with the other coach was inspiring. The soccer zone at the end was confusing. Matt doesn't carry the ball, but seems to be returning. People, he's not the right size! He is to lift fifty pounds for that position. But I thought his acting was skillful. I measured it with the way I wanted to dress his neck with Meredith Monroe several times during his scenes. The movie was right. Meredith M was better than anything right.
