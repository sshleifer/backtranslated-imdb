Just watched it. It's pretty damn awesome. The battles are fantastic and the magic is really cool! It's completely like a video game in parts, with an incredible hand-to-hand battle there. <br /> <br /> This movie is for the fans: "For those who have loved this world once again and spent time with their friends, gather again and spend your time ..." Next to this ominous opening was the not very hard to follow, and I have never played a Final Fantasy game. I think it's important to be familiar with Role Games in general; knowledge of the genre kinda helps you to understand better. However, I think if you pay attention and accept what the movie is throwing for you, it's pretty easy to understand. There are many that are not explicitly explained, and if you claim to be then you will probably be confused and irritated. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie is like falling in the middle of a big saga. , and bring as much of the puzzle as possible. I like that approach; you get caught up in the secret and confusion that all the characters go through. But as I said, just accept. As a strange red lion thing that speaks, turns up and starts kicking ass and taking names, and the other characters just say he's an old friend, accept it and continue; You don't need a biopic jump, or a tell-everything sit-down. You are an observer here, from something beyond your experience and unstable. <br /> <br /> So, great graphics and animation, good voice viewing, cool video game stylized music, involving story and characters, and perhaps the coolest fight you'll see in a while. It's worth seeing, and while it's for fans, it's completely accessible to people like me who have never played the games.
