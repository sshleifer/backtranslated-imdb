Authors, Peter Viertel, Joan Harrison and Dorothy Parker enable the director, Alfred Hitchcock, to highlight what his favorite movie theme was: innocent man, caught up in crime, taking it on the lamb. Hitchcock, who has some confidence in the story, engineers blamed the plot for a warehouse worker for the blast that killed his best friend; He is traveling to find the right culprit. Very large-scale excitement, with usually colorless actors (Priscilla Lane, Norman Lloyd, Alan Baxter) doing surprisingly good work. Even forever-smug Robert Cummings gets in the right spirit! *** of ****
