This movie is a good movie, but it is, as most movies are highly predictable. The biggest highlight of the movie is, of course, the strong character Amanda Bynes, which is absolutely beautiful and hilarious. She is one of very few people in this world who can use all 53 muscles in her face to make the strangest and gut-busting faces ever made. It's good for the kids, and contains top male nudity and suggestive nudity at the end. All in all, they did a good job of updating an old classic, and deserved to be on the movie, standing with O and 10 things I hate about you. The other actors also do a swell job, in many of their first time debuts.
