I once commented on this Chucky story, but I had to do it again to tell something about the movie, when I first saw it in a big balcony in a big theater. The movie was a lot of fun in the theater and my first Chucky movie, ever in a theater, and it was a special moment for me, because I chuckled. The other horror villains are referred to by BIG COOL !!! And the gore was shockingly good! The scene where the gay child is nailed by the truck was incredibly cheerful! It was a big gore scene !!!!! And the end was so bizarre and shocking that it made me s *% @ my pants. The idea of ​​the Seed of Chucky was very, very bizarre and shocking! When I left the theater, I just loved it and I couldn't believe it was really. The bizarre and different features of this Child's Play installment showed me some reason as the Jason Goes To Hell of the Child's Play series. It only had that intense shocking, bizarre and different quality that reminds me of Jason Goes To Hell. A sure ***** from *****. Here's how I arrange the series: 1,4,2,3. I loved it, but not quite as much as Tom Holland's original Child's Play classic. I can't wait for Chucky Seed! Bring it on!
