As some people wrote, I'm a mortal Mario fan, and I loved this game. <br /> <br /> This game starts a bit boring, but trust me, it's worth it. Once you start, you're addicted! The levels are fun and exciting. They'll hook you up until your mind turns to grow. I'm not joking. This game is also orchestrated and beautifully finished. <br /> <br /> To keep this spoiler free, I have to keep my mouth shut for details. But please try this game! It'll be worth it! <br /> <br /> Story: 9.9 Action: 10.1 (It's so good!) Hardness: 10 Attention Grabber: 10 Average: 10
