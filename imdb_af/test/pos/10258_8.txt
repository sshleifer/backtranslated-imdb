It was the very first movie I ever saw in my life in 1974 or 1975. At that time I was 4 years old and saw it at a drive-in theater. I didn't understand that it would be a classic at the time (I went to bed for about twenty minutes). After watching it on television - along with two of my other favorite movies, Car Wash (my favorite movie) and The Wiz, which have been around the same time at the same time every year - about 40, 50, 75 times, I knew that here was a movie I would have as one of my favorites. Those three movies were the only live action I could see as a child. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't consider being a blown movie, but rather an urban interest film. Course and Preach reminded me of some of my uncles, especially the Wild Irish Rose they drank. My mom also told me about some of the quarter parties she attended and that some of the things that happened in the movie were similar in nature to what happened in real life. If you're one of the two or three black people who are thirty who haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you buy the DVD. I'm glad I was around to testify of the shows of the era.
