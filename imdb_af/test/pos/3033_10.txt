Wonderful story of a dedicated young teacher teaching minority children in an area outside South Carolina. <br /> <br /> Jon Voight is just terrific as the leading, dedicated, idealistic teacher facing this challenge despite a principal who believes in rigorous discipline and has little regard for modern educational techniques, as a crunchy old school superintendent, played with the late Hume Cronyn. Madge Sinclair is the principal who loves her babies. <br /> <br /> Being a retired teacher, I can relate to this excellent movie in some ways. The ignorance shown here as well as the lack of co-operation with officials is also evident in urban areas. <br /> <br /> Voight realizes that these kids need much more than the traditional teachings of a classroom. He went out and experienced life by learning outside. <br /> <br /> The end is a definite downer but true to life. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, such back students had a sixty to learn and were well-disciplined. I think it answers my question. The behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment. <br /> <br /> The end will just drag your heart. It was memorable and so gripping.
