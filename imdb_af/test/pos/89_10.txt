It's a piece of cinematic beauty, and it shows more of Quebec's culture to others than probably any other work coming from La Belle Province. It all takes a first-person experience of culture, to the point that you want you to have your hair glued and eat everything Maurice Richard. The book does it as well as the brief, and I am glad that I have spent all the time studying French in high school, it was needed in both languages ​​to read. <br /> <br /> I thought it was brilliant To tell Roch Carrier, tell this story. His molasses-thick accent brought a lot of realism to the story. The animation was also good, very surreal, which draws attention to the idea that it is a whimsical daydream, and it seems as if better days are over. <br /> <br /> Again, as a symbol of cultural quebecoise, it is unsurpassed. One can almost smell the cook slowly over a wood stove. This whole film deserves endless praise to be people proud of Canadians, and encourage us all to appreciate the finer things of family and our roots. I'm from Ontario, and in this movie I fell in love with Quebec. Maurice Richard vaujours vivre dans nos coeurs.
