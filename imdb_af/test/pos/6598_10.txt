I must say that this is the best documentary I have ever seen in my life. First I tell the movie to my friend's house and don't get the chance to watch it. From that time on I spent my free time finding the movie. I never found it, but my birthday gave me a gift for my friend, who knew I had the hardest time to find the movie. Sean Penn does a good job of telling the documentary. I loved how it tells the story of each of the Z-Boys and the history of Dogtown. I visited Venice and the surrounding area many times, and never knew what had happened until I saw the documentary. I didn't get the chance to see the real movie, and I heard it was nowhere near what the documentary was. I don't know if I really want to see the movie, but who knows.
