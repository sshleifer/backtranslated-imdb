Oooooh man I was glad I didn't miss it. I wanted to post this review because this episode in particular did not do a recent movie. It pays real tribute to the game DOOM. The plot is different, and the characters are, of course, in a very different universe (of course the doctor who is the universe), but the feeling, the pace, the references and the location are perfect. And for all the original Doom fans, listen for the door's opening and closing of the sound effect. It was the icing on the cake for me. <br /> <br /> Please look at this one all doctors who looked and doom supporters. this is a gem!
