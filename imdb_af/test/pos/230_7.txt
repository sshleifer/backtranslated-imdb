In short, the story is paper thin and you can see the end coming from a mile away, but Gene Kelly, Rita Hayworth and an impossible young Phil Silvers keep the movie in the air. Sometimes it goes straight into the air. Some of the songs are terrible clunkers ("Poor John" is a train wreck), but most of them are wonderful, and Hayworth's scene acting on the absurdly set for Kelly's rival must be seen as believed . Another surprise is the perfect faux-NYC sets in the best Hollywood tradition. <br /> <br /> Another attraction, if you consider such attractions, is the weeping terrible male "knights" of women. The oily teaching and transparent obsequiousness that has been passed for male charm, then (in the movies, at least) is presented here in its lightest form. Some of the men are like a cartoon wolf. <br /> <br /> One little disappointment is Eve Arden caught up in a role so small that she hardly has a chance to do anything. I can imagine a lot of potential comic interaction between her and Silvers - a missed opportunity.
