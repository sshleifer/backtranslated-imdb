Filmmakers made a rather boring allman's story, interesting and complex, focusing on his wife at home. At the same time, we are exposed to a truly original, existential French one-off. <br /> <br /> The movie is more than a documentary. I hardly ever feel that I've experienced something that is inadvertently deep. This makes it deeper. <br /> <br /> Film has visually interesting moments. I absolutely loved the journey the filmmakers tackled. (Many Europeans in the credits). Hopefully, PBS will screen it to reach a wider audience in the US.
