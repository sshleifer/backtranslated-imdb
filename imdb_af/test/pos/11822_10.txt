Incredibly close to the real feelings and emotions captured by Joseph Mazzello as a haemophilic child affected by AIDS and his new young neighbor, Brad Renfro played a tough redhead. Although the story may seem a bit overlooked (the two boys are trying a few hundred miles to find river raft to find a doctor who claims the drug should be cured), the emotions, actions and interactions of all the characters involved are tragically close to real life. Being a big brother to a boy in a similar situation who died a few years after this film was released, I recommend this photo to anyone who has ever wondered what really happens in the life of a child with AIDS. Stunning direction by Peter Horton creates the perfect atmosphere and setting for every scene and draws the viewer into the different emotions affected by friendship, illness, prejudice and the final separation of two friends who fought hard to overcome adversity.
