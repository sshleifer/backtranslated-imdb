Beyond Rangoon is one of the most emotional and intense films ever made. Outstandingly directed by John Boorman, and intensively performed by Patricia Arquette, this movie can easily be called one of the best films of the 90's. The story and lively characters just grab the audience from the beginning and never let go. After watching the movie, the viewer will never forget "Beyond Rangoon". The film made little money at the box, and is little known, but must be high profile. If you see it, you can say it was meant to be seen by a large audience. It's a very important and moving movie, and must be seen by everyone. <br /> <br />
