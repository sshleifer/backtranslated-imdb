After being educated as a child in Phenix City, I recognize many of the local people in the movie, so for me it's like a trip to memory lanes to see the Phenix City Story again. In fact, my grandmother is in one of the very first scenes. Uncle Drew is the one in the Hawaiian shirt that shot his chair to get a better look at the singer / stripper. <br /> <br /> Unless you were there, like Mr. Page and I both, you could not understand the story that tells it. The New York reviewer calls John Patterson racist, probably without ever having met Mr. Patterson or his father. And what's your point about Patterson's work now to educate? It has nothing to do with the movie you're supposed to review. How in the world can you get back and judge whether they or this movie if you probably have not gone beyond the southern Bronx? It was my experience that people who do this simply try to feel morally better than the people portrayed in the movie. At most accounts of the time, both mr. Pattersons basically good and decent men. Their families were respectful people, like most people in Phenix City. <br /> <br /> By the way, why is it so difficult for those living outside the south to believe that there are good and decent people even in small towns in Alabama? And why do they accept that anyone living in a small southern town is a racist? My parents lived there and yet they didn't tolerate it in our household. Others also do not tolerate it, but the myth that everyone in the south is racist remains through the deliberate ignorance of others. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is simple and direct. It's not the whole story --- Hollywood added some sensationism when the film was made. Parts of it were absolutely on the target. Other parts of it border on fairy tales. And if it's the source someone uses to decide how people in small southern towns are, they need to get hold of and understand what most of us do. It's just a movie.
