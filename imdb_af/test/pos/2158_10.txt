Yes, indeed, we have a winner - a winner in the best silly action movie! <br /> <br /> The only reason I chose to vote for this movie is because it's so incredibly bad that it's actually getting funny. "Night Hunter" is basically about Jack Cutter, a vampire hunter (Vampire hunters have been in his generation for centuries) and his mission is to make the last remaining death. Vampires. <br /> <br /> This movie features one of the cutest scenes I've ever seen in my life. Not to mention the very bad gun shooting scene. When people are shot in this movie, blood splashes like a ketchup all over the place, making the movie so cheap and lame that you just lose interest. A constant shake of the camera is what irritates me the most during the fights. That is, I think, done to create an "action effect", although I think it has no effect. It's totally ridiculous! <br /> <br /> All stunt scenes are extremely poorly done. For example, a scene where the dead Vampire leader pours a roof. When the body hits the ground, it jumps like a wobbly rubber doll. A scene where Jack sobs the ground, is a vision, is so lame, it laughed me hysterically. <br /> <br /> Lame music, cheesy scenes, bad acting and clear stupid filming techniques are of course the features of this film. a malfunction. To declare that this is a good movie will be the same as nuclear bombs are good for people. Obviously, those of you who say it's one of the best action movies haven't seen much in your life. <br /> <br /> It's basically a B-class vampire action movie that earns 0/10, but I give 10/10, just for its ability (the craziest action movie I've ever seen have to make me laugh and because I just can't live out of it.
