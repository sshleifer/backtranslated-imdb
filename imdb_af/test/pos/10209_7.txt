Difficult to believe it was directed by Fritz Lang, as he mainly targeted crime tricks and mysteries. This film has a role that includes Robert Young, Randolph Scott, Dean Jagger and John Carradine. Scott plays an outside maker who tries to go straight and leaves his old gang and winds to save Jagger's life. Jagger works for Western Union, a telegraph company that plans to have telegraph from the west. Jagger hires many men to make sure it is done because they have to worry about Indian attacks and bandits. Scott is in charge of the men and Young is a telegraph expert who can't shoot a gun but can drive. Scott meets his old gang they want to stop, but Scott can't tell anyone. It's a fairly good western and Lang needs to be more Western oriented.
