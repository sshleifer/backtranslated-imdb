When I first heard that the subject for Check Out Out was a self-orchestrated suicide party, my first thought was how morbiological, tasteless and then a comedy. I was skeptical. But I was dead wrong. I loved it completely. The throw, the funny one linen and especially the surprise ends. Suicide is a delicate matter, but it is very well handled. Comic yes, but soft where needed. Checking out also deals with other common issues that I believe many families can relate to and do with tact and humor. I advise you to check out. A MUST SEE. I look forward to his release to the public.
