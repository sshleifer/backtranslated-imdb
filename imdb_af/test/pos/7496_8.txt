OK, so this movie is not very well known and is not very well known. I discovered that this pretty cruel gangster was a good movie through a complete crash on one of Skys millions of movie channels late on a boring night, but I'm glad I did! The opening order of this movie is fantastic comic in a very dark way. It does matter what I think is the general tone for the movie. I think many critics and movie fans who actually saw this movie were a little unfair to just write it off as a lower budget gangster movie in the reservoir dog's year, so there are unmistakable similarities between Thursday and another. crime genre films it compares to, but in all fairness, I think this movie takes a much darker comic look at this type of film, and the end result is an impressive, well-made, funny, if not completely original, movie. Tom Jane is good at this and deserves the recognition he will hopefully thank the Punisher. His performance as the bad guy went well is realistic, funny and just cold enough to make you believe Casey was really a bad ass before he reformed. This is another thing this movie stands out, the characters. In Nick's gang you get the strangest trio of criminals ever met, a smooth, charismatic but very cold leader (Nick), a faster happy blood of a woman's sexual predator (Dallas) and a psychotic hill , with a precursor to torture (Billy Hill). ever seen on the screen, beautifully played by Mickey Rourke, and you have a recipe for ... good for Thursday. It is sometimes dark, comical, sometimes brutal, sometimes irresistible, but always exciting and worth watching.
