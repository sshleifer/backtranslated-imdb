The melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is an anime that left the impression on me. Partly for the characters, many of them fall into anime fantasy / sci-fi stereotypes, but the placement of these stereotypes in the fairly everyday setting of high school is a breeze I appreciated. Then there's the somewhat mad titular character that is something else: a head-on, almost amoral girl with ridiculous talents of talent and a secret she's not aware of. <br /> <br /> The set up for the series is a bit of a thought journey. In essence, Suzumiya, unknown to herself, is a kind of super-powerful being capable of having divine facts of creation and destruction, as she can destroy and rebuild reality to her impression. Our narrator and primary character is Kyon, a high school whose sympathy / curiosity for Haruhi causes her to drag him into a club against his will, she begins to give up her life because she is bored with normal life . In search of adventure, she claims three more unusual members, each with secrets, and they are all dragged into her crazy schemes. <br /> <br /> There is a little crazy but nice, philosophical consideration early as we debate whether the world is just Haruhi's creation because she gets bored of the old and whether our characters exist to serve her or serve her to continue to exist or to exist without her. It's a bit of a confrontation, but a pleasant one the same. While sci-fi / fantasy scenarios sometimes occur in the series, I think the joy of the series lies in how normal things are, while this tension remains to know that if things are too boring, Haruhi can destroy the world in the hope of making more interesting. <br /> <br /> The art is clean and in line with what I expected from the anime that is normally imported into the US; I like the character designs and while there isn't much action in the series, I think it's better. The series is told of the mind of Kyon and he does not play an omniscient narrator, but only comments on what he knows and what he feels. He's a lot going on in his head, but he doesn't talk much, so it's good to hear it. <br /> <br /> The voice that is dubbed in the English is acceptable enough, but I prefer the Japanese to do it. There are some strange aspects of the series, some of which are parodies and traffics in fanboy ism, which I found amusing. For the first season, I have to admit that there is a lack of closure as the series doesn't really have a bigger story arc, but it looks like it's one at a time. So it's an easy series to pick up and down. , although I think it is still difficult to put down because of its rather entertaining features. It is also based on a series of light novels and the author was directly involved in writing the series. <br /> <br /> Although based on the novels, I still wish that the overcrowding had stronger story bows, but I love how naturally we can develop these characters and how well the series can silence moments as well as crazy kids spell out. Since Haruhi himself is growing, it was quite a treat as well as seeing the relationships between the SOS brigade (Haruhi's club). <br /> <br /> It is not for everyone, because of the mental mind and the "extraordinary beings" in an everyday world "institution. It will probably not be fanboys in action / sci-fi / fantasy And maybe a little too low for the more relationship-oriented drama lovers, but for those who are willing to try something different, or what is remarkably similar to this one, I think The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is a refreshingly unique and enjoyable series.
