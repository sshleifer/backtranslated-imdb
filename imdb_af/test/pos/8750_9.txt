What an awesome mini series. The original TRAFFIC completely chased me away from anything else that was going on. The original TRAFFIC is much more encouraging than the American remake, and boasts a wonderful role formed from lesser-known actors to North American audiences. Juliette Binoche is the mainly recognizable actress who plays a drug addict teenage daughter of a civil servant. But this is not the strength that this film carries (although I enjoy the American version, I felt it was muted by the well-known Americans). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I saw the US version before getting the original BBC mini series. Of course there were no picture filters, lush places, and the big names stars / director. The grit and filth of Europe (through the drugworld), however, complements the imminent threat of danger that has penetrated the entire film. The problems, such as getting drug addicts by giving them more, poor anti-drug campaigns and the resistance of foreign governments to help destroy their drug cultivars from within, all make TRAFFIK fat, invasive and terribly everyone the same time! <br /> <br /> The incredible parts of the movie are all from Pakistan. My God, I never knew how bad the problem really was in Europe ... even over! For a proper education on the problems of drugs, beyond what it affects the human body, you should look at this and the American version. Each one shows a very clear and unmistakable fact. These countries, which are leaders in the eyes of the world, have a culture that has led to death and suffering for many. <br /> <br /> Drugs are worse than war. They work in the shadows, the dark secrets of any "successful" society.
