This is a case where the writing plays with the audience in a way that only serves to extend this story to 90 minutes. Story begins in 1969, where a young girl, Faith (Cameron Diaz), travels to Europe with her boyfriend Wolf (Christopher Eccleston), but she dies under mysterious circumstances. In 1976, Faith's sister Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) also decided to go to Europe and tried to find out what had happened to her sister. In France, she looked at Wolf who stayed there and she wanted him to help her take back the steps her sister had taken and answer questions. He is reluctant, but decides to travel with her. Along the way he fills in the gaps of events and tells Phoebe that the faith has joined the Red Army, which is an extremist group involved in terrorism. Phoebe and Wolf engage in a romance and this complicates the journey to Portugal where Faith died. They are several things wrong with this movie and it has everything to do with writing. First, the romance between Wolf and Phoebe is wrong and does nothing for the story. It switches completely untrue and comes across as forced. It seems strange that Wolf would be involved in a romance with his dead girlfriend sister. Second, Wolf knows exactly what happened to Faith, but leaves only a few pieces of information every fifteen minutes. Wolf will watch Phoebe every 15 minutes and say, "There's something I didn't tell you"! Give, thank you Wolf! If Wolf got clean the first time he spoke to Phoebe, the movie would be over in about 30 minutes. Another thing that bothered me was that I didn't think this movie was recreated in the 1960s. Diaz wears hippie clothes, but time has just not gone. I enjoyed some things like the authentic places where the movie was shot. It's a very nice movie and the scenery is beautiful. The performances are all good, especially by Brewster and Diaz. Besides "The Fast and the Furious" I have never seen anything in Brewster. But after watching her performance in this movie, I was very impressed. She is very good here and I hope better rolls get her away. The script is told in a very confronted way and the film never appears so credible.
