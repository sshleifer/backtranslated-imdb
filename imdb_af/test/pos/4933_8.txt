How I spent my holiday included closing the television series broadcast from 1990 to 1992. I always enjoyed the series for what it is. I have never compared the series to the Looney Tunes of the old days. The video release is divided into four or five episodes (I can't remember as I write it) for television and it is included in the episode list of the series. What is good about this series is that All the main characters of the show play an important role in the story. We see what they all do during their summer holidays in different parts of the world. Elmyra is with his parents in a Safari, Plucky and Hampton crossing the country with Hampton's parents. Fifi is in a beach, etc. The climax is very good and eventually all Tiny Toon characters reunite for the start of a new year in the "Looniversity", thus ending almost the good course of this TV show.
