Gene Roddenberry never leaves his fans. His death ended Sci-Fi legacy that never matched. Earth: The Final Conflict was a proof! His pilot film and the first 2 seasons were well written and carefully crafted, but somewhere along the road that lost the Roddenberry touch. The loss of lead, Kevin Kilner (William Boone) definitely hurt the series because he was an important part of what made it work. The story entails the human race visited by the Taelons, a foreign race that doubles itself 'The Companions'. After 3 years, they gave the earth new technology, useful information about the universe and more. Many question their intentions here on Earth. The main link on Earth between the races is Da'an (Leni Parker) and he is for many, the reliable Taelon. Questions arise: just why are they here? What are their goals, is Da'an aware of any suspicious plots against humans? There is an underground group led by millionaire industrialist Jonathan Doors (David Hemblen) who uses his millions to investigate the Taelons. By the end of the first season things are going well, Da'an seems to be trustworthy, Boone is helping doors in his investigation while working with Da'an and the Taelons as a liaison. In the middle of the 2nd season things were unraveling and the once fantastic and fascinating series of spirals down, mostly because Roddenberry was dead and was not around to lead the producers, of which his wife Majel Barrett-Roddenberry was co-producer. Still, the first season remains interesting and fun to watch.
