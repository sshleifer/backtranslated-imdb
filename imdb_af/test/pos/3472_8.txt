Let's make it clear from the beginning: I'm an asshole with the emotional sensitivity of cubic stone. Therefore, I see drama of people with disabilities, social stigma or any ailments they have and crying over and over as silly movies with poor taste. I mean, if you have a message, you can tell it without the help of sick or miserable people. <br /> <br /> But I enjoyed this movie. It's about people with incredible crash because personal health goes on, but they don't cry about it, and the opposite, they are trying to live and people are trying to "protect" or "care" by actively removing them from real life . The message is life to the limit, even if the end is as sad as possible. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: if sick people go drama, this one is a custodian. It's sad, but hopeful. I like James McAvoy, even though he or she always seems to play the arrogant rebel. I also say Steven Robertson played very well. Either this or he really has partial paralysis. :)
