Attend the story of Sweeney Todd ... The weirdest, most transient but most wonderful Broadway music game. It's chilling, funny, and instantly moving through Sondheim's most memorable and incredible score and sharp performances. George Hearn is unmatched in the title role, bringing a strong voice and death (no pun intended) imitation of the legendary demon creator, while Angela Lansbury offers the comic relief as she brightens his victims in meat pie. If you just allow yourself to enjoy it, Sweeney Todd is a real surprise.
