The first-ever picture came back from oblivion, and now you can hear and see it! In the fall of 1894, Thomas Edison's accomplice William Dickson combined in the Edison lab complex in West Orange, New Jersey, two existing technologies (the phonograph and kinetoscope) to combine sound and image. In that case, Dickson was unable to sync the sound and image. This experimental movie has never been released to pay audiences ... and consequently (unlike many silent films Dickson made for Edison at this time) it has no official title. . The silent image (recorded at 40 fps) has been in the Library of Congress for many years, known for film historians as a blunt curiosity. It was also known that the 'soundtrack' was attracted to one of the raw washing cylinders on the Edison National Historic Site ... although no one knew which one. <br /> <br /> But now it's changed. Recently, curators have located the wash cylinder, which has broken into several pieces. It was re-assembled: a playlist was acquired, and the sound was digitized. Hollywood's veteran soundtrack editor Walter Murch made the background noise and adjusted the digitization to make it sink with the movie, which Murch digitally compressed to 30 fps. Sound and image are finally synchronized! <br /> <br /> The movie begins with an out-of-the-box voice call: "The rest of your community is ready? Go ahead!' (The unseen speaker remains unknown, but was probably Dickson's assistant Fred Ott.) On the screen, Dickson plays a violin in a large funnel mounted on a tripod (one of Edison's audio recorders) while he is next to him. In full view of the camera, two male lab assistants embrace each other for some quick ballroom dancing at the pace of Dickson's music. <br /> <br /> The movie is barely 17 seconds: just long enough to marvel at this crude technology before it is challenged to laugh at the eyes of two men falling into each other's arms. About, here's a WARNING: A well-known but extremely inaccurate reference book ('The Celluloid Closet', of late Vito Russo) includes a frame magnification of this movie and identifies it as 'The Gay Brothers'. This is wrong. "The Gay Brothers" is a completely different movie, made by Dickson in the Edison laboratory during the same period. "The Gay Brothers" never had a soundtrack: it is a short fiction film about two brothers who are NOT "gay" in the sense that Russo meant it. The deceased, Mr. Russo, for his own sake, wanted to consider us Dickson's experimental sound film (probably the first movie music!) As an artifact of 1900-century homurothism. (Hmm, what about gay men and musicals?) Sorry, but there is no such content. <br /> <br /> This very important movie deserves a score of 10 out of 10. I often maintained it. no 'lost' movie should ever be regarded as irreparable unless deliberately destroyed. I am delighted to report that this movie is finally available to audiences, as the producer planned it for over a century after it was filmed!
