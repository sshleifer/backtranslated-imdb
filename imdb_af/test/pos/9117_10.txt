I could see a preview of this movie through UCLA's preview program, and let me tell you: THIS MOVIE IS OUR REASONABLE GOOD !!!! I've seen a lot of movies, but little has made me laugh so much about the movie. I had a decent respect for Tenacious D before I saw the movie, and now I'm MAD about them. I will definitely buy their album when it is released on the 14th and will see this movie again. <br /> <br /> If you were on the fence to watch this movie, get away and see it !! It's worth the expensive price of movie tickets nowadays because you'll definitely spoil the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Apart from the comedy, the glorious and divine music of KG's guitar and JB's voice is awesome. The audience is let down that such beautiful harmonies and incredible riffs can be created in combination with such ridiculous (and hilarious) lyrics. If it is nothing but the music itself, this movie is worth the admission. <br /> <br /> With a wonderfully coherent storyline in almost every aspect of traditional D history and features, great new songs, hilarious comedy, and some awesome awesome cameos, this movie stands out with the best! Check it out !!
