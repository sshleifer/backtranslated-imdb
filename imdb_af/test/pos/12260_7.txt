BROADCAST NEWS opens with a series of short vignettes that are a smart way to start a story about TV anchors, which do not know what they are reporting. <br /> <br /> When speaking to a group of -And reporter, all of whom are bored by her presentation, most of them leave. When the last one leaves, the co-host tells the event quietly to HOLLY HUNTER: "I don't think there will be a Q&A." Subtle line in a brilliantly written low-key comedy, a farce about showing TV anchorage. <br /> <br /> WILLIAM HURT is the indifferent news anchor who works with HOLLY HUNTER as the network. In need of help in remedial reporting, Holly refuses to take the bait - first. He knows he's just able to look good, but isn't a reporter. He seems to be a quick study as long as his earpiece works and he gets all the straight information from executive producer Hunter. <br /> <br /> Holly's other anchor friend (ALBERT BROOKS) helps by feeding her information that is going on to hurt her. Of course, she is confronted with her feelings for the ace reporter Brooks and equally strong appeal to the pretty boy anchor, Hurt, who has his own dalliance with a nice staff member. <br /> <br /> You have to wait up to twenty minutes before the movie ends to find out which man she will end. Brooks tells her that Hurt is wrong because he represents everything she opposes. In this unpredictable comedy there is no telling who will end the Hunter (the neurotic heroine). <br /> <br /> Fittingly, HOLLY HUNTER, WILLIAM HURT and ALBERT BROOKS were all nominated for Oscars (Brooks in Supporting Role), such as the film itself and director / writer James L. Brooks. A total of seven merit Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> The script doesn't choose a conventional happy ending - and this is the only mistake for the brilliant script. I was deceived and dropped a bit by the capricious conclusion.
