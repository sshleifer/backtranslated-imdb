I was very excited to see Rock Star because I'm a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I was surprised to enjoy it more than I originally thought I would. The script left something to be desired, but the film's performances were successful. There were a few moments when visions of spinal tapes were rushed back, and I can't help but think this movie would have been even better than a documentary. But I'm going out. <br /> <br /> Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent because he plays with faith an ordinary man whose biggest dream comes true. He does it with the wonder and innocence that not only believes you, but also cares about his character. <br /> <br /> Jennifer Aniston, who hasn't impressed me in movies, is surprisingly good like the girl / driver. She shows more real emotion than I combined in her last few movies. <br /> <br /> But most of all, this is the music in this movie that really draws you. Pepper with the 80's songs - Bon Jovi will rock any 80's music friends in their seat), the movie really sounds with the original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlberg's performance of them. <br /> <br /> I plan to see this movie again, but first I am going to hurry and buy the soundtrack!
