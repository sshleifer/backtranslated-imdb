I'm not a massive Disney fan, but my 7-year-old boy is coming in to them, so we've built up a collection, and that's one of my favorites. We only saw it a few weeks ago and we have seen it half a dozen times! OK, as others have pointed out, not the most complex or inventive plots, but there's more to a movie than that. <br /> <br /> Big characters, Phil Harris steals the show as Thomas O'Malley, but Edgar the butler not far behind. The music is wonderful - my disabled son always insists that I lift him up and dance with him to say, "Everyone wants to be a cat," it says. And "Thomas O'Malley" is just as enjoyable. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why some people have such a downer on this movie, unlike similar cats! And yes, it takes some of its clues from 101 Dalmations, and maybe "The Lady and the Tramp" (It's been a long time since I saw it, so I'm not going to compare it) And while "101 Dalmations" on some ways better, it is very pleasant to me "The Aristocats". Isn't that what these movies are about? <br /> <br /> In addition to "Peter Pan" (now it's a 10/10 movie), it's my favorite Disney movie. My 7-year-old son loves it, his cute 41-year-old father loves it, so you can't ask much more about a family movie. <br /> <br /> Super!
