I had the privilege of watching Mar Adentro last Friday, and I am still shocked by his beauty, the powerful work of each actor and actress and Amenabar's incredible ability to tell the story of Ramón Sampedro, known in Spain to ask for a legal euthanasia, lost the court case and eventually died in front of a camera that drank a glass of poison and frozen all our hearts with its determination not to be immobilized due to an accident . <br /> <br /> Before watching the movie, I was already smothered by the strong symbology in his title, which I would translate as "Into the Sea" and not like some, "Out to sea" An original poem written by the man about which this story goes. Then I watched the movie. Oh my friends. It is a cinema with a capital C. The narrative flows to bring you to the heart of every character: Sampedro, which has been reincarnated in a Bardem, which you forget from the beginning, is in the middle as a A man full of humor and full of hope, and his hope is to die, because to him the life he lives is not worth living. The rest of the characters, but one dance around him, respects his decision because they see him as a human independent being (forgetting that he is dependent on the other for everything), even though they love him so much. And that's what the movie is about: love. You can feel it, you can breathe it in the skin of every character. Your witness of the growing feeling within three women who meet him in the movie: Gené, the member of the association who defends his right to die with dignity, his friend, her story in the movie is the hope for us the lucky ones who can living a normal life in this world; Rosa, the woman who met a good man in the midst of her list of broken relationships and pain in the hands of all the men who used her and despised her; Julia, the woman who shares a tragic destination with Ramón, and eventually acts in a way that we cannot understand. <br /> <br /> But before the women met, Ramón knew what was love because you couldn't meet him. without loving him, and he is much loved by his murdered family: four characters unique in their humility and bravery, each with their own thoughts on his decision, respect each thought in his own way, because the terrible thing of this story is that no one is to blame for what happened. It's a pity, life is sometimes so terrible. From this well-known quartet, I especially liked Mabel Rivera's work as Ramon's son-in-law, Manuela, a fantastic show. <br /> <br /> I would like to draw attention to three episodes that are the best climax I have seen over a long time, and if you haven't seen the movie, don't read it, go over read this paragraph and read the next one starting with "Mar adentro", showing the movie his secrets to you. The episodes I loved were: 3. The best love scene I've seen in a movie, when I really feel love entering the screen is when Ramon wakes up to meet Julia on the beach and kiss them . 2. Gené talks to Ramón by phone the day before he does, and he says it's better, they'll take good time at that moment, not to put her in trouble with the authorities. And then she knows it's the last time they're going to talk, and she fought for his right to die ... but she doesn't want to lose him because she loves him as a true friend. And though its respect for its decision at all costs. 1. The best. A young Ramón in the beach, looking at his girlfriend under the sun, jumps to the water of the rocks to a retreating sea. We see the accident, we hear his voice and remember what happened and claim to have been so dead that moment. The face of Bardem, face down, showed us from the bottom. And the hand of a friend who pulls him off the forehead and brings him back to a life that will be a hell for him in the next 30 years. There are many others, like the impressive end, despite the fact that in Spain we know well what Ramon did. <br /> <br /> But adentro didn't fool me, Amenabar never did, but this time he thanked the actors who participated in the project and who might have taken it personally, because it's not just a movie, it's an elegance for a man who died alone when he asked to "legally" die, which meant to him, as Bardem pointed out, died with the people he loved and who loved him.
