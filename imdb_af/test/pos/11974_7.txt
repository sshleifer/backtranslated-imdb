I will consider myself a fan of Dean Koontz; After reading some of his novels and having liked them all, but unfortunately I never came to read Wagkenners, so I have no choice but to judge this film on his own merits, rather than compare it to the book I didn't read. I expected something terrible in this, and while I didn't get exactly a brilliant horror movie; I have been led to believe that it is a fan of the lower grade book, as Watchers is an entertaining and somewhat original little horror movie as a movie. The plot, of course, has some influence from Predator and starts with an explosion at a research laboratory. It is not long before a farmer is killed by a foreign animal and the boyfriend of the dead's daughter picked up an ultra-intelligent runaway dog. A secret government agency is soon on the issue, as the murders continue. The boy is still fascinated by the intelligence of the dog, but it somehow joins the murders and the agency is soon on its tail. <br /> <br /> The script for this movie was originally written by Paul Haggis, who later denied it. I do not know why ?? the writing here is nowhere as ridiculous as his 2004 hit Crash! Anyway, the main reason why this movie works is undoubtedly the dog that is exceptionally nice, is also the best actor in the film. Corey Haim, warm of the success of The Lost Boys, is the human lead and actually has a pretty good chemistry with the dog, although it is a bit ridiculous to tell him most of the way through the movie. The plot is quite complicated and as such the movie is more than a bit messy; But the ludicrousness of it all traverses it during the more awkward moments. Michael Ironside also appears in the film and does well as the 'bad cop' side of government agents. The monster is, of course, one of the most interesting things about the movie and the way it is about killing people is always entertaining and stingy; although we can't see much of it and when we do, it is disappointing - of course, the filmmakers saw Bigfoot and the Hendersons! Still, this is the kind of movie that can easily enjoy despite the many problems and I would recommend for any unceasing viewer of eighty horror.
