While HOUSE OF WAX is never mistaken for Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or HALLOWEEN, it is finally trying to make a worthy addition to the quality of horror movie. There is enough tension and enough implied gore here to please the young audience today and there are plenty of explicit gores to please the purists of yesterday. Overall, it's quite a good movie to do well on DVD. Six kids on their way to a soccer match are stranded in a LIFE like an institution and what actually seems to be. A discarded Deilverance successor and the backwoods hicks pulled out to tease the group. Eventually, the group had to break and half of them went into the desert to get car parts. The other half of the group stays behind the camp and sets the second half of the film up. <br /> <br /> House of Wax has many strengths. The first is that it is blessed with a very pleasant role. Paris Hilton is well in her role, but she is far from the focal point. Chad Michael Murray, Elisabeth Cuthbert and Brian Van Holt are three very charismatic actors and their presence in the film adds some panache, some credibility and flair. I have never really heard of Chad Michael Murray, just that he was a brand new teenage heart. But he has a presence on him. He implies an intangible to him who appears to translate into his performance. He is instantly tasty and has a strong character. I enjoyed his performance much more than I thought, and when he was on the screen, the movie flowed. <br /> <br /> The question now becomes: "Is this movie a worthy horror movie?" And the answer to this is a sounding YES. As I mentioned above, it is not in the same class a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET or LAST HOUSE on the left, or even THE RING, but it is relatively tense, very graphic and there are some very inventive deaths. It's not the HOUSE OF WAX your parents told you about. Vincent Price is nowhere to be seen, and when you begin to see the fingers cut off and warm laundry that contains comatose bodies, you realize that this movie is a bit on the edge. <br /> <br /> I want an uncircumcised director's X-rated version. I bet there is somewhere that would be much more violent than this one. Be it as it may be, this is a very good entry into the horror genre and it is heads and shoulders above bad movies like I KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE SUMMER AND DARK WATER AND A FEW OTHERS. This is definitely worth a look. <br /> <br /> 8/10
