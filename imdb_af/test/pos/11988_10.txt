The only conceivable mistake of this movie is its title !! Please stop comparing it to the first! In my previous review I did just to separate it from the first. If you haven't seen the movie and are curious, completely forget about it and develop a different name for it. There is nothing right and has its own mood. It's a huge exponent of the screw-type mid-80s comedy. I seriously doubt that such big names in this movie did the movie because they broke or even wanted to relive the first. Anyone who ever wanted to kick the sneaky nobility should love this little opus. I maintain, the only reason it is in the IMDB bottom 100 is because of its title. I usually hate movies like this (ie Adam Sandler, Farrell, Farrelly Bros ....), but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically. I don't know, maybe it's like a bad relationship. I can't get rid of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure. Anyway, this is the most underrated movie of the 80's behind 'The Stunt Man.' <br /> <br /> Robert Stack-WE LOVE YOU !!! (1919-2003)
