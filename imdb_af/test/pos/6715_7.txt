Life force begins in outer space where the HMS Churchill follows Haley's Comet. It is the equipment that detects a 150-mile alien spacecraft in the head of the comet, unable to contact the earth due to interference. Colonel Tom Carlsen (Steve Railsback) decides it's the only chance to investigate it. Carlsen and some of his crew enter the mysterious spaceship and find the remains of a bat such as race of creatures and three perfect humanoids, two men (Chris Jagger & Bill Malin) and a beautiful woman (Mathilda May) who aboard them take the Churchill. Thirty days later and back on Earth, the Churchill is found on radar, a rescue mission is only sent to discover that the spaceship has been burned and all those suspected of being dead. The rescue team does find the three humanoid aliens and takes them back to Earth where they return to a space research center in London and start to suck the life force literally out of human victims, who then have to do the same to stop themselves from dust, things to look like grim as the epidemic spreads in London ... <br /> <br /> This English production was produced by the infamous Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus, who in the early 80's was responsible for very cheap low budget action movie under their production company Cannon usually starring Chuck Norris & they wanted to move in big time and signed director Tobe Hooper on a three movie deal (which was this Life Force, the Invaders of Mars (1986) remake and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986) a successor from Hooper's own classic), all who were failing and basically bankrupt, both Golan & Globus & Cannon, were no longer. Anyway, despite being a commercial flop at the cashier's office, I have to say Lifeforce is a very pleasant, as a foolish sci-fi horror. Originally released in the theaters in 1985, Lifefore was cut down to 101 minutes by Golan & Globus, but the longer 116 minute cut has all replaced it on DVD, VHS, Laserdisc & TV, but apparently Hooper's original cut of the movie ran for 128 minutes, so there is still more footage somewhere. I will base my comments on the longer 116 minute cut, the script by Dan O'Bannon, Don Jakoby and unredited rewritten by Michael Armstrong & Olaf Pooley was based on the 1976 novel 'The Space Vampires' by Colin Wilson and has very extraordinary ideas, its scope is really ambitious and one felt it was a bit of a mess, but a hell of an entertaining one. It moves like a rocket and there is a very interesting story here, though the movie itself comes in a jumble. There are also some hilarious moments in Life Force, the scene when the security guard is trying to convince the naked female Vampire by offering her a half-eaten cookie, a real camp classic, the terribly overwhelming hypnosis scenes, including the one where Railsback finally kisses Patrick Stewart & many, much more besides. I don't know, call me strange, but I thought Lifeforce was very nice and very entertaining in every way, of stupid character, strange dialogue, strange ideas that never quite come together and some fantastic visual lives. Lifeforce is definitely not a director Hooper had just more money here to play with than he ever had (double that he had for Poltergeist (1982)) and he uses every piece of it to Bring this spectacular movie to the big screen, John Dykstra, the person responsible for Star Wars (1977), Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and more recently Spider-Man (2002) was brought in to handle the visual effects they look fabulous. The ranges that look good in outer space with spaceships in particular are also some very good visual effects on Earth, including the destruction of London as 100's blue souls are flying everywhere. There is a little nudity, but not much gore, there are a few withered corpses, a few gunshot wounds, the skin on someone's hand peeling off, blood traces of someone's eyes, nose and ears. There is a cut arm as well as some zombies. The special makeup effects are also generally very good. I don't want to say Life Force is frightening because it's more of a scientific movie than horror. I have the way Hooper shoots the spaces of outer space as he turns his camera to effectively grasp the sense of weightlessness and that there was no 'solid' floor like it was. <br /> <br /> With a so-called budget of about $ 25 million, it has made less than half of those in its theater career, and the world hasn't switched on video or DVD, it's a pity because although it's a bit of a mess, it is very pleasant to look. Shot on the spot in England. Well filmed in 2: 35: 1 widescreen, the picture 4: 3 is horrible and cuts large pieces of information on either side of the screen. It is most noticeable during the opening scenes in outer space where it is sometimes difficult to figure out what's going on and the feeling of the greatness of space and the alien spaceship is lost. The play is OK in a very dim movie, Patrick Stewart replaces Sir John Gielgud, Nancy Paul replaces Olivia Hussey, Frank Finlay replaced Klaus Kinski, while Anthony Hopkins turned Caine's role. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a bizarre movie, no two ways to really do it and anyone looking for something simple and straight forward needs to look elsewhere. Anyone looking for something else in the sci-fi genre will give Lifeforce a go, because it's so bad, it's good movies with some impressive effects. It's not your average run of the mill movie.
