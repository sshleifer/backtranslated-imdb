First, this movie won't be for everyone. There are scenes of extreme graphic violence and "disturbing" images that by their very nature will only turn off many potential viewers. Of course, reviews on this board - SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY shared those who saw it. I am among those who loved it for many reasons. I feel it was a very ambitious (and highly skilled ...) venture for a bunch of 18/19 year olds without budget and little experience. I think every aspect of the movie - the direction, the acting (although the character's performances are more compared to increased or free form performance due to the nature of the movie ...) the production, the FX, the score / sound design - everything is much better than many movies I've seen that exceed the children's budget and experience tenfold. I was honestly not impressed by an "art house" style horror movie since Nacho Cerda's GENESIS. <br /> <br /> Firstly - I'm not going to pretend to understand everything and / or understand the graphic content in this movie - but to know that it wasn't a straight-forward type movie I went into it, I was not disappointed with how it played. SUBCONSCIOUS CRUELTY are 4 relatively short vignettes that revolve around the right brain / left brain lust / anger / psychosis theory / restraint / normalcy. To briefly give an overview of each chapter: <br /> <br /> OVARIAN EYEBALL basically has just a naked girl who has an eyeball out of her stomach. I'm sure it's symbolic of something - I don't think I've paid so much attention at that time and this one blows pretty fast. <br /> <br /> The next episode - HUMAN RARE - is a nihilistic, horrific, truly creepy story of a man who both falls in love with and repels his pregnant sister, giving in his growing psychosis leading to the shocking conclusion of that chapter. HUMAN HAIR is the best of the bunch in my book, and will probably come under your skin. The dead-end storyline highlights the growing tension, as you know that something terrible will happen - but you don't quite know what it is. Do yourself a favor and if you are interested in watching this movie - do not do too much research on it. Get into it with an open mind and an iron stomach and I think you are pleasantly surprised, especially with this particular episode. <br /> <br /> REBIRTH has a lot of people in a field that screws the ground and blows trees and things. Apparently an "artificial" interpretation of the rape of the earth or something that leads to it. Not bad, but this one is pretty short and I missed the point ... and RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM seems to be about religion and religious hypocrisy and also with MENSLARVAE, has some of the "most difficult" images / messages from the whole function ... OVARIAN EYEBALL is not something to write home, mainly because it runs very short, but it makes a decent victory in the madness to come ... and REBIRTH is also so short and not quite So mind-boggling, but HUMAN HAIR (especially) and RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM are so out-of-the-wall and well done that they are more than for the other parts. I think the main reason I liked so much of this one is that it is done as "shocking", "repulsive", "violent" and "excessively" as it is, and you can say it was a real work-of-love from those involved. Nothing about the movie feels cheap or rushed, and even if the content is not completely decipherable, it is unthinkable original - and that alone is the point in my book. Not that every "strange art house" movie that has an incomprehensible plot should be praised for its originality, but SUBSIDIARY SPRING is the kind of movie I think I will look at in the near future to see what I can get other interpretations from it. Again, this movie is absolutely not for everyone - with some very extreme scenes of gore, murder, rape, incest, sacred images, etc ... It is definitely there to shock the viewer to look better at this movie. I have to say it worked for me, and I am anxious to wait for the Hussain / Cerda co-operation to come next. Exit this one if you have the stomach for it - 9.5 / 10
