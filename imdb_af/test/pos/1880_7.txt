(Some Spoilers) It has been around 19 years for Bruce Campbell to finally put his masterpiece "Man with the Screaming Brain" on the screen. But Campbell had to change his story by having it, due to financial problems, in Sofia, Bulgaria, where he initially wanted it to be filmed in Los Angeles California. In the film, Burce Campbell plays the USA. pharmaceutical tycoon Willian Cole, traveling with his spoiled upset wife Jackie, Antoinette Byron, to the former communist Republic of Bulgaria. It is there that William wants to help finance Bulgaria's almost non-existent mass transport system. <br /> <br /> It is poor Willem's accident to get involved with both Gypsy wife Tatoya, Tamara Gorski, and her ex-friend Yegor, Valdimir Kolev, an ex-KGB taxi driver. The two, William & Yegor, will unknowingly shave their brains inside William's skull, due to Tatoya's jealousy and revenge. <br /> <br /> After Tatoya's murders, William and Yegor delivered their bodies to the mad scientist. Ivan Ivanowitch Ivanov, Stacy Keach, through his loyal assistant Pavel, Ted Raimi, to make their brains experiment. Dr. Ivanov has this theory because two heads are better than one. And now, with the material, William & Yegor available to him, dr. Ivanov finally proved it. What dr. Ivanov's sadness will find out that by combining the two heads or brains, their brainwaves overlap and cause them not only to malfunction, but to turn against each other! <br /> <br /> William melted Yegor's right patch in his damaged brain, finding Tatoya and paying her for the damage she and Yegor caused him. Yegor for his side is stuck in William's head, which he likes and dislikes, in both food and drink, completely opposite his own. It causes a lot of tension and hostility between the two brains in those who fight for the control of William's body! <br /> <br /> Things are even more wrapped up when Jackie finds out that Tatoya killed her husband, William, confronts her in the dangerous and the Bravoda's high crime department calls Gypsy Town and ends up being murdered. Returned to dr. Ivanov by his assistant Pavel, it is determined not to put Jackie's brain into an experimental robot on which Pavel works. The operation is an exciting success, but the only downside is that Jackie, with her brain in the robot, needs to recharge her brain every few hours! Or, like a true brain lacking oxygen, she'll die with the robot's batteries. <br /> <br /> Combination of the 1930s such as screw-ball comedy and horror movie with William and Yegor to change the Bulgarian city of Bravoda up. down in the effort to find Tatoya and pay her, with her life, for the sad existence of life, they both have them. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER ALERT *** This is Dr. Ivanov who saves the day by discovering how to fight the two brains to fight and work with it! This is done by him, rather than combining the brain. Dr. Ivanov holds them independently by implanting a neutralizing cell wall between the two gray coats of co-operative gloss.
