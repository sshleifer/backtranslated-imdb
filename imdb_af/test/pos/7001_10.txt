This movie is about the crew of a spaceship landing on a strange bright planet with three suns. Among the passengers are convicted ceremony, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his nemesis, Johns (Cole Hauser). While the survivors of the wreck are touching their bearings, there is an eclipse of all three of the sun. Shortly thereafter, frightening creatures appear and the crew members start picking up one by one. During the eclipse, Riddick comes into his own, as his eyeballs shone diagonally, giving him night vision. The crew must trust him to get them safe. <br /> <br /> It's a very attractive film, with the color of the scene changing on the scene, giving it a very strange look. Vin Diesel is brilliant as Riddick, very threatening, but forced to help people who would otherwise only see him as a threat. There is also an underlying humor in his performance, which also adds another dimension to the character. This is the kind of role that Vin excels, the anti-hero, whose character is not as one-dimensional as it seems. I can't imagine anyone else in this role, it could have been specifically written for him. <br /> <br /> Roll on Chronicles of Riddick!
