His John Dark-Kevin Connor fantasy adventures were the main roles of summer holiday movies in the days before Star Wars: they were not masterpieces, they did not boast the latest special effects, but they were exactly what an audience of The kids wanted a movie back in the mid 70's. <br /> <br /> At Earth's core catches are just the right show for the appropriate name of Burroughs's pulp adventure about Victorian inventor, Peter Cushing, and the inevitable Doug McClure ending in the underground world of Pelucidar and the battle. against his evil telepathic fighting dinosaurs. This time the dolls for men went into monster packs, which is much nicer if you are willing to suspend your unbelief, and if you are not there, it is always Caroline Munro's fate to look at. Apart from what Peter Cushing's worst performance may be, it's an annoying but dottier rehash of his movie Dr Who ("You can't admonish me, I'm British!"), It's easily the best of the John Dark Kevin Connor-Doug McClure's fantasy adventures, surprisingly well-designed and boast an atmospheric color scheme. Alan Hume's photography is pretty good, but a studio gives him a studio. The film was completely shot at sound stations. It is a wonderful, vibrant world worthy of a pulp novel cover. Not high art, but definitely good Saturday matinee fun.
