Seven Oops are compared to Bullitt for the chase scene, but don't come close to Bullitt anywhere. Bullitt has a construction start building. When McQueen leaves the seedy hotel, his Mustang arrives, which is parked under the Embarcadero Freeway (now broken down) and watches the Charger sitting nearby, you know you're about to see something spectacular. From that moment on, when McQueen starts that car, the best car-hunting sequence ever begins. Adding to it is a great Lalo Schriffin If I remember the correct soundtrack. It has been a long time before you first tear the first tires. The shot of McQueen's Mustang that suddenly appears in Bill Hickman's rear mirror is unmatched for visual impact. Hickman's surprise and double really adds to the effect. Then San Francisco is of course unparalleled for setting cars up and down hills and turns. Bullitt was filmed in the 1960s when cars were still "Hot" (Mustang GT and Dodge Charger) made for a better set of wheels, when two boring, smog devices Pontiacs loaded seven Ups in the 1970s. Bill Hickman was the driver of the bad car in both movies. I saw him on an insider movie preview once on the Univeral lot when I reviewed movies for a paper. They played it a good three in Seven Ups with the chase scene. Seven ups have some "jumps" over small hills, (Yawn), but of course they weren't San Francisco hills. The Seven Ups, where they actually go fast, are longer than the fast drive in Bullitt. But the scene of a single shotgun blast completely blowing the hood OFF of Roy Schieders Pontiac is the height of absurdity. Strictly Hollywood, I would say, except that it was filmed in New York.
