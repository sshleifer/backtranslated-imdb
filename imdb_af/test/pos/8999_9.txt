I think some of America's baseball movies are one of the best movies ever made. When this movie was in production and heard it, it was described as a rugby movie. I wanted to read the Highland team in the newspapers but didn't have a high expectation for this movie about a sport that didn't interest me. <br /> <br /> Last night I saw it on demand. and almost loved it as my favorite baseball movies. Ryan Little and the throw and crew did a wonderful job. Neil McDonough was particularly convincing. As the "bad dad," he showed a good series and a subtle but moving character bow. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the Pacific Islander actors. I am happy to get to know many of these fine people and this movie captures their wonderful spirit and culture. A glimpse of how the Islander culture became such an important element of Highland's team was an excellent addition to the film. <br /> <br /> Recently, some tough movies were shot in Utah. It's good to see a quality movie like this from the Beehive state.
