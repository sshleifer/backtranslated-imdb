If there is something like beautiful horror, this movie is one of the best in this genre. It's a horror movie, which, despite not missing out on scenes, relies more on psychology and masterful build-up of tension to create excitement. And this is one of those movies that have been so beautifully filmed, where every scene is a complete world of symbols and details, all of which serve the scale and genre that can be called beautiful. <br /> <br /> It is not easy to tell, with two sisters returning to their father and stepmother after spending time in a psychiatric institution. They barely deal with the death of their mother and they try to protect a world from them and defend them against the adult world. The film therefore appears to be on its most external layer. Actually, the movie is slowly evolving into something completely different, at a slow pace, but no frame is lost to convey the sense of exciting beauty, so I won't say much more. Look, it's one of the best in the genre of distant eastern horror movies that recently won the world cinema and it really shows that they manage to do it for good reason.
