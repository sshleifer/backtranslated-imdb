I almost stopped watching Hindi movies because of the mediocre quality and story lines. An exception to this is Ramgopal Verma movies. It's a nice movie with good performances from the star cast. It's a movie for those who are sick to watch silly dance and love stories. The adaptation of the story and characterization was exceptionally good. You need to watch this movie for Nana Patekar. based on the life of Mumbai policeman Daya Naik, this film is treated in a more realistic way. The movie delves into the life of the ordinary man, whom he has apart from a meeting specialist. I rate it as one of the best movies of the year
