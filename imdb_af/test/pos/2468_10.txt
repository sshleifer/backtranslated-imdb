I was just happy, I found this movie. I used Walmart's $ 5.50 DVDs, because I watch a lot of movies (and rarely watch television). I graduated from high school in 1968 - so I have family and many friends who have served in Vietnam. This film really illustrates the pain I saw in my friends handling what happened to them. I wish more people would see this movie - I think more people might understand what happened to our Vietnam veterinarians by watching these great actors portraying a family-damaged family. The story felt realistic - it was not gentle but made me feel where they were going. I think it helped Martin Sheen and Emilio Estevez play father and son - this made their relationship more credible,
