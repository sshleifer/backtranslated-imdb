Others talked about James Stewart's age when he played Lindburg (he was 47 Linburg was twenty-five.) But Stewart didn't look at his age and the movie, because he was a dream come true. A real pilot and a retired air force general at the end of his life felt Stewart feel the character and understanding of his passion, which other actors could not play. At the film was co-star Murray Hamilton, who also appeared in the FBI story with Stewart, and other well-known character actors such as Richard Deacon, of the later Dick Van Dike Show and Robert Cornthwaite of "The Thing of Another World" , the 1951 Sci-Fi classic. <br /> <br /> Billy Wilder captures the flavors of the Lindburg autobiography and tells what would become an important event in the history of aviation. film is evidence of the soul of determination and perseverance to realize a dream. A failure of the venue at the time of its release has since become one of the great classic American films and one in a long series of outstanding performances by an actor called America's Everyman. No film history student may miss this one. There have been more than 500 000 movies since the start of the film, and one of these is among the top 500.
