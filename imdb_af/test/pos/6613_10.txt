This movie moved me at age 39 in the same way that all the material and coverings of Dogtown touched me when I was 13. For anyone who questioned the self-promotion of the Z boys, they have the last laugh at you. It was their whole thing, "we are better than all of you and here is why .... (add the image of the smoothest pool notch imaginable)." It was a movie to tell their story and it was their story whether you would like it or not. This was their opinion of their skating that was of interest ..... not yours or mine. I thought the movie captured their attitude and influenced exactly as I remembered it in the 70's. The reality is that they revolutionize the skateboarding, they were the tension behind extreme sports and they injected a cultural paradigm into every corner of americana. This movie has given birth to images of Bertleman on a wave, and Alva and Jay Adams have saved the California Dream into a whole culture of young American teenagers who just wanted to have fun and love! While watching this movie, I realized that it was these images that I lived every day until I was old enough to move out and go back to So Cal, after my family moved to Nor Cal when I was five. Until I could come back, my friends and I built and hit driveway to the driveway, searching for every empty pool possible and covering everything aimed at these guys. We're all educated and now have family and careers, but this movie reminds me of who I was at that age and why I'm still navigating. It's an inspired film that everyone who is interested in pop culture, extreme sports, the 70's or even good documentary film entertainment will enjoy it. When it comes to the cable, I can't change the channel. Kudos to Stacy Peralta for making a beautiful piece of art!
