How many reviews of this movie will I have to write before I get it right? Tom Conway inherits the Falcon's mantle fully from his real brother George Sanders with this entry. Conway travels from New York to Miami into a beautiful double-breasted, one-knot dragon-style suit and crosses into beautiful, 110% large-screen cars and suicide doors that come to your armpit. formula for industrial diamonds to fall into the wrong hands. His "client" is beautiful, virgin Louisa Briganza who has beautiful hair, but only lets you kiss her for the first two months. Along the way he walks into the colorful variety of characters that can only offer a B movie. His sidekick in this outing is perhaps best among Falcon sidekicks Edward Brophy as Goldie Locke, who has given some very funny lines. He runs into sinister dish Doris Blanding, the kind of '40s chick you know stick out. Her cohort was played by Benny by Steve Brodie, who was a Presley bag in two Paramount King movies twenty years later. They both work for cold fish and jogging cap Kenneth Sutton, ready to do what is needed to get the formula while crossing his hunt for Brazil. Composed with the stoniest Falcon-pursuing cops ever, this entry still ranks highest. Forget about the 120 minute melodramas, give me a 1-hour Falcon movie any day. I have a wife and two children - who has time for a two-hour movie? Shake some dry martinis and forget about your problems with this great Falcon movie. But if you didn't lose it from local TV in Toronto, as I did 17 years ago, you're not happy.
