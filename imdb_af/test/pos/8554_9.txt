I stumbled upon this movie while letting the TV channels flicker one night. It has kept my interest twenty years later. Because of the important real lesson, it teaches us about the dark side of human nature. And even though it tells a true story that takes place in World War II, it is incredibly dedicated to the ugly things that are happening in Europe today. <br /> <br /> If you thought "ethnic cleansing" as it is called today has something to do with race or ethnicity, you will think differently about reading this story. <br /> <br /> I think I was pretty naive to think that evil follows any set of rules. The evil is so evil. <br /> <br /> This movie teaches a valuable lesson, and I especially recommend it for example. church groups or civil rights organizations. <br /> <br /> I don't expect it to be easy to find and rent, but I really want to see it again, because there is one wonderful scene that gives a totally unintentional but interesting insight into the banal complexities of "racialism". In this scene, the protagonist, captured by the Nazis at the beginning of the war, was discovered by an SS race authority and entered a room. There, the two play a kind of puzzle, where the SS officer can determine where our hero (Anthony Quinn's character) comes from and where his ancestors came from. Well, come out to find out that Quinn's character is not a member of an inferior race, yet he is a perfect, aristocratic Aryan! This doesn't mean much for Quinn's character, who is interested in talking about the towns, rivers and mountain ranges the SS man just mentioned. Yet it is a perfect Aryan archetype that offers its benefits. Among other things, he gets his job in a slave labor production where he wears striped rags, and in a slave modeling work where he wears custom Nazi uniforms. Yes, it's a better gig for a man who always appreciated wearing beautiful clothes ... until the Allied armies arrived and recognized his face from magazines. <br /> <br />
