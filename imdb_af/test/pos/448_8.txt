Anatole Litvak directs the 1959 film, The Journey, starring Yul Brynner, Deborah Kerr, Robert Morley, E.G. Marshall, Anne Jackson and Jason Robards. <br /> <br /> The film takes place during the Hungarian uprising in 1956 and relates to a group of travelers who have problems coming out of Budapest due to political problems in that part of the world. They are taken on a bus to Vienna, but the Russians, led by Major Surov (Brynner), confiscate their passports and hold them for questioning. One of the passengers is Paul Fleming (Robards) who is considered an American, but in reality is a Hungarian freedom fighter, who is being smuggled by the Hungarian chief. In fact, Lady Ashmore (Kerr) puts him away. She becomes the focus of major's romantic attention. <br /> <br /> Very good movie that brings the tension and hassle of the Cold War, and all the performances are wonderful. Brynner is especially excellent as the passionate Major who is not bad, and Anne Jackson gives a realistic, powerful performance as a pregnant woman who does not want her child in a communist country. <br /> <br /> Good script, good director, good throw - there should be more movies like this. Highly recommended.
