This is the best version of the Gypsy filmed. Bette Midler is just wonderful like Mama Rose. She has the voice, gestures, appearance, and most of all, a supreme acting ability to carry the role and make her character alive. Her singing is simple: MAGNIFICENT! She shines especially in two numbers - "Everything is rising roses" and "Rose's Turn". The other actors are also fine, especially Christine Ebersoll as Tessie. Also good is Peter Riegert, his portrayal of Herbie was done with great style and credibility. The direction of this movie is very, very good. There is no false note or Gaffe in the whole production. This film is a great improvement over the Roz Russell version filmed in 1962. When I see it again, I can say that the three biggest Mama Roses are: Ethel Merman, Bette Midler and Angela Lansbury. See this movie. You'll be glad you did.
