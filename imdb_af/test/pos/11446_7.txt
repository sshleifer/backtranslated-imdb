Much more than any other movie of that time, Night of the Demons represents the mindless and extremely enjoyable horror pastiche. It's unforgettable fun with many nasty makeup effects, beautiful looking (and horny) teens and adorable clich√© elements. A group of parties, led by the alternate Angela, are going to celebrate Halloween in a deserted funeral home that carries an ominous urban legend. It all starts typical and innocent with dancing, drinking and sometimes flirting between young people who cannot control their hormones, but a bloodthirsty devil soon has a bloodthirsty devil. In the most ingenious ways you have ever seen, the rest of the throws are only fierce generation to return to as scabies that seek blood. The thing that makes this movie better than most of the 80's horror movies is a good balance between light camp and atmospheric horror. Certain rows are really creepy and the funeral home setting provides Night of the Demons with an excellent tone. Director Tenney makes great use of the set of pieces (coffins, a crematorium, endless dark corridors?) And his young enthusiast naturally loves what they are involved in. The awesome makeup effects of a whole team of artists and designers are, of course, the obvious aspects to love and horror fanatics will absolutely love the large amount of cut limbs, expressed eyes and crushed skulls! The ultimate highlight, however, is Linnea Quigley's trick with the disappearing lipstick! This nimfomanian bimbo kicks a whole tube of lipstick in her nipple and continues her sexual murder boom! Great! Night of the Demons received two successors in the 90's and although they are still worth checking out, they focus more on comedy and chills.
