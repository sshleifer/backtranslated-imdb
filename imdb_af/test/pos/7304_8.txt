I love this movie a lot, but the feeling that I get the most out of me was the memory of how much I enjoyed the novel. The film has two of the best actresses working today. Jessica Lange, who's wonderful here, and divine Jennifer Jason Leigh, who does the best she can with the thin-drawn character she gets, as well as a surprisingly excellent Michelle Pfeiffer and a steady Jason Robards. The adaptation is basically true to the book, at least as faithful as it can be in an hour and forty minutes. The film surprises, except for some scenes between Lange and Pfeiffer, but it does a thorough job to visualize this wonderful tragic story. As far as films adapted from novels go, it was definitely one of the better ones. If it was nothing else, it returned me to my bookshelves to rediscover favorite parts of Jane Smiley's great novel and return to King Lear to brush the little characters to see the depths of the parallels. Worth appreciating your time as a movie, and hopefully enough to remind you that reading great literature is also a joy.
