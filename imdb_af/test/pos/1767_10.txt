It's the kind of unknown and forgotten movie that one dreams to discover when he watches old videos. It's a wonderful comic jewel with brilliant funny writing, embedded in the wonderful characters of characters, a wonderful inventive and funny musical score, and a spectacular, light direction of Montgomery itself. This is one that looks over and over again. Montgomery is a part-actor who found himself at his military reserve to infiltrate a young debutant's house to discover the identity of her former beau, a supposed jewel thief. Although the premise is pretty annoying, the results are hilarious. Montgomery is the frozen plant, Ann Blyth is a wonder as the romantically obsessed, terribly serious debutants and the parade of comic character of veteran actor Jane Cowl's lawyer mother to Lillian Randolph's maid is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Oddly, it just earned an Oscar nom for Sound, when it earned the best buttons for Direction, Screenplay and Musical Score. <br /> <br /> Don't miss it - it's one of Hollywood's best.
