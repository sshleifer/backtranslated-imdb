Because of his predictable, second-class title (the one he distributed in Italy), I didn't expect much from this movie. Think it would be another cheap movie about a haunted house ("LA CASA MALEDETTA" means "The Cursed House"). Well, I had to change my mind just after the very first brilliant scene! The constant presence of priests and the creepy atmosphere reminded me of The Exorcist and some of his decent Italian rip-offs, but that is going to be quite different. It's more like Hitchcock meets Italian thriller! Well written and directed, good actors, interesting plot ... OK, I tried to spoil the view of "7 Hyden Park" to you, which I strongly recommend to everyone. <br /> <br /> P.S. Am I wrong, or when Joanna crawls or hardly tries to stand (she is paralyzed from the middle), does her feet and legs become too much? (... And I'm not talking about the "bad dream" order.)
