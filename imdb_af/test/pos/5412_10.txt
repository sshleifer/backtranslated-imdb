Wow. When I went to the movie at the Toronto Film Festival, I had no idea what I was involved with. This movie takes you on an emotional roller coaster in the best sense of the term. Sigourney Weaver was better than I had seen her in years; Emile Hirsch was great and Jeff Daniels broke my heart. I can see how it won't be every person's cup of tea, as it can sometimes handle difficult things that can happen to a family. Don't get me wrong - it's very funny too - my audience burst into applause after I laughed over and over again. I just think if you are open to exploring your own life, Imaginary Heroes will be sincere. I can't wait until it comes out in theaters.
