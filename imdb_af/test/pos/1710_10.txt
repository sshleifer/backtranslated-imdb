"Saturday afternoon" is one of Harry Langdon's best-known short subjects, and with good reason. It's one of his funniest and best movies. The plot - as it is - is an old bird of prey: A chickenpox man sneaks away for a night out with a couple and some other girls. This is a solid and well-used comedy plot, but the difference here is Harry Langdon himself. His slow, ineffective, turbulent, innocent character somehow swung his way into a marriage with a woman who feels that he must be ruled by all people with a fist, and he is only deceived in her because he can't say "no" to the admonitions of the nice Vernon Dent and the cute lashes of the girl. <br /> <br /> Being such a helpless, childish character is a very mature issue. Harry doesn't want to cheat, but he can't do anything about it. In a wonderful little comic business, he can't kiss the new girlfriend. He slid the kiss diagonally to her and embarrassed his hand as if cheating it. The movie is a three-line comedy, ten minutes longer than the two-line Harry Langdon formerly in the front in Mack Sennett, without any plot. Maybe it's even designed to be a two-reel. It works beautifully, as it gives him so much time as to inspire the slow reactions and confused smiles and half-lives where so much of his comedy lives. <br /> <br /> He's at his best here, and the show is really Harry Langdon's inquisitive magic and the ability to turn off comedy almost nothing. His little half smiles, his appearance while handling the money he hid under the robe, childish attempts to enter the battle at the end. I think his comedy lets us recognize something fundamentally innocent and confused in ourselves that makes us feel that the whole world is too much for us, but at the same time by making us understand what Harry is not doing (like the fact that women who he kindly brings his friend to encourage him after he thinks the date is blown, is actually whores), he forces her to realize with a little sadness that we are no longer so innocent. His comedy is just as capable of making us audible, "Awwww" says, as it often makes us laugh. <br /> <br /> Here, Harry refuses to cheat his wife, he wants to tell his wife who's boss and get power again in his relationship. He wants to pull back against the two violent men at the end of the movie, but he can touch just as little of his environment, and sometimes we all feel that way. <br /> <br /> The movie is perfectly directed by regular Langdon director Harry Edwards; it is moving at a fast pace and stalls never, while at the same time offering time and presentation to the best of Harry Langdon's still-reactive comedy. Vernon Dent, a regular foil to Langdon, plays one of the roles here where he becomes almost a comedian in his very effective combination with Harry. The gags flushed in a way that also gives the maximum effect, and Harry gets his own version of a Lloyd or Keaton style stunt at the end. Here, the comedy is not in Harry's great response to the danger of sitting between two moving cars, but in its inertia to take it. <br /> <br /> It's a hilarious movie and a perfect example of the comedy. one of the most unique talented humorists I've ever known.
