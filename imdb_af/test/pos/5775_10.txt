This movie of what I remember was such a big movie! I watched it on television when I was 11, and couldn't remember the title. If I remember correctly, I believe it was a Christmas TV movie special. One of my friends at work and I discussed it a few years ago, but none of us could remember the title. But we almost remembered the whole movie. No one else at work remembered to ever see it! Thanks, somebody on a TV movie website, answered my mail! Now I have the fun job of finding a copy of it! It's amazing what you as a child can remember, but this movie still stays in my head ... even after 28 years. And I believe I just watched it once. Maybe it's because I am the oldest sister in my family, or maybe because I was babysitting and working in day care centers that it was so long with me. Whatever the real reason, it's been one of the movies I've really wanted to see in the past !!! If someone knows where to look online or have a copy, please let me know. I would love to see you again! Thank you very much! Seriously, I tried to post it and it says my comments aren't long enough. So, apparently I have to type more, did you know that Melissa Michaelsen is Peter Billingsley's sister who died in a Christmas story? I know I'm not the only fan of this movie, so if anyone has any idea where to find it, I really appreciate it.
