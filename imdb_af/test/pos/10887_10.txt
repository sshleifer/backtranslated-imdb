In my personal opinion, I think it's the biggest video game ever created! I played this game years ago at my friend's house, the next day I went out and got my own. Since that day, I haven't stopped playing about seven years ago. I can't help it, but I can't make it bored. I'm addicted to other games on other, much newer systems, but I'm still back for more Goldeneye. Every mission is incredibly fun and challenging, the multiplayer was like no other. I hope you can be as happy as I had to play four-player multiplayer mode, because I had brothers and friends who would come along and play this game all the time.
