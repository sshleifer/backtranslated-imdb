I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be entertained. The directing, acting, and story is brilliant. Definitely there with movies like Scarface and the godfather. This movie makes your heart race. Damian Chapa as well as all the cast was amazing. I would definitely rent this movie. Damian Chapa deserves an academic award for his acting, and for the way he portrays the life of a gunman. This movie is a classic and brilliant piece of film-making. I loved it and I give it 10 stars. In a sense, the only way to describe it is a movie without any errors. Look at this movie and you will see what I mean. 2 inches up !!!!!!!
