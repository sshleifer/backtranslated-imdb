Sheba Baby is probably probably underestimated because it has a pg rating instead of the regular r rating a Grier movie gets. all that pg means is that Pam doesn't take her up, she takes her best in every other movie she was in. It's more exciting than Coffy, more action. It slows down but by the time she is on the screen, the excitement has started. As Dolemite d'urville Martin is trying hard to get Saba's dad, but she doesn't. She had a one woman war against Martin and his gang of loved ones. The best scene is with a stupid pimp in his car I'm still laughing at. I thought it would be stupid because of the pg rating, but I was wrong it replaced sex with violence and in a blax flotation movie that could just be good!
