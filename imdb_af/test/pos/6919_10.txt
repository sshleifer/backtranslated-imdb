First, what do some of you think? This is the best movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> Secondly, I don't think of it as a British movie as it is in Dublin and have mainly Irish actors Moran, Gambon, Aisling O Sullivan (Rita), Deirdre O'Kane, and so on. <br /> <br /> Third, I thought Moran was excellent. He was hilariously funny through out. Micheal Caine was just there to get Moran's context. Every character he adopted, he perfected. <br /> <br /> Abigail Iversen I thought it was better than any other child actor I saw. She was credible as the smart kid and also as a child and an adult (yes I know it sounds strange, but hey ...). Even she could get Caine up. <br /> <br /> Iversen and Moran worked very well together and were very funny in the preparation scene. <br /> <br /> Barreler (Gambon) was very funny in his dissatisfaction.
