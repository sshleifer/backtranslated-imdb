George Barry's "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats" is rooted, telling a dark fairy tale through a horror movie framework. It is, in my opinion, one of the best films of the 1970s, and it is a criminal offense that the picture is basically stolen and distributed without Barry's knowledge (those responsible for this theft must be brought to bed as soon as possible). If you are looking for excessive or deadly action, 'Death Bed: The Bed That Eats' is not the movie for you. "Death Bed" is a softer, weirder-row-in-picture; it plays like a totally strange dream, half remembered. I would recommend reading Stephen Thrower's "Death Bed" summary in Thrower's FAB Press book, Nightmare USA (he perfectly describes the movie's vibe). Whether or not intentional or not, I noticed shades of "Death Bed" in everything from the Phantasm movies to Michele Soavi's "Cemetery Man" to the magical realism / slipstream fiction of writers such as Kelly Link. Barry is an original and in a fair world, I'm sure he would have followed 'Death Bed' with some fantastic bizarre movies.
