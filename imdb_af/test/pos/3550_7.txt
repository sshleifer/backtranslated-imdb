Sure, it has its pretentious moments, it plays like art house, lively action Fantasia, but it also has moments of deep beauty and humor. Omnibus films are always a problem, but I've always had a lot of interest in them. I will now judge the segments individually. <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg - "Un ballo in maschera" - This segment can spoil the film very well for some people, because it is absolutely the worst of the whole lot. It's hard to follow, mostly because it tries to keep a clear plot (a hacked one). That photography is unfinished. The best thing about it is the little Lesbian homoerotica that never does it enough. This segment made me very nervous to continue. 2/10. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - "La Virgine Degli Angeli" - an unclear segment, but it doesn't matter. The film has the best cinematography of the bunch, mainly because it is in beautiful black and white. The segment is dreamlike and beautiful. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - "Armide" - I chose to encourage this very malignant movie for the Godard and Altman segments. With Godard I was much more impressed than I thought I would be. I can't claim to have seen so many of his films since he has made so much that almost no one has seen, but judging by what I have seen, it can be his best work since the 60's. This is the funniest segment in this movie, and reaches the most artistic reach. Bravo, Jean-Luc! 9/10. <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - "Rigoletto" - a very funny segment, it is also very predictable. Yet, this story about a man and woman who are cheating on one another, is filmed wonderfully with long, complex traces of detection that rely on precise timed choreography of the actors. It also has a good self-referring joke about the omnibus movies themselves. The final scene is very poor. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - "The tote city" - this short segment involves lovers in (I think) Venice. It's beautiful, with some nice shots of pigeons flying over the city. It's small but nice. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - "Les Bor√©ades" - not one of the better segments, it's unfortunately more of a music video than a short film. It involves the residents of an insane asylum attending a theater performance. The music and images work well together, so I can at least give it credit for a good music video. 7/10 <br /> Franc Roddam - "Liebestod" - a bit unlucky for Beresford's segment, this segment looks a lot like that. As you may have heard from my phrasing, this one hit me much more. It's about a young man and his girlfriend going on a fatalistic journey to Las Vegas. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - "Nessun villages" - perhaps the most visually striking segment, plays more than in a fantasy world. This is a beautiful story of a fallen angel. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - "Depuis le jour" - I heard a lot from Jarman, and this is the first movie I saw about him. Hopefully I will see more in the future. This one is also music video-like, but it's better than Altman's story. It's mainly about an old woman who remembers her younger days. The editing and use of different movie supplies to represent time and emotion is very nice. 8/10. <br /> <br /> Bill Bryden - "I pagliacci" - the sad clown, possibly one of the most famous arias (especially memorable from a Seinfeld episode), serves as the material that separates each segment and the final. It is simple and effective. 7/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, I give it a solid 7/10. It's not as close as bad as you've heard.
