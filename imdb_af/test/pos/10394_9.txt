I'm not really sure what to do about this movie, especially after watching a good movie like La Notte. Unfortunately, I saw it in German during an Antonioni film festival at the Frankfurt Film Museum, so I couldn't hear Malkovich's big voice. He is supposed to combine four stories about couples in Italy. But as good as an actor like him, Malkovich can't save the most ridiculous of the four stories depicted here: a woman coming to him at a cafe near a shop she owns and points out how she killed her father. Then the two of them went home, had sex, and he left. Antonioni seems to have lost the subtlety in earlier films (like The Passenger) in dealing with sex and replacing it with blatant nudity. <br /> <br /> But the storyline is indifferent, the film contains two things that make it visible: eye and candy. The actors and actresses are all beautiful people, and cinematography is great - scenes in old Italian cities that contrast with a bit in a high-rise city-view apartment (reminiscent of La Notte). The lights, however, are what make the movie worth watching. U2 and Brian Eno worked together on "Your Blue Room" and "Beach Sequence", which made the atmosphere perfect in the film. The songs are available on "Passengers: Original Soundtracks 1."
