I watched this movie this weekend, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The 2 Italo-American actors are excellent as usual (Michael Imperioli and John Ventimiglia). Obviously, the director was influenced by 2 major films of the past directed by Italians. He was mainly influenced by Dino Risi and his film IL SORPASSO. This is the story of 2 young men who happen to meet and become friends. One is extrovert and the other is introverted. They enjoy the whole day together and by the end of the day the shame teaches that there is more to life than its usual routine monotony. The same happens with Albert De Santi. Unfortunately, IL SORPASSO has a very similar ending and it apparently affected ON THE RUN's director using the same technique but with a twist. I expected something, but was surprised to see that it was the opposite. If you watch both movies, you'll understand. The other film influencing the director is AFTER HOURS directed by the great Italian American Scorsese. I already recommend 3 movies!
