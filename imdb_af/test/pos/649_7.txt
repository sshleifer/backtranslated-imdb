Back in August, '81 there was a nationwide buzz on movies, big hits like 'Urban Cowboy', 'Any Way But Loose', 'Smokey and the Bandit' was all the rage. That is why I suspect that the filmmakers of this movie have chosen "Honky Tonk Freeway" as the title that hopes it will help the movie's cash receipts by drawing in the same "Urban Cowboy" crowd. Instead, "Honky Tonk Freeway" bombed at the theaters and I suspect it does it partly by being a poorly chosen title. It's the same problem, it is now burdening video and it's too bad, because it's a good movie and comedy style before it's time. No matter what, probably, anyone who can remember 1981 will enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It's too bad this movie bombarded. But I think it would be even though it wouldn't be sown with a bad title. It's a movie before his time. One can now look at this movie and see that it is clearly a father or grandmother anyway to the kind of comedy made today. For his day, "Honky Tonk Freeway" was full of insinuation and a kind of honesty about life that didn't become popular later in the comedy. Although it is clear that it is an airplane, it is more mature, and although it is definitely not "Beat," it clearly shows in that direction. The characters are more "comedy adult" because they are low key and never think anything they do is nothing but serious. The jokes are in the choices of what to emphasize and see the camera and the way they see themselves and their situations. <br /> <br /> But more than that, "Honky Tonk Freeway" is a real capsule. A great look back at the extremely early 80's. The people in this movie are dressed and act like everyday people of 1981. It was clearly meant to reflect the times and a cunning comic remark about everyday life to be. <br /> <br /> I don't know if my review helps you, but it's really a good, sometimes some excellent, movie worth renting if you want to see how many faces are known today. , looks like they were 30 years younger. Beverly D'Angelo is so young, it's hard to realize her sometimes. So are Beau Bridges and Terri Garr. Terry Garr was about to become Hollywood's toast as her next movie after being one Tootsie, who eventually made her a star. Howard Hessmann was probably the biggest "current" star of the day when this film was made. Back in 1981, Howard Hessmann was the star of the big hit TV show "WKRP in Cinncinatti". He played his main character, the rascally night DJ. Daniel Stern was about to break out as a star as the adult narrator voice of the main character in the popular 80's sitcom "The Wonder Years". There are also several faces that are no longer with us, it's nice to see Hume Crowyn and Jessica Tandy as an old married couple traveling. Jessica Tandy will eventually take her Oscar for "Driving Miss Daisy" ten years later. There is also the large Geraldine page in one of her final film appearances. Although she had a brilliant career, she didn't get her Oscar up to four years later in 1985's "Trip to Bountiful", for which she earned it richly and she died very soon after the award. <br /> Plus, there are many other faces in this movie, actors who aren't big stars, but have done tons of supporting work. Many are known even if you can't think of their name. <br /> <br /> This movie is a pleasant little distraction. A lot of people with a variety of problems set out from different places, each for their own individual unrelated reasons, all on a vaguely Altman-Eskom heading to Florida and announcing a rendezvous in the town of Ticlaw, Florida , which is due to the effects of bypassing the recently built interstates, which did not build an exit to Ticlaw which effectively took the town out of the map. <br /> <br /> And that's also what this movie is about, fascination with the whole idea of ​​the interstate system, which has just been "completed" recently. It has taken a generation to build from the 1960s through congressional congress, as different parts were built and then became alive. By 1980, most of the system was eventually built and all connected, and only the promise of what the interstate system would have changed to was the first time. And people enchanted them. Everyone by 1980 was actually an "interstate highway veteran" in that everyone used parts of it at the time and knew how it worked and how it was different from other roads, because it didn't have red lights or stop signs, just on and exits, and that it goes to places that were previously less accessible. By 1980, anyone could ride comfortably and without stopping for anything except eating and sleeping and a bathroom. And it was all new. <br /> <br /> The end is anti-climate and is not satisfactory, even if it is a spectacular moment. What makes it good is the journey, not the destination that makes Honky Tonk Freeway timeless, despite being such a product of his day. Forget his title; Instead, it lets your memory lane decrease.
