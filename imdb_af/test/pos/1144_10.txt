I saw this movie at school and loved it absolutely. Based on a true story, it's a wonderful masterpiece of a movie. I could hardly find anything wrong with that. One clear plus is how it was filmed. In 1904, Morrocco was filled in the Wind and the Lion with moving images like the Great Raisuli. The cinematography was flawless, the editing was sharp, the costumes were beautiful and the scenery was breathtaking. And I must call the music of Jerry Goldsmith, it was phenomenal. I used this phrase very recently, but Goldsmith is not my favorite movie companion for anything. His score here is so exciting and exciting, it shows the man's true musical genius and this gem of a score must be there with Goldsmith's best scores with Legend, Rambo: First Blood, Patton and The Secret of NIMH. <br /> <br /> The action is exciting and the script is intelligent and sophisticated. The direction is also handled sensitively. The performances were also amazing, with Sean Connery, once the image of charisma and suavity, wonderful as the Great Raisuli, he dominates the whole picture on his own. He is joined by a festive Candice Bergen, a brave John Huston and a fascinating Brian Keith in one of his more underrated performances. History is pretty accurate, perhaps faint in some areas, but with the acting, music and visuals so good I am over. 10/10 Bethany Cox
