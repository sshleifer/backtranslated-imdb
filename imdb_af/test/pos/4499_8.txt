Based on the best-selling novel by Khaled Hosseini, the Kite Runner is a story of friendship, betrayal and the battle for redemption. In Afghanistan before the Soviet invasion of 1979 and later in the Taliban regime, all the elements are present for great drama, but under the direction of Marc Forster (Finding Neverland), the film lacks the sort of tearing emotional impact. unforgettable experience, but it is entertaining, well behaved and occasionally moving. <br /> <br /> In 1978 in Kabul, but filmed in Kashgar, China because of the dangers in Afghanistan, the friendship the movie between two young boys is really, although miles apart in social and economic conditions. The 12-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) lives in a tranquil setting with his rich and educated father Baba, played by the great Homayoun Ershadi, although his wealth is somewhat uncomfortable in one of the poorest countries in the world. Although Baba is a loving father, he confesses to Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub), his friend and business partner, that Amir is too soft and that something is missing out on that boy. The family has a servant, Ali (Nabi Tanha) who is in every need of him and whose son Hassan (Ahmed Khan Mahmoodzada) is Amir's best friend. <br /> <br /> The two are not only separated by class, but also by ethnicity. Amir, an emerging author, is a member of the Pashtun majority, while Hassan is a Hazara, a minority sector (10% of the population). Although we learn little about their traditions or social situation, they are bound by their love for kite flying, a popular sport in Kabul and Amir's reading of Afghan stories to Hassan who is illiterate. The annual kite flying competition for boys is a big event in their lives and the CGI effects are breathtaking. The kites are covered with glass particles and the winner is the one whose kites can cut the other kites in the air. Hassan is the kite runner who has an incredible ability to locate the fallen kites and bring them to Amir as a trophy. After Amir wins the important game, there is a sad event that will form the rest of his life. Bullies, led by the older Assef (Elham Ehsas) who later appeared as a ruthless Taliban leader, attacked Hassan because he was a Hazara and raped him (from camera) while Amir was too scared to prevent it. Unable to confront his alleged lack of courage (although one has to wonder if all he did to help Hassan), the driving force in his relationship with Hassan is being blamed, and their friendship is tense. In one incident, Amir throws pomegranates at Hassan as if he begged him to fight back and punish him for his passivity, but Hassan does not take the bait and remains married, despite his friend's cowardice. When Amir urges his father to dismiss the servants and accuses Hassan of stealing his watch, Hassan admits the theft, although he is innocent. Eventually, circumstances forced Ali and Hassan to be ashamed. When the Russians enter Afghanistan, Baba and Amir also leave for Pakistan and then to Fremont, California, where the story emerges years later. Baby is forced to work at a petrol station and sell trinkets. On an open air market, while Amir (Abdul Salam Yusoufzai) seems to be moving through the movements, studying to become a writer at the local community college. After he fell in love and married to Soraya (Atossa Leoni), the daughter of a Kabul general, Amir finally publishes his first novel, a season of ashes and things look very positive. When Amir receives a call from Rahim Khan, asks him to visit him in Pakistan, and says to him: "There is a way to be good again", the guilty feeling that has haunted him all his life shows Amir. go home. He returns to Pakistan and returns with great risk to a Afghanistan now controlled by the Taliban to confront the demons of his past and discover a frightening secret in the process. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner is a sensitive film that deals with the internal pain that comes from knowing that you were not faithful to your best instinct and allowing a new level of responsibility scan. It also does not hide the pain that Afghanistan caused by wars and revolution, a pain perhaps suggested by Hassan. Unfortunately, it reduces complex situations to the level of good guys and villains and distorts what actually happened, which the US excluded, which was involved in anti-government-covered operations within the country, of any responsibility for the one million disastrous war. left dead and millions more disabled. Although inspired by the outstanding pedigree and shifted by the freedom that kites fly, Kite Runner leaves his strength as he tries to replace the melodrama for history.
