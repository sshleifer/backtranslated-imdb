My impression, after seeing this documentary, is that Nathaniel Kahn came up with more questions than he had before making the film. <br /> <br /> He took five years to make it, a labor of love and longing. I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process, what to go in, what to take out. <br /> <br /> His father, well-known architect Louis Kahn, comes across as a man selfish and self-absorbed to be emotionally available to even one woman who is not only three. But like many men of his character, he dressed up women who were played through the abysses and enchanted by creativity. <br /> <br /> One of his mistress said he was "accessible" but never explored. Other comments by people who knew him well had the same fate. Pity. <br /> <br /> The tension between the three half-brothers in the room of a Louis house designed is also tangible. The unseen hangs over the conversation. The only songs his father left were in the buildings he left behind, some big, some not so big. <br /> <br /> I was captivated by the music ship and the Salk Institute. Driven by the baby mothers who have been caught forever by his careless fertilizers, it never occurs again as he told the director's mother when she was told of her pregnancy - "not again!" <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10, beautifully filmed, actually. <br /> <br /> In this case, the boy doesn't seem to be the father of the man.
