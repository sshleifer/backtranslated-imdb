Sick of the current cinema edition, especially American cinema, I made an effort to watch the Oscar-winning foreign films. That's when I got this jewel. Slowly to start, it comes in handy when war is declared. Actually, an old-fashioned girl-waiting-for-son-to-back war story, the performances, cinematography is so much more. Why Tatyana Samojlova as the young woman did not become an international star after being outside me (although she has lived successfully in her own country). You take the journey with her: young, challenging, turbulent young girl, who through the war wars becomes a very sober, gloomy woman who holds a bright hope (her final scene is devastating). We love her as much as the camera does. And the camera works! Was it the pioneer in hand camera work? It really adds an immediacy to the story. And its beauty (such as when Tatjana's character steps on a staircase and next to a low fence). I am humble and grateful to see this movie.
