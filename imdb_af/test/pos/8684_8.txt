I recently saw a Blurred test screen, and I'm surprised to say that it was pretty good! It's a movie about different groups of kids, your hills, your rich snobs, your typical teenage couple, plus two geeky guys and one after-hippie babe. Together, but as separate story lines, each group travels to the Gold Coast for Schoolies Week. Australia has never had trouble writing comedy and Australia is never short or actors who can play comedy with subtlety and just the right amount in the right way. The film is full of starry Aussie actors with immense talent and numerous screen presence. Keep an eye on Craig Horner, a young graduate, whose optimism for a week-long party is lost in his friends' face. Travis Cotten and Mark Priestly, who successfully tackle a bit of physical comedy as two bombers from the Bushmen and Jessica Gower as a tuck shop, but confused teen who has anxiety about love. Veronika Sywak makes her film debut as every adolescent boy's dream girl, and holds her own under a series of significantly more experienced artists. Watch out for Matthew Newton, cleverly cast as a seedy limo driver. Fantastic Aussie
