Cowboys and Indians are a great movie. The writing, acting, directing couldn't have been better. It was a story that was asked to tell, and this group of talented individuals and teams did very well. Stories like this are not fun, but serve to remind people of the social injustices that exist all over the world. It is my hope that when this film is seen, attitudes and prejudices will be changed. A movie that can do this is a rare, special thing. Andrew Berzins is an excellent author, and his talents and expertise in this field have appeared in this film. <br /> <br /> Thank you for telling this story! <br /> <br /> Ruby
