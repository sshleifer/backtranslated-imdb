I really enjoyed this little musical fantasy. I bought a copy to share with my friends. This is a pleasant and varied change of our everyday lives. I believe we can all benefit from an active fantasy life, one of joy and indulgence, I highly recommend it! <br /> <br /> The performance is excellent and the music exalted!
