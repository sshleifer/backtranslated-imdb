This movie is so wonderful that it captures the game life. I laughed so hard while I watched it. The film is about a game group that has a tough time with a campaign that turned their dungeon master up. The movie links the real world and the gambling world as they play the campaign they show in the game world as their character, and then back to the real world when they don't play. The campaign forms the basis of a module written by the dungeon master, Lodge. The problem is that Lodge can't complete its module because the characters can't complete the campaign. They are more for murder and looting instead of role-playing. Lodge wants them to play a role through the campaign they have never done before. They decide to bring in some extra help so they have a, waiting for, girl in to play. Lodge also makes a npc, a non-player character, a paladin, who can't see or do wrong, to play. The movie is how they do it all and more I don't want to spoil any of the film, so I will not say anymore. This movie may not be a big budget movie. The acting may not be worthy of Oscar, but if you are in gambling or dungeons and dragons, you should definitely see it. They had lots of fun making this movie and it shows that I won't go for any movie problems like continuity or something that is a low-budget movie that's just fun. There are a few folding stick comedy I enjoy and a little good writing in my opinion. So if you want a fun movie, try it.
