To see this film, or rather movies, has in my early teens irrevocably changed my idea of ​​the possibilities of human interaction and the variety of potential experience. This monumental exploration of individuals, and their historical environment, reveals how perfect and intense each human existence is. The people are portrayed as they are: their experiences from the smallest to the greatest internal and external phenomena are outlined with the greatest art and perception. Edgar Reitz displays a fantastic appreciation for human motivation and desire. <br /> <br /> When these phenomena are set against the tremendous time allowed by the length of work, one cannot achieve the power and vitality of happiness, defeat, lust, love, sadness, melancholy feel. When I watched these movies, I observed my future experiences, how my life would inevitably turn and oscillate because of both envisaged and accidental events. I got a sense of life's essence and what it meant to think about past lives, memories, and contexts. A masterpiece and a revelation. I just wish the BBC would screen it again. <br /> <br /> If anyone knows where to get a copy, they can contact me
