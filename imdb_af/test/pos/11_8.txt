I'm looking forward to The Guardian, but when I entered the theater, I wasn't really in the mood for it. It's kind of like the Olive Garden - I like it, but I have to be in the right mind to thoroughly enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I'm not quite sure what my spirit is dampening. The trailers look good, but the water theme gives me bad flashbacks on the latest Kevin Costner movie on the subject - Waterworld. Plus, despite the promise shown by Ashton Kutcher in The Butterfly Effect, I'm not completely sold to him. Something about the man just irritates me. It probably had to do with its simian features. <br /> <br /> It took about two minutes for my fears to descend and my hesitation drove away. The movie instantly throws us in the time of a tense rescue mission, and I was tighter than Kenny Rogers's orange face. My concerns briefly burst at Kutcher's initial appearance, because too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious. Sunglasses, a tough old toothpick in his mouth, and sporting a cloak that makes George Clooney proud? Yes, we get it. I was completely ready to hate him. <br /> <br /> But then he had to deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs. <br /> <br /> Be you, monkey! Effective blending of excitement, exciting rescue scenes, drama, humor and solid acting, The Guardian is easily a movie I dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy. You can be up to date on its clich√©s, predictability and rare moments of overcooked sappiness, but none of it takes away from the entertainment value. <br /> <br /> I had a bad feeling that the pace would slow down too much when Costner started training the young guys, but on the contrary, training sessions could only be the most interesting aspect of the movie. Coast Guard Rescue Swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen. So I feel the inside look at what they are going and how difficult it is to make it is very informative and a great way to place audiences here. - Valued group. <br /> <br /> Do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer? Just think about it - you are going to tackle dangerous missions in cold, dark, rough water, and then fight disorientation, exhaustion, hypothermia and lack of oxygen while trying to help stranded, panicky people who depend on you for their survival . And if all that isn't bad enough, sometimes you can't save everyone, so make the hard decision of who lives and who dies. <br /> <br /> Man, who wants that responsibility? Not me! I didn't know what it really was for those guys, and who would have thought I'd want an Ashton Kutcher / Kevin Costner movie for education? <br /> <br /> Not only does The Guardian do a good job of paying tribute to this rare race of hero, but fortunately for us it's also a good job to entertain its paying customers. <br /> <br /> The GIS <br /> <br /> Moviegoers wanting an inside look at how to go on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean, The Guardian wants a give chance. I saw it for free, but if I paid, I would have felt I got my money's worth.
