After another attack in an empty town, the head of the Vikings understands the statement by his adviser Cryptograf that "gives fear to the inhabitants" and believes that fear actually causes the inhabitants to fly. They decide to chase the champion of fear in Gaul to learn how to fly and make their invincible warriors. Meanwhile, the cousin of Vitalstatistix, Justforkix, is sent from Paris to the Gallic town to become a man and Asterix and Obelix are named to train the youth. The stupid son of Cryptograf, Olaf, listens to a conversation by the coward Justforkix with Asterix and Obelix and kidnap him. Returning to the Viking town, Justforkix meets Timbaafah's daughter Abba, and they fall in love with each other. But the Machiavellian and ambitious Cryptograph plan is to marry Abba with his son Olaf and become powerful. In the end, Asterix realizes it's not fear giving wings, it's love. When I was a teenager, Asterix was my favorite cartoon and I read all the Goscinny and Uderzo stories. This feature movie shows all the original elements and humor of the comics in a wonderful and wonderful animation. The romance of Justforkix and the beautiful Abba are wonderful and the situations that Asterix and Obelix are engaging in are hilarious. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Astérix e os Vikings" ("Astérix and the Vikings")
