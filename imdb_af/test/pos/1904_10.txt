Citizen Kane .... The Godfather Part II .... D'Urville Martin's Dolemite. It is the single largest piece of celluloid ever created and unleashed on humanity. Rudy Ray Moore, in a role that exceeds Academy Awards stars like Dolemite, the worst cat in the universe. He clearly does not take out turkey (unfortunately I am a turkey) and proves it with its powers of rapping, pimping and karatehak. It's a blast at its absolute best, a brilliant example of the low-budget genre, continuity errors, and hate-drive hatred that explicitly eats explosives. The true Godfather of Rap (not this new Ali nonsense) Moore is something of a contradiction of acting technique; somehow manage to be the most charismatic terrible actor of the 1970s, and that's something to say. This one is highly recommended to people, if not for the one-liners alone.
