I found that West Point was a nice movie, although I doubt I would see it again. The performances were convincing, with William Haines as another zealously entertaining young man coming to film. It's hard to believe that astronomy Joan Crawford made the film less than a year, as she sometimes looks uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> I will also apply the comment of another about Ramon Novarro's "Huddle" (1932) to this film. There is a good movie waiting here, but something is missing. The background and integration of the Corps was well utilized, but I was less involved than I thought I would be. Maybe Haines' character had gone too far, or got away with too much. His "repentance" didn't really seem enough; And what kind of message did it send him to perform every play in the last minute of the Army-Navy game? Where is the "Corps" in it? Perhaps the other ten men also went out and could do it all themselves. I also doubt many that William Bakewell's weak, punished character will ever have a real counterpart at West Point. <br /> <br /> All this aside, the movie is sometimes very moving and inspiring. This is a good look at the daily practices of an honorable institution. Thanks to tradition, something at West Point means something, as opposed to the vague "traditions" of Ivy League schools, which are only half-hearted. <br /> <br /> Regarding the score: it was appropriate. But there was a clear overuse of strings drums. Using them for knocking on the door, stage transitions, ALU as well as over half of the screens must be pretty boring. Rather, it reduced the viewing experience. I was ready to say, "I already get the point." <br /> <br /> With that, enjoy the movie, but don't expect too much emotional engagement.
