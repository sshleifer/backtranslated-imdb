This movie is very good and the whole family will love to watch. When Susie Q goes to the prom from her big night, she dies in a fatal car accident on her way to prom with children who are drunk and tall. If the years go by Susie's house is sold and a family moves in the house where she loves. As the boy now living in the house, Susie sees and is the only one who can. The two team with his little sister and try to save Susie's parents from being broken. Battle Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q. This movie will drop your heart with comedy, sadness and laughter. I hope you see this movie because it's great. But no one seems to be on DVD or Vh's no longer on TV.
