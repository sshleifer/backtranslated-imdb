This show is absolutely fantastic. It offers all the great drama and romance of teenage programs such as The OC and Dawsons, but it's more fun. It is a show of morals and values, without everything being sugar-coated and disinfecting. Ala 7th Heaven. We have no wrath behavior or brotherhood in Australia, and our university system is completely different, so I have no idea how accurate Greek life is. portrayed. But I don't care! Because this show is my new favorite! Any writer who can love me for a racist, gay-hopping, flaming bible bassher must be genius. <br /> <br /> And Cappie is my new Pacey. Sorry, Josh Jackson, you were dissolved!
