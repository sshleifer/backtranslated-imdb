It shouldn't be a 10 out of 10, but for me the jokes didn't fail. I've seen it many times when I was younger and again on DVD I believe and I laughed every time. The humor is simple and fun, it's just one of the little movies that Disney threw out at the time. I found the parts where people from the invisible loop saw people invisible. These expressions were priceless. Big movie, as the opportunity to see it ever, I recommend seeing it for a good oh-fashion laugh. My favorite character in the Dexter series will definitely be Dean Higgins, I love his voice and hear him get upset, especially since his expression at the end was just sheer hysteria.
