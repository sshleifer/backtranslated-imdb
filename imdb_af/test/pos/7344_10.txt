Now it may have something to do with the fact that I saw this movie at a low point in my life when I really tried to find out where I went and what I needed to make me happy, but this one movie really talked to me. Jane is an allwoman: although she is so many positive things to her, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. She is strong and intelligent, but she is surprised to reach her potential through an unfortunate accident and is a second choice life. She looks for new challenges and happiness, and desperately seeks to fill the hole in her heart. Dreya Weber is a beautiful Jane. As we travel with her, we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her despair and ultimately the power of her conviction. The beautiful Addie Yungmee was also very well thrown and an asset to the production. Allison Mackie is a playmaker like a bad character with impeccable timing. I recommend this movie although it has a low budget, it has huge budget writing and production values. PS- great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women. Women will love the story and characters, but there is also something for the men. :)
