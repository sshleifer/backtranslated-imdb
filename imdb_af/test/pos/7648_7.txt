Didn't really know what to expect from this movie - and I was pleasantly surprised. I picked it up because I recently stumbled across Norman Reedus and tried to find more of the movies he was in. <br /> <br /> I'm not big in hustler movies or movies, but I have to say, this one called me within minutes. Probably because I couldn't stop knowing who was who. This movie is stylish and fast, with a story that is credible for location and fantastic performances. <br /> <br /> While I was very impressed with the movie, I must say Dagmara Dominczyk was simply excellent. br /> <br /> Give it a chance, it's a very funny movie.
