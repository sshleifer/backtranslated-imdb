One of the most important aspects of "Malenkaya Vera" (known as "Little Vera" in English) is that it was the first film from the Soviet Union that had a sex scene, even though it was a short one. The title is important: Vera is the Russian word for "faith," and identifies that punk Vera (Natalya Negoda) has little faith in the Soviet system. And as the movie shows, there is not much faith to be in it. The opening scene shows the dark industrial village of Zhdanov, almost a hell on earth. When Vera's lover Sergei (Andrey Sokolov) moves with her family, it leads to some unexpected events. <br /> <br /> As in many Russian films, people's characters describe their characters. For example, there is Viktor (remember "winning" means winner). All in all, this is a good look at the Soviet Union as it collapses - and we can see why it collapses. Very good.
