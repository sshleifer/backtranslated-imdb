I saw Beyond Rangoon about 20 times, it was so good. Only when I looked at it did I see the story of Laura Bowman, but later, after several shows, I realized that it was also a parallel documentary. It was in my mind, a story about Aung San Suu Kyi, and the struggle of women to stay strong in the face of uncertainty, danger and sadness. I would also list history and politics on the list after looking further, as I learned a lot about Burma's past, and it was, and could only guess in the future. This movie is not just one you want to see, it is also one you definitely want to copy. It's a movie that can easily be seen by the whole family, although it's not for children under the age of thirteen. However, the educational benefits of this movie cannot and should not be underestimated.
