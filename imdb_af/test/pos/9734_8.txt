Ses-shooter, Tunnelsersant, Dr. Death, Pinhead, Cyclops, and Blade help young Andr√© Toulon take out Sutek's Egyptian handler in the best succession this series has seen. <br /> <br /> Retro Puppet Master is atmospheric with many sets, quality acting and some fun dolls FX. What it lacks, makes it an interesting, successful plot. <br /> <br /> Best Quote: Dr. Death: "Don't you know, my friends? Smell the sulfur, see the smoke ... <br /> <br /> It's easily the best Dave DeCoteau movie I've seen. The actors do more than credible work : Jack Donner as "Azfel" turns into an inspired show, and young Toulon does well with the dolls, O, and the ring needle is cool. <br /> <br /> John Massari's score is a good symphony on The original Puppet Master tunes by Richard Band, which plays the movie playfully and ominously, is rare for a Full Moon score to actually add something to a movie, and this one does. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Dave Allen was not affordable enough for Band and Co. in the late 90's, and beyond, so all the puppet show is done and roped in. There is no stopping movement like the familiar and funny scene in the original Pinhead is looking for his pens, and of course, as with all Full Moon rates of this period, RPM was shot in and around Castel Studios in B most of the pieces were thrown to Romans: the hearing of their "Parisian" accent was a bit annoying. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's probably one of the top 10 Full Moon movies. This is definitely the most inventive of the Puppet Master sequels.
