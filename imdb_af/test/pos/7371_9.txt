It was the Saturday before Halloween this year (today, at the time of writing) and it should be the best horror anthology out there. I'm not usually a fan of horror movies, mainly due to the size of the recently released crap. However, the director of Campfire Tales has the Hitchcock esquire gift. Unlike other contemporary films, it does not take the opportunity to fool you, rather than using foreshadowing and near-misses - moments like the moment <br /> <br /> I don't have The Hook or caught the first main segment, but from what I read here, they were the two you could afford to miss. <br /> <br /> "People can also leak" was full of stress - this brief keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for something to happen to the little girl as she turns around her yard and home searches her soccer ball and later her dog. She met so closely that the tension reached heartbeat before the climax of the short, when the girl got up and went to bed, thinking his dog was underneath. She reaches her hand to lick him, and she feels a touch on her hand ... before she writes it on her mirror, in blood, "People can also leak". I will leave the last few seconds to find out, my reader, because at this stage the short could have taken any number of turns. <br /> <br /> "The Locket" was, however, the unspeakable masterpiece of this movie. It starts with a man on a motorcycle, just driving ... to what he doesn't know, but he can feel closer to him. As he drives, a storm breaks out, and he is forced to find shelter in a dumb girl's home. The two are quick to meet each other, but before they can do anything except kiss, the girl reveals by writing the ghosts in her home. They start packing quickly, but they are caught in the midst of a scene of a scene decades past. A father who comes to his daughter and her boyfriend gets ready to defuse, kills the two and commits suicide. I'll have to leave you to discover the end here too - I couldn't hope to do the story justice anyway, and what I have said so far is just a brief summary of the story. I couldn't hope to convey the nuances and sensory details that add to it. <br /> <br /> "The campfire," which is the link between all the stories, is a fairly interesting repetition of the car accident theme, and the girls are very attractive - in fact, most of the girls in this movie is nice. Anyway, despite being cut, the story is given justice, and the end is hard to predict if you're busy with the other stories. However, if you pay enough attention to the segments of the campfire being distributed through the film, it is certainly possible to predict the end, especially if you have seen movies on the same premises. (MST3k fans, remember Soultaker? Same presentation, but without the terrible writing of Vivian Schilling and most of the movie. If you've seen the first 30 minutes, you should be able to predict the end.) All in all the best horror movie I've seen in a long time, and the only horror anthology that deserves a bargain.
