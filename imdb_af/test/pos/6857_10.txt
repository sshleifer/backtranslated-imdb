With "Anatomy", the German filmmakers tried to make something completely new. Usually there are only drama or comedy films - in the horror genre (or was) completely new at the moment. <br /> <br /> The story is also new and shocking. Franka Potente plays her role brilliantly and I bet you won't find out who the killer is. It is possible, but difficult. A very good movie with many talented actors.
