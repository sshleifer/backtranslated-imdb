Before I saw this picture, I was rather skeptical, I didn't like movies with an agenda, and I didn't appreciate being scared to think like the author. I was also scared it would be like the 2-part mini-series "10.4" which had a far-fetched concept, unrelated to the real world and very poor performance. Initially, it was said: "This film is fiction, but the events are depicted and the information on British emergency planning is based on extensive research"; And the general feeling is that you are not sold on an idea, but that you are taught a lesson in civic awareness. Obviously, the message conveyed is self-evident: it comes and we are not prepared. Using real-life sites and a scenario that can't just happen - there are plans for when it does - everything adds to the disturbing effect the movie will have, even the most cynical viewers. The film's perspective is that of society and it remains away from sad personal moments, which will not convey the message, as one of the Romeo-Juliet drama we are accustomed to.
