Alfred Hitchcock's "Saboteur" (1942) (not confused with another Hitchcock movie, "Sabotage" made in 1936 which has a completely different plot) is not the Master of Suspense's greatest movie. The dose does not have the depth of "Vertigo" (1958), nor the "Rebbeca" (1940) atmosphere. It's definitely not the emotional impact and acting talent that can be found in "Notorious" (1946), but what this dose has is excitement, adventure and nail-biting climax. The two leads, though, are pretty poor. It's easy to understand why Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper for the Robert Cummings role and Barbara Stanwyck for the role that Priscilla Lane took. Also, the patriotic speeches that Cuumming says (written by Dorothy Parker) are poorly dated, and the encounter with the circus group was poorly done (the beard on the beard woman is clearly false). The last half hour, however, is a view of the seat, the climax above the stature of Freedom is well done, and the film is a clear predecessor of "North By Northwest" (1959). The two villains, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd are very good and the starting fire at the aircraft factory is an excellent order. It's not Hitch's best movie, but it's one of his most entertaining.
