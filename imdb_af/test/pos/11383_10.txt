Sometimes the Academy does not recognize the potential of some films, or nominate them because they are controversial or strong. Sometimes they are nominated, but nothing wins (I hope it doesn't happen this year with "American Beauty"). This is exactly what happened with "Boogie Nights", which was the best film of 1997. The Academy chose to give the best Oscar to "Titanic", a purely commercial and hollow film, and other awards to the over-rated "Good Will Hunting" and the annoying "Full Monty". The other main category nominations were "LA Confidential" and "As Good as it Gets", good movies, but "Boogie Nights" is even better and should be remembered in more categories. <br /> <br /> This incredible film tells the story of Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg, in a surprisingly good performance), a 17-year-old barman who has the attention of Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds, in a resounding play ), a director of porn movies, brought to the attention. Eddie has a special 'gift', and it helps him get into the world of porn movies. He changed his name to Dirk Diggler and made a big success. But fame ... doesn't last forever. Other characters also have their parallel stories - Amber Waves (Julianne Moore, perfect), Buck (Don Cheadle) and others, including Rollergirl (Heather Graham), an actress who accepts to do something, but she has to wear her roller shoes. <br /> <br /> What a banal, trivial movie could have been, a perfect, memorable one in the hands of Paul Thomas Anderson. What makes Boogie Nights such a good movie is its performance, added to a smart, well-written script, good soundtrack, etc. Each character is very well developed and each one has his / her interest in the context. Every feeling, weakness, fear, emotion is explored, leading to a masterpiece of modern American theater. <br /> <br /> "Boogie Nights" is a strong, impressive image to be seen by anyone who really likes cinema. Under a plot that looks banal at first glance, there's a wonderful story of highlights and drops, things we face in our lives. It is a wonderful portrait of the late 70s and early 80s, exactly at the height of the heights and downwards. This makes this movie so special and a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> 10/10
