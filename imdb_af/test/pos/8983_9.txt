This movie grabs you from the opening styles and never lets go. You look carefully after reading Janos Szaby's excitement about coming to America. He is a lovely fellow man. You can't help loving him, even when his eagerness is replaced with bitterness, as his fortunes change. You know that in his circumstances you will be forced to make the same choices he makes to survive. This film comments on society's worship of beauty and all superficial and is more true in the culture of the twenty-first century. Janos himself becomes the victim of this philosophy if he tells his blind friend "you are young and beautiful, if you could see, you would have the world." And like a modern gangster movie, when her security is threatened, he withdraws a powerful revenge. However, his innocence is not completely lost because he demands an equally high price for himself, knowing he deserves his fate. <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre is in good shape in this lead role. Only a few actors could convincingly achieve this character's transformation of innocent and embittered criminals in sixty-nine minutes. Lorre is well supported by all the cabinets that make it a true ensemble photo and not just a single star vehicle. With a little less preachy dialogue, this movie will be a 10. Highly recommended.
