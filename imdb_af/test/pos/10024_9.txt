While I can't tell if Larry Hama ever saw any of the old cartoons, I would think writing comics, file cards, and some of the cartoons would count on something. <br /> <br /> For fans of the old cartoon, it's actually a continuation of the same, except with a few new characters - and a more insane Cobra Commander. <br /> <br /> We still have all the old favorites, but on a personal note, one thing that has always annoyed me was this "Duke in charge" game, if there were other * officers in the environment is. <br /> <br /> The battle sequence is similar to the old series; the most important tricks here are the CGI. It's generally pretty good, if not a bit top-notch.
