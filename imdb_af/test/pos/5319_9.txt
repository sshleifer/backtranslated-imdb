I remember seeing the trailer for this movie and I absolutely knew I had to watch this movie. It looks like something that would have risen upright. <br /> <br /> "The United States of Leland" is a great movie. It is not one that will leave you with a nice, pleasant ending, but with a sad, empty feeling instead. And if I say it will leave you with an "empty" feeling, I don't mean it as a bad thing. I believe you are meant to fill the empty feeling with your own thoughts about the characters and man's general motives and how they act as part of society. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as Leland. He is intelligent, yet stubborn. I like the way he tells the film with his magazine. The supporting role is also good. Kevin Spacey is very good as always, and Don Cheadle is wonderful as Leland's teacher and mentor. <br /> <br /> It was a wonderful story and very clever and thought-provoking. I highly recommend it.
