If I had to decide what the best Ernest movie was and not act like that, it didn't happen all the time. This is the one. <br /> <br /> All Ernest movies are entertaining. but the best are those who do Jim Varney a number of different characters. In addition, I am known to enjoy the comedy stylings of Bill Byrge and Gailard Sartain as brothers Chuck and Bobby Tulip. "Ernest Goes to Jail" contains all those elements, as well as a funny script and a supporting role that contains various beloved character elements. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I chose "Ernest Goes to Jail" as the king of all Ernest movies. It's not me if you have to, but deeply you know I'm right.
