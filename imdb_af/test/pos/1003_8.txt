So Keira Knightly is in it ... So automatically we compare this movie to reconciliation. The fact that this film is also war and her appearance is uncannous, these films are completely different. <br /> <br /> The actors work well, I think one good thing is there is no memorable person, they are a team. <br /> <br /> If you want a movie where things happen, advise the id another if the story of this movie is about human interaction and their physical damage through their experiences and how their lives are intertwined. <br /> <br /> This movie has real interaction, perfect break moments that make you breathe. No, it is not exciting, but it is gripping if you can empathize with these characters. At moments I wondered if this movie could have been better than a play rather than a movie. We expect a lot of movies, since everything is possible, but with theater we allow to interact and rely on faith. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a hobby, if you are not looking for anything, and if the movie takes you, moving, allowing you to forget these stars and not acting as actors, there are things wrong But let them become people, you will really move in yourself. <br /> <br /> GO ON! ! try it!
