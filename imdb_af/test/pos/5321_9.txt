I noticed that the official IMDb review refers to Leland as a sociopath. I believe this diagnosis is clearly and deeply wrong. <br /> <br /> It is a movie about sadness and about the ability of one particular teenager to see sadness in daily life, as it awaits in every corner, before the unfolding of the lives that affect it. A sociopath is a person who cannot inform others, and who, while the difference between right and wrong is understood, does not care about this difference. A sociopath is a subject that puts him or her in the middle of the subject's universe, with total negative for the impact of the subject's actions on those around him or her. One of the definitions of a sociopath is that a true sociopath has the ability to feel empathy - does not have the ability to feel what others feel and not the changes in the moods of others due to the sociopath's actions with those actions. A sociopath cannot feel the pain of others, or understand that the pain of others is the result of the sociopath's own actions. A sociopath is a person who is not completely formed. An important part is missing from the psychological and emotional composition of a true sociopath, which makes the sociopath immune to "talking therapy" and other treatment modalities involving human interaction and the exploration of personal feelings. Sociopathy is devastating, even when the subject is being treated and placed in a highly structured environment aimed at containing the harm that the sociopath may offer to others. Many sociopaths function more or less normally and are never exposed to the criminal justice system radar, although they tend to wake up a trace of emotional debris in them. <br /> <br /> Leland Fitzgerald is not a sociopath. He is a blessed (or cursed) person with the ability to provide what he sees as the inevitable consequences and outcomes of human interactions. Leland literally sees sadness in the eyes and faces of people around him, as he slowly acknowledges and philosophises the life-losing philosophy, and that people are subjecting slowly to the inevitable and inexorable fact that, for a better metaphor, things fall apart. People falling in love and kissing and hugging today become "pathetic" elderly couples. The electricity in the eyes of Leland's "mother" (a rich New York social person who loves Leland and invites him to the house she shares with her family when arriving in New York City, alone and determined to stay in the city) age 12) as she explained to the last of his visits to New York City that she had been deceiving her all day, having a divorce, breaking his heart, happening to everyone, and that such a loss is an inevitable part of growing up. Her eyes still reflect light, but the electricity they once illuminated is gone. This scene - this explanation, late it is coming - is essential to understand why Leland commits a seemingly wasteful, senseless crime (killing his ex-girlfriend's younger brother). Leland knows what lies ahead for this little boy - a lifetime of unattainable goals, to learn only words that are in danger, never to know the love of another person, never to love and never love. to commit another person. More than any other character in this movie, this little boy illuminates everything that Leland sees as inevitable and horrible over the world. Leland's act - to kill this little boy - is a merciful act for Leland, as it is the one thing he can do in a world where actions cannot change outcomes. While a true sociopath knows that actions can change and change, but don't care about the harm that other people do to such actions, Leland does. What most people regard as a barbaric and horrible act is the only decent thing he can do in Leland's eyes to relieve the suffering of just one person. <br /> <br /> It will be comforting to present it as an explanation of Leland's actions - comforting, but incomplete. Because in the end, "blame" for Leland's actions elsewhere. As is often the case, there are no easy explanations and no balm to apply to the angry soul. Why has Leland not learned something that even the most pessimistic people usually acknowledge - sometimes - sometimes sometimes - people remain in love, and relationships succeed, and even the saddest life changes? For Leland there is no middle ground, no inner core to which he can retract and regroup. There is only pain and sadness. One is being asked to blame his arrogant and thoroughly unpleasant father, the brilliant writer (played by Kevin Spacey) for not being during critical times during Leland's development, but the man's folly may have been a blessing . br /> <br /> In the end, this viewer is surprised by a tremendous sense of sadness. Why is Leland doomed to see the world through a veil of pessimism and depression? There is a maturity for Leland's character - present, for example, when he repeatedly insists that no one should blame for his girlfriend who arrives with him - this is both stoic and heartbreaking. Stoic, in the sense that it is absolutely real, despite the confusing statements of Leland's teacher. But sad, because it's not so much understanding of despair. Leland's indifference to his fate is merely a reflection of the absolute certainty of his belief that nothing really matters. Nothing he does can change his fate. <br /> <br /> It is not sociopathy being displayed. That is, if anything, its polar opposite ...
