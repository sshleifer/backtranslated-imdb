Just after 30 years, Baby Blue Marine has seen again. I still find it a pleasant and romantic movie that captures a time lost forever. The innocence and purity of a long time gone by are truly trapped in this little film. The acting is above average and Richard Gere's short appearance as a watched Raider Marine War Hero holds great interest in any movie buff or Gere fan. Jan-Micheal Vincent is in the front and looks and acts as the "All-American" boy. The then-Bruno Kirby (who was billed as B.Kirby, Jr.) has a greasy role as "Pop," a peaceable, Marine Corp rejected and dream to return to his wife. If you're looking for sex, drugs or rock and roll, this movie isn't for you. If you are looking for action and adventure, it also applies. However, if you want a time in America of innocence, honor, romance and love, then Baby Blue Marine is a movie for you.
