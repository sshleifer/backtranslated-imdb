This 3-hour epic (looks much shorter) explores the will for power and conquest and the contradictory motives underlying the quest by following two parallel lives: the emperor Q'in, whose desire to make the Chinese feudal states united, has its basis in noble goals but decays into violent oppression, isolation and ultimate powerlessness; and the killer Jing ke, a mercenary killer who acknowledges the unintended consequences of murder and finds a form of redemption. As with all great art, it can be understood on many levels. The film made me images and ideas from Homer, Euripides, Machiavelli, Shakespeare and Freud. <br /> <br /> The story itself is true (I chose it at britannica.com!), so this movie will appeal to history buffs. It is ironic that Q'in spent much of his last years in a useless quest for immortality (not shown on the screen, but in accordance with the plot). <br /> <br /> The movie can also be regarded as an allegory of Maoism and the Cultural Revolution. Through the film one can understand that the past 50 years of Chinese history have had their predecessor in the last 3000. <br /> <br /> Happy to the audience, these complex ideas are developed into a movie that rich in images, action and pageant. The battle scenes alone is worth the price of admission.
