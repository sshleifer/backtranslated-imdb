I think it's one of the best tamil movies I've seen for a while. I love the fact that it doesn't turn around and a girl falls in love and they made the movie brilliant. The cast did a good job and I especially wish the little girl good luck. She was brilliant and really brought the feel of an adopted child to her real mother. Best of all is the songs, beautiful music and moving lyrics. There are some good songs in this move. especially 'Kannathil Mutthamittal' and 'Velai Pookal'. Big songs, both of them. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good cry and some good plays (and great songs!). Cheers Simran.
