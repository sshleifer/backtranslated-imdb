I went to school on MCRD Parris Island in 1953 and this film is about as accurate as depicting which boots went in that era, even burying that filled sand flow. Many of the "actors" in the film were active Marines. This movie can be more entertaining for Marines than others, but I feel the movie itself is very well done, and Jack Webb made a "good DI". Semper Fi!
