While I agree that this movie has no real content and should not be taken seriously, it is mainly aimed at fans of the series looking for a quick fix. Bronson (Paul Kersey) is back in the streets (a license not to kill the chief police) and moves into his friends apartment (whom you guess) killed by a street gang who took control of the neighborhood (which looks like Beruit). It's funny that people who associate with Bronson have a habit of killing. Bronson kills them one by one systematically because people in the neighborhood are used against him. There is some dynamism between Bronson and Fraker leading the street gang, you can tell they both enjoy their work. At one point in the movie after shaking in the city's jail, Fraker says: "I'm just going to kill an old old lady for you, get it on the 6:00 news." The "Giggler", a wallet thief who laughs while committing his crimes, is also nice to watch. The film was made in 1985 and most people can probably identify with the stereotypical urban gangs thrown into the movie. It's nice to look at Bronson (Paul Kersey) to escape the streets of these thugs. Look for the look of the Wildey Magnum, a hard piece of hardware that Bronson uses. I also really liked the soundtrack of this movie.
