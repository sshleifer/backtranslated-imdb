Well, it's about as good as they come. There are arguments about whether Hitchcock was just a "commercial tension expert" or perhaps a "compulsive technician" - or was he really "deep". No one knows exactly what terms it means, but it is legitimate to ask if he could not at all be all three things at the same time. <br /> <br /> In this one he seems to be at its peak. Almost nothing in it is coincidental. It runs out of doubt, ambiguity and whiteness. And the story is disturbing, Patricia Highsmith apparently has complexes similar to Hitchcock's own. <br /> <br /> I'm sure the plot is set elsewhere so I won't bother it. I will only show five on-screen incidents that Hitchcock is undoubtedly responsible for. <br /> <br /> Bruno Antony (Walker) followed Miriam (Laura Miller) and her two boyfriends to a carnival at night, intending to kill her. She noticed his attention and was flattered innocently. <br /> <br /> 1. Laura and her two friends rent an electric boat to go through the Tunnel of Love and then to an island in the middle of the lake. Walker is right behind them, smiling, in his boat - Pluto. "Pluto." It's not an allusion to the Walt Disney cartoon character. It is a reference to Pluto, also called Hades, a god of the underworld in Greek and Roman mythology. This small contact cannot be an accident. And the "underworld" that Walker represents is not just a literal hell, but the underworld of human mind. I hate to say he's a jungle "shadow," but that's what he is. (Did Carl Jung see this movie? He was alive at the time of his release - but probably not.) 2. Now it's a deadly serious sequence, right? Walker is a madman about to kill a woman he doesn't even know. Imagine how this would be explained by most directors. A night-time stalking through a crowded carnival, stealing from shadow to shade, the killer from behind the canvas walls and so on. What does Hitchcock show us? When Walker first came through the gates, concentrating on his victim, a little boy in a cowboy pack, with a balloon, walked up and shouted: "Bang! Bang! You're dead!" Walker stunned his head and looked indignantly at the child. And when the child walks away, Walker throws his cigarette at the balloon and pops it, and continues his pursuit without another look. This is one way Hitchcock deals with the impending punishment. <br /> <br /> 3. The familiar strangulation reflects in the fallen glasses, which have been counted countless times. <br /> <br /> 4. Miriam and her friends stop at one of the devices that hit you with a big hammer and send a kind of hockey puck to measure the power of your bladder. One of her boyfriends holds it and the puck doesn't reach the bell on top. Under Miriam's delighted and admiring look, Walker smiles and rubbing his hands, picks up the hammer, knocks it down, and the puck bangs against the bell. She's excited. He puts the hammer down, looks at her, whips and WAGGLES HIS EYEBROWS on her like a ten-year showoff! 5. After the discovery of Miriam's body while whistling and shouting, Walker leaves the carnival and meets a blind man waiting at the curb. Walker took the old man by the arm and led him over the intersection, holding his hand seriously to stop the traffic. A macabre joke. <br /> <br /> These incidents and others occur during the ten or fifteen minutes of the carnival visit. (Robert Walker's performance is exceptional throughout.) It's actually a kind of invitation to be noirish. (Cf: "Ride the Pink Horse") But the threat of the scene is suppressed by Hitchcock's insistence on irony and distance. None of the known noir techniques are used. There is nothing really "creepy" about it. And the murder itself is hardly a cruel one. I don't think any other director like Hitchcock would handle it as he did. It would be all threats and shadows, shelters, abortive efforts, kicks instead of grills. <br /> <br /> Not that it's a completely flawless movie. A flawless film is not yet with us. From the middle part is a bit slow and Farley Granger, although a nice old, cool, boring and quite stupid. His new girl friend is not boring. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock was the misunderstanding of guilt with deadly seriousness in "The Wrong Man." I'm not sure Hitchcock ever thought about the difference between legal debt and moral debt. The latter was imposed on him at an early age by his Catholic education. "Original Sin" - you were born with it - and all this. In filmed interviews he always dismissed his fear of the police and authorities in general by telling a story that his father had taken him to the police station to scare him to a peccadillo in him. We are justified in asking if it was just what psychoanalysis calls a "screen memory". I hope you get the pun. I know I know. It's tense and indecent, but I spent a lot of valuable time thinking about it.
