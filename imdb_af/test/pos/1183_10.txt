For people like me who were born long after the 60's ended, we can only learn about the era of cultural artefacts, of which "Hair" is one. This is definitely a well done tour de force. One can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture. Probably the most impressive scene - at least for me - is when the group crashes the rich people's party. Regarding the film's final scene, one can interpret it as the symbolic end of all that the 60s suggested. <br /> <br /> No matter how you interpret this movie, it is important to understand that although the '60s may have ended, the movements they typed still exist still in small enclave. It's a time that people won't soon forget. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this movie is one that I definitely recommend. Milos Forman played another good one here, right between his two masterpieces "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Ragtime" (so why did he later make a piece of crap like Man on the Moon?!). Play John Savage, Treat Williams and Beverly D'Angelo.
