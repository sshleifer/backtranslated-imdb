Soul Calibur is stronger than it ever was ... with the new character creation, and the bad cricket of the sword mode on the home version. <br /> <br /> The arcade version is more complete, although the character grid is smaller than the home version, this version is definitely the nicer of the two, which has all the "goofy / unrealistic" fighting styles found in the home version. turn off. If you were somehow disappointed with the home version, or thought it was too much, you might find a much more fun and straight forward game from Soul Calibur in the arcade. Do you think what is needed to become a legend?
