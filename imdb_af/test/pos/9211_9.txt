Just watched the program for the first time - the 2-hour kidnapping program. Don't know why I didn't have it sooner? James Caan is outstanding and fully credible in the role of head of the featured 5 * Vegas complex. <br /> <br /> So often, programs like this one or more in the ensemble that are either really annoying or appear to be selected have to be linked to the producer or director. <br /> <br /> This is definitely not the case with this program. Along with Caan, all the primary and supporting role players are attractive and credible. The guest actors are well chosen. <br /> <br /> The stories I saw are interesting, and the show also offers a good view of the city. <br /> <br /> It's an entertaining program, and one that I will keep hoping for. I don't know how to miss it for so long, but plan it from now on to TIVO.
