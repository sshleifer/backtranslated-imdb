Unfortunately, because I can't find myself, I didn't get any of the other entries in the series, though I definitely don't care and trust me, I watched. For anyone who doesn't know, it's a point-and-click adventure title. This means that the mouse is what you use to link to everything you can do with it, although there is one particular case in this where it is inaccurate. I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't tried it yet. However, no matter how little experience you have with computers, you can sit right and try it. There aren't even very many pieces of this that you need to be fast or have quick reflexes. Heck, you can adjust the speed of the text (if you have subtitles), and therefore the talk in it, and it is not very uncomfortable or forced when it is slow. Access to your inventory is easy as well as the combination or use of items. By holding and holding the button, you can have three options for using it (it is a person, a specific part of the environment or an object): Hand (press, add, open, etc.), eyes (examination, looking through, etc.) and mouth (eating, vice versa, etc.). All this adds to a welcoming, friendly environment, where you can approach the plethora of puzzles (the amount depends on the two difficulty settings you try) at your own pace and explore and take in the dozens of individual, creatively crafted characters and territories this to your heart's content. The length of it will be determined by how much time you take to do it (you won't get any debt from me, it's worth it) and your skill to find the solutions. There are a few points where you have to decide if you want the harder way to complete it or not. It can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. There is no material that is not acceptable to children. This is one of the products that proves that this fact does not mean that it is unbearable to older audiences. The animation is quality work, smooth, everything moves as it should, and the 3rd dimension is honestly not so badly missed when trying. The storytelling is well done, and you're never unclear about what's going on. There are many well-directed cuts, kept in the same colorful, mostly bright 2D world as the rest, with well-done camera movement. "Cartoony" is an appropriate word to describe it, not just the visual style. It can be applied to all these things. The whole world of this is very similar to, but not quite the same as ours, with a mix of past and present, inhabited by people and filled with things that we can at least partially recognize or understand, but make the absurdity They are funny. This will be one of the greatest strengths of this, right there: it's hilarious. Much of it comes from the spoken rules (what is said as well as how it is), and those who focus British efforts with the focus on verbal, such as 'Allo' Allo or the BlackAdder franchise, will want to investigate this sucker. However, there are different kinds of jokes, including but not limited to: satire, cunning, dark, spoofs, irony, brutal comedy (not exactly my favorite aspect of this) and more. There is self-awareness, with the guidance that personally addresses you, and for example explains why he is not going to do what you just asked him. There are references to pop culture by a few decades. Almost everything doesn't work, and there's almost no gags flat, and if you're not in stitches, my best guess would be that it's just not compatible with your sense of humor. judge, and if one suspects that this is the case and wants to find out, I propose the demo version, where you can see for free whether you care for the play and / or laugh. The plot is well written (almost everything is really), develop beautifully throughout and keep your interest. The sound is all excellent, sharp and well done. The sound effects are spot-on. The music is well-composed with no exceptions. The vocalist is impeccable, with a celebrity or two. Armato is fantastic as Guybrush Threepwood (must love that name), who you control. Boen is incredible like LeChuck, the deceased (and ever-threatening) zombie villain. The designs are incredibly well done, highly imaginative and fit. Despite the relatively limited mindset of our hero when it comes to piracy, you can involve some. Manage a ship, sign it from others, and apply blades in a very unique and wonderful way. The reproducibility is mainly in the choices, in the dialogue, etc. It's linear, with a little freedom as far as the order goes, so the buccaneer sitting on it for at least the second time isn't that big. A number of possibilities are challenged as far as they are concerned, unless they have forgotten what should happen in the meantime. Oh, nothing is perfect. Anyone who would soften in a well-crafted and fascinating fictional universe and run out numerous times should get a real kick. The good kind, not the ones that hurt and potentially leave. Don't forget, kids, * don't * eat books ... it's just to beg for a paper cut. I would dare guess that those who love the other would also appreciate this one. And they're not the only ones coming in here. I recommend it, except members of the aforementioned group, any fan of this genre of VGs, as well as anyone to whom this review appeals. 8/10
