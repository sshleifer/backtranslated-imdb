The '7' rating is not necessarily a smear - this movie is on a low budget - but it's well done within the limits. <br /> <br /> An ordinary pot-boiler plot destroyed in space, people and prisoner escaping into pods, landing on unfamiliar planet where their presence wakes up. Mayhem follows, many ammunition is spent. <br /> <br /> The special effects have been saved and done well, focusing on future technology with holographic displays and controls, rather than relying on large-scale, cheap plastic props. Plus, the story moves without the viewer getting bored in boredom, where they start to pick things apart. <br /> <br /> I pick this one as a small Saturday afternoon movie. You can get up and hit the fridge without interrupting it and it will still be nice. Better still, your girlfriend can talk completely through it without damaging your enjoyment - and she'll be happy: after all, she's talked to you! That's the kind of movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the real story line has a few holes after they hit the planet, but hey, it's a Guns an 'Ammo action movie. Coherent story lines are not necessarily required as long as you have Beer and chips at hand. So don't get yourself in the brain.
