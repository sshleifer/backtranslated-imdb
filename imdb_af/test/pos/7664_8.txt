I love the Thackeray novel on which this movie is based. And while this modern version of Becky Sharp's story is a B-movie, Loy's decisive role in her first over-billed role is quite fascinating. <br /> <br /> Before joining MGM's prevailing good girl, he & # 39; s got comic roles, she was an actress. Vanity FAIR was Loy's succession film for EMMA, in which she played a sneaky and greedy daughter who destroyed the loyal housekeeper (Marie Dressler). <br /> <br /> Loy's Becky is much nastier than Miriam Hopkins's version 3 years later in BECKY SHARP. Loy's Becky is a very pre-code film character with her thin neck and amoral ways. This is the kind of character Jean Harlow or Clara Bow could have played easily, but Becky here is still supposed to be the finest set. This is what makes her fallen character so tragic. <br /> <br /> Unlike Loy's grab, Becky is the goody goody Amelia (Barbara Kent) who is just not an interesting character. Mary Forbes is somewhat good as Mrs. Sedley. Most of the other actors in this release are beautiful blah: Conway Tearle and Rawdon; Walter Byron as Osborne; Anthony Bushell as Dobbin. Others are almost Dickensian is their peculiarity: Billy Bevan as Joseph; Lionel Belmore as Crawley; Montagu Love as the Marquis; Lilyan Irene as Polly the maid; Elspeth Dudgeon as the housekeeper. <br /> <br /> Loy is through and through. While the end is quite shocking, she has several excellent scenes, such as the gambling scene in the casino, where she tries to win another woman's roulette bet. The more Loy's Becky's morale decreases, the more beautiful she becomes until she is finally caught. Bottom line here is that it is a very good performance by Loy in a movie to be seen.
