this is the best movie I've ever seen !!!!!! I just love them !! I watch it every day! I have the episodes of the internet! here in Romania the 6th season is broadcast! I am glad that I have seen the show from the beginning and I am glad that I can see via the internet the 7th season. So far season 5 is my favorite: D I love it because Logan appears and the scene where they jump is my favorite. I also had Dean, but Logan is the best. I want Lorelai to stay with Christopher because he is beautiful. This show is good for all ages and is worth seeing. I really want the DVDs, but I think it will never appear here in Romania, because I think they don't even know they have fans here. but no matter what I will look at. bye !!
