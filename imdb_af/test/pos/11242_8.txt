I can't say this view is perfect. Perhaps all the previous commentary remembers the old Tuesday at 10:30 am, which was recorded by the childish humor of Butch Elvira Curt ('There is a spacecraft carrying a 747! hit it to change it. <br /> <br /> See, comedy can't dress a showcase and create the comic genius of the real Canadian Trailer Park Boys, but hey, they try. <br /> <br /> This performance is by far one of the better original performances, none of which will find themselves laughing at the apparent players who show their stupidity to pick up girls: <br /> <br /> a) " Dumb "Girls - Obviously they can't realize they're not just like the girls on show. Unaware. Jump on the man's meat, you can call yourself a whore tomorrow and get his name. He looks good, he must be popular and beautiful. HAHA HAHA !!! Oh, but you will never do it! No one would ... if they knew it was happening. <br /> <br /> b) Unsocial guys who think women like nice guys. Obviously these guys succeed in succeeding on what you fail or don't even experience. to make your madness boil. Look more carefully, they are shot down most of the time. They say stupid crap. <br /> <br /> c) Girls with respect for each other - Obviously your distinctive female species in the real world are spotted, wrongly wrong. No one is playing. Women are not objects, they cannot be played because they are all very faithful angels who go to clubs politely to talk to each other without fear of guys trying to pick them up. <br /> <br /> Wait ... hmmmmmmmm <br /> As much as ALL will say this show is not funny and it doesn't teach you anything, I have to take the opposite. The performance is very good in the details of how relationships work for both men and women. The way they think, and the way they think one another, and social hierarchy. It's funny to see and hear the guys, making absolutely idiotic comments on things the women say ("My grandfather recently died." "Oh, well, did we have tonight?). <br /> <br / > Furthermore, she is a club, the place people are going to have fun, and they are laid in. No matter who you are, you go to a club to get someone or pay attention, churches go there to test their game and girls pick up girls girls flirt with guys and find the one who wipes her the best of her Light up! <br /> <br /> If you are a guy, learn a thing or two about different approaches and the different effects they have, if you are a girl, learn what these "studly" male whores really think, and learn to distinguish them from real guys, the next time you break through one of those shower wads Don't realize it because of him, because you're stupid and thought he was the greatest guy ever when he was completely dicked all the time.
