What started out as a homespun comedy drama and then changed halfway into a melodrama made a big star of John Garfield - and fair. But Jeffrey Lynn should not be dismissed as the object of the love of the four daughters. Lynn is very beautiful and so beautiful, it's easy to believe that all four daughters can fall for him. Although Garfield received the most kudos, Lynn became an important chief at Warner Bros because of this movie. Michael Curtiz insisted that the picnic scene be shot, which is the highlight of the film. Throughout, the craftsmanship is enough to give awe. A sea opera by Fanny Hurst has been transformed into a cinema masterpiece.
