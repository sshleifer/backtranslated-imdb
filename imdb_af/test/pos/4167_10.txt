A surprisingly wonderful cartoon in the same league as Batman: TAS and his ilk, I enjoyed it in my youth and could see them all again, a good voice acting from Tim Curry, Richard Moll, Tony Jay and Maurice LaMarche. different roles. The only blame I had was Rob Paulson's voice was a bit too old for the title character, but it wasn't a big problem as the stories were good and the whole thing was a good time wire has. Some say it was a cop-out, but I have a refreshing compared to many series that just hang things. Hopefully one day they put this series on DVD. Unfortunately, it came at a time when DVDs weren't common and the cartoon probably only sold a specific type of toy. I never found this, despite the entertaining cartoon.
