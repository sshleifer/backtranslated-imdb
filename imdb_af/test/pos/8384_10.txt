That's what I thought when I heard about the role of Inglorious Basterds. And I'm both from Germany and in movies. <br /> <br /> The guy is older than 50 and so far he has played almost only in mediocre TV series - and even there he didn't play the chapters. Obviously no one has ever noticed what he is capable of. Now, thanks to QT, he had one chance to change it - and - let's say this - it was a bingo! He is the living proof of what a great castor is Tarrantino. <br /> <br /> By the way: I think it's a great privilege to watch the movie as a German - to understand everything. And the German dialogue is almost as good as English. <br /> <br /> Now I can repeat, which many others have previously written. I will briefly say: Finally, QT is back.
