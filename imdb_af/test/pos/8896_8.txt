As much as I hate to disagree with the original poster, I found Asterix and the Vikings very well, and a BIG step above previous efforts to impress everyone's favorite Gaul. <br /> <br /> For anyone who is not familiar with the famous comic series, the show will be difficult to follow, but for those of us who know, it is a pleasure to watch. <br /> <br /> First, the animation is much better than earlier comic adaptations. You can tell that they have taken the time and effort to fix the look and feel of the comics. <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, there are elements of other Asterix titles in the movie and I can see how fans of those titles might be confused or a little lower, but I was so trapped to actually one of my favorite children's magazines that is faithfully represented on the screen. Small destroyers follow ... <br /> <br /> Asterix and his faithful friend Obelix travel north to save the cousin of their village chief, trapped by the Vikings. The Vikings think that the boy will teach them about fear of flying, due to a poor wording of their village's druid. In the process, the boy meets the Viking chief's daughter Abba and they fall in love, etc., etc. ... If my explanation is listened to, don't worry. The plot is easy to follow! Definitely a good buy. You can buy this DVD through Amazon France, but be warned. Your DVD player may not be able to play it. I had to change the regional setting on my computer to see it.
