In the "goofs" section of this film there is a remark that there is a mistake in continuity where Auguste's car is seen being parked elsewhere than seen in a previous shot in the same scene. This is wrong. One of the views is from Auguste's apartment, the other is from Valentine's apartment across the street. The whole purpose of this segment is to show how Valentine and Auguste - which can be made for each other - almost crossroads (as it has happened several times), but never really do so until conditions are on the ferry at the end of the movie. (And here's the implication that Joseph manipulated things so Auguste was on the ferry, after checking Valentine's ticket to see what sailing she was.)
