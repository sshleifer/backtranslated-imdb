Check it out on Comcast On Demand. <br /> <br /> Every time I see this musical, I'm amazed at the songs ... one show stop after another. <br /> <br /> For me, this interpretation is magical. The songs are glittering ... the choir, orchestras and choreography are great for a "made-for-TV" movie ... better than many increase versions I've seen. <br /> <br /> The debate on Bette just doesn't make sense. She's Mom. Her voice is brilliant and yet full of the patos of the stage mother who lives by her daughters. I still get tears in the end when she finally has her glory, no matter how faded the glory is. <br /> <br /> The Tulsa / Louise duet / dance is currently. Fabulous. <br /> <br /> Stephen Sondheim is the King of Music Theater. His lyrics just roll off the tongue as she ... Styne's music may be the best ever written for the stage / screen. <br /> <br /> Thanks, we have this masterpiece of the American Music Theater on DVD.
