First things first. <br /> <br /> Angels and Demons are a much better and much different movie than the DaVinci code. <br /> <br /> Following the recent death of comic book movies, remakes and dubious rebellions of older franchises. It is refreshing to see a very solid and entertaining film uncovered by shaky camera-filming techniques, lens flares, excessive GCI and top action. <br /> <br /> In this regard, angels and demons feel almost old-fashioned. It provides a good and judicious debate on the age of religion Vs science, provides insight into the parallels between the great houses of God in Rome (beautifully shot by the road) and the temple of modern science that CERN's large Hadron Collider facility . <br /> <br /> Hanks is Hanks who pretends to be the smart man and he is better than his timber performance in Da-Vinci the second time. Good support is provided by a solid solid casting, with a particular highlight that is Armin Mueller-Stahl's stoic cardinal. but the movie's main saving grace is the pace. for the full run I was completely up to date with the story and the movie never really gave me time to put its mistakes in logic. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that some of the science depicted is at its best debatable greetings true reality authenticity. But it is not the fault of the filmmakers, rather an observation of the old saying that you should never leave the truth in the way of a good story. <br /> <br /> Speaking of which the story is a cracker, blending adventure and a race against time with good sprinkling of intelligence and a fine twist or two along the way. <br /> <br /> Overall, I strongly recommend it to fans of one of the national treasure movies (which it seems clear but with a much more serious voice) and fans of rounding off adventure stories in general.
