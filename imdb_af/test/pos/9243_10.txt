Fascinating looks behind the scenes about how a really good movie can be made if the producers, director and role simply refuse to stop. These guys experienced serious stumbling blocks during the two years of the project (minimal budget, writing problems and authoring), so the final product was not the first to be proposed, but probably became more interesting than the movie that indicates that the punk mentality of "just doing" ... with or without any support, money or help ... find out what you want to do and do what you want to do. I liked a lot about this documentary and know that viewers will see things they didn't know before. This movie is really one of a kind ... it's hard to classify because it contains pieces of sci fi and suspense and also makes a movie. It tells the truth about how movies are made, what can go wrong and how to overcome it. I especially wrote the music of Ed Ivey. These guys know how to make a good movie on a shoe string because they are creative and know how to build props, skirts, staging, lighting with what they can shoot ... pretty amazing stuff.
