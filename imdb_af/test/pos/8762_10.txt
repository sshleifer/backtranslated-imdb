Beautifully built, "Traffik" tells the story of drug use and trafficking from various points of view. From a policeman, from a politician's point of view, from an addictive point of view, from a smuggling's viewpoint and from a farmer's point of view. In a carefully instructed storyline, one gets the impression of how everything is interrelated. From beautiful on-site shots in the poppy fields in Pakistan, to Karachi, to the airports of Frankfurt and London, to the delapidated buildings where the smuggling takes place, one sees the massive dimension of drug consumption.
