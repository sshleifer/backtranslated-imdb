I usually hate movie movies. Living in England is a nightmare at the moment when you have an allergy to time drama - what I do. However, this one is the best. It doesn't take itself seriously, and Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are good together, Liv Tyler is also good, although her English accent is dodgy. <br /> <br /> The movie has everything for someone who just wants to go to the theater to enjoy themselves. It has action, adventure, drama and comedy. I don't know how well the jokes will translate over the sea, but hopefully they'll do it. It will be a pity for American audiences to miss this movie. It shows that English filmmakers can produce something that does not involve constant curse and sex. Both features in this, but in a balanced format. Iain Robertson's camp portrayal of the good to do a man is brilliant and the two brothers who are also part of the upper class are hilarious! <br /> <br /> As the trailer for "The Spy Who Shagged Me" .... "If you see another movie" .... make this spring it Plunkett and Macleane. It's fun, action scary and of course, Jonny Lee Miller with an English accent for a change!
