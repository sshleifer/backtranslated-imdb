AristoCats is such a great Disney classic that I loved so much as a child. Until today I can't resist it, it's just such a wonderful and beautiful movie with great animation and beautiful songs. I really miss the animated films like AristoCats, they have perfect voices not to mention the hand-drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family. AristoCats is also very funny and clever, the story was just as wonderful. This movie is just beyond irresistible. I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano that teaches the appecios, lol, it was just as cute with the piano playing and painting. <br /> <br /> Douchess and her kittens are very spoiled in their big house, mainly because their wife is very rich and treats them as they were her children. But when the lady feels it's time to do her will, she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler. The butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and hits them in the middle of no place. Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat named Thomas O'Malley, they return home to their wife, but teach the shade to be a skate treasure. <br /> <br /> The AristoCats are just a perfect Disney movie I feel is a bit overlooked. I will always recommend this movie for kids or families, it can be enjoyed by anyone. The songs and story are just unforgettable. I will always join the movie's best song "Everybody wants to be a cat", such a big voice. I also love the dogs that guarded the farm where the cats left, they were just as cute. It's a fantastic movie, please look, you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
