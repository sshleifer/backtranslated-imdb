This is a movie that is much more enjoyable than the 7 score. In many ways, it's like a 50-year-old version of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS. With much of the exorbitant and slenderness of VALLEY, it yielded a little to the audiences of 1959. Like this later film, both are about three young ladies who are fast-paced - though this time in the publishing industry rather than the entertainment industry (though one of the ladies has the BEST GENERAL aspects of Broadway). <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Hope Lange joining the company for her first day of work. She was assigned to a strong-as-nail boss, Joan Crawford, who appeared in her first supporting role in decades. Despite the nasty Crawford looks, Lange is determined not to give in - to make it into this job. And over time, she quickly moved from the secretary to the editor. At the same time, her two new roommates also try to move the ranks - one by stage and one by a relationship with a rich playboy. Like VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, everybody gets up and down (mostly downs), but by the end of the movie there is hope that at least some of them will make it - knocked and bruised. Nevertheless. <br /> <br /> In this movie, men are mostly pigs. The only man who looks decent is played by Stephen Boyd. Of course, Hope Lange neglects him for a ne'er doing good ex-boyfriend. As for the guys played by veteran character actor Brian Ahern and the rest, they are sexist scum and finally you understand how Crawford has become so bitter and nasty. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything - adultery, premarital sex, abortion, etc. and is definitely not an artistic triumph. But thanks to excellent production values ​​and a juicy script, this one is a joy to watch. Just don't expect Shakespeare !!
