It was a true epic production that had all the elements one wants in a fantasy movie. The costume, the music, the cinematography - all the artistic elements of this film were absolutely beautiful and have a rich experience. <br /> <br /> Ted Danson, best known for his TV roles in "Cheers" and "Becker," was excellent in the role of Gulliver. Mary Steenburgen (Time After Time, Cross Creek) performed equally well in her limited role as his wife. <br /> <br /> Other shows I really enjoyed were James Fox as dr. Bates, Alfre Woodard as Queen of Brobdingnag, and Peter O'Toole as Emperor of Lilliput. <br /> <br /> It will make a pleasant child movie, but it will also appeal to adults for its deep social comment.
