A truly fantastic, touching movie. Female melodrama at its best, with lots of comedy: good dialogue, characters and writing. Any woman can relate to the story because it is a classic: you fall in love with 'sir right', but he has no interest in you until a guy who looks completely wrong comes along and you fall in love with you head. But of course it's not that simplistic. The characters are real and all the performances are perfect. The movie is also hilarious, every movie society. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a well-written script of humor and melodrama. You can relate to each character and the plot moves unexpectedly. A great, understated movie.
