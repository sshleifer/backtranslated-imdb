This is a gripping story that lends elements of the Kennedy assassination and successfully uses it to create an excellent Western story. <br /> <br /> The movie has a good music party, although it relies on the repetition of the title theme a bit too much. Giuliano Gemma and the rest of the cast are excellent. It is more cerebral than ordinary spaghetti westerns that rely more on storytelling than action, and succeed because the story is excellent. It is not to say that there is no action in the movie. There are many, and they are very well made. This movie instantly captures you and keeps you absorbed to the end. You will always wonder what everything is in the documents. It also has some commentary on American politics. <br /> <br /> This movie shows why Valerii is, in my opinion, three-way with Sollima and Corbucci in the rankings of spaghetti western directors.
