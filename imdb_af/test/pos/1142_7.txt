In a very near future world, a corrupt government is constantly monitoring computers and surveillance. One man has managed to evade assimilation, and works outside the system and fights to preserve his freedom. An engaging and imaginative story and some very interesting editing and camera work. There are some confusing and slow parts, but everything is an excellent example of what a small crew with brain and talent can do on a scant budget.
