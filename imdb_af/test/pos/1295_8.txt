Having seen other Bollywood flashes with Salman Khan in them, I can say this is my favorite of the more recent ones. The songs are all very nice, especially 'O Priya O Priya' which has a beautiful mix of Beatles, Indian music and (sometimes I do) a little prince. The love stories are a bit more credible than, say, Chal Mere Bhai. The occasional focus on Prem's use of alcohol is sometimes difficult, as it doesn't really make sense to me, but it is played well by Khan, although his voice is whining when portraying drunkenness.
