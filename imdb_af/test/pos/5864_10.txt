I remember this movie as the other person who said. I wrote about it, but wish I had it just because it was one of the worst movies ever. Funny, in a very bad way. I remember the mark line on the box was "The ultimate frontal lobotomy". I got it from my mother, who got it from a friend at work who said it was the worst / cutest movie she ever saw. My mother said, "My son will probably love it." and the woman gave it to her only to get it out of her possession. I later pasted it over, which I regret. I also remember that the "cake screw" thing was one of those ball catches .... the yellow cone stuff, with a red "button" at the end, and when you hit the red thing, it sends a flying ball. Well, they used it with a crutch on one side, and a corkscrew in the funnel. When the killer was killed, they showed him to come forward with the "weapon", and then cut a close-up of raw chicken and fake blood on the victim's head. I don't know what else to say about this "jewel", except that if you like bad movies, it doesn't get any worse than that.
