"The Gymnast" unfolds in short shots and short scenes, which obscure his characters and message over time. The saving operation is accompanied by a beautiful, simple score. This intimate approach is great to feel as if you are on the path of discovery, as much as the characters. <br /> <br /> The savings approach is also its disadvantage; There are some scenes that are confusing because they don't have enough context. There are some decisions made by the characters who seem to flip until I watched the interviews in the bonus material. I am glad I did, because the actors' descriptions of their motivation gave me a much more rounded understanding of the film overall. <br /> <br /> Apart from the story itself, it was great to see women so comfortable and strong in their own bodies. The shooting was done very tastefully; lots of matter-of-fact. One has the feeling of seeing a love story and unfolding a life story, not a voyeuristic sleaze movie. The physical characteristics of the athletes - their reality - is a great contrast to the sometimes etheric nature of the plot. <br /> <br /> Not a movie, I will have to see again soon as the storyline is simple but its delivery is powerful enough to stay with me for a long time.
