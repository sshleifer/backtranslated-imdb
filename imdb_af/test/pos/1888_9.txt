I saw it last night and I laughed aloud for the whole second half of the movie. The whole audience was. Bruce Campbell made a damn funny movie! I don't want to give anything away, but when the film turns and turns, it gets wacky. Just one funny scene after another. My hats from Mr. Campbell and crew to draw on such a small budget. Bruce was there to introduce the film and do a Q and A, which was a surprise. Many of the questions people asked were rather lame, but Bruce would turn them around and be all sarcastic. He was wonderful! Anyway, the movie was love. I look forward to seeing it on DVD later this year. B makes sure that it is checked on the Sci-Fi channel in the autumn. I recommend this one.
