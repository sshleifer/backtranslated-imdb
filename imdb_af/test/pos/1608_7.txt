In Luchino Visconti's film Death in Venice, it is not only the beauty of the surrounding world that is decaying, but in the pursuit of beauty itself, Gustav von Aschenbach falls into a mere watch of a man. To understand the decay, we must recognize the beauty we enchant, best described and explained in a quote from Socrates found in Thomas Mann's version of Death in Venice. "Beauty alone, is beautiful and visible at one time? The only aspect of the spiritual that we can observe through our senses? Who would speak to us as the divine, as reason and virtue and truth with us? not lost and consumed by love? We see this thing happening in the film, the man is surrounded by a longing for beauty, which leads to a longing for the son, Tadzio. telling him that the worship of beauty can lead and leave sensuality, he cannot contain himself. <br /> <br /> It will be easy to describe it as a beautiful film; hall, and we are treated to a perfect summary of the century's high school life, all captured on film by film Pasqualino De Santis, but Visconti does not enjoy the picturesque aspects of Venice, but instead the glorious and sensual artistic achievements of the past based on materialism and sensual beauty, and these things are rejected by the past. The city we know of incomparable beauty and uniqueness is nothing more than a relaxing resort with friendly hotel staff. The streets become exhausting labyrinths filled with disgusting dirt and rotting, the city decaying against the protagonist. Only through the flashbacks are we allowed to get a glimpse of why this well-known composer is a weak and harmless man. The death of his daughter, and presumably his wife, along with the failure of his music, allows us to understand why he is destroying himself. <br /> <br /> Alfred, with whom Aschenbach talks in depth about the meaning of beauty and what it can create; but Alfred is more than a friend, he is Aschenbach's alter ego, and what Alfred says articulates the composer's own doubts and fears. The scene in which Aschenbach decides to leave Venice is immediately followed by a stone by Alfred telling him that he has poor, alienated and lacking feelings. Ultimately, we can conclude that these flashbacks are not real. It is a decay of memory, rather than objective versions of the past, these flashbacks become distorted memories. We can say that these are reminiscent memories because even Aschenbach indicates it, he states: "reality leads us down and humiliates us;" And because of the scene in the travel agent's office we see Aschenbach Tadzio and his family confronting and warning them - leaving for Venice, but immediately after the meeting we see him sitting at the clerk again and realizing it's all in his imagination, he works long dialogue-free scenes framed by the horrific music of Gustav Mahler. He makes the viewer's mind wandering as we watch Aschenbach's life and respect fall into disrepair with his beauty. <br /> <br /> Slowly, the viewer realizes that our hero is overwhelmed by exhaustion that is mixed with a growing awareness that the town is being smothered in garbage. The crumbling city is the stage for the middle-aged man's attraction to Tadzio. It is romantic that longs for something so idealized and ambiguous that it can never be consumed, even in fantasy. The beauty of this Polish boy burns a fire in him that first glows him, and then uses it. The movie ends with von Aschenbach who sits poorly in a beach chair that Tadzio fights with his friend, we see the black dye of his hair falling on his cheek and it looks like rotten blood, this is a vision of his life's passing moments, though before his last breath. The final decay happened, and around him the city was polluted, and with it he became what he denied. As Aschenbach dies, he has the same painted face as the old man at the start of the film, a man who disturbed him. It was the pursuit of beauty that began its decay; in the pursuit of artistic beauty he could not make his own demise and that of the city feel around him; His sensuality is conceded, while constantly in control by the presence of death and decay. These are the three themes that combine the destruction and death in Venice, beauty, death and decay. These themes are Visconti's art, the beauty of his work is in the fall of beauty itself. <br /> <br /> In this movie we are treated to the deliquescence of a great man. We see the honored composer Gustav von Aschenbach striving for true and pure beauty, and it is in pursuit of this trait that it lapses around him and leads to a miserable, lonely death that sees the goal of his love. I believe Visconti, through these movies, is trying to tell what is beautiful doesn't last. Falling into the world is intrinsic, and when we are distracted, it can destroy the beauty. In death in Venice, it is because of culture and by the pursuit of beauty that everything is removed. Beauty and deliquescence are intertwined like thorns in Visconti's works, instantly beautiful and destructive, these are the themes that define his art.
