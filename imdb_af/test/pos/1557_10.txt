"What Alice Found" is the biggest movie nobody ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard it, and I knew it was all sex, no plot, and just really stupid, but in reality it was really good. They say all Indian movies suck, but this one, and "Napoleon Dynamite" didn't suck. I asked my friend, who saw it before I did it, and she said Alice had all these three roads, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three way I remember, and little nudity. The movie had a point and it taught me to never trust hitchhikers. I like that they eventually get Alice a little dolphin. On the way to Flordia. I totally suggest seeing this movie.
