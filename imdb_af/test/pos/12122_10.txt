I just got it in the post and I was pleasantly surprised. As a big fan of the 70's theater, it doesn't take much to satisfy me when it comes to these kind of flicks. Despite the obvious low budget on this movie, the play is overall good and you can even see why Pesci would ever become the greatest actor ever. I'm not sure how real this movie is, but it's definitely a good contribution to the mob genre .....
