Starewicz is endlessly inventive and his techniques are still astonished by animation fans another 70 years later. We can now have computer-generated techniques, but everything he had in 1934 was an imagination that wouldn't take 'no' for an answer. Whatever he wanted to see on the screen, he created. <br /> <br /> And he wanted to see some bitter things - every imaginable piece was called for service: old shoes, chicken legs, cutlery, broken glasses, dolls, monkeys, rats .... looked like there was nothing that was out of bounds. <br /> <br /> An actual, frightening, even disturbing film to be seen by anyone with even passing interest in animation. This film should be seen to be believed!
