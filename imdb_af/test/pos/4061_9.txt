Dad (78) and I (46) both had a good time watching the movie today. For a man who is mainly known for serious roles, De Niro is a heckuva comic actor. Of course, it helps to play his past movie images. Consider that one of those roles, 15 MINUTES, was a cop who had to handle the mass media interference, and you have an interesting set of comparative / contrast performance. <br /> <br /> Murphy plays another of his Axel Foley type characters. Shatner plays a burlesque of himself, a parallel world himself best known for TJ HOOKER and not STAR TREK. <br /> <br /> It is interesting to watch the film comment on the contrasts between the reality of police work and its fictitious TV and film counterparts. Shatner reads about the correct way to slide over a hood; De Niro points to holsters scratching the hood. Ironically, as the film progresses, De Niro's character begins to bring together the illusions of the TV cop reality in the real world case he is working on. <br /> <br /> The film draws its inspiration from a source of resources. make the comments it derived. Well, so what? Satire must deduce his humor to exist. And besides, the film has unprecedented moments of originality. For example, I'm pretty sure the villain's method has never been done before. <br /> <br /> One doubt about the reality of the weapons involved - should those guns not have a kind of setback? To penetrate steel, the dots had to have enough inertia to penetrate. And any bullet's highest inertia is at the moment of fire. So ... to shoot a volley of these tank killers, the shooters had to drive back on their buttocks. Oh, how completely ... this is a satire. Perhaps the rifle's lack of record itself is a satire on the B-F rifles that are so unknowingly used in sensors. <br /> <br />
