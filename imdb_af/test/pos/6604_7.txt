Dogtown and Z-Boys are a documentary about the Zephyr Skateboarding team, and their impact on skateboarding. It also focuses on the history of skateboarding. It was directed by Stacy Peralta, a member of the original Zephyr team, and was written by Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, another team member. The documentary stars the members of the Zephyr team and are told by Sean Penn. <br /> <br /> The documentary talks about starting skateboarding, and how it developed from surfing. It discusses skateboarding's popularity in the late 60's and 70's, the decline in the 80's and its 'rebirth' in the 90's. Skateboarding was launched in Dogtown, nicknamed the poor side of Santa Monica, California. The Zephyr team comes from the Zephyr Surf Shop, which produced the first modern skateboards. The documentary consists mainly of the original members of the Zephyr team who talk about the past in the Zephyr team, the competitions they won, and their popularity and prestige. It focuses on three specific members of the team; Peralta, Tony Alva and Jay Adams, three virtuosos of skateboarding, and probably the best three members of the team. <br /> <br /> Documentary interviews are usually about the archival material of Dogtown in the late 60s and 70s. Very rarely do you actually see people interviewing, but when you do, they are shown in black and white, while the archive material was in color. I think Stacy Peralta used this technique to show that the documentary was past (that is, the Glory Days of the Zephyr team) and not the present. The documentary is very fast, as we often see cuts of impressive skateboarding about the beating music of the era (such as Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and David Bowie), and the interviews tend to be quick and up to date. If I don't know anything about skateboarding (that is, not even riding one straight on the ground), I was very surprised to find this documentary so interesting. The reason is that this doco was more about the Zephyr team than the actual sport of skateboarding, so I couldn't relate to skateboarding, but I could relate to the boys in the team. Made by real team members, it gives a little more depth and authenticity. <br /> <br /> All in all, I should say this is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It gave me a whole new insight, not only in the Zephyr team, but in the skateboarding as a whole. For those who love skateboarding, I can only imagine how it should be even more interesting. Seven and a half stars out of ten.
