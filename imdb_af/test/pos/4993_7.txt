Everyone wants Duvall and Jones back, come on! Viewers say things like, Zahn and Urban are not so deep ... Puhlease! Were you so deep when you were young? That's the whole point: they have a lot to learn. Zahn and Urban pull down the plain innocence they are aiming to perform, and with great commitment to retain the nuances of Duvall and Jones's input into the characters. Zahn is wonderfully perfect like the early Gus, and Urban is subtly perfect like the early Woodrow. What a sharp step it was for them to accept such a position in the entertainment industry. They had to know they would all come down to them because they were not actually the beloved original, but they clearly made the best progress. I gave it a 7, because the editing was in place, and the timelines were sketchy, but the acting was a joy to watch. Val Kilmer was absolutely wonderful. Another thing: I expect that the audience would have been more accepted by the mysticism that the appearance of a jaguar and blue and gold ear had deemed, if more trouble in the way they appeared and so simply by characters are accepted.
