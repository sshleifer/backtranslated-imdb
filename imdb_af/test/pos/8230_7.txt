I'm a fan of Randolph Scott Westerns. While some of them are incredibly clich√©d (like most Western of this era), its easy delivery and style really elevates the movies to classic and near-classical status. While this film contains another example of real life, Western heroes are exploited after Hollywood's death (in this case, Bat Masterson). The film works well because of both him and his excellent supporting characters. One is the always strong act of Robert Ryan - an excellent actor who is almost forgotten today. The other is the ubiquitous Gabby Hayes who has one of his best roles as the cunning and very colorful deputy. Here he is more enjoyable than in his many supporting roles for Roy Rogers and John Wayne - mostly because his part is better written and he is given more to do. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty much the plot of half The Westerners have ever made. There are a few bad things that a bunch of thugs are running to run the locals and it is up to a doctor (Scott) to restore peace and kill the villains. But how the plot is performed is much better than the average and therefore the movie is still visible. Don't just expect a whole bunch of innovation or uniqueness - unless you want to see what might be Gabby Hayes best performance.
