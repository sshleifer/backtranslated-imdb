Although this film looks like a Crime-Thriller Noir, it's actually a bit simplistic and with very few surprises turning or turning at all - and those that look are not really shocking. <br /> <br /> But if you're slipping out of an intense action thriller mode and into "mindless entertainment," then it's really a fun movie with several hilarious moments. Most of this can be attributed to the witty dialogue between Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson's characters - but Sadie said it all in her hilarious opening greeting to Friedman. And it left very little for anything else to develop between these two characters. I didn't find this valued British actor version of the southern accents so bad. (Okay, Thompson sounded as if his marbles were in her mouth while she was speaking south, but Rickman was surprisingly good with very little decay in his usual English accent). If you want criticism, we can discuss it with Coco. She only spoke southern time. <br /> <br />
