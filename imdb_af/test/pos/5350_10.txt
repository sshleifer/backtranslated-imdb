In 1989, Aardman Animations launched the two heroes in The Grand Day Out. In 1993 they fought an evil penguin in The Wrong Trousers. And in 1995 they had to save sheep from an evil robot dog in A Close Shave. In 2005 they returned and they were fighting something that was cute and cuddly in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit. In this full feature film, Wallace and Gromit work in Anit-Pesto, a pest control industry. There will be a huge vegetable competition, but rabbits will keep the neighbors' fighting. Wallace and Gromit take care of it. But Wallace had an idea. He will wash the bunnies with his machine. After you do that, something suddenly eats all the fries in the area and it's great. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to save the day. As a fan of these two characters, I was impressed. It held what had been the previous three chapters and, instead, added many voice-over Hollywood actors, they didn't give a name to the job and the boy, they did a fantastic job. Wallace and Gromit didn't change. Wallace is still the cheese love freak he always was and Gromit is the silent newspaper reading dog. Also the script was not too sparse, like other family flies. There is a twist of who the Verre King really is. The direction of Nick Park (the director of the 3 previous chapters) does a very good job with the storyline. Instead of adding the Hollywood formula to it, he just took the style of previous chapters and added a bit of a dark fantasy twist to it. Well done, Nick. The rabbits are also funny and rich, but the funniest haste in the movie is one that has Wallace's mixture in it. The characters weren't bad and they weren't annoying, but they would never up Wallace and Gromit. The animation is indeed fantastic and wonderful. I have never seen a clay animated movie that is so wonderful. Overall, fans of the two knuckle heads (including the teens) will love this fantastic movie. This is a good movie that has to get an Oscar next year. Hooray, Wallace and Gromit. 10/10
