One comment said it wasn't a comedy ... Error! It was a wonderful comedy of a history that didn't easily lend that genre. Very busy ... and active movie from start to finish. Often the shots were from the window of the train, or car, just fine. An enjoyable way to spend a few hours in a theater. All the French historical figures such as Charles de Gaulle and Petain and some of the people involved in the French Resistance were included in the writing that those who are unfamiliar with the collapse of France under the German invasion may want to investigate. The characters were alluring and the actors they portrayed were excellent. Recommend it, 9 out of 10.
