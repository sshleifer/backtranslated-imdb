I saw this fantastic movie at the Fantasyfilmfest in Berlin and when I left the cinema, I felt I was driving! I saw a lot of movies and there are just a few that I call perfectly like Fight Club or Koyaanisqatsi! Unconscious cruelty is now one of them! Half of the people who watched it in Berlin went out of the room and I can absolutely understand it because it can be a real shock to someone who lives in his / her perfect world, day after day around his / her dream to dream, not to think of the horror on us planet-in our lives! I don't think I should describe the story of the movie to you because the people have already written on this page! It's a movie that shows everything and everything !!! Get 10 points + of 10 !!! It would be cool if you were writing people who saw it to me! So far, I have not been so impressed with anyone! Finally, sorry for my bad English. I'm not a studied person (and it's so good!))))))
