I saw the accidental movie when I visited my uncle in Arizona about 3 and a half years ago. The VHS pressure was a little faded, but I was very much followed by what I looked at. Did it all make sense? Well, honestly, no it has. However, it is a movie that requires more than one show to understand all its aspects. The beautiful tragic score rushed me and the bizarre images made a quiet impression. <br /> <br /> Well, when I found out that Anchor Bay released this strangeness on DVD, I picked it up right away. I was very happy with the transfer, although I lacked the extras rather. Although the film relates to the "O" and Sir Stephen characters, it has nothing to do with Pauline Reage's original novel or the 1974 film The Story of O. However, the film focuses on artistic detail and symbolism of an almost mystical type. "O" decides to prostitute herself to Sir Stephen in violent 1920s Hong Kong. Her goal is to prove her unusual dedication and love for her master by giving her body to other men. Of course, Sir Stephen enjoys her during her unpleasant sexual escape, and even finds a lover. However, the tables are turned when "O" actually finds some kind of love with a young male admirer. Suddenly, Sir Stephen feels the threat ... <br /> <br /> I feel the deep meaning behind the film (including the tragic count and artistic direction) really makes this movie a classic. The viewer is not only introduced to the lives and passing of "O" fellow brotherhoods, but the 1920's turmoil of Hong Kong is also being investigated. Like the political environment, the prostitutes all need themselves. No one is happy in the movie, even if they believe they are. (But, "O" finds a sense of happiness with her young admirer). One prostitute shakes him remember how her father worked like a dog when she was drunk, which of course leads to a fetish because her clients act like a dog. Another older prostitute is obsessed with her past as an actress. She can't let that vision go. She treats her clients as co-stars and even swears she hears a piano in the river. <br /> <br /> As for "O", she has a look back over her father who leaves her in a critical circle. When he leaves, she feels a sense of abandonment. Of course, in the same jump, Kinski suddenly becomes her father. I was very, very disturbed by this image. I really felt "O" at this stage in the movie. She smiles scarcely and this scene really explains why. Her fear of abandonment is so great that she sees Mr. Stephen as her father and provides for her every obscene question in the hope of proving her love. <br /> <br /> Another strange aspect of the movie is the young child (who is forever ending) who sells luck in a box. It's a very random character, but somehow it just adds to the feeling of loss and emptiness in the movie. At one stage, the director even uses painted cardboard figures to represent people. Now, if it's not symbolic for you! (Laugh) <br /> All in all, I really love this movie. I feel this is a very deep and somewhat moving experience. It has erotic scenes, but the scenes aren't really meant to be aroused. Like the life of the characters, the sexual acts are empty. They are movements but do not feel and tenderness. (Again, the only tender scene is between "O" and the young man). "Oh" believe she is in love and that lowering herself is an honor, but she eventually finds out that she has choices. She can also be her own person and pursue her own happiness, but she also has the option of staying in that circle that her father drew. The director leaves many unanswered questions, but some things don't need answers. The viewer will make the judgment that works for them. <br /> <br /> I have to say that I want a special edition of this DVD released with director comments. I think it would be fascinating to hear his opinion on the film and his message years later. It's a pity that the soundtrack was never released. This movie has a really ghostly and heartbreaking score. There is something about the deadly chorus that chews my spine. I can really feel the feeling of loneliness in the movie just by listening to the music.
