Remove all parts of the movie that were the "current" day and stick to the flashbacks. Then you would have had a wonderful story. Faith and Wolf's story and their relationship were the best part. Diaz and Eccleston were wonderful. Brewster was ponderous to go through. Surprised to see Blythe Danner as a mother. She was wonderful. Also watch Patrick Bergen as the father, always like him (Sleeping with the Enemy). It's a lot of hippy, except the world, kind of movie. Don't mind, but I recommend seeing it for Diaz's performance alone. She has an excellent range and it needs to be used more. Eccleston is, as always, compelling. He is wonderful!
