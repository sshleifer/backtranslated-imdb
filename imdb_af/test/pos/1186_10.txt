It couldn't have come at a worse time - just as the nation entered the Reagan years, the stress-tree 80s, the time of no regrets, no worries. It had no mouth-to-mouth and opened poorly. The studio cut it down. But Hare is probably the best music ever made - with Forman directing and Tharpe choreography, it's a brilliant, well-directed, well-written triumph that few people remember. The casting is perfect, the musical numbers are memorable, and even the end of an end does not make the inhumane spirit of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, you haven't seen any music of all time. Seriously.
