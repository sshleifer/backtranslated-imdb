I'm a big fan of Naruto, although I didn't watch every episode or read every manga. <br /> <br /> I really watched the first Naruto movie, and tell you the truth that I was a little nervous that this one wouldn't be as good (or action packed) as the first ( mainly because this one in Australia only had a PG instead of an M, which is a PG-13 USA or 12 UK. But I was wrong (thank you)! The animation was improved better (although some characters of the characters raced at points) it was very good, especially in the battlefields. <br /> <br /> Talk about it, let's talk about the scenes! The animation and action in battle scenes was spectacular and very entertaining! I especially enjoyed the genjutsu battle with canoeing and the battle with Gaara fighting the form-shifting female warriors! All the characters you want are here! Naruto, Sakura, Gaara, Kankuro and Shikamaru! If only Temari was in the movie, Shikamaru could save her dramatically from the female warriors! And maybe they can have a passionate coast! In my summary at the top I say that this qualification is more than a piece of Cinema than just an extended episode. And do it! The action is lots of theater and the animation quality looks very fancy especially during the battle! Overall, this is an excellent anime movie that has a must-see for any Naruto fan! 05/05! 10/10! 50/50! 100/100! Okay, I'll stop!
