It's a 1972 Disney movie. For the time being, I was eleven years old and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Nostalgically, I bought the three series of DVDs from the Dexter Riley movies and even now, at the age of 46, I still enjoyed it. It was all about fantasy, magic and clean fun. And it's still! I wasn't sure which of the three movies was the second and last. So now I have the official dates. On December 31, 1969, the computer wore tennis shoes. On July 12, 1972, you see him now. You shouldn't be the strongest man in the world on February 6, 1975. I still think the middle film was the best. The special effects were wonderful back in 1972 for our children. I definitely recommend it to all ages.
