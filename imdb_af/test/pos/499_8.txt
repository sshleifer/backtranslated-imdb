I remember seeing this one in the theaters when it came out, had no idea what it was going to be and would be so pleasantly surprised that I wanted to buy the video when it came out. <br /> <br /> While not going too far to dissect this movie, I'll say I've given it an 8/10, for all the reasons you can read in the other user's reviews. <br /> <br /> What I will say is this: <br /> <br /> The first 10 minutes of this movie is incredible. It's as close to a textbook grabber as I've ever seen. I once put this movie on a party, where everyone was finished and ready to go. I just wanted to see what would happen if I showed them the first ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Everyone who watched the opening stayed to the end.
