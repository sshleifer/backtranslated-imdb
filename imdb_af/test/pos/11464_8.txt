Night of the Demons is a great movie and an excellent example of how good a low budget can be. Certainly, many of them are pretty predictable, but somehow it is much nicer than the horror we've seen today as "Horror". I give the gore a sturdy 9, and the Demons' one-liners are actually funny. I'm still civilized by "Stop me!" The soundtrack is well done, I was surprised to hear Bauhaus's "Stigmata Martyr"! There are also some very nice T&A on each other, as well as some good makeup effects. The second film in the series is also pretty good, but avoid the inferior third. Night of the Demons can be dated, dark and lower rent, but it still has a lot of potential. It is definitely worth a rental at least. Give it a chance tonight, stay away from any old makeup! (you will understand if you see it!)
