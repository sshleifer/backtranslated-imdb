I'm not here to tell you "Armor" is Kubrick, Hitchcockian or Fellini-esquire. Nope. Referring directors are more like Don Siegel ("Charlie Varrick") and Walter Hill ("The Warriors"). Those two helmets didn't bang with fiction, like putting women in their movies. No skirts should apply. They made old films unapologetically. Guns, many guns. Men met violent death with a jaw. Their movies were like a juice to the head. You want a friend? Get a dog. <br /> <br /> "Armored" is such an old movie. Dueling armored trucks? Bloody gunshot wounds? Exploding money? If it doesn't excite the brain of your brain, stay away. <br /> <br /> At 88 minutes, "Armored" is all the muscles without an unmade fat. We meet six security guards who run armored vehicles, three per truck. The six, led by Matt Dillon, schedule a fake hijacking with two trucks. Their mission is one day to deliver $ 42 million from the federal reserve (I think). The idea is to drive both trucks to a warehouse, bump into cash, then run a hijacking. Certainly, the police will suspect them, but if they meet, they will get it. <br /> <br /> The problem is, one of six, which Columbus played briefly, is a sting. First. But he did see eviction. And he is the guardian of his excited younger brother. He needs cash badly. <br /> <br /> Matt Dillon cajoles, pleading, persuaded to persuade the verdict. No blood on someone's hands. A clean way out. All right, not bad. You will be rich forever. Blue sky smiling at you ... <br /> <br /> Right. <br /> <br /> Everything goes to hell, of course. This is a damn thing after another and the game continues. And almost everything happens in the deserted warehouse somewhere in Los Angeles. In fact, the film goes out of its way to project a background of industrial urban decline. I like industrial urban decay. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Matt Dillon, who plays the top bad dog. He goes from charm to disappointment to be frustrated, furious to make himself completely mad in the course of the movie. Love the guy. <br /> <br /> Also, credit is due to the threatening, throbbing, blistering and completely sinister electronic soundtrack by John Murphy. I suspect he heard a few Tangerine Dream records. <br /> <br /> It's also surprising that it's a PG-13 movie. I caught one ?? a! ?? f-bomb in this whole movie about violent naughty robbers. On a certain level, I like it. Take the kids. <br /> <br /> The director is Nimrod Antal, a Hungarian who made a fine noir in the Budapest metro system called "Control". Author is an out-of-now man named James V. Simpson. <br /> <br /> Many of the people in this movie have just started. I am prepared to find that the performance given to this movie will increase as time goes on and these filmmakers progress in their careers.
