Hoot is a pretty young movie about a group of middle school children trying to keep a pancake house chain of a piece of land that is home to some endangered owl trees. The acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see. Many well-known comedians are in this movie and keep the humor almost unstoppable. It is a film for the young crowd, maybe 5 to 11 years old. I thought it was a beautiful change from the pace of the adult movies passing through the screen. There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or children. It's just a lot of fun with a constant message about saving the beautiful places in this country to develop. If you can remember back to the day you didn't fight for a buck, remember that money is not everything. Not many people over the age of 12 will enjoy it unless they really have a soft spot for the special series after-school.
