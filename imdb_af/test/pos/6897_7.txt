I sell the death (2009) ** 1/2 Dominic Monaghan, Larry Fessenden, Ron Perlman, Angus Scrimm, John Speredakos, Eileen Colgan, Brenda Cooney. Independent blend of horror and comedy that existed as a valentine for the '60s horror films of Roger Corman and Hammer Studios, with two cretinous diggers (Monaghan and Fessenden) challenging the final punishment for the crimes via the guillotine, but not before their stories of the occult can be reminded in flashbacks. Amusing and some well-sprinkled crooks, but really a mess of a B-movie trying to be a cult classic in the year, mainly because of the decisive genre veterinarians Perlman and Scrimm. a good rental for Halloween.
