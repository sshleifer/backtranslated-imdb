This British documentary was recently shown on Comedy Central during their "Best of". week and can also be seen on the South Park's second season DVD. I remember many ads for the DVD that contain clips of this documentary version, most of which occur with Matt Stone, Trey Parker, and another man in a bubble bath. It was funny when I saw it in the ads, but I was used to seeing it when I saw the real documentary. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Goin Down to South Park" is a pretty funny and interesting look at how South Park episodes are made and the series's history goes back to when Matt and Trey have the idea in the reached college. However, there was something about the tone of this documentary that actually felt kind of depressed. It's not as fast, fast fire, and as alive as the real South Park episodes. Instead, it has a slow, dry-white style, which can sometimes be funny, but most of the time you're just waiting for something to happen. If you get the chance to watch it, it goes completely in, but I don't think you will miss much if you never see it. <br /> <br /> My IMDb Score: 7/10
