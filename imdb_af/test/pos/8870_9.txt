I don't understand this movie's clear average rating! <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it, I even stayed until early morning to watch it on the late night TV. <br /> <br /> There are three excellent characters here, excellent characters. Danny DeVito played a jeweler, quite a feat due to his directing. His tendency sometimes laughed, and the character was brilliantly written and surreal in an absolutely credible way. There are people like that, Owen was just on the line without crossing it. <br /> <br /> Billy Crystal's comic soul and timing sense was perfect for his role. His frustration / comedy was interesting and fascinating and what's more ... you can understand his feelings. To really feel like you know, a character is hard to reach from the writers' point of view, to find the right actor to pull it off, is an art in itself and both are reached here three times. <br /> <br /> Third, who else could have played Momma? There is no one who can play this part so well. There is a style there unlike any other, something you like to watch, I waited and waited for her to appear on the screen ... and not because the rest was bad, oh no, but because Momma's character was like that again without stating that it was great to watch. <br /> <br /> And what's more? A happy ending to new friendships, no one is hurting and anyone getting what they wanted in life ... WITHOUT a big cheese tied to the end. Brilliant writing, brilliant idea, perfect role, good movie.
