I can't really explain why I find it so tempting and "The Leopard"; This may be because the focus is on everything that was wonderful about that movie, those intimate moments that Visconti can do so great. Like the movie, it has a majestic slow pace, but this time it's not too long. It's the kind of movie where nothing happens, but twenty minutes like that. I think it should be partly attributed to the way the movie deals with flashbacks that act as their own mini-story. Like 'The Leopard', it has a sympathetic lead that brings out the same kind of worn-out pathos - although Bogard's actions are more willing to open himself to unlikely, especially in appearance: he has a very thin smile that's easy to to keep. It is often very beautiful in quiet moments. This is the abundance of Visconti's films, the grandeur of the balls, which I find boring, as they exchange individual clarity with mass accuracy. But here it is part of the point - Gustav surrounded by a visual din. <br /> <br /> The way the object of Gustav's love is introduced to us is quite brilliant - the camera shows a girl, girl, girl, then this beautiful, female-featured boy. It is like an indication of Shakespeare's sonnets, and it does not feel heavy. (It is only when the camera Tadzio fully sees, pulls back and we see its long, slim legs, that we realize that it is not a boy, but an adolescent. First of all, we need Gustav's attraction) Visconti must have known it, and he doesn't give it to him.) Visconti is extremely patient with Gustav; we get a sense of the man, we know him. This is a great silent performance, and when he opens his mouth, it is to inject poison; No wonder he needs the English, sincere boy to test himself. There is a difference with Tadzio (we never know him, just as we never know a handful of Fellini grotesque, but that's because his life is another, his own movie), but it's not as flirtatious as that made to look (there is one scene, however, where he turns around a pole that is too much). Tadzio does not necessarily lead him - he looks at him; Visconti is just as zoom in. <br /> <br /> The movie does not give gay to Gustav - Tadzio is not even masculine, he is a nice version of a boy (delicate, pale, wispy, with golden locks) who all seem to be love (including one beautiful, slightly older young man with whom he wrestles). The closest they go to show what can be seen as a reference to Gustav's homosexuality is the famous hairdresser scene, which unlocks its suppressed vanity. <br /> <br /> It's not quite successful - the whole section with Alfred is a waste, and some unnecessary scenes, people wearing bags in long shots, could have been cut out. Some parts are heavy-handed, such as when Gustav's boat pulls, and rowdy boys pass him by - the appearance of his face is too obvious. (But in the same scene, Gustav throws a fitness, wants a new robber, something inexplicable to make up for it.) But there are a few scenes that touch for the first time, building up a remarkable, silent intensity. Tadzio repeats a piano song, the notes moving in the air may be the best example of the anxiety the movie has. There is one discussion that contains a debate that I am particularly interested in: Can art be spiritual if it satisfies the senses, or should it go beyond that? (We can consider Tarkovsky, who both view Visconti and Mann as the leading example of someone who goes beyond mere sensory sensations.) I think this one management both. 9/10
