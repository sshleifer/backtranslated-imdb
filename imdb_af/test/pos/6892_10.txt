I absolutely loved this series and was very sad to see it. Yes, it is Christian based, and also traditional. It's about difficult issues, like the other reviewer shows, but I think it depends on your point of view on these issues. And as a teenager grows up and now as a mother, I was so happy to see a TV show that was clean and, frankly, wonderful! In contrast to the other reviewer, I was sad to see how they dealt with the condom agreement. Instead of hearing the typical wishy washiness over condoms, they showed that the boy was really cool and applied to his later relationships, which were pure and divine, and much safer for that (100%!). <br /> <br /> After watching this whole series, you become very attached to all the characters in the family and outside the family (as they settle down more permanently), and the moral values ​​they teach in each episode. is just priceless. I bought Touched at an Angel (made by the same producer) to cheese here and there (although overall I liked it), but this range was, in my opinion, made much better and performed better and was also more interesting. . It was good for the whole family and was interesting for the whole family, which was a great plus. The family was not excellent, they had their own mistakes, but in the long run they did what was right and saw how they were growing and changing and struggling like any real family. This was my favorite show at the moment and will always be near the top of my list, I hope it comes out on DVD!
