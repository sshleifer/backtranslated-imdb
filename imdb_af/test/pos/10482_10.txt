The dead spots and picture superficiality of "Out of Africa" ​​buried about any interest I might have had to read Isaac Dinesen. When my brother bought my "Babette's Feast" and when I knew it was based on a Dinesen story, I didn't run exactly the VCR. But as the titles rolled, it became clear that it was not an ordinary movie. Jutland (where it is stated) is not Africa; the cold dung collected on the camera shots is not inviting. The cold, forbidden sea; the heavy gray clouds; the light, icy green cliffs - translate into hardships pointing to the director Gabriel Axel's curtain. The craggiest is Bodil Kjer's as Philippa; Amidst the many merits of this movie, the most memorable is the face. It is like a map that presents the cherished wonder of her pastor's apostolate; like a maze of long-forgotten fjords, where the complications of her congregation's perseverance and dedication hang like shiny screens. <br /> <br /> I am gathering it is Dinesen's point how the world is inexplicably drawn to Christian commitment, when Philippa is rejected by her only ceremony (because he fears he will never be the rules and strings of her little religious click do not measure), and he returns to find her mistress whom he sees as the greatest chef on the continent. I think it's also her point that Christ answers the doubts and regrets of those who give worldly success (Philippa's sister Martina reaffirms the efforts of a visiting baritone (Jean-Philippe Lafont whose folly creates a constructive counterpart for the gall of the spirit that surrounds his discovery) to make her into an opera star, the title character leaves France and an enviable reputation and seeks a sanctuary as a servant of two spider sisters, artists' triumph to only God and neighbor to him to testify, but it is Axel who weighs the sharpness of these people's lives with the richness of Martina's voice and Babette Hersant's table and influences an abundance you would never expect of a movie sacrifice, belief and religious belief. <br /> <br /> What this film sets apart from other religious films is his clever humor. "Babette's Feast, that is the banquet itself - a posthumous ministerial commemoration 100th birthday Day - is a beautiful orchestrated collision of sensitivity that offers comic moments by an ensemble of actors who are unmatched in their subtlety. It's just this great comedy that makes the solemnity easier. Together they do pious movies. They leave a believer extremely hopeful and unexpectedly decide and humiliate.
