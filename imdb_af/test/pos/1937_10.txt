It's a forgotten classic of a movie, and Harmony Karin borrowed a ton of it for Gummo. Gummo is good, River's Edge is much better. It's no secret that Keanu Reeves is not the best actor on earth. No, he's actually a horrible actor. But he was born for some roles: Ted Preston, Esquire of Bill and Ted, and his role in this movie. He is perfect as a kind of good, natural but very apathetic and confused teen. Then there's Crispin Glover. I think his performance in this movie is the best of his career. He is phenomenal like the wackjob character. Then there's Dennis Hopper, who is also perfect. This movie is just wonderful, and if you haven't seen it, it runs out and watches it today. Its brilliant. One of the best portraits of modern America I've seen.
