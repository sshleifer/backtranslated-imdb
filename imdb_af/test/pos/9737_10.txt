I loved "Flash Gordon" as a child and watched the series again on DVD, bringing back such good memories. Every 15-minute episode contains the adventures of our hero Flash, the beautiful Dale Arden, and fearless dr. Zarkov on the planet Mongo. With Flash escaping death in every turn: The Sharks almost drowned, he watched the Fire Monster in the Tunnel of Terror, and he is in danger of death in the static room! <br /> <br /> The characters are still nice: Buster Crabbe is each the blonde dream boat hero and Jean Rogers is a delicate and beautiful Dale Arden. Princess Aura continues to exploit Flash for herself, King Vultan of the Hawk. Men still have their booming laughter and angel wings, and Ming the Merciless, Emperor of the Universe, still gives everyone the evil eye and the creep. <br /> <br /> Today, this series will probably not interest children with its hokey effects - oh that spacecraft! - But it's a fun little nostalgia for those who liked it for the first time. The actors play it straight and do not play with children. I appreciate that young viewers have expected to read the chapter synopses, which had quite big words in them. <br /> <br /> I'm glad it came out on DVD. It's great fun to see this classic sci-fi series again.
