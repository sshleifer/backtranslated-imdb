Many consider BEAST STABLE as the last of the "real" FEMALE PRISON films, as it is the last of the series directed by Shunya Ito, and is followed by another film (GRUDGE SONG) by another director. I haven't seen GRUDGE SONG yet (but soon ...), so I don't know how to stack it on the previous FP movies - but it will be interesting to see. The way BEAST STABLE ended did not leave much room for another predecessor - but I think I'll find out ... <br /> <br /> This entry has Scorpion underway by the police, where she hangs with a street hooker who gets pregnant with her delayed nephew (oh yeah - it's not a lie, must love these crazy story lines). Scorpio is eventually kidnapped by an old competitor, but (as she is so good ...) she ends up escaping and taking revenge on some people who have hurt some of her hooker friends. <br /> <br /> I agree with other reviewers that this one is a bit slower on points and more "serious" than the previous two entries. The story is sometimes confusing and tortuous, but many of these 70-year-old pink movies are - and I still love them. BEAST STABLE is very bad in the nudity, which was pretty disappointing - but I thought it was strong in other areas - storyline, filmography, some good sleaze, and so on. Definitely worth it for fans of this kind of thing or who enjoyed the other FEMALE PRISONER movies ... 8/10
