eXistenZ was a good movie. Initially, I wondered what was going on, organic "pods" made up of mutant reptiles, connecting you and other players with a umbilical cord through an umbilical cord to a surreal reality game. It does look a little strange. <br /> <br /> But as soon as it's going, it's a pretty good movie, with some twists with a big open end and the good aspect of weridness in the movie is also to be seen if you're not sure is what comes next. br /> <br /> Security staff throw away the metal detectors; they have leggings!
