Originally filmed in 1999 as a TV pilot, "Mulholland Dr." was rejected. The following year, David Lynch received money to film new scenes to make the movie fit to show in theaters. He did it - and made one of the biggest, most bizarre and nightmare films ever made. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't really have main characters, but if there are main characters, they will be Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita (Laura Elena Harring). Betty is a beautiful blonde who lives in her aunt's flat while playing auditions for movies. She finds Rita in her aunt's apartment and decides to help her. You see, Rita lost her memory. She has no idea who she is. She has her name, Rita, from a "Gilda" poster in the bathroom. So the two determined who Rita really was. <br /> <br /> David Lynch is known for making strange movies, but this film is the definition of strange. It's bizarre, nightmarish and absolutely indescribable. It's like a movie captured on film. At the 100-minute point, the movie has become extremely confusing - but if you look now, it will be perfect. After watching the movie and then reading an article on the internet that shows things in the movie, I understand the movie completely. <br /> <br /> The play is very good. Watts are great. Justin Theroux is very good as a Hollywood director experiencing problems with local crowds. The music is excellent. Angelo Badalamenti is one of his best scores. And directing - hah! David Lynch is like a movie maker like ever. <br /> <br /> Is this your kind of movie? Well, it depends. You should probably see more of Lynch's work before watching this movie. You have to be patient with the movie, and it probably looks a second time to pick up the many clues that Lynch has left throughout the film. For Lynch fans this is a dream come true. <br /> <br /> "Mulholland Dr." is a masterpiece. It is brilliantly, mysteriously and masterfully filmed. I love it.
