Eisenstein's first sound film tells the battle of the ice of 1242, when the Russians under Alexander Nevsky defeated the Livonic knights, and wanted to bring Greece under Roman Catholicism. In 1938, Nevsky is seen as a piece of propaganda: the Germanic knights, with their sinister (and somewhat goofy) helmets, are obvious to the Nazis. The butchery by the knights when they enter a Russian city seems a prophetic warning of the massacre of World War II. The movie ends with a warning: those who came to Russia with the sword will die by the sword. Made in delicate black and white (somewhat reminiscent of a day-to-day type), it also marked Eisenstein's return to official favor. By the late 1920s, Stalin wanted Soviet filmmakers to stop experiments and make films that would be more populist and palatable to the Russian public. It stopped Eisenstein's career in Russia for a decade, and in Nevsky he returned with his more accessible film. Nevsky's strong point is in his second half, which contains the battle itself, and it is seen as just a milestone in film history: never (and probably never after) a battle would be so bright on the screen. Another strong point is Prokofiev's beautiful, ghostly soundtrack (using a composer to make a movie was quite unusual at the time). One of its weak points: the comic relief (in the form of two simple Russian warriors trying to woo a beautiful Russian farmer) is really scared.
