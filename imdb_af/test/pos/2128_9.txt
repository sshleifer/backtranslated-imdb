This movie was very cute and very little girl suited. My cousins ​​watched it right away, as they got it, and so I've gone through it almost 4 times. I can't get enough of it. The CGI images are great to watch, the humor is good and the ballet images are excellent. Although the story line has a few holes, no girl will pick them up, and as an adult, the movie is so charming that he almost even takes notice. Just keep in mind that this is a Barbie movie, and although it is sometimes naked, this experience lives to the high standard of the other Barbie princess films. I would recommend it to anyone who has a girl who always wants to be a princess. It also teaches a good lesson. Everyone is special and different in their own way, and everyone can make a difference.
