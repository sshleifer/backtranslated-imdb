A movie that tends to be buried under prejudice and bias. It's a remake! Doris Day is in it! She sings! - Hitchcock's second crack on 'The Man Who Went Too Much' is his most subordinate film, and probably a full-fledged masterpiece in his own right. <br /> <br /> It's more like a Doris Day movie. Not only does she give the best performance of her career, but keeps her own against James Stewart, but the entire film is subtly structured around her character rather than her. After all, it is a film in which music is both motif and plot device. What better casting than the most popular singer of her generation? Consider: The day's Jo McKenna gave up her stage career to settle with her husband and raise their son. It looks like it's a mutual decision, and she doesn't look unhappy. But look at the way Stewart puts her in the cart over her concern about Louis Bernard, which means she's jealous that Bernard didn't ask her any questions about her career. It is clearly a repeated joke between them - she reacts with a "har-de-har-har" indicating the familiarity of this gag, indicating that she has a certain latent resentment over her birth and that they both realize. br /> <br /> After their son was abducted, Stewart insisted on doping before giving her the news. It is a brutal scene played brilliantly by both actors, illustrating the power balance in their marriage. He tries to control and suppress her reactions, essentially using his professional knowledge to suppress her voice just as his medical career suppresses the singing career. <br /> <br /> The strength of the voice is demonstrated in the Ambrose Chapel sequence, when she has to rule in her highly trained brightness and volume to merge with the congregation of female drudges - they almost act as " a warning of what will become of her if she still suppresses her talent. In the Albert Hall it is necessary to call out to exercise those impressive lungs, which save a man's life, and in the embassy final, it's her talent and reputation with which to find their son. In contrast, all male activities of Stewart are counterproductive. His visit to the taxidermis is a dead end, he is left at the church while everyone is moving to the Albert Hall and his efforts to kill the murderer, so deprive the police of potentially useful information. It is only when his action joins his wife's voice, in the salvation of Hank of the embassy, ​​that he actually manages to do something useful. <br /> <br /> Far from being forced into the movie for a day to sing, 'Que Sera Sera' acts as the first musical instrument in the film, which is the nightmare that the McKennas goes bridge, shadow; "The future is not ours to see." It also prepares the way for the finals, in which the closest bandmother and son share music, Doris will be able to save the day. <br /> <br /> The best-known sequence in the film makes music the most important feature - building the assassination attempt in the Albert Hall. This lengthy wordless sequence may be the only extraordinary thing Hitchcock has committed to film, the ultimate expression of his belief that movies should tell stories confidentially. We see that people are conversing in this order, but we never hear a word they say. We don't have to - the images say everything. It's also its most prosperous sequence, with the pieces moving slowly in place as the music builds. The editing is incredibly tight, perfectly adapted to the music. There is no frame in place - anything that is not directly related to the murder gives the viewer a sense of the environment, the geography in which it all speaks. It builds slowly, but by the end the tension is almost unbearable. When Jo screams, it's not just a relief for her, but for the audience. <br /> <br /> The Ambrose Chapel series is spiritual and especially effective for anyone who needs a special service. in-the-mud nonconformist church. The embassy series looks a little flat after the Albert Hall one that preceded it, but the second time it looks more effective, with the final rally at the rifle point much benefit from the beautiful use of Dagsang in the background, reminiscent of the music-as-surrounding noise in 'Rear Window'. The score as a whole is subtle, so the music of the screen can be foreground. <br /> <br /> Bernard Miles is a low key villain, a bit banal, but with a dry white. He is emitted by Brenda de Banzie as his wife, who runs a fine line between sinister and sympathetic. Just look at the way she smokes a cigarette while her husband preaches the assassin. Her attitude is a pure gangster mole, dressing in the middle England's exterior, but she clearly has a soft side and possibly maternal feelings towards Hank. <br /> <br /> Stewart is excellent, but if Hitchcock really always threw him as "Everyman," as the director's daughter seems to think, it confirms that Hitchcock had a cynical view of his audience. Stewart played a hypocritical intellectual who addressed fascist ideology in Rope, a voyeur who had abused his girlfriend in the back window and an obsessive nephrophilia in Vertigo. Day is nothing less than phenomenal. Just look at her response to the news that her son has been kidnapped - she never overdo it, but doesn't sell it short either. It is one of Hitchcock's most emotionally effective films. He never lets us forget what the game is for the McKennas; they feel the most complete of all its central characters.
