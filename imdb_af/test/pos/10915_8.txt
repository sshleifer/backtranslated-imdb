I've seen this movie many times and I never get sick. It's about a man coming out of the closet, he doesn't know he is in. Kevin Kline's character is a teacher and when one of his former students reveals Kline's character, gay people in his village are beginning to speculate whether he is straight or gay. Kline's character begins to wonder if he is straight or gay. The acting is absolutely fantastic and hilarious by all the role-players. I found the movie very funny and heart-warming. I love this movie, it makes you laugh and makes you feel good while you watch it. I recommend this movie to everyone, you will have a good time watching it.
