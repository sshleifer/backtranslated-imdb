This is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. Usually when they are so strange, I get out early and rarely regret it. Luckily, I detained this one. While I can't say it's a good movie (it's not), I can say it looks like a good acid journey - just a few awful moments and the rest is filled with " really just saw that? " amazement. Many laughed aloud moments. A great role player with Meredith Eaton outstanding as the dwarf daughter-in-law with an attitude. Keep open thoughts.
