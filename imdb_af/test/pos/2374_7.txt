The final installment regards Sho Aikawa and Riki Takeuchi (look cooler than ever in his reversible overcoat!) Against each other in the last battle, this time in the future. The plot owes much to Blade Runner, but done in Takashi Miike's low budget, frenetic, comic style. I felt that it was the worst of the three DOA films, and although the end was still shameful, it lacked the shock of the previous two. Compared to that of Ichi the Killer and Visitor Q, DOA: Final is nowhere so extreme, but is true to the other two films in the trilogy. This will give fans of the first two (and supporters of Miike) much of it, as it links all three films and gives a final explanation of the relationship between the two main players.
