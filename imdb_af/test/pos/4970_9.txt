Deep Blood ... One of those movies you're talking about here and you don't say another Italian Jaws ripoff! Well, deep blood is far from that. It's a cheap, like making movies, and on the other hand it is also creative. In Jaws and all the other shark movies we've all seen or herds, they all made use of sharks that were made right. In Joe D'Amato's movie, he used a new approach using all the stock for his shark scenes. This is one of the many reasons I like Deep Blood because it didn't use stock material. <br /> <br /> In Deep Blood, an old Indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark, in Joe D'Amato's Shark Classic Deep Blood. It seems as if a native American elder once warned a group of young people about this great evil in the sea, and years later the friends are forced to shake their fears when one of them sharks in a series of attacks along their coast murdered. Now it is for the remaining couple to make sure that this monster is killed, even if it means going to sea. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato directs and produces this film under his Filmirage company. Published in 1989 and later used in Bruno Mattei's Cruel Jaws: Jaws 5, along with many other shark films. Joe D'Amato's shark entry is a good movie and any Joe D'Amato fan of shark movie watcher should try it.
