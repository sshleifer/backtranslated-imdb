Love Jones gives a clear, positive and realistic view of young African American men and women. I feel that all the actors and actresses were great and really did a good job of capturing the mood. Nia Long and Larenz Tate worked well together and I hope to see more work from the two. In fact, all the actors / actresses did such a good job, it would be great to see another romantic comedy from them. This movie can be compared to most any well-written, romantic comedy. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I strongly advise you to do this, it can certainly give you a different perspective on life and love.
