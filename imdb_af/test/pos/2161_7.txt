Look at the first 20 minutes, although the voltage has not yet turned on. We get a glimpse of the super-secret Los Alamos, just a few years after the big bomb test that helped to end World War II. Except for the strict security, it seems unattractive. Notice how it is a TV repairman, an obvious regular guy who takes us through security. Once through, it's like any town US, nice homes, quiet streets, kids go to school, and a family TV on the eye. Later we see little Tommy and little Peggy along streets lined with impressive search facilities, separated by closed gates. The film seems to say, "Okay, we're hard, just because we have to be. But basically we're just people." <br /> <br /> Now, I expect it was a comfort message to Cold War audiences still not accustomed to government's "doomsday" research. This is a clear effort at popular reassurance. The one darker note is when Tommy's mother (Clarke) is worried about her son's spiritual condition. He does not say when I grow up; Instead, it is, "If I grow up". That doubt not only shows a Los Alamos reality, but also a national one who in 1952 saw only the image of the apocalyptic H-bomb. Also note how professional FBI agents are portrayed as a standard feature of the McCarthy era. When brute force is needed, isn't it, but private citizen Gene Barry is pouring out the information? An early version, presumably, of the modern era "version". <br /> <br /> After the kidnapping took place, the voltage didn't stop. The plot is properly handled with colorful LA locations we guess. The climbs around the cliffs may not be visible, but the views of northern New Mexico are wonderful. The ancient stone apartments are also one of the more exotic backgrounds of the decade. Also note the extensive use of the police helicopter used only as a law enforcement tool. Under an otherwise muted role player, Nancy Gates remains a sparkling presence as teacher Ellen Haskell. Never Hollywood glamorous, she was still a subtle actress and winning personality. I also expect it to be one of directors Hopper's more successful film efforts, and although people have become accustomed to the nuclear threat, the movie remains a revealing and resounding document of his time.
