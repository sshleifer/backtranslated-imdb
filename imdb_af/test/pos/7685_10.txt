I was in my early 20's, just graduated from college when this movie appeared. As it has a huge impact, it was not only because of the high quality of the film (as evidenced by its numerous awards), but because of its place in the historical context of 1959. Due to social progress since then It is almost impossible to understand that my college only allowed in 1953 (carefully selected) black students in 1953. A major stream, high budget ready with an almost all-black role, was a clear novelty in 1959. <br /> <br /> The movie was given a luxury road show (reserved seat) presentation in only the best theaters complete with a souvenir program that has taken the cute lighting and color care with a multi-track stereo sound. Almost every black entertainer who had our white people was aware of the movie. Gershwin's music, performed extremely well and the mere universal humanity of the story was great. <br /> <br /> I recently received a faded copy of a two-hour movie cut, and repeated views have confirmed my opinion. Time has made what looked like tuning sex scenes in 1959, looks pretty soft, but the musical quality hasn't diminished. Sammy Davis and Pearl Bailey are masterful in their portrayals. What a crime the young black artists of today cannot see these artists at the height of their careers!
