A few weeks ago I lost my beloved companion and friend of fourteen years old, a golden retriever named Sasha. When I came out of the animal house alone, I put my teenage daughter on my side after making one of the painful decisions of my life. . . And we talked about this episode of the Twilight Zone. I can be wrong, but I remember a line that Arthur Hunnicutt said when Satan tried to deceive him into hell, but his dog couldn't go with him. . . And his dog, in turn, grew on the gatekeeper who tried to try to enter the old hunter. . that it would be like a hell of heaven if the dogs were not allowed, and the spirit of the old mountain man and his dog decided to turn off the gate (from what they thought was heaven, to the eternally alone.) What a slow moment when they meet a "good ole boy" on that eternal road, just to discover that he is an angel sent out to find them, and a neighbor, Of course, dogs are allowed in heaven. <br /> <br /> I will confess that I have been crying while talking to my daughter about this while stirring the happiness of our beloved golden. Rod Serling was truly a genius, a voice that spoke out against racism, hatred, "know-nothing" in the early sixties, and was a great inspiration for me to become a writer. This episode, forty-five years, has a message of comfort to all of us who have lost a beloved friend. I request you to receive a copy the next time, buy one of the Twilight Zone marathons. There will be tears but comfort. As always, thank you Rod, for everything you have taught us. . Even now.
