Actually a good movie ... I hit it at the videoback and rented it because Aaron Eckhart (In the Company of Men and Your Friends and Neighbors) was also in there, as well as Paulina Porizcova ... The beautiful former SI swimsuit model get naked in the movie, but it's just one of the many reasons to rent it. It's very exciting, and character development is fantastic. Eckhart is one of the most underrated actors working, and he steals this movie ... It's very dark and violent, but I enjoyed it immensely.
