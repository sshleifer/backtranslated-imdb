"Are you alone in the house?" belongs to the pre-cable TV days when the networks were keen to provide an alternative to popular TV shows. It is a well-crafted thriller with a talented cast and credible situation. Kathleen Beller plays a high school student who gets a series of threatening letters. Everyone seems to think it's nothing more than a prank, but Beller is really scared. Tony Bill and Blythe Danner play Beller's parents, Ellen Travolta (John's sister) is the high school principal and Dennis Quaid has one of his earliest roles as a crunchy rich child. It is a capable chiller with an ever-relevant social message. Caller is lovely - if you are 30 or older, you will remember that she was very popular with young people. Blythe Danner, which I usually don't like, gives a real moving display. Nice little movie.
