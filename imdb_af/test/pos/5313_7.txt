After beating a delayed boy, the fifteen-year-old upset and pessimistic Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) was sent to a juvenile detention center. His teacher and aspiring writer Pearl Madison (Don Cheadle) comes close and tries to understand him, first with the intention of writing a book and later becoming his friend. Leland slowly reveals his sad vision of the world and shows that he is a sociopath. <br /> <br /> The United States of Leland is a depressing and interesting study of character. The low tempo sounding script shows pieces of the story like a puzzle; there are excellent lines and dialogues; The performances are wonderful, though twenty-three years old, Ryan Gosling, is not convinced as a fifteen-year-old teenager; but it seems like a part is missing to complete the puzzle and make "The United States of Leland" a memorable movie. The disappointing explanation of the "why" for Leland's violent actions against Ryan Pollard is not convincing or touching. Indeed, it shows that this character is a completely hidden sociopath with a strange and sick world vision. Further, the way Allen Harris gets Pearl's knife is ridiculous. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Mundo de Leland" ("The World of Leland")
