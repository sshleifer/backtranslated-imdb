I think it's a great, classic monster movie for the family. The mole, what a machine! The long beings with the bill, the flying green lizards, Ranthorincus / mayas or whatever they are and the monkey man things that telepathically talk to them. The battle of the men in rubber suits is fighting for a doll for breakfast umm! nice! Class, what else can I say? How will they make a 2002 reminder of this one?
