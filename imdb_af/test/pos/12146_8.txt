"Classes tous risques" is one of the best gangsters movies ever made by France. Perfect cast: Lino Ventura, a young Jean-Paul Belmondo (who made a bolt the souffle, Godard's thing the same year). Marcel Dalio and a fine supporting film, brilliant screenplay by José Giovanni - who also wrote the best Becker's masterpiece the same year! What a year for him! Wonderful black and white movie art by Ghislain Cloquet. And naughty action, first-class director Claude Sautet, who exceeded Jean-Pierre Melville. Where the latter movie people with metaphysical predictions, sometimes longer than two hours, Claude Sautet directs flesh and blood, and the presence of the two children adds moments of extraordinary graciousness that Melville has never been able to generate. And Sautet avoids pathos, excessive sentimentality: the last time Ventura sees his children coming into the subway (a subway) is a peak of limited emotion. <br /> <br /> Ventura views a gangster whos He believes he can rely on his former acquaintances, but they are all cowards. We are far from male friendship, love Jacques Becker ("touchez pas au grisbi") who would continue Melville continuously. the sixties, sometimes by means of average women (the film noir misogyny par excellence), living in a rotten microcosm, ready to inform about - we are far from Jean Seberg's simplistic actions in Godard's "opus" -. <br /> <br /> Cloquet works wonders with the picture: the scene on the beach in a starless night when the two children see their mother die after the shooting with the customs officers is absolutely staggering. <br /> <br /> There is a good use of voice-over, which only uses Sautet when needed, so the last lines make the end even stronger than when we attended the scenes. <br /> <br /> Claude Sautet got a good niche, and he "The class tous risques" follows very well with his sequel "l'arme à gauche" (1965) which turns Ven Tura into a desert island and a ship used. He continued in that year, France would have had a Howard Hawks. In his subsequent works, only "Max et les ferrailleurs" (1971) showed something of brilliance. He exhibited in the first half of the sixties. From "les choses de la vie" he became the director of the cinema qualité. He worked in a soft bourgeois such works as "Cesar et Rosalie" (1972), "Vincent François, Paul et les Autres" (1974) or "Mado" (1976)
