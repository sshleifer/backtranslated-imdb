Nurse Betty is the kind of movie you can't describe on a poster or in a trailer or commercial. It's the kind of movie you come in to expect a more mature "Dumb and Dumber". What goes on with temporary madman on a cross-country adventure, while crooks are avoided to kill her. <br /> <br /> The fact is, this movie is a wonderful, heart-warming story about two people pursuing their dreams. The best part about "Nurse Betty" is it is unpredictable. Director Neil LaBute uses cruel violence to separate dreams from reality, and with the touch of drama and hilarious comedy, you can never tell what will happen next.
