The Muppet Movie <br /> <br /> directed by <br /> <br /> James Frawley <br /> <br /> Kermit the Frog and Friends revives the stories and stories of how they all came together. <Br /> <br /> The Muppets star in their first feature film, bringing the magic they are familiar with to a bigger picture. The story is not too complex and was written as a prequel of all sorts. The well-written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction. The cameos are not just thrown, but written as interesting characters, making one of the many peaks for our hairy friends.
