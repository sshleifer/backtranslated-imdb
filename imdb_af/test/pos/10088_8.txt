What can I say about this movie that won't give you preconceived ideas when you see it? Very little. The plot is about returning from the hospital to a teenage girl after she broke. What follows is the movie. This is one of the creepiest most printed films of the past few years. Everything about the movie is just slightly out of the center and makes you feel sick, very well after the movie is over. It's not a perfect movie. The movie has problems in the last half hour which makes an already confusing story even more confused. (If you've read any other comments here on IMDb and elsewhere, you'll know that a lot of time was spent unlocking what's actually going on) I'm not sure what I actually think about this movie, except that it scared me and disturbed me in ways that most famous horror movies ever have. If you like horror and do not mind that you have not summarized everything clearly, I suggest you try it because it will probably crawl your skin.
