GUTS OR A BEAUTY is a little better than its predecessor GUTS OR A VIRGIN. Although this film is not really a sequel, in that it has absolutely nothing to do with the first installment, I found that BEAUTY is a bit stronger and better composed than VIRGIN ... but again, it doesn't really say much. <br /> <br /> BEAUTY begins as a pretty rough and straight face extraction. A few Yakuza cats hold a young woman prisoner and start raping her in a very cruel way. As this nastiness is in progress, the chief tells the girl that she did the same to her sister and sold her into slavery in Africa and that they would do the same to her. They then shoot her up with drugs and rape her a few more. She somehow gets away and ends at a clinic where the nurse listens to her story. The rapee endures the tension of her previous experience and commits suicide. The clinic worker, moved by the young woman's story, decides to take revenge on the gang by deceiving one of the lower levels and trying to hypnotize him to kill the Yakuza leaders. This whole plan is back, so now Mrs. Vigilante-Clinic Worker exposed to the same treatment as our original rape - just worse (a little rough rape rape along with the prerequisite gang rape ...). She is also intoxicated, but the drug has a strange side effect on our seemingly fearless victim ----- it turns her into an angry hermaphroditic BLOOD DEMON !!! (no! this is what really happens!) This is when BEAUTY really starts with some beautiful, flaky deadly scenes - including a very classic breast rape that looks like a cross between the FEMALE and a bad porn and favorite - killing a head-devoured-by-demon vagina (complete with demon vagina-smart ...) to be believed ... <br /> <br /> Definitely a few promising things Go in GUTS OR A BEAUTY, but still feel very unfounded. BEAUTY feels almost like two different movies are forced together in a non-compatible way. Still, I have to give the film credit - the rape zone is very rough and misogynistic, and the screens are just out of the wall. A solid 7/10 for another crazy J-horror "classic".
