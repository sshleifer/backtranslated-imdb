Destroyers. This review has been edited for word limit. <br /> <br /> The horror. The horror. "Marlon Brando, Apocalypse Now (1979) and Apocalypse Now Redux (2001) <br /> <br /> The sentence so known as" Here you look at a child, or "do you talk to me?" or "May the Force be with you" or "I'll be back", a little more than some one-liners, when it is spoken, it hangs in the air with an interest and meaning that doesn't stay unnoticed. driving some users' nuts is that they can never get an answer to the horror unless they watch the movie again and try to look carefully at each frame. <br /> <br /> What exactly does this line do? Dialogue means the horror being spoken is the reality of the war, and the reality of moral men is so easily damaged that they turn on their innate instincts and kill fellow human beings without any sign of guilt. The end of the movie before dying Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is the horror, the horror is the realization of Willard's corruption, and he has neglected to kill a man in cold blood as part of his mission. not a typical Hollywood ending, and in most cases a character gets something, or it emotion eel, physical, spiritual or all three. But Willard both wins and loses. He gets the knowledge that he has lost his morals. And this is a shocking end. <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is Francis Ford Coppola's tribute to the artistic side of movies. This movie is completely different from `The Godfather. "It is hallucinogenic, visually stunning, and an ode to the guilty side of human nature. Initially, it looks realistic, and then it becomes strange, and then symbolic, and ultimately, originally in its own unique perspective of the spiritual side of warfare. It's not so much a movie about the Vietnam War because it's a film about the war in us. <br /> <br /> Initially, it looks like it's another war movie. Captain Willard (Sheen) is appointed by an army of Harrison's army (a young Harrison Ford) to kill an apostate American colonel, Kurtz (Brando), who hides somewhere in Vietnam with a lot of troops or more than his slaves act. <br /> <br /> Willard's mission "with extreme prejudice" along with four soldiers, including the captain, chief (Albert Hall), Chef (Frederic Forest) and a very young "Larry" Fishburne (who later appeared as Morpheus in The Matrix). <br /> <br /> "Apocalypse Now" is a modern update of Homer's Odyssey in many ways. As our main character, Willard, travels, he meets a variety of original and strange characters, including Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), who has a strange fetish for surfing, and a stoned photographer (Dennis Hopper) whose lively gestures and ways can be compared to those of the lesser Jeremy Davies in "The Million Dollar Hotel," one some of the worst movies I've ever seen. Davies fails to make any connection with an audience; Hopper doing it. He is like the poetic atmosphere between Willard and Kurtz; He is like an interpreter who goes back and forth and speaks in foreign languages. In this case, he translates Kurtz to Willard, although I'm not so sure that Kurtz needs a Willard translation. <br /> <br /> Many movies are fortunate to have one or two memorable scenes or lines. "Apocalypse Now" has many. Kilgore, who falls into a Vietnam town, who plays Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyrie", remains one of the most memorable scenes in all film history. There is sharpness, a brutality on it, an ironic tone, and a sense of playfulness. When Kilgore kneels on the beach and says, "I have the morning smell of napalm. It smells like a victory." We all tore a smile. <br /> <br /> I won't lie to you: Apocalypse Now 'is a strange movie. It's not exactly the easiest thing to analyze. The end may frustrate some viewers if they do not understand Marlon Brando's significant speeches. But what comes out, which really matters, is that this film deals with the dark nature of human psyche. The horror is the realization of war and its consequences, not the war itself. Kurtz says: You have the right to kill me. But you have no right to judge me. "Brando's character, Kurtz, is handed over to the audience for judgment. For many naive viewers, he may look like a crazy wage whose power came to his head. But that's not what Francis Ford is trying to overcome Coppola. By fighting in Vietnam, Kurtz realized how big he had, and how badly some had it. By walking through ruined villages, he finally realizes that we are the na√Øve who live our lives in a foolish paradise. We are completely naive in our environment and possible irregularities until they hit. By seeing how unhappy some Vietnamese are, Kurtz realizes how easily he can be hit by something. How easy he can end up like the people around him. And he also realizes that the people who did this are people who have abandoned their morals and left the door. Many people think the horror is one thing. It's two. For Kurtz, the horror is the reality of how naive he was and the reality of war's impact on men. And after Willard kills Kurtz and hears Kurtz's dying words, he also realizes it. He realizes the consequences of the war. Seeing so many soldiers without feeling right or wrong makes him terrified by the war that one can do. And what did he do to him? The horror. <br /> <br /> 5/5 stars - <br /> <br />
