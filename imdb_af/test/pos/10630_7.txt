First, those who are heartfelt must definitely avoid this movie. Even those who, like me, most graphically denying violent and sexual acts in films, should be careful. I'm not telling you to leave the movie, but be aware that what you're about to see is a bit of disturbing material. Certainly not a pleasant movie to watch, but nothing is set on the screen strictly for shock value. But I had to admit when I watched the movie a second time, I had to skip to the next chapter when the "razor scene" emerged. <br /> <br /> The main character is one of the most sympathetic characters I can think of, but we later realize the humanity of her character later in the film's second act. In one scene, his broken glass splashes into one of her student's jacket pocket after being unhappy with her seemingly unsatisfactory performance and getting nervous before a lively audience. The student goes into her pocket and cries with pain as she stares at her blood-colored hand. Along the razor scene, it saved me the most. The student's mother is not much more sympathetic than she is. When she gets a word that her daughter can't play, she talks about injuring her hand, being one of the spoiled mothers trying to torture her daughter to become an over-achiever. <br /> <br /> Although the film irritated me and involved my interest for the most part, I needed more to explain Isabelle Huppert's character. When a woman is fascinated by sadomasochistic porn movies and herself involved in behavior, you want to understand the root of the problem. The movie finds out she really wants love. Then why is the hateful attitude towards everyone? Why does she get sexual pleasure from pain? <br /> <br /> The acting is great and I like the brilliance, stylized lighting. Altogether, this is not a movie I would recommend if you are in the mood to be entertained, but as I said, it is very interesting. And I'm sure if I watched it a few times, I could investigate some subtleties that shed more light on aspects of the movie I didn't initially realize. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10)
