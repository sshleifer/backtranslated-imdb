Sui generis. People, I'm not going to lie to you; Merhige is a one or two hit wonder, but what a movie (it excuses almost SUSPECT NOW). I'm also not going to pretend to understand it completely; half of what it does is try to guess what the hell is doing on the screen because of the chiaroscuro. <br /> <br /> Richard Corliss says, "It is as if a druid cult is again" for three Bible stories - creation, birth and Jesus' torture and death at Calvary. "This is not a bad description. not, but there seems to be more to the seemingly one-to-one religious agreements. <br /> <br /> There is an environmental theme right near the surface - note that at the end of the jungle of the landscape there are huge pipes, unlike those on a construction site. Oh no, he's going to tell how people rape the mother nature. One rarely sees a dead metaphor in action, and with so much hyperbola, but to figure it out, it is much harder than the language implies. <br /> <br /> And yes, if you just want something to sync with a death metal soundtrack, it does have the horrors needed. But for myself and others like me, it's an important art movie that has to earn a Criterion collection release. Arrange right there with Murnau's FAUST. <br /> <br /> ~ Ray
