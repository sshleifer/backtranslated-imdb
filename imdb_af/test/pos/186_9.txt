It's a beautiful, and in many respects, impressive movie. I saw it as a boy on TV, with my throat almost tumbling with tears, and again today on the wonderfully restored Criterion DVD. Cranes are at the heart of the War Weepie. Imagine Cherbourg Umbrellas without music and no color or Waterloo Bridge without class awareness. Tatiana Samoilova, a cross between Vivien Leigh and Bjork, becomes deep as a beautiful girl whose fiance does not write or return. <br /> <br /> The fiancee, Boris, dies in front, and his dying scene is indescribably romantic. Very risky, because so close to "over." But that scene will stay with you. <br /> <br /> Although the Soviet Union was defined by World War II, the film is rather unspecified, and more powerful for it. The pre-war and post-war scenes have a very 1957 feel. There is no attempted period detail. The whole film is becoming more and more stylized to the Siberian scenes, which feel like a modern opera series (this is a compliment). The cathartic final scene is milked to its last drop - again, comparable to Cherbourg. The production feels like a big budget (those stairs need a nice cup of food). <br /> <br /> Go for it. Don't expect a bitter socialist pill (though, of course, it's very sad). The Cranes is Flying is an impressive piece of world kiosk, very advanced considering where and when it was made.
