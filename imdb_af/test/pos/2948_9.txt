This film is remarkable in how imperceptible it is. It is the true story of one woman and one man and their search for happiness amidst the dull, rotten life of a housewife and 'husband of the house'. It can be any couple, any family, in any town ... but it makes the story so move. It touches each one of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love, or of ourselves. I laughed, I cried, I couldn't stop thinking ... and what more could you really ask for a movie? Especially a documentary. It's an excellent movie and one that I highly recommend to anyone who enjoys documentary programs, stories about families like yours, stories about love, life, parenting, loss, expectations, soul searching, longing, wandering through life and finding your way , or not.
