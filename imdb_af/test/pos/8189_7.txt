Chen Kaige lost his sense of pace. I envy Europeans and Americans who can watch the movie without following the dialogue with their ears, because it is painful to do: slow, unnaturally heavy and exaggerated. But Westerners, on the other hand, suffer from the poor quality of the subtitle translation, which manages to lose all the subtlety and dual meanings that make a thorough study of the film so much fun.
