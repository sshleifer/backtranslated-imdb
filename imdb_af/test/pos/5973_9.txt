I agree with another reviewer, it is such a broken movie, it will be difficult to watch again soon, but for quality alone, it deserves repeated looks. The complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and the beautiful direction make this movie worth the emotional price watch. <br /> <br /> There is one scene of the two parties dragging themselves through the snow to escape a patrol. Perhaps, for pure physics, the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. In fact, although not episodic, the story flows - it's a movie of memorable scenes. There is the passing of rations among party parties, the snow, the ruined farm, the encounters in the homes, the interrogation, the "basement" scene, the "climb". Everyone looks like jewelery in a chain. <br /> <br /> For me, religion is not open. Frankly, I don't think it would have been allowed in a Soviet movie. I see it as an existential parable of the value of life. Here is a story where the hero - and he is a true hero - becomes the villain, and the weaker becomes stronger. Is it a mystical process or one dictated by circumstances? There is a transfiguration, but does it come from inside or outside? You have to see the movie to understand the problems, because they cannot be discussed without giving away too much of the story. I can't say enough about the acting. It's hard for me to choose which of the leaders has more influence. I am not familiar with the Soviet film of the 70's and am not familiar with any of the actors, but they are all wonderful. I also notice how director Larisa Shepitko uses children. They remind me of Giotto's childhood gels. <br /> <br /> There is some confusion in the end. There seems to be a previous relationship between the soldier Sotnikov and the interrogator Portnov, but it remains unchanged. And the final scene is a bit ambiguous. But compared to the overall experience, it's an issue. It's a movie that will mark you for life.
