In Victorian times, a father's family is divorced when he is falsely accused of living in the country. The children adapt to their new situation, make friends and make the help of an old man waving on the train to help reunite their family. <br /> <br /> Actors who make movies are often not very good at It. Jeffries, however, the great veteran actor of decades of British comedy clubs, is one of the few exceptions. His brilliant conception (he also wrote the screenplay, from the novel by E. Nesbit) of a classic British children's story, is that this film enhances art. Although the story can be highly idealized, combining the amazing performances and the stunningly impressive Yorkshire Dales settings make a memorable movie. Photography by Arthur Ibbetson is the definition of good movies - not a shot is wasted to tell the story, but at the same time the images combine to create a wonderful romantic atmosphere. Behind is just perfect like the friendly Bobbie (okay, I fell in love with her earlier, but I testify to anyone not to agree) and Cribbins, whose comic play is the same as Jeffries, is unforgettable as Perks humble but proudly coach. It's a movie from the time; romantic, charming, extremely enjoyable and with a beautiful naive sense of kindness towards all.
