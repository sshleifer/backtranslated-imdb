I don't really know what it's about Dirty Dancing. There is some kind of absolute magic in this movie. I can't possibly tell the hundreds (yes, hundreds) of the times I've watched it. Begin to finish. . But every time I get it on TV, I am enchanted and mystified and sit down and I love the movie for two hours as if watching it for the first time. Although Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray absolutely hated each other while making this movie, they have a beautiful chemistry on the set. This makes the viewer enjoy it much more to see this passion and dedication. And I can't help getting a little to the end, when Patrick comes to the Houseman family and tells her dad, "Nobody puts Baby in a corner". (classic moment) For all the people who believe this movie, it is lean and juicy, maybe it is, but it was the penic of the 80s and put Patrick Swayze right on the map. his performance was impeccable. <br /> <br /> Three Cheers for Dirty Dancing !! <br /> <br /> Ps The soundtrack is fantastic, an absolute masterpiece
