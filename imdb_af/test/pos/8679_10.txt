I must say it's the best movie I've ever seen. I know that on this site only negative reviews were received, but for once I would like to be the good person who gives the best movie of the world, a good review. I find the movie very funny, and it has the perfect mix of everything. It makes me feel all kinds of emotions when I see them, and I can't get enough of them. the soundtracks brilliant. I love it, I understand why people can't love it as much as I do, but I don't understand how people can hate it. The movie is 100% brilliant. Blurred is wonderful. I never realized that Aussie movies could be so good, and I never realized that I could see one movie, so many times in a single day without getting sick. I think everyone should look at it, whether it's a sense of how life was in the younger days, or to see what you're coming into when you reach the end of year 12.
