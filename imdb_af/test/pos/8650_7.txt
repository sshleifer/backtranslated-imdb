The whole movie reminded me of the first circle of Dante's Inferno, where the souls who deceive themselves to believe that they are happy go to. They never realize they are actually inferno, but nothing is nice, they just move without emotion. In that sense, Dante thought they were the worst, as they never really tried to change their situation. Nobody can die in that place, but definitely try to hurt. I don't know if the writer based his story on this medieval manuscript, but the agreement is absolutely striking. <br /> <br /> I didn't enjoy the movie when I watched it, like I never got a climax. Nevertheless, it made me think afterwards and now I actually think it's a good movie - it definitely holds on.
