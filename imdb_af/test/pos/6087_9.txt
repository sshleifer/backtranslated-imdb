"The English Patient" is rightly comparable to the films of David Lean, whose sweepstakes such as "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Bridge on the River Kwai" should inspire director Anthony Minghella. The film is beautifully photographed, and like 'Lawrence' it is in North Africa, but during the Second World War. The story is complex but it boils down to a forbidden love between an experienced and often difficult archaeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomas. <br /> <br /> The story, based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje, is told in flashbacks by Fiennes Count Laszlo de Almasy - the titular character. The fact that his name does not sound like he is English plays a key role in what unfolds. He is badly burned in a plane crash, just like the movie opens, and is cared for by Hana in Europe, an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche. What makes this story epic is the great whip about place and time, and the development of characters other than those of the two bad loves. The film makes it clear that true love and passion, even with dreaded consequences, can make life worthwhile, or worth it to die. If you are a romantic heart and can appreciate a movie without the standard happy ending and simple moral codes, you can find that 'The English Patient' is directly talking to you. <br /> <br />
