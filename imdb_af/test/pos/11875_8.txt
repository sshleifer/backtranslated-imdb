One night at McCOOL'S / (2001) *** (out of four) <br /> <br /> By Blake French: <br /> <br /> According to Harald Zwart, One Night at McCool's director, "This movie is a dark comedy about the power of women about men and how a group of people can all see different realities - this is the same story that comes from three different points of view, and every time we tell the story, we try to a little more to tell about what actually happened, no one really knows. '<br /> <br /> "One Night at McCool's" refers to the movie director debut of Zwart, an award-winning commercial and music video director who started making short films when he was eight years old, I always get nervous when a director of advertising and music videos turns to movie filming, and we have seen so many examples of how these guys think they make another ad or music video for their TV Blacks resist that tendency, catching a specific humor Truth in 'One Night at McCool's', from an inventive, complex script of the then Stan Seidel, even though it's often somewhat confusing. <br /> <br /> "One Night at McCool's" has three men who share their separate experiences about a particularly beautiful young woman. In some ways, this movie is the comedy version of "American Beauty," but in others it is a world apart. <br /> <br /> "All this started at McCool's one night," each of the three men explains to their respective listeners. There is Randy (Matt Dillon), a tender at the local bar, and his cousin, a lawyer named Carl (Paul Reiser), who stays until the place closes. Detective Dehling (John Goodman) comes when the salon becomes the crime scene of the dead boyfriend of a female mortal named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Randy is the first to see her, if an individual treats her ignorantly. He stands up for her, and before you can say SEXY, they have strong sex and she moves with him. Initially, Randy is reluctant: "The sex and the violence, all in one night? It's a bit." But who can turn a jewel like Jewel. <br /> <br /> Jewel changes the lives of each of the three men. For Detective Dehling, she pulled him out of a hole of grief since his wife died. For Carl, she forgets him his lovely family and a beautiful little suburban household. For Randy, she lights some fires, both positive and negative, to later persuade him to contact a bingo hit named Burmeister (Michael Douglas) to put an end to her deceptive ways. <br /> <br /> It's interesting how the movie sees the three different chronicles - even the Jewel costume is relative to the man who tells the story. Dehling sees Jewel as a beautiful, enchanting gift from God. Carl sees jewel as two sexy legs and lots of fuss. Randy is not sure what to make of her, an awakening of his otherwise boring path to nowhere life. The most interesting element of this movie is Jewel himself, but played well by the always lovely Liv Tyler ("Armageddon"). She is not really interested in the men, but what they can offer her. Her motives are too simple, not truly diabolical or angry; She is just a young lady who learned at an early age that she can get what she wants from her life through her beauty. <br /> <br /> The movie has lots of fun with its material. From the enthusiastic entertaining movie, to his violent hilarious revelation, "One Night at McCool's" uses most of his humorous ideas. What makes the film even harder is how the three men's views differ. The actors also have fun with their characters. Goodman is curiously whimsical; Traveler adjusts his kinky, squirmy part very well; Douglas is clever and secretive in one of the movie's funniest appearances; Dillon gives his character arrogant personality, although Randy lacks no one; Liv Tyler is beautiful. She injects jewel with the perfect amount of fancy charisma and seductive white. She reminds us of Mena Suvari's intimate performance in "American Beauty." <br /> <br /> "One Night at McCool's" is the first film to come from Michael Douglas's new production company, Furthur Films. It is a creative, true and sexy production. Along the way, we are often trapped in the winding structure, but it is a natural response to a movie that intentionally interweaves several corners of a single story. The movie ends on a note that is both black and comedies. This is another of the comedies in which serious events occur in a humorous way; ie the black comedy. Many movies of this genre occur either too black or too short. "One night at McCool's" is one of the few that really works. <br /> <br />
