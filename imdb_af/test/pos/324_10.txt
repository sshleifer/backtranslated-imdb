Manie sir as usual brings out another wonderful story with Kannathil Muthamittal. Such a wonderful relationship between parents and children is brought out in a beautiful way. Mani Sir as usual without many special effects and not many outdoor shoots. (In fact, it was the only movie where he was completely out of India. It was only for Sri Lanka.) Mani's class was written all over the movie ... and adding it ARR's music .. what's just amazing ... Vellai Pookal is one of my most fav songs ever ... Maddy, who he is in the film industry, also impressed. Starting from alaipayuthey, to kanathil ayutha ezuthu to guru .. Mani Ratnam showed to the world what a versatile actor Maddy is. Simran was also really good. She showed that she can also act in non-glamorous and character roles. In all a wonderful movie. Sad that the Tamil public could not appreciate this gr8 movie and bombed it at the checkout.
