So, do you want to be a rock star? See this movie. You don't like rock, you say? Or are you really into heavy metal? Then put your favorite album and dream yourself away, this movie has nothing to offer. Rarely have I ever seen a movie portraying the dream of a rock group as well as it can. I had long hair in the late 1980s and early nineties, and I played guitar for the past 15 years. Did I keep Rock Star? Oh yes. The music is good, not good, the actors are good, and credible, even Jennifer Aniston plays her role to perfection. And Mark Wahlberg is perfect as the wannabe rock singer. So you know what you're going to get. A movie about dreams is observed, acted, and finally figured out what life really is about. It's a good solid seven out of ten, no longer, no less.
