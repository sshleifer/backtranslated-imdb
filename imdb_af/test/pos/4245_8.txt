remember when this movie was made by Robert Downey Senior. a very good entertaining black awareness feature, which was then an underground hit in California-Los Angeles, and New York. A hippie beloved classic where changes that occur in the business world are striking, refreshing and interesting comedy. It does not meet, as the basic society at the time of 1969 being watched is still very good, but today's life in America is quite different from 69 good for baby boomers.
