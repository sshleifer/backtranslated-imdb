I hate movies about sports. I think the made-up Hollywood sports film is a bit difficult for me to swallow because it follows the most identical ideas each year. What I'm trying to say is that there's not much creativity in this genre. Use exhibition "A" ?? "The game plan" as proof of this if you want. So, needless to say, I was reluctant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time I couldn't wait, because I like to documentary documents like "Step in Liquid" and "Billabong Odyssey". reading. I took a step, I immersed in the unknown, and to be honest, I wasn't initially happy. I didn't like the direction, the people or the style the movie included to offer these young sportsmen. With my first performance I thought history could not be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was cutting stock with faux actors acting like they were from the late 70's. The music was intense, it spoke well. Peralta made a mixed band of this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals are nothing but stimulating. The extended screens, while using great music to support, were just flushed for me and too long. I wanted to get to know the pioneers and not just watch them skate in an empty pool for ten minutes. I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their fame, and where they are now. It felt like I was watching the birth of our country with a big score to the settlers who row their boats all day. I wanted to know the men behind the myths. <br /> <br /> Then, with the thought of having another negative review under my tape, I watched the movie again with Peralta's sound note. His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film made me "wow-ed". It suddenly changed into the movie I wanted to see. Peralta lets us know where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them on the camera. He didn't see much of them in 20+ years. To hear these challenges, the human element brought back to the surface. He was sincere; He was sympathetic, but he showed so much commitment to this project. While I disagree with everything he chose to do (that is, the Sean Penn button is not PUNK ROCK), he revived this movie for me. It was because of this comment that I thought this movie much higher than originally thought. <br /> <br /> Jay Adams. Tony Alva. Jeff Ho. Peggy Oki. Wentzle Ruml. These are just a few of the names that need to be mentioned, and are constantly praised, as skateboarding continues the fast-growing trend it currently sees. While Tony Hawk's name sells products, it's these guys, these moderate pavements that redefined a whole sport. Sure, others probably did it in the cliff times, but these guys did it with style, grace and moved to the next level. It was a hobby for them, but it also drove them in a direction, and I believe none of them was ready. "Dogtown and Z-Boys" is the evolution story, in the right place at the right time, in a generation without televisions to plant us, and about friendship. Over the years we have seen so many stories showing the progress of mankind, and that is certainly a story to add to it. I can't say I loved this movie, and I won't, but it should look standard for anyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend. It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys are no longer millionaires? they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see it in documentaries. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't watch this movie again, but I will suggest it to friends and family for time. I think the downfall for this movie, for me, was the filming ?? the efforts to be avant-garde with the style, which eventually deviated from the characters and events. As mentioned earlier, there were some elements that dragged too much, leaving us with little or no time to know where these guys were now. Peralta, of course, had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he sometimes looked temporary. The music was intense and worked perfectly with the movie. Sean Penn, while being decent with his voice over, was not needed at all. They could have spent the money elsewhere. On the positive, the sound comment captures everything that the ordinary movie lacks. Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene while telling us better stories of people, places and events. Watch this movie, but don't expect to be blown away. Listen to the audio commentary; I think you'll be impressed. <br /> <br /> Degree: *** Â½ from *****
