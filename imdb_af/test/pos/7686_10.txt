This movie is one of the only historical documents that showcases the talents of so many black singers, actors, actresses and dancers. Many that are no longer with us. Those who have blessed us to enjoy today in 1999, through this film, can recognize the talents that existed at that time. That is why those who are still alive today also have those who have died, superstars. Due to the educational history of music, drama, filming, design, singing, etc., this film belongs only to the people of this country. <br /> <br /> I recently watched this movie. The sound was excellent! The movie seems to be complete, color and brightness was costly, but good to look at how old this movie is without any repairs to frames. I agree with all previous positive reviews. I have no negative views. <br /> <br /> I just want to make one request. Please, to whom this is my concern, please make this movie available so that everyone can have this historical experience.
