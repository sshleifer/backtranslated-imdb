David Lynch shot his first film, "Erasurehead," over several years, and collected a little more cash each time. Kevin Smith made 'Clerks' at work while working as a clerk, and Robert Rodriguez praised that 'From Dusk Till Dawn' cost exactly $ 30,000. But $ 30,000 is still a lot of money to raise if you work as a cleaner in a cemetery. And as an aspiring filmmaker, not only had such a job, but also had the ambitions of such bodies, and all the folly of Smith, but absolutely nothing of the talent. Such a figure is Mark Borchardt, the subject of this hilarious documentary version that chronicles his attempt to make some movies over many years. Borchardt combines his crazy dreams with flights of depression and a fatal inability to call it a day; one of the senses that he prefers the endless labor to find an impossible perfection for an accommodation with the reality he simply (according to evidence in 'American Movie') is not very good. And like a contemporary Ed Wood, he surrounds himself with an epic crowd of co-losers, his true love for whom his greatest salvation function is. The collection includes his fighting parents, his best friends (one a criminal, the other a reformed drug addict), his own unhappy children and the best of all his older uncle Bill. Bill can live in a trailer park and just surrender to life, but he owns a small fortune ($ 280,000 to be exact) and the touch but potentially exploitative relationship between the two men lies at the heart of the movie. . Borchardt manages to present a few actors to be natural (next to himself), but in the main he is totally dependent on friends and family to complete his work (even Bill has a role on camera). On British TV, the BBC returned a screen of 'American Movie' with 'Lost in La Mancha', the story of Terry Gilliam's bad forged attempt to film Don Quixote. In that movie, the impressive amount of professionalism on the screen (insufficient as in the hand in hand), and just how difficult it is for millions of experts to spend to make a movie, is even difficult; while Borschadt is not only indecent, but also such a clown that he cannot even pronounce his own work ('Coven'). Eventually Borschadt is human enough for you to want him to succeed, but terribly enough for the viewer to still be able to laugh at his failures. If this movie were fiction, you would have dismissed it as incredible; But as it is, it's one of the funniest documentaries you'll probably see.
