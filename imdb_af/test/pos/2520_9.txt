A straight forward X file that shows that action is always equal to intelligence. Rob Bowman's direction is sharp and sharp. The episode looks just as fresh as it did almost a decade ago. David and Gillian both give good performances and both seem to satisfy the lack of luggage - this is a standalone X file that even non-fans can do and enjoy. Junior Brown gives both clues a run for their money during his scene with them. He is so convincing that you can believe the crew drove to the middle of nowhere and knocked on the first door they came to. Bryan Cranston is intense and energetic like Patrick Crump. He has since acknowledged in interviews that he knew nothing of the X Files in the past, a fact that made his hit performance increasingly incredible. A brilliant stupid idiot.
