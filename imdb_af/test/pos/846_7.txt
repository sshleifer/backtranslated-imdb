Believe me I wanted to work this series, but Kevin Kilner's early departure hit an almost manslaughter after the season. Robert Leeshock was just not right for the part and Jane Heitmeyer used an admirable job as a lead, but the series just got too messy and confused. I don't know what happened at Season Five, what a mess. Sometimes it's time to drop the red hood and just keep the sword in the bull, if you know what I mean. The only consistent thread the series held was the wonderful performances of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in silent ideological conflict. If it wasn't for their talents and well-written dialogue, they would have been two strange bastard chicks in a B movie series. <br /> <br /> If this series ended only on season 4 and could later be picked up by SyFy ...
