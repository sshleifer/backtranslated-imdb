I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Unlike the mother's full moron a few times and the youngest daughter is idiot enough to go out at night, in the forest that scares her in the day, this movie was pretty good. If the director had the sense to treat us as if we had our brain, he might have given us a movie where people should not be behaving idiotically, but could still be in danger. It worked for the plumber and fellow in the trailer, but the teenagers and the mother had to be idiots, because the director had a close to ending this movie. <br /> <br /> Atmosphere was wonderful, the scenery was wonderful and the undead scared off the shit ... I live in a wooded area so I take the garbage out of me for a while to get. The movie accepts me for what I have already mentioned. Make the mom's IQ a little and I'll give it a ten.
