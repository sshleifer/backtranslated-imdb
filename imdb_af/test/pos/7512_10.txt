It is one of the greatest films ever made. Brilliant acting by George C. Scott and Diane Riggs. This movie is both disturbing and very deep. Don't be fooled into believing it's just a comedy. This is a brilliant satire about the medical profession. It's not a pretty picture. Healthy patients are murdered by unauthorized surgeons, who spend all their time spending money outside the hospital. And yet you really believe it's a hospital. The producers were very careful to include real medical terminology and actual medical issues. This film really shows how difficult it is to manage a hospital, and how bad it was in 1971. I loved this movie. P.S. - I noticed that the incompetent, wheel dealer surgeon played the head of the firm in LA Law. The young doctor played in Lou Grant. I also noticed that the registration nurse has since appeared in Becker and other shows.
