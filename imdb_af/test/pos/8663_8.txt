A bus leaves an unnamed man outside a downward Standard Oil filling station in the middle of nowhere. We never learn where the bus came from, or why it is or who it is. Why is he the only passenger? Is he a prisoner? Is he the "difficult man" referred to in the title of the movie? Did he die and go to heaven or hell? Like our husband, we don't get the chance to stop and wonder. He is met by a gatekeeper of all kinds and transported to an undisclosed city. From day one all the choices are made for him. An apartment was rented, a job was found, an office assigned. In fact, his life is not quite different from life in the virtual reality of corporate blocks and suburban condos. Women are heartless, dinner parties are a mourn, office work sucks. But some pieces don't fit the puzzle. Stylishly efficient, gray gates throw the streets around. Are they some kind of paramedics, or the secret police? And why are there no children? Is the story even set in the real world? When we think we might get answers, new puzzles unfold. "The Bad Man" makes you half-relieved that it is over, half wants more. I hope they quickly make it into a computer game.
