Admittedly Alex has become a little podgey, but they are still (for me) the biggest rock trio ever. I recommend this DVD to every fan. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed to have canceled their planned recent Munich gig (logistics) and regret not trying to see elsewhere. The DVD is a small console - the biggest incentive to get a proper DVD playback setup. <br /> <br /> Maybe naive, but I still don't understand the meaning of the tumble dryers on stage; I will be grateful for any explanation. <br /> <br /> Cheers, Iain.
