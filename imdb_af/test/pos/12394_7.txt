I blow warm and cold over Carn√©. He can really be a puzzle for me. I think his inspiration might have left him a little earlier than it did for other directors of his generation. Certainly, a man who came to maturity with the Popular Front in the Thirties was probably resting in the France of the Fifties, with his great commercialism and heavy American influence. He is almost thirty years older than his young stars, and it shows. The party tones are much longer than they should, as if trying to buy time for the anemic scenario to work. Roland Lesaffre's character - he plays Pascale Petit's older brother - seems to exist only to ensure that the director still has his old style ideas healthy. <br /> <br /> At two o'clock this picture is too long. Yet, let me praise Pascale Petit for her performance; She was a natural one who had to challenge Brigitte Bardot for sex pot rule, but somehow lost her. Andrea Parisy is also excellent as the girl who gets pregnant and wants Charrier to marry her and make her baby right (yes, they still thought in the fifties). Laurent Terzieff is the only French actor who can convincingly play an anarchist: he is wonderful here as he saves a cat from death and says he cannot stand cats. Jacques Charrier reminds me just how mediocre he was as an actor, with that constant little smile and those bright eyes.
