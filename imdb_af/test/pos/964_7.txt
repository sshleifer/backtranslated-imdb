I didn't expect much from this story of a child whose term paper was stolen and changed into a film. Who then travels to Hollywood to even get .. but .. hey .. it's still a fun movie. Frankie Muniz of "Malcom in the Middle" boasts stars as the child and is pretty good and Amanda Bynes as his friend is also very good. Yes, the film works as an ad for the Universal Studios theme park and is really a foolish child movie .. but I enjoyed it anyway. GRADE: B-
