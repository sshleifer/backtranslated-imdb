The first thing you see in this movie is a static corner (repeated later in the movie), which sees the chaos (unseen for the audience) in a studio that broadcasts news. Soon after, Fonda's character's typical story is shown in the same corner. Don't deceive it; The film is not about a female reporter, a woman struggling to succeed in a male dominant profession. It's just an introduction, a way to start the movie (although it's used later). The real point of this production is gradually being revealed, and the first thing we see is early in a deliberate long scene. The whole movie has that tempo; not slow or exhausted, but deliberately. It's never really fast, even in the few rows you normally expect to be. This pacing (especially as it appears to slow down as the plot is revealed, as the disturbing disruptive nature of the film is unraveled) is strong, almost painful for the viewer. It inspires you, if possible, to jump into the screen, grab the people responsible for the collar and scream to do something to correct the situation. I never once felt that I was getting up for a moment or even taking off my screen. The subject is extremely important to be aware of, and it is handled well here. No over-dramatization (well ... very little, anyway), just an accurate representation of the problem. The direction is amazing. The empathy that felt for Lemmon's character is deep. The editing is masterful ... one scene near the far end illustrates it perfectly. The editor, who is judged by his filmography, is much underestimated. The writing was excellent. The play was great, especially by Lemmon, Fonda and Douglas (who also produced it). The lack of a score is perfect; No music is needed to improve. The end is sublime and effective. The movie does have some negative points. Among them, some of the dialogue, of course, and undeniably, is essentially a part of the movie, while it looks dramatic, does not seem to follow. Not everyone will watch the movie because of its two attributes commonly (and legally so) attributed to bad movies; the pacing (which can be delayed) and the (lack of) count. One can argue that this is a negative thing, since everyone should consider the points they offer, but maybe it's better this way; Handling the heavy subject with the intelligence and respect (for the subject as well as the viewer) ... something like this, maybe it shouldn't be spooned. I was enchanted by the movie, and left much behind. I recommend it to anyone who believes themselves strong enough to handle it. 9/10
