Going into this movie, I was a little careful. I've always been a bit keen on clay film. I always enjoyed decent animated movies, but clay was always different to me. But this one surprised me. Wallace And Gromit are extremely sweet characters, and this is a great joke story for all ages. There are the dim bumps for the children and the subtle but over the head of young children, jokes for our older people. Very neat claymation and while the story had holes, my interest began to end. <br /> <br /> It is so scarce to find pure and unprecedented humor, this film is increasingly refreshing. Wallace and Gromit are going to do their normal thing, HUMANING out the buggers that destroy people's vegetable crops. But this time they find themselves in the form of a freaky big rabbit who can't even keep their human buildings under tabs. Great laugh and half an hour of fun. If you haven't exposed yourself to Wallace And Gromit, I recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I'm 7 and not higher is because it's still a family movie and I don't have children. I enjoyed it, but if I watched it with a few little ones and my wife, it would be at least a 9! Give it a shot!
