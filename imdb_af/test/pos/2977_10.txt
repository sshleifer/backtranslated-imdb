I was drawn to "Friends" by the soundtrack that was by a very young and well-known Elton John I saw in a nearby Houston club. I had no idea of ​​the emotions and impact the movie would have. Recently I returned to the movie with a song called Heart Seasons. Then I found the Elton John song "Friends" think it was the same song ... it's 35 years old. Anyway, the flood of the emotions of "Friends" came back like seeing an old picture of your first true love. I reminded more of the way the movie hit me than I did about the real details of the production, plot, etc. So forgive me for a pretty poor review. I remember taking some special friends on a date to watch the movie and they were so horrible and scary at the end as I was. I'm anxious and nervous about finding a copy and seeing it now. So many movies that were so important to me (ie "The Graduate" "Easy Rider") now look stupid and I don't want it to fall into the same category. But I will find it, and if it seems stupid, then I can at least turn my wife on a wonderful ... no outstanding soundtrack. When we met, we followed it with "Last Tango in Paris". The young people I work with (56) respect my views, but it's hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings, but now look a bit "older". I just can't figure out if the aging process is the movies ... or I don't. "Friends" is a very special, sensitive and wonderful movie. It will bring back many special feelings, I'm sure. Anyway, rent or buy a copy ... India was not near the strong genre then they are today.
