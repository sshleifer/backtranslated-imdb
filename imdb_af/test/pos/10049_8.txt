It's a great movie as a movie. It gets an 8 out of 10. As a filmed piece of accurate history ... you want to love more, but it's a 5 out of 10. And I think I'm actually a lot of charity. <br /> <br /> What was he - that man of horse and saber who was the youngest "boy" general in the Union Army of the American Civil War, and ended with all his command in the greatest death military victory of the North American Indian tribes? Authoritative, militant, shabby, bloody-handy, ambitious, clever, too clever, Indian enemy, Indian friend (?) And national hero. His death in 1876 was regarded as a national tragedy and resembled Washington, Lincoln, Jackson, and Grant / Lee and Sherman / Jackson in a position of fame. It is only with increasing awareness of the mistakes made in his career - the excessive ambitious hot-spur, that his reputation has diminished. To this day, George Armstrong Custer remains the best-reputed figure in our military annals of our history to lose his last battle (I can't really think the same - perhaps General Jonathan Mayhew Wainwright is forced to join his men in the Bataan Stay Dead March - but Wainwright survived the March and World War II. <br /> <br /> Custer appeared in more films than much better generals, due to Western adventures and Little Big Horn. Sorry that the details of the actual career have never been so lovingly treated as Raoul Walsh and Errol Flynn handled in this movie. But even in 1941 the legend was still strong. Olivia De Haviland depicted Libby Custer, who recently survived in another movie review on this thread, until George George took over until 1933, so her effective handling of the story was still in place eight years later. Custer was seen as our demanding but brave knight, and with the shadow of World War II threatening, we had to keep the myth and bury the truth. John Ford would fully understand and approve it. <br /> <br /> So we get the view that he was a striker but he was patriotic. Although Custer was almost expelled from West Point in 1861, it was really stupid to be such a fighter that year. You see, most of the so-called West Point military talent (from Robert E. Lee) was southern, and joined the Confederation. The Union needed every northern Point man they could get. <br /> <br /> Custer's Civil War career needs to be studied further. He was attached to the staff of General-in-Chief George B. McClellan and distinguished himself in the Peninsula campaign and other eastern front warfare. But he was a cavalier - and he would stand up under the watchful eyes of Grant and Sherman's friend Phil Sheridan in the last parts of the war. In particular, he served in the battle of Cedar Creek, which ended the threat of the Confederation in the Shenandoah Valley. It also hit Custer on a personal level (she joined West Point friend Stephen Ramseur, joined the Confederation and rose to a position like Custer - mortally wounded. Custer joined Ramseur all through the latter's last night life). <br /> <br /> After the war, things fell apart. He wanted to make his letter - Major Generalship permanent (it wasn't because it was a battlefield promotion). They just had a Lt. Colonel company to give him in the cracked army next to the border. He tried to play politics, which made the mistake of supporting President Andrew Johnson on a political journey in 1866 and favoring most Northerners, hating Johnson as a turbulent idiot. He presumably admired the Indians (he was certainly eloquent of them and the West), but in 1868 he caused a true military massacre of Indian women and children who had ended with martial law. Later, during the 1870s, he would support Indian claims against a ring of politicians (this led to the Secretary of War, William Belknap) who bought and sold Indian trading profits for profit. It destroyed Belknap, leaving a black eye on the Grant Administration. It put him in the log cabin with Grant and Sherman (who was Belknap's former commander), and Sheridan barely saved his career. Then he was sent to the final Big Horn campaign. And immortality has come. <br /> <br /> This career is worth a movie but would it be too critical? Should we keep a man of the 1850s up to 1876 by the standards of 2007? Would we have done this to us over a hundred years? Surely this can happen, but I'm not sure we would like it. <br /> <br /> Custer (1941 style) fits Flynn like a glove, with his closest to a dance performance in any of his big movies. His final film with Olivia De Haviland is underlined by a melancholy due to the fate of the hero's character. Supporting actors such as Sidney Greenstreet, Stanley Ridges, Arthur Kennedy and Anthony Quinn did well as friends, enemies, or even treacherous sneaks (Kennedy). As an entertaining piece of myth, it is high - but as a study of a complex military hero it is not what it should be.
