Terrific, deeply moving crime thriller with Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan. <br /> <br /> From the dark opening to the extremely satisfying conclusion, this cat and mustache barely miss a beat. <br /> <br /> Johnny To, who again works with the Ace composer Arthur Wong, is building another operational action that increases in the face of his contemporaries. <br /> <br /> The images are strong and moving. Its cut, combined with the extraordinary ways of music, is exemplary. You're in the hands of a master movie. <br /> <br /> The two series in which Andy Lau "hides" from the police on a bus by pretending to accompany a beautiful beauty (Ruby Wong) are testimony to To's unique director skills. <br /> <br /> Lau Ching Wan is strong and commended as the stricken policeman, while Andy Lau is dynamic as a dying man ending his father's death. <br /> <br /> It's great movie-making, just slightly compromised by some bad English dubbing in one scene with criminal Waise Lee.
