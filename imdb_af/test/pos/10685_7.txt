Well, I'll allow some of the science to be dopey in "Doppelganger" (or "Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"). The idea of ​​a whole planet that is unnoticed (because we cannot see it on the other side of our sun) is not fixed at all. Any Astronomy 101 student knows that another planet will cause the Earth's gravitational disturbances in the movements of other planets. So astronomers have inferred the existence of Pluto, which is how they find comets and asteroids and moons on a regular basis. <br /> <br /> And the notion that a mirror image of Earth somehow evolved in almost perfect parallel to our Earth, to English-speaking scientists and human peers for every human being born on our earth. It takes things out of 'hard science' fiction and into the 'Twilight Zone' area. It is not necessarily a bad thing, but it requires a great suspension of critical thinking to accept and enjoy. <br /> <br /> But man, this movie pulled off my socks as an adolescent. I was still accustomed to reasonably cheerful, excited science fiction movies when the hero finally worked through. Even "2001" can be interpreted as an "optimistic" end. <br /> <br /> But in this case: Dunne tried to dock with his groundbreaking motherhood, so that he could return to his own Earth, just to be returned from his dokkie (Something about the polarities that didn't overturn) not because his "doppelganger" did not do the same thing. Apparently Thinnes' doppelganger decided he was happy in his new home.) Thinnes's ship took the descent back to the CounterEarth launch site, and I was sure he somehow wanted to get the damaged craft to land safely and try again, armed with the new information that will make him and his backsliders succeed. He was the hero, and the hero always wins in the end. <br /> <br /> Instead, Thinnes cannot maintain control of the crippling vessel, and the ship's subsequent crash in the start yard was so terrible and devastating that it killed everyone (except for the main project leader) and destroyed everything records of the project and the existence of Thinnes. Dunes never went home, and he died unusable, his secrets never revealed. <br /> <br /> Apart from the Planet Of the Apes series, I have never seen such a sad and cunning end, and it always stays in my mind - especially the fiery destruction of the scene of the accident near the start of the move. (You knew that spaceship never went flying again) and the one at the end. <br /> <br /> I would love to see this movie again, and see how good it is over the years.
