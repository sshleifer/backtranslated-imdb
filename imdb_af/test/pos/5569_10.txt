Looking at this series will probably make you feel like our parents felt when we first looked at Star Trek. <br /> <br /> This series has everything. The kind of stories that let you forget how to blink, the kind of characters that make you join the action, and the atmosphere that makes your hair stumble in awe and endless admiration. <br /> <br /> In short, we start with an astronaut John Chrichton, shot in a wormhole and end with a gang of prisoners on the way of the bad black leaders, ironically known as Peacekeepers. <br /> Other colorful characters include D'argo, short-tempered man and a sword / laser gun. Aerun Sun, former peacekeeper and a Ph.D in the chicks. Zotoh Zhan, who is a plant. No really, she is. She is also a priest, but with an average line. There is also Dominar Rygel XVI, a thick lazy hybrid that sails helium and generally more damage than good. <br /> <br /> Later in the series we meet the sexiest alien ever on television, Chiana. A young and apparently chronically horny Nebari. She was played by Gigi Edgley, who is a name to remember. <br /> <br /> One of the many things I like about this series is that John Chrichton eventually landed in this part of the galaxy. refer to "Real Life". On behalf of John, who is difficult to accept the fact that he will be frozen as a sculptor for 80 years, one of his many complaints is that when he returns, Buffy The Vampire Slayer will be dead. <br /> <br /> So Frell's all the other series, get your Dren together and spend an Ahn on one of these episodes. I can assure you, Sci / Fi as you know it will change forever. <br /> <br /> This series has everything. It's sexy. This is action package. It's hillarious. This is Farscape
