It's a tough movie to watch, and would have been even harder when I knew the protagonist's actor was murdered in his home by police at the age of 19. Pixote (PeeWee) is a street kid in Sao Paulo who is caught in a roundup caused by a murder in which he had no involvement. He is committed to a youth prison where he testifies to cruelty and exploitation that ordinary citizens hardly believe to exist. When he finally escapes, he and three comrades survive the only way they know what crime is. What makes the movie so heartbreaking is that both the Pixote and the actor clearly portray him, not wanting to be the characters that made their living conditions. Pixote is trying to trust and love and bind, but there is simply no place in its world for the soft side of human nature. The one is over and desperately wants to do something for the Pixotes of the world, but what? Building more children's prisons with higher walls is definitely not the answer.
