I just checked out the Northanger Abbey from the local library and didn't expect much. Imagine my surprise at this gothic treat! Northanger Abbey is one of the most ominous places you've ever seen, with empty corridors and decorated secret-filled rooms. The glory of the movie is that it is never revealed: your imagination goes free, runs with the imagination of the main character, one Kathrine M. She is a wild imagination girl, a gothic fantasy reader she brings into her (and our) real world. <br /> <br /> If I used one word to describe this great movie, it would be surreal. Dreams are woven throughout the movie and the mood improves. Sometimes it is difficult to tell what is real and what is not; it is deliberate, I believe. <br /> <br /> Atmosphere rules supreme. The music is not what you expect from Jane Austen from a movie: it is ominous, flute and drum based, tall and haunting with an undercurrent of fear. Playing a soft, pleasant voice in the Northanger Abbey will be positive. Now it's quirky, a grim and sharp-walled palace of madmen. (But! The characters! You'll have to see it for yourself!) <br /> <br /> Looking for a pleasant evening, look no further than Northanger Abbey.
