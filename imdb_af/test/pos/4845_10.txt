Without a doubt, film is a powerful medium, more than ever before because of the accessibility of DVD / video, which gives the filmmaker the added assurance that his story or message will be seen by millions. Use of this medium therefore attaches an innate responsibility to the artist, since film is educational and entertaining, dictating that certain subjects should be approached accordingly and with a corresponding sensitivity and sensitivity. For example, a movie like Spielberg's Schindler's List, is important because it remains the memory of what should not be forgotten, and as history tends to repeat itself, Spielberg's film can be considered a valuable tool to " a repetition of that tragedy. In this same action, this film, "Focus", directed by Neal Slavin, is important. It alleviates the problematic reality of anti-Semitism, which has been striking for years beyond the number of millions of people, still unimaginable today and, like any bar crossing, will survive if it is unmarked or ignored. Born from a xenophobic tribe, it is a disease that infects society, which can be relentless; And these are intrusive insights into the condition, this film is an effective vaccine that at least helps prevent its proliferation. Hopefully this can act as a step to eradicate it completely. <br /> <br /> William Newman (William H. Macy) served his country in the Great War and has since lived a quiet, conventional life in New York. He has had the same work for twenty years as a staff director and owns the home in an average middle-class environment where he lives with his mother (Kay Hawtrey). Lawrence is the kind of guy who just goes by thinking about his own business and refuses to involve himself in matters that are not his concern. <br /> <br /> However, all these things will change. as with the advent of World War II, Lawrence, along with the owner of the corner market, Mr. Finkelstein (David Paymer), inexplicably a target of the neighborhood xenophobes, who aligned themselves with the "Union Crusaders", a national organization currently being taken to channel their fears and hatred over Jewish, or even someone looks like a Jew. And suddenly, Lawrence finds that he can't just stand on the sidelines and watch the game play; because now he is the game, whether he wants to be or not. <br /> <br /> Working from an intelligent, well-written script by Kendrew Lascelles, which he adapted from Arthur Miller's novel, offers Slavin a different scenario that explores the effects of bigotry on those against whom it is leveled be; and if one considers the fact that it is not just a hypothetical situation, but a portrayal of reality, it becomes increasingly uneasy, even unnecessary. And what makes the movie so effective is Slavin's clear understanding of his subject, and she studies presentation, which in his subtle sense is meaningful. In the opening phase, Slavin establishes Lawrence's "character" and shortly afterwards it re-establishes in another scene, giving the audience the opportunity to observe and assimilate how Lawrence's thoughts really work; the thought processes that lead his life. With that in place, Slavin can take his audience with Lawrence as his problems gradually unfold. In this way, he effectively illustrates how the problem develops, rather than simply posing and addressing the problem. This increases the viewers' emotional involvement and ultimately improves the impact of the movie. <br /> <br /> Slave makes an important statement with this film, which is not just a bigotry charge, but also a caution about apathy. And to his credit he never beats you over the head or touches you subjectively to make his case; Instead, he continues carefully, with great effort to be as objective as possible with everything he submits for your consideration. His approach is that of a film diplomat; And this is an approach that serves maid - and his movie - very well. <br /> <br /> As Lawrence, William H. Macy - one of the best character players in the business - gives a wonderful achievement, the credibility and credibility of his character with a sensitive, honest and introspective depiction. He never tries to circumvent the personal defects of Lawrence's nature, but rather uses them to create a three-dimensional character that not only makes him convincing, but also serves to confirm the integrity of the depiction. What makes it so compelling is Macy's ability to convey the process of investigating his own conscience, which can successfully share the viewer in the experience of his personal epiphany. In the final analysis, it is the power of Macy's performance, more than anything else, that distinguishes this film so significantly. <br /> <br /> Another strong film of the movie is the performance by Laura Dern, such as Gertrude Hart, a performance that effectively complements Macy's work as well as that of Slavin. Dernoot gives her great character to her character, and physically as well as emotionally, and her colorful fervor crates a striking contrast with Lawrence's reserve, which works well for her character as well as the movie itself. <br /> <br /> And just as Sean Combs recently (in Monster's Ball) made a good case to get rid of the acting efforts of an established "rock star", Meat Loaf gives Aday a powerful show here, like Fred, Lawrence's next door neighbor. It also shows that a true artist will produce, regardless of the sail he is working with. <br /> <br /> The supporting film includes Michael Copeman (Carlson), Kenneth Wallies (Father Crighton), Josef Ziegler (Gargan) and Arlene Meadows (Mrs Dewitt). The kind of film that a filmmaker takes pride in his craft, "Focus", offers an unforgettable experience that will hopefully also be enlightening to those who are unaware that such conditions exist and still do - even in this country of the free 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
