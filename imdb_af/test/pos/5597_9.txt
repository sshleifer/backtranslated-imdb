This movie is probably Hal Hartley's best one. The subject, of an unusual originality, is treated (this is usually with Hal Hartley) with good humor. This feature is by no means the only quality of this film: the difficult frame composition (everything is parallel, to the smallest details), shooting angles, lighting, a more supernatural dimension to these faded images (Jesus' descent could not be on a filmed in a conventional way), the falsely 'busy' acting, features that this Bible reads, which is performed in the form of an apocalyptic delirium, are essential.
