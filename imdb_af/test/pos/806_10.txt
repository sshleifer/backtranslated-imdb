This movie earns 20/10 if I could give one. "THE HOLLOW" is a wonderful Hercule Poirot novel and the end to end is most people. I am delighted that this film has remained completely true to the novel. There was no big difference I could make. The only difference was that Poirot was introduced into the story earlier in the story. The acting was excellent, and the music was as usual as incredible! David Suchet is perfect in his role, and the rest of the cast is also perfect in their respective roles. In no other movie I've seen so far, Poirot is so brilliantly portrayed! Hats off to the producers - they made a movie that I would cherish with many others for a long time to come!
