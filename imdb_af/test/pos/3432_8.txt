Very funny movie with some of the best Swedish actors. It's all filmed in black and white with the true 40-ish feel. Most of the movies were on board a train that went to Berlin in 1945 under a mixture of refugee characters to 2 gay guys and 2 nuns. I really recommend this movie if you want to laugh.
