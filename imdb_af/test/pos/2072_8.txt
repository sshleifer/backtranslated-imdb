Part of the BBC filming of all of Shakespeare's classic plays, this version of Hamlet, makes me particularly impressed that it is one of Shakespeare's most overestimated plays and Hamlet himself is a particularly moving and tragic character. I didn't feel any sympathy for him, and I didn't look at it. <br /> <br /> Even when you have big actors like the big Derek Jacobi in the role of the Dane, and Patrick Stewart as Claudius and Jonathan Hyde like Rosencrantz, it cannot disguise the lack of passion in the storyline. And when a good actor like Jacobi injects passion into it, he makes the whole role incomprehensible. I couldn't tie his physical character to the character he'd said, and it killed me. It is said that he is not the word "to be or not to be", as his actions with a dagger make the character's suicide targets clear at that time in the play. <br /> <br /> The supportive roles, better written for me, and therefore played better, are great, especially Lalla Ward's loopy Ophelia and Stewart's well-detailed interpretation of Claudius. <br /> <br /> At four and a half hours it is very long and the best viewed in bites. cut pieces. Check it out if you are interested, but be prepared for a long look.
