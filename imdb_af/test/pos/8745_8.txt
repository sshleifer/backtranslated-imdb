I've delivered countless reviews that talk about the superiority of the mini-series. I certainly can't agree on such a blanket statement. Analyzing all the aspects of a video / movie production, there are countless areas where the movie is probably much better. <br /> <br /> Certainly, many of the comments are valid with respect to specific areas of the mini series. Specifically regarding more threads (customs officers) and more developed threads (such as the Pakistani farmer and family). That said, I found Catherine Zeta-Jones' character much more compelling than the desperate women, from poverty to wealth that "won't go back." It's a much more similar character to those cold women who didn't have much reason for her quick turn. (And yes, I understand ... her children. She was desperate, I just didn't see her so desperately.) <br /> <br /> Also, while I appreciated the more stuffed story threads In the mini-series, Benicio del Toro's character was very compelling. An anchor for the movie. That thread has changed (as an alternative to the Pakistani family) in nothing but good manners. A fantastic adaptation. (Of course I am skeptical that such a person can be so clean within such a system, but I don't know enough about the politics of the nation to argue.) After the first episode of the mini series, I actually have the movie repeat. Why? I read about the fantastic acting. I found the performances in the first episode of the mini-series to be borderline. Certainly, this has improved as the mini series progresses. Now that I have finished both versions in a few days, I cannot agree that the mini-series performances have reached the same level as Benicio del Toro, who was brilliant in the film, though Ormand, Paterson, Shah, and Lindsay Duncan was very good. I also feel that the police in the movie overshadowed the mini-series far. I wasn't really impressed with the Germans. <br /> <br /> Finally, the dialogue, as in the film, is very nuanced. Especially in the screens that are almost verbatim. "Careful, you start as your husband sounds." Unlike "HAHAHAHA! You sound like Karl." Again, I found some of the actors in the mini-series very unconvincing. It was a good example. <br /> <br /> Other better aspects of the movie, in my opinion: counting, cinematography, editing. <br /> <br /> Should I complain that the movie was no longer? No. I think it was a fantastic adaptation that gave the format. The changes made are on their own. I mean, you will sit in a theater for 5/7/10 hours. Of course not. <br /> <br /> Mini Series: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Movie: 9 out of 10
