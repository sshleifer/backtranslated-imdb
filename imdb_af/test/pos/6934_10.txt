Just watched this one. I wanted to show it to one of my friends and we had the best time. That's why these kind of movies are made, to entertain people and Zombie Bloodbath 2 does it for me and for everyone I showed it. <br /> <br /> The story is about a group of teenagers in one of those races in a group of escaped prisoners who took over an old farmhouse. When a scarecrow (who is actually a demon, I think) is disturbed, it comes to life and revives bodies of the local cemeteries. This means that our heroes just have to escape to land in the arms of two mad killers, torturing some people in a deli in a small town. Soon it's a revelation with people fighting the zombies. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie! From the various formats (black and white film, video and digital cameras) to the very fast pace and good music, there was always something going on and it never bore you! Sure, it's cheap, but you can see a lot of care and hard work in this movie. I read other reviews and all I can say is that these people missed the point. If you want a 35mm Full Moon fluff, or if you're into modern things like Urban Legend, I say it's going through. If you like low budget things like Gates Of Hell and Evil Dead, I say buy it now. <br /> <br /> The make-up and gore are very good, the acting is sometimes uneven, but excessive is pretty good and the editing is very impressive. There is plenty in this one to fill two more movies! This is actually one of the better b-movies I've already seen.
