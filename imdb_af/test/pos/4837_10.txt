We will never broadcast this movie through HBO in the near future as anything. If someone somehow gets it into a video store, grab it just before someone else does, because I doubt it will ever be released again. <br /> <br /> An incredible and timely film about the first attack on the World Trade Center on February 26, 1993 and how the government agencies whose work it is is to identify and stop terrorists from damaging US citizens to do and US property fell completely on the job and allowed it to happen. <br /> <br /> Bone chilling since we all know now that the terrorists who were arrested at the end of the movie will not be the end of our nightmare that fell back on September 11, 2001. <br /> <br /> The movie brought out everything that went wrong in 1992-93, which made the first tragedy at the WTC possible. Yet it took another eight years to realize that we had to learn from the first WTC attack to be more vigilant and ready to prevent the second and much more devastating assault on the World Trade Center. I found this movie more difficult to watch the events of 9/11 and then the video of 9/11 attacks itself. <br /> <br /> All I can say about this movie is not alone. The end of the self is so powerful and prophetic that it will leave you in a state of shock to know what we know today and possibly look at someone who is with you but not at the movie, to seek medical help .
