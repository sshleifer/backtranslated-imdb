The Turner Classic Movie Channel spent the month of January on the films of one of my favorite actors, Robert Montgomery. His films are mostly rarely watched, except for those that were atypical for most of his career. This means that the roles that regularly appear on television were published. THE LADY IN THE MORE, JUNE BRIDGE, NIGHT SHOULD VALVE THE SAXON. CHARM, RIDE THE RED HORSE, RAG IN THE SKY, THE CHICAGO'S OVERSE (Briefly, the films he fought to get the roles because they were not the usual comic fluff, he usually appears). It is ironic that nowadays, as one thinks of Montgomery's career, it is the films that were mostly made after 1937 being pushed - those that broke the original image that MGM and Louis B. Mayer broke. The pity of this is that Montgomery was a gifted comedian and saved many movies to be routine. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is such a film. Made in 1936 with PICADILLY JIM and PROFILE FOR TWO, it was a banner year of good performances by Montgomery. He helped convince the forces at MGM to enable him to play Danny. year. <br /> <br /> PETTICOAT FEVER is in Labrador, and Montgomery is a weather station operator called Dascom Dinsmore. He has been living there for five years and was not in the company of a woman (except for Inuit women) for most of the time. He has a girl of the kind Clara (Winifred Shotter) he suggested, but it's been two years since he heard from her so he believed she'd surrendered him. <br /> <br /> Dinsmore's world was rocked when Sir James Felton and Irene Campton (Reginald Owen and Myrna Loy) appeared. They flew to Toronto for a business meeting that Felton had to address. Felton is involved with Campton, but Dinsmore finds her fascinating ... and gradually she finds him equally attractive. Certainly, the turbulent, self-evident and hopelessly infallible Felton is no competition (it is some of Owen's play that he remembers the character, even if one finds it difficult to believe such a boob, a Canadian captain of the industry.) /> There is something surrealist about this movie - probably because of the original play. While the "Labrador" scenery is rather rude, it serves the purpose of the comedy (witness the polar bear sequence). But the culmination of surrealism is dinner. Dinsmore serves his guests, a dinner of "pemmican steaks", which Owen eats with a real gusto. Owen (a minor nobleman like a baronet) is dressed in ordinary clothes - a winter suit for the climate. But Montgomery was dressed in his pack of evening wear (as if attending a ball at the embassy). Loy, see him dress up, put on a gown too. They are served by Dinsmore's servant assistant, Inuit Kimo (Otto Yamaoka), who also wears a suit of evening dress - it seems Owen is! Owen, who earlier insisted that Dinsmore turn into clothes that are more suitable for his station, is the only person inappropriate dressed for this dinner !! Montgomery was MGM's most elegant actor in a dress or evening dress (Franchot Tone was the closest contender). It's a thrill in the movie if Montgomery or Fred Astaire was the more elegant figure in such suits. Hard to decide. <br /> <br /> The course of love does not move in comedy or drama at all. Clara appears (we are typed too early at the beginning of the movie when we see her on an icy ship). Will Dinsmore break with Clara? Will Irene break with Felton? The movie is funny, and Loy and Montgomery make a lovely couple. They appeared together in another movie, and both were in separate scenes in front of this movie in a second. But that would be their last movie together. <br /> <br /> One last interesting point - at the start of the movie when the credits are shown, you see illustrations of men and women in comic situations. They are based on the artwork of John Held Jr., the great cartoonist / illustrator of the 1920s and 1930s - who was the recorder of the flapper and the Jazz Age. It's an unusual choice - as it has absolutely nothing to do with the movie's plot or Labrador.
