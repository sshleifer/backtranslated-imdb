To date, I thought there were only three people, including me, who considered the Heavenly Gate (1980) a masterpiece and perhaps the last great western (since the 1970s), Little Big Man (1970), Jeremiah Johnson ( 1972), The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and The Long Riders (1980). <br /> <br /> I was surprised and pleased to see that 22.5% of those voting at IMDB evaluate this movie a 10. A recent book, the worst movies of all time, includes the Heavenly Gate. Through this production and release, it has been destroyed, like no movie since Cleopatra, almost twenty years ago. At one time, it was considered the most expensive over-all-movie movie ever to surpass Cleopatra. It was blamed for the downfall of his studio, United Artists, until everyone finally saw all the studios fall. Michael Cimino, fresh from his glory with the Deer Hunter, was hated and despised for his success and movie excess, but clearly, it was little jealousy at its worst. <br /> <br /> Eventually, Cimino has one of the great exhibits of the American experience. This movie cannot be missed, but a serious student of American movies.
