Hummmm, ... Another Keystone comedy in the park !!! It looks like the number one spot for shooting in the same local park, as there are so many Chaplin's and Arbuckle's movies there! And while it's still one, it's different enough and well made that I still enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Fatty is interested in a younger than usual looking Mabel Normand. I think she should be a little younger, but in her mother's eyes she is YOUNG to be interested in men. Well, Fatty doesn't share her feelings and soon he and Mabel will run away for innocent fun. Things become complicated when the mother's watch is stolen. Fat find it and give it to Mabel as a gift and cause many problems. <br /> <br /> Good pacing and the fact that this movie did not attract too much on cheap folding stick, but a reasonable plot makes it a cute and enjoyable little movie.
