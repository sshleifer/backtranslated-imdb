Although scarcely compared to other scientific film series such as 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, LIFEFORCE works as a totally berserk and bizarre mention of science fiction and horror elements. Somehow, despite a dialogue that controls the ridiculous and acting approaches that do the same, it works because of a few highly different elements. <br /> <br /> Loosely based on Colin Wilson's 1976 novel "The Space Vampires", this film by director Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) focuses on a joint US-British mission aboard the Churchill British spacecraft to study Halley's Comet. Under the direction of an American commander (Steve Railsback), they discover an alien spacecraft in the coma's coma. And when they examine the inside of the spacecraft, they find strangers who look like giant bats. Later, the Churchill reached the Earth's orbit, but no response was given to radio calls issued by the mission-based Space Research Center in London. Columbia is launching to work with Churchill, but they find the whole ship fired by fire - except the strange creatures that are locked in glass, which, far from the untouched of the fire, look perfectly perfect. The strangers are bought back to Earth ... and that's where the incredible happens. <br /> <br /> These space vectors escape from the Space Research Center and, instead of draining their victims of blood through bite wounds, their victims' suck out completely. One of them is the Space Girl, a thorough naked vampire played by Mathilda May. Churchill's only real survivor, Railsback, is being bought by the SRC chief (Frank Finlay) and a British specialty agent (Peter Firth) to keep up with May, who is in telepathic contact with him. However, the vampires soon changed London into a scene of pure holocaust; People are being tackled or turned into zombies, and the threat posed by NATO to sterilize the city with thermal radiation is great. Railsback eventually picks up with May and sacrifices himself by catching her with a large metal saber. <br /> <br /> Undoubtedly unrelenting, undoubtedly uneven, yet worth watching, LIFEFORCE, despite the regular incoherence of its writing and its acting, benefits from some deadly excellent special effects work by John Dykstra ( STAR WARS), the best ever seen. The other working element, and a surprise, is the incredible orchestral score by Henry Mancini, almost Wagnerian, as John Williams's score for STAR WARS was. And Mancini, like Williams in front of him, uses the London Symphony Orchestra to get started! <br /> <br /> Especially forgotten nowadays, and a critical and boxing disaster in 1985, LIFEFORCE, if for no other reason saw it for someone who was bizarre. There has never been a movie like this before, and there will definitely be nothing more.
