The only footage from Zeppelin I saw before this DVD is "The song remains the same movie" of 1976. We spent hours with a friendship house to see it, but I never really liked it and did it fantasy sequences hated. .. <br /> <br /> So what about this DVD? I didn't know it existed before I looked at the Physical Graffiti CD ... "When did it come out?" I thought <br /> <br /> For some reason I thought Page was not a good live guitarist, but to say that watching this DVD changed my opinion is a massive understatement. <br /> <br /> There is a white summer from 1970 to 10 minutes of guitar wizard. <br /> <br /> There is an acoustic set from 1975 - "Source-y-aur Stomp" has a brilliant finger- <br /> <br /> The "In my Time of Dying" and "Tramped Underfoot 'performances (also from '75) are breathtaking - with Page and Bonham torn things like no one else has. Demonish possessions of Rawk! <br /> <br /> The magic continues in the Knebworth 1979 section. The performance of 'Achillies Last Stand', taking into account their respective drug-addicted states, begs only faith! A song of complex guitar overburden, Page arranged in a way that allows it to just 'punk it out' of live - the effect is quite fascinating. "In the Evening" - I never kept it on the disk, but it is singing here. 'Sick weather' - large piece of sleaze rock. The footage of Knebworth is very interesting and has great effect between big screen, several rostrums and bootleg footage. <br /> <br /> Planting is incredible through all the gigs. Page seems to be a painful thin, resembling a six-year-old child who enjoys most of his life at the Knebworth concert and makes contagious performances. <br /> <br /> One thing that surprised me - The 1973 'Black Dog' Performance sounds a lot of 'camp pitching' !! Robert Plant has always loved a little 'mince' and those jeans are absolutely ridiculous - and would justify an arrest today. Very different from the muscle-bound kick-a $ studio version. <br /> <br /> I love this DVD. It reminded me how good Zeppelin was and remained.
