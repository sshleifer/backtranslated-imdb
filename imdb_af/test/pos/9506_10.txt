As other reviews have said, there are some missing videos from this collection, but what's on this disk is overwhelming. There are two separate soundtracks, an original recording and a complete new version. Any new music from the residents is welcome and I think for a first time listener, the new version could be more over-friendly, but I prefer the original recordings (probably simply because it is original.) Production of this DVD is incredible, New and old videos are interesting, with live show videos probably the least interesting of what is being offered (though the bits of live recordings hidden as easter eggs are very welcome.) It's not a tenant, it's a collection of its own. Enjoy.
