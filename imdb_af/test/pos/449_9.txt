There were many excellent comments about this movie and I want to add my voice to praise. Yul Brynner has never been more attractive. His big Surov was sounding. Your eyes just can't leave the screen when it's on it. It's his movie. It is not to relieve the rest of the cast, which was also exemplary, especially Deborah Kerr and Anne Jackson. Since they were mostly stage actors, they brought many nuances to their performances. For example, I saw this movie at least 4 times, but this is the first time I've noticed the reaction of the German girl when she came face to face with a Russian soldier. Although he did not threaten, her absolute hysterical reaction realized that she had to be in Germany after World War II and would probably be the gang rape by the Red Army. The possibility of discovering a deeper story just below the surface lets me see this fascinating movie time and time again. Please place it on DVD.
