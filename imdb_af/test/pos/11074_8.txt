It's a very realistic movie. It's the most realistic I've seen in urban youth. The actors were great. I'll watch for more movies by Gomez. I have never heard of the movie until someone recently mentioned it. I bought it on DVD. I was impressed. I didn't see anything coming close to life as I know it in Philadelphia. It really comes close - in fact, one scene where there is an accident (I won't spoil and give details), reminds me of an almost identical situation in Philadelphia. Initially I thought Gomez had taken the scene of that real event, but then I realized that he had made the film a few years before that situation. I also agree with the point that this film did not try to extend its appeal by entering in Hollywood crap. Gomez also directed "Gravitational Laws" - I'm eager to see them.
