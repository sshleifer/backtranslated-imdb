Henry Thomas and Robin Tunny are some of the most underrated artists in the business. It is beyond me why they have no more recognition than they have. This film is a perfect example of how unlimited their abilities are. <br /> <br /> Exercising the lives of people who can be called strange, seems to be their specialty, and if these characters are not strange, I have a loss to find someone who is. <br /> <br /> The story is funny, romantic, dramatic, complicated and tragic. I hated the end, but if I didn't, I wouldn't have loved the story as a whole. So there you go.
