I actually considered investing in this movie when Gorman was no longer funding. I loved most of the screenplay, but didn't like the end. Gorman insisted that the end be as it should be. <br /> <br /> To see the finished movie, I must say I'm surprised. Reading the script I didn't introduce to the play (and Gorman's direction) would be as strong and mobile as it is here. The two leaders did a wonderful job. They were very credible and this movie is worth just watching the performances of these two amazing stars. <br /> <br /> Now, for the spoiler and if you haven't seen the movie, please do not read any more as you should see the movie first. (I really wish I never read the script, just as I could experience first hand.) <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---------- SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have two main problems with the movie. First, and I'm sure I mentioned it when I read the script, the woman had to be dead. If she were dead, the end would be much more credible. As it is, we have hurt this man who has been suffering from a woman who has left years ago. "If she left him and he is still in love, he must be seriously deceived. But he does not come across in the writing. (There is also the problem why he did not spend all this energy on the woman he still loves.) <br /> <br /> Plus, if the woman were dead, we could actually believe they were a fulfilling love and therefore believe that the man has been destroyed enough for the end to be reasonable. <br /> <br /> But I'm not buying Daphne what she does in the end. I need a very convincing need to believe that this naive girl (very naive for a higher but credible because of Bohl's performance) did what she did. The character is simply not cold enough. And if she did some kind of love or something else, then there's a whole piece of movie / story missing. <br /> <br /> Much of this movie is reminiscent of "Sex, Lies, and Video Tape." I think it would have been popular if Gorman chose to give the movie a more credible end. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie, enjoy the show. And make your own mind.
