I have seen both movies and I have no doubt seen that the repetition is the best. I know many people will not agree with those who have become supporters of the original, probably not this re-make, but I thought it was well thought out and definitely scary, it was so good I will see it again tonight, the original expressed me because they killed the kids, I mean whoever does it in movies anyway ... but in this one the kids have at least half the chance ... The only bad part of this movie is when the babysitter (Jill) goes to the sounds she hears and walks outside in the bushes to look at someone, no one in their right mind will clearly do It while baby sitting, so this is the only thing I got wrong with the movie and even so they probably had to put it in tension, I don't want to give too much away to anyone who hasn't seen it. , I recommend doing instead of listening to all those people who are shit and worse than the original saying is a better movie for teenagers, because it shows things that most of us are scared of, but then in the movies were at least 10 adults older than 70 who watched it and enjoyed it when they enjoyed it. I think you will! I give it a 9 out of 10!
