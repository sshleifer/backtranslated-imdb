the first Child's Play was an original and effective little horror movie. As expected, the 2 terrible successors played the end for this franchise. <br /> <br /> Well, when I hear they make a 4th one called "chucky bride," I just rolled my eyes and a "... when will they ever learn." <br /> <br /> But when I heard that they were getting a good director, Ronny Yu and a solid throw, including the awesome Jennifer Tilly, pleased me. <br /> <br /> This movie is extremely well done. It has a good sense of humor, highly stylized graphic violence, great cinematography and the beautiful sexy Jennifer Tilly who has her most impressive things in the first half. (I must add that she is also a fantastic actress.) <br /> <br /> it keeps its tongue firmly in the cheek without moving into the campsite. The pop effects are great and the verbal interaction between them is invaluable. It's more of a horror / comedy than straight horror, but the humor is welcome and well integrated. <br /> <br /> I've heard they're planning a boy from Chucky. If they can match the quality of this movie, if possible, this franchise will have made a legitimate return. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8.5
