This show has everything you ever want from a prison drama. There are twists and turns to the season. The characters are very strong, and this gives the display a lot of power. When you look at the show, you feel not only for the prisoners, but also for the prison staff. The actors playing prisoners at this show have done a very good job depicting a prisoner. Also, if you want the law and order of the law and order criminal intention, there are many actors of this show that appear in those programs. The only problem with Oz is that it wasn't long enough. This performance can easily be from nine to ten seasons without getting old. Even after the season final, I find my boyfriend Oz all the time on DVD. This show is easily one of the best shows on television. Don't be a fool, go see Oz.
