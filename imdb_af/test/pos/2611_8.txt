Assy McGee is an out-of-control, hard-nosed detective based on the many examples of late 20th-century police dramas. The twist here is that Assy is literally a butt. <br /> <br /> The cheap, low-front facade of the show believes its smartness and hidden satire. It's not to say that Assy is without fervent jokes, just that the toilet bowl is used sparingly to generate consistent lips, not make groans and eyebrows. The title sequence of the program demonstrates the clever, subtle humor that is continuously used. The sequence consists of the embellishment of photos of the city that was placed on a jazzy 70s cop theme. In one photo a police cruiser is shown and the "camera" zooms in on the front license plate holder, which is vacant. The meaningless zoom satirises the production of the typical 70s-80s drama drama and lets me laugh every time. <br /> <br /> All the typical characters are included: the frustrated police chief who cannot control the user manual; the loyal, minority partner serving as a foil for Assy's recklessness; The regular police who despise Assy mean .... everything is justified and everyone is hilarious satires from the typical police drama. <br /> <br /> The voice performance, performed mainly by Larry Murphy, is nothing short of spectacular. Assy's voice - breathtaking and abominable with a little drunk grind - is so clever and unique that it is ridden alongside overall greats like Stewie Griffin (Family Guy) and Homer Simpson (Simpsons). Although the voice is unclear, the thickness is somehow clear and easy to understand. This is a good change from other adult swimming programs that often require closed captions to understand. <br /> <br /> Apart from the fantastic production and voice work, the writing is also hilaries. Assy's no-sense directness burns most of the humor, especially in his interactions with civilians outside the police force. <br /> <br /> If you have access to the Adult Swimming Comedies, Assy McGee is probably worth it. Every episode beats in just 8-9 minutes, so you really have little to lose.
