The original Female Convict Scorpion is a masterpiece all the time. The first successor, Jailhouse 41, was not, in my opinion, good, although it is still noteworthy that it took the original idea and created something in a completely different style. Director Shunya Ito managed to do the same thing again with this film; The story is a bit different here, but he still managed to make what made the previous entries excellent and better than many of these types of movies and crafts something pretty original about it. Again, the action focuses on Nami Matsushima ("Scorpion") and this time she is out of jail and not too keen on the idea of ​​going back. After he escaped to follow police officers, leading one thing to another and Scorpio found himself gathering with a prostitute and her delayed brother. The prostitute is eventually captured by the delayed brother, while Scorpion is kidnapped and kidnapped by someone she has made an enemy out of prison. But Scorpio doesn't like spending time behind bars and it's not long before she does what she does best again. <br /> <br /> The movie gets a good start when we see Scorpio cut off a buyer's arm. intention to take her back to prison. From there, however, the movie is much delayed and Beast Stable becomes more than a drama than the previous two films. It is not to say that there is not enough action yet. Scorpio spends a lot of time in 'revenge mode' and the movie is not quite short on general sleaze. Meiko Kaji repeats her role as the sinister title character and it is another understated, almost wordless performance. Her screen presence is great, and she manages an imminent presence, though only physically small. The plot structure for this film is similar to the other two in that it all develops into a crescendo of revenge. There are more people who have angered Scorpion in this movie than in the previous two, so this section takes up quite a large portion of the movie. There are a few surrealistic sequences, not as much as in the first movie, and nowhere near as in the second, but the film is about to hit the rest of the series. Overall, I would say this film is between the first two in terms of quality - not as big as the original and slightly better than the second.
