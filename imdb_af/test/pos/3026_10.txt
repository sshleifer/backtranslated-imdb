"The Cell" is an exotic masterpiece, a staggering journey to not only the great idea of ​​a serial killer but also one of a talented director. This is conclusive proof of what can be achieved if people release their unmotivated imagination. It is bravery at work, forcing thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches, and to create something truly wonderful. This is the best movie of the year to date. <br /> <br /> I have read many complaints about this movie, all over the style and no substance to make characters and bad plays worse. To criticize this film negatively is to miss the point. This movie can be a landmark, a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow. "The Cell" has just opened the door to another world of imagination. So we can hit the door in his face and tell it and his director Tarsem Singh that we no longer want to? Personally, I would like to welcome more than another movie to Tarsem, and I would like to see someone trying to challenge him. <br /> <br /> We all heard how to get into the minds of a serial killer, and yes, I agree that the "genre" is a little overworked. The 90's were full of movies trying to portray what makes serial killers; some of them worked, but most failed. But "The Cell" does not blow the same route, we get a new twist, we are physically transported and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious topic ever studied. <br /> <br /> I love how the movie doesn't decorate us with too much scientific jargon to explain how Jennifer Lopez actually enters another's brain. Instead, she just sits on a lab table and is wrapped with what looks like many Twizzlers and chased into another entity. "The Cell" wants to show you what it's about and not "how" it's all about, and I think that's what some people don't like. True, I like explanations with my movies, but as a movie blow on new ground, make it do what it desires and simply take in. <br /> <br /> I noticed how the movie was very dark when it showed reality, perhaps contrasting the bright footage when it The set design was simply astonishing, but I would not be surprised if this movie brought home a few Oscars in movies, best costumes, best directors and the like. nominated at least for the best photo. <br /> <br /> I noticed that I repeated myself a lot, not because there was nothing else to say, but because I can't stress enough how fantastic I thought "The Cell" was not, if you walk in the movie with a lot of open minds and wonders and obvious f If you took over, then you are sure to have a good time. I think this movie was just too much for some people, writing it off as "strange" or "crazy". I am very much into psychology and the imagination of human mind, so it was right next to me. When I leave the theater, I hear one member of the audience say, "Whoever made the movie sure did very good drugs." If so, I want what he smokes. <br /> <br /> **** (out of 4)
