This movie starts a bit slow but kicks quickly in the comic gear. Each of the three "teenage girls" offers their own credible, separate, self-assured and entertaining personalities. I especially enjoyed the dialogue and interaction between Keith and Lisa. Looking at the superficial "action" that occurred, Keith's character treated Lisa's "deflowering" with tenderness and consideration. The comic development that has been followed has, in my opinion, also been drawn. David Boreanaz gives a wonderful performance as the adult man who becomes clearer than he can handle. Dialogue was sharp, fast and flowing nicely. The director and writer of this film clearly showed how none of the main characters got the moral high ground for all the shenanigans they drew. Although the film appears light on the surface, it reflects all the gray areas to become an adult, human emotion and desire.
