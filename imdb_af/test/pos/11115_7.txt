I expected FAME to be an uplifting movie, but it ended up being the opposite. The overall plot following the lives of several established students attending an performing arts school has strong potential. However, FAME beautifully builds up his characters and leaves us as many questions as possible. I was very surprised when the graduation ceremony appeared - we thought the DVD had skipped or something. All the characters have internal and external conflicts of some kind and virtually none of them are resolved when the movie ends! You might think there are too many characters, but these are probably too many scenes. Obviously the film is cut and shortened because it sometimes has transition. I think Laura Dean as Lisa Monroe is my favorite character. I was really related to her character's ambition and her heart followed. Boyd Gaines as Michael, the stereotypical poor student who cannot read, but is a divine dancer, is also very good. I didn't know especially about Coco's character like Irene Cara, but it's not Cara's fault because her writing is poor and her character is not wiped out. Her voice is beautiful and she hears her songs guaranteeing that the whole movie is being watched. In summary, the film can use many improvements, but the quality actors and good music deserve its place in film history.
