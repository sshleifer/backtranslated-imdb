I didn't know what to expect when renting this widescreen DVD. I knew it followed a cult, but I also saw many of the directors' later works, which were delicious, but also unsurpassed. DO NOT CONVEY A DUCKLING, actually had a linear story and a riddle that almost made me guess until the end. And that was already said and it was a really disturbing and creepy experience. One Important Reservation: I'd rather have heard the original soundtrack and read English subtitles as the uneven dubbing found here.
