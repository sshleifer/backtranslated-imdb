Man, I can't believe the very hard and negative comments for this movie. Well, that's certainly not a sophisticated work of cinema. But it's a whole lot of entertaining tough fun. To begin with, the titular pumpkin-head-supernatural killer must be one of the most legally stupid and unsuitable things that ever stumble in front of a camera; He looks like something you'd see in a fourth-rate carnival haunted house. Second, the temperate gore is ridiculously fake and unconvincing, with the definite highlight taking place when this annoying, unceasing, ultra-conservative woman is mined by a toaster through a toaster. Then there is the prosperous presence of the ever lovely Linnea Quigley, who has entertained a nice, long, totally free two-minute shower. Incredibly, we also hosted performances by the deceased blockbuster legends John Carradine as an evil fairy tale and Cameron Mitchell as a horror TV show host. In addition, screaming queens had Brinke Stevens and Dawn Wildsmith refugees. Guide kid actor Ryan Latshaw projects stump all the charm and acting ability of a crazy old tree. Pretty brunette Rachel Carter pops her top and bursts her cute breasts. The cruddy special effects are definitely less than special. The score is properly transmitted. Yet, this movie has a very nice hokey appeal, which in turn makes this honey a really nice cat to watch.
