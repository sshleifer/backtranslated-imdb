It's a good movie to watch with a good friend, boy / girl friend or family. Actually, one of them feels good to share with your loved ones .... without all the girls you find in many American movies. This movie is light but makes you think, and will make you laugh. <br /> <br /> Just a very simple but universal plot. Would think most people can somehow relate to this movie. The characters in the movie are incredible and the actors do a good job of sucking you into the movie. And the movie is taken down the road with the hilarious, real, lively Jewish humor. I watched the movie for the first time last night, and now I want to own it. :)
