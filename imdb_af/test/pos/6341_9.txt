I just looked at "returning lonely pigeon" and it was very good! I have seen many negative comments on this and I do not think the Viewers are really about it! In the television / movie business it is difficult to get all the actors back for a 2nd successor or 3rd. WE ARE LUCKY TO KEEP ANOTHER MINISTERS THAT INCLUDES THAT! This production was in the first place with the original music party, and the actors put their hearts in it (you can tell it). If you want to look rewarding d. with Robert Duvall and Tommy L. J. then look at the original. Return to L.D. didn't have so much white and took a more serious tone but was quite fascinating. From the moments to the villains, this one is a winner! "Wonderful !!!"
