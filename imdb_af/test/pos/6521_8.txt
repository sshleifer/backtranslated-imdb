In a sport that gives prizes and treasures, it's characters, one of the biggest of them in the 1930s was Jar Dizzy Dean. He was so colorful a personality he probably was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on its strength, as opposed to his pitching statistics. After all that part of the dean's story is that early end of his career. <br /> <br /> In the pride of St Louis Dan Dailey, the character of Dizzy Dean, at least the Dean I remember, is successful. I'm not old enough to remember him, but I remember him in the 1960s to broadcast Baseball Game of the Week. Because it is also part of the Dean story, it is a pioneer broadcaster on radio and later television. Now that the announcers are in the Hall of Fame, there is no doubt. Dizzy is there. <br /> <br /> Jerome Herman Dean was one of a tribe of shareholder children who had very little schooling, but a wonderful talent to throw a baseball at dazzling speed. In fact, he had a younger brother, Paul Dean, who was a pretty good jug. <br /> <br /> Richard Crenna plays Paul in this movie and is one of his earliest films. Paul Dean in real life was a quiet retirement type whose career was also circumcised by injuries. As a result, Crenna is not given much to work with. During the Dean boom, sports writers tried the nickname of Daffy on Paul, but it never took. <br /> <br /> Joanne Dru, a break from play, Western Gals in Gingham dresses and corsets, is the first to be the sensible, patient and prudent Patricia Nash, who met and married Dizzy while Houston plays in the Texas League. <br /> <br /> In the 1937 All Star Game Dizzy started for the National League. Facing Cleveland's Earl Averill, Dean was struck by a line drive at him. Refuse to listen to medical advice, dean comes back too early. He broke a big toe and placed too much of his arm. He was never the same jug and his refusal to accept it is part of the story. <br /> <br /> If he had a career of ten to fifteen years, he knows what statistics he has rolled up. Dean was the last last jug to win 30 games in 1934 and after Denny McLain (who himself was a character) did so in 1968, it hasn't been done since. <br /> <br /> Dean was broadcasting and while he was not the first former player in the broadcast building, his colorful game descriptions made him a direct hit. He started broadcasting for the other St Louis team, the Browns, and the Browns were a very unhappy team with not much to cheer for. The dean has become a star view there. <br /> <br /> Of course, part of the dean's story is the problem he experienced because of his lack of education and his colorful way of expressing himself on the air. It's part of the story I'm not going to do, but in the movie it's handled with tact and humility and your eyes can be humid if you're prone to the sentimental. <br /> <br /> A good baseball movie, a true tribute to a US success story.
