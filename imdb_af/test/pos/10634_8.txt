In the first twenty minutes we are taken away by several powerful extinct emotions: a suffocating and excessive mother has a violent argument with her vibrant 40-year-old daughter; A piano teacher (and professor of music )'s love for her pupils expressed in indecisive critical judgment; The joy that music can inspire both in the listener and the performer. Within this short time our senses are convincingly attacked with many real characters. We are also captivated by powerful music and the difference between great and mediocre performance, with a lot of attention to nuance. Such material alone would be the basis for an excellent film of widespread appeal. But the trend in French theater is what it is, it goes deeper, examining the suppressed sexuality of the teacher, the expression of sexual freedom and subsequent collapse within a context of passionate attraction and the inevitable cycle of actual abuse. We are attracted to her suffering and at least initially wonder how much suffering relates to the fulfillment of genius, especially in the composers she admires. The Piano teacher contains graphical dialogue and depictions of sex and brutality in scenes that some people may not be able to watch. The screens are essential for the dilemmas the movie intends to collect and can hardly be called. A good movie it may be, but the main stream is not.
