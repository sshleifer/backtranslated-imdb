I don't watch many horror movies, but one night I sat down and watched it with my cousins. Now, we are teens, so we tend to do a lot of fun, but frankly, the acting here was really not very good, especially in the beginning. One rule that stood out was when Scarlett told Jill and Tiffany, "This is ... high school!" while the next scene shows that Jill is passing a high school sign over it. Many parts initially reminded me of a critical, slamming, Lizzie McGuire episode. However, as the story progresses, and the movie mostly just moves over Jill, I could appreciate the movie more. Camilla Belle did really well in this movie, and I think the other actors and actresses have ruined the movie for her. And I have to admit, it was one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Well, no, there weren't big monsters and white faces that appeared in dark corners and owned dolls. But the thing that made this movie scarcer than those containing those things is that it could really happen. And this movie really reminds me of what's really scary. We all know that we will not always stumble upon living death, but the idea of ​​having a killer in the house you can sit on really happens. The only mistake with this movie is that it is one of the most cliché movies I've ever seen. It has everything that any horror movie ever had - the keys turn and the car starts shining in the corner, turning the corners of the stairs with tension, turning around and seeing a dead body, and ending a deadly scene with waking up from a dream, etc. At the exciting scene, it was very predictable, but overall I would give it a 7/10. It is definitely worth seeing. <br /> <br /> By the way, this is my first review, so I don't know if any of those things were spoilers. But just to be safe ...
