I agree with the other 9 and 10 star reviews. I saw it at the South-South West movie festival in Austin. Of the 20 movies I saw, 7 were very good and it was the best for me. I am a sucker for movies that has plot devices where characters go through transformations that totally change their lives. The excellent acting was mostly done by people who were involved with TV, or it was their first movie. It was written and directed by Jay Floyd. It was his debut as director. Jay's day work is apparently a clearance administrator for many famous films. Forgiving the Franklins was a total joy and very funny in places. This is a movie where I would buy the DVD and see it again, a great addition to me. Well done, Jay, yeah ... give your day work!
