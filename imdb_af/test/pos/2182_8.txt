I saw Turner Classic Movies (TCM) last night. I have never heard of it, and was rather surprised to find it so far. <br /> <br /> Bogart turns star as a city-wise cynical editor who is reluctant to go along with his greedy radio network boss in this sharp "B" programmer. About 12 years before he played similar urban cynics in the film such as Deadline USA, Knock On Any Door, The Barefoot Contessa and The Harder They Fall, Bogie has already passed the star features. <br /> <br /> Increasing the ratings and bringing their somewhat high-speed programming to a more popular level, pushes WUBC, "The Voice of America" ​​a radio mini-series of all about a woman who 20 years ago acquitted by a plea of ​​self-defense to kill her husband. Not willing to be discreet to save the woman's and her husband's reputations, the station uses proprietary methods to reveal everything to all listeners and as narrowly as possible. <br /> <br /> As a time capsule I also found It was many bodies of male female mores in the workplace in the mid-1930s. Although I am not familiar with Henry O'Neill, the players are evenly excellent, and the direction was tight. <br /> <br /> If you don't want this kind of movie (eg A Face In the Crowd, an Inspector Calls, etc.), don't miss the opportunity to see this one. <br /> <br />
