This movie strikes the atmosphere of a D&D group brilliantly. While I was watching, I couldn't help but see how sharp characters reminded me and my friends of friends to the point where they literally acted like us. Including the bickering, the battle, the internal jokes, the DM management. EVERYTHING. <br /> <br /> This has it all. Jokes that made me cry, action scenes that even filmed in low-budget, I found incredibly awesome. The story is pretty simple and unpleasant, but it doesn't matter, as most of the movie is to see the characters react and react with each other and the NPCs. <br /> <br /> Seriously, if you play D&D or any similar RPG, I can't stress it enough. WATCH THIS MOVIE, it has captured the spirit of D&D.
