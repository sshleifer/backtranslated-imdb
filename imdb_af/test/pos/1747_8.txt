There was a time when not all animations were Disney or Pixar. It's so nice to see this wonderful movie again and I actually got a good, reasonable copy on DVD. Be careful if it is outside the public domain and there are some very bad copies around. I have a very good copy of a company called Flashbacks and it's pretty good. In the old days I watched it on black and white on TV and his magic to see it in color. Much better than some would believe. The songs are beautiful and the color is wonderful. Interestingly, the characters are very well developed, which is strange in animated movies. I loved Hoppity and the villain Mr. Beatle is a real cad. It's incredibly imaginative. The way live objects like cotton rolls, old tins become part of the environment and new features are great. The anthropomorphic use of insects is incredible considering the many ground beings that most people unfortunately think are inconsistent. Hopefully we can never again insect on an insect! The enemy of the insects is man. In fact, it is of course the insects that will survive. No matter how hard we try to escape from ants here in Australia, they stay back. The battle is lost and we have to stay with them. There are several scenes that look like when Hoppity and Mr Bumble are caught in a water cloth, the great flood and the journey to the top of the building is wonderful. It is also rather anthropomorphic, but in a way that is charming. The human characters look very much like those in Gulliver and it is incredibly effective. The wedding scene looks beautiful. It's a crime this movie is not considered a classic. The only stumbling block to me is the opportunity in the movie as the characters move in verse. Speaking verse spoils the narrative and it was not necessary. The verse is terrible and spoils another wise, good writing. Its great and kids will love it. It's a joy to look at. There is also a very clever end.
