If you haven't seen it yet, you should really put it on DVD. I can't believe how much I enjoyed it! It's incredibly realistic and credible. Certainly, many are speculated, and I would like to know more about what was speculative and proven facts (there aren't many of them), but it deals pretty well with a "Cruel Mother Nature" theme. It will remind you of the nature programs you have seen on Animal Planet and the Discovery Channel, only the animals here are dinosaurs. They act naturally; they eat, kill, mate, play, and fight for survival. You will actually find yourself for some of them and towards others. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the effects are excellent. Sometimes they will look a little too much like CGIs, but then you see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic. In some cases you will actually be convinced that you have seen a dinosaur. My favorites were the Coelophysis, the raptors, the diplodocus, the iguanadons, the allosaurus and the Arctic bipeds. However, I was very disappointed with the T-Rex, which sometimes generated a bit. <br /> <br /> In any case, you should definitely see this production. It is educational, well-made, and very entertaining. For what it is, it's an A!
