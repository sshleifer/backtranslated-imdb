This game was one of the main reasons why I got a PS2. I remember returning Soul Edge (sometimes called Soul Blade) and I was dedicated to it. <br /> <br /> I played the original Soul Calibur, but I never had the chance to play it for a huge amount. of time. However, I bought the Gamecube version of Soul Calibur II and it really hung me on the series and I was ecstatic when I heard Soul Calibur III. This game still gives us the classic characters like Mitsurugi, Cervantes, Nagmerrie and Taki. However, it also adds several new characters such as Zasalamel, Tira and the unplayable Night Terror. (The REAL boss of Tales of Souls) The strategy based on "Chronicles of Thes Sword" mode is a new feature that I really like. It can be quite challenging in later chronicles, but it's a good addition to the series. <br /> <br /> The Soul Arena mode has several missions in which you have to fight a certain enemy under certain circumstances. (The exception is "Final Battle" in which you only have to defeat Night Terror). It's another nice touch that makes the game even more fun. <br /> <br /> In some scenes in Tales of Should you be made to print certain buttons to get a different result, it can be to evade or block an attack or to get a better end . (Each character has two ends.) It's all an excellent game and I would recommend it if you're a fan of fighting spirit.
