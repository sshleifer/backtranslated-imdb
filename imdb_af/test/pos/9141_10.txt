With some wine, friends and good humor, I had a great time watching this movie. I especially enjoyed the show of Jilon Ghai (such as "Randy"), which was such a kick in the pants! His scenes with Charity Rahmer ("Michelle") were very amusing. I don't want him to come to me, but it was great to see if "Randy" played with Michelle and even better see the results! Of course, the girls in the movie are also fun to watch. AND, a friend of mine showed me the PLAYBOY edition that Pilar Lastra had as the playmate of the month. She is definitely a viewer. All in all, this film served its purpose completely, which would entertain us in a light and carefree way.
