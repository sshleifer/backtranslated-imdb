It's one of the biggest documentaries I've ever seen with 'Dark Days'. I've been living my whole life for an hour, and I still love this movie. Peralta and his excellent editor perfectly captured the feeling and atmosphere, partly helped with some incredible archival material. Tony Alva is one of the coolest individuals in existence. Love the knees high striped sports socks, you rock Tony! <br /> <br /> Not only is this movie a visual festival, but the soundtrack should be one of the best in history, if you're in the 70th rock. Buy the DVD, you won't regret it.
