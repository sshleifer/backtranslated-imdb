Golden Boy is ecchi humor (bordering on hentai) in the guise of "educational moments." The main character, Kintaro, walks around to get himself into the women's silliest situations. It's just that he is ashamed of the surface, but analyzes everything until he can learn something about it. The most striking feature of the series is the circumstances surrounding its "education", which is actually conferred, but at the same time funny.
