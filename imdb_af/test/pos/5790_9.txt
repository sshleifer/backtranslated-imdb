This documentary was my first introduction to the Peak Oil theory. A fascinating concept that has many terrifying effects if it appears to be correct. I had absolutely no idea that the effects of oil exhaustion would come so soon, it literally took my breath away. This movie will probably open your eyes to how strong the American way of life depends on the "abundance of cheap oil" - a term used throughout the film. Many of the topics are common sense, and they are not deeply concerned with any of them. But you probably never put all the pieces together like this movie. The interviews with the authors and energy experts are all very interesting. I don't think this movie is meant to scare people. It's just meant to inform people about what to expect in the years to come, and perhaps to encourage you to think twice about the 100-mile commute to work and leave your lights all day long. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, I was no longer able to watch the cars and buses. Great documentary, everyone should see it.
