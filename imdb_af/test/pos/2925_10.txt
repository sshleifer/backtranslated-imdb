One of the most enjoyable aspects of movie viewing is getting lost in a movie. To wash it all over you, so that you absorb it as it is, and thus fully experience it. Every time I see it, the Egyptian is such a movie. Over the years, it has been a photo critic who has loved to hate. Many threw arrows at its vulnerabilities. But perhaps because of the many shows the film brings it rather than its most obvious features. It is immediately banned, remote, possibly dangerous; beware of what lies inside! The ghostly chords of the music, seen over the 20th Fox logo, lead us to other worldwide turquoise fonts. <br /> <br /> Strange! Archaeological! Decadent! It is as if we are descending into a safe of antiquity, in which great treasures can be mixed with uncertain dangers. (One might suggest that Darryl Zanuck commands: "Make it old!") What unfolds a dark dramatic story, all within the same tone set at the beginning. <br /> <br /> From Hollywood's mid-50s 'Egyptian Trilogy', 'The Ten Commandments' depicted civilization's stubbornness, the phenomenal 'Pharaoh's Land', its nuts and bolts, while 'The Egyptian' It all shows, from a drama to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> No need to say many of the players here, but I think Bella Darvi will be redeemed over time. What a perfect face for the role, right out of a symbolic painting. If her acting does not please a little, it may be argued that she is, in her role as a courtman, of course better off than to be a poor helpless admirer. I think Curtiz caught the kinkiness of her sado-masochistic relationship with Edmund Purdom's character with aplomb, censorship that was then. Sir Peter Ustinov, in his memoirs, was pretty good for the "Egyptian", and wrote that it "lost a big set for" Aida ". I have ever adopted his statement of the word 'beer'. (One of the film's historically accurate references: the Egyptian beer!) Henry Daniell, egads, which is a perfect show. Gene Tierney, who's a screensaver. Bless DFZ to give her this 'late' role. Come on, don't be so hard on Victor Adult! He's a cheese maker's son! Who has risen to be Pharaoh! Sounds like a strange American occasion. One of the best moments: John Carradine's existential observations on the sand of time. And Purdom's verdict on living outside the sunset of the world. If it's not an 'epicness', what is it? <br /> <br /> Of course, with everything, the music is sublime. It is often noted that Alfred Newman and Bernard Herrmann created one of the screen's most compelling scores, perfectly harmonious. Yet each theme is well developed, with its own life. Newman, who was pressed in time by DFZ, called in Herrmann, someone he could implicitly trust, to take up half of the burden. <br /> <br /> Benny, not the easiest man to work with, obviously respected Newman enough to really deliver. inspirational music. Their alternate directions, an ingenious approach. No destroyers over who has what is done here, but Benny brings a ridge with him, mysterious, wonderful sounds. Alfred brings fullness, longing, poignancy. Both are actually epic. Even when seen on a cut TV edition, the effect of seeing the two composers' names side by side in the main credits, which can comfortably accommodate the ultra-wide anamorphic screen, is backbone. <br /> <br /> Leon Shamroy, the Dean of CinemaScope, doesn't leave us here. The lousy vegetables and moody shadows (probably distortion in all the terrible TV prints I've seen over the years) are perfectly accompanied by the multidimensional writing (by the great Philip Dunne and WB fat Casey Robinson, who is Curtiz with him brought it to 20th). What is remarkable is that Shamroy, who was so much a founder of Fox's filmmaking as Newman was with music, was the lens "Cleopatra" a few years later, but in the brighter, sharper images of the 60's Todd A-O. These old studio guys are really my heroes. <br /> <br /> For me, what does all the imperfection and criticism in a picture like this miracle want? I'd rather say it all and enter the sea of ​​laziness to refresh, move and starve the inspirational climax of 'The End'. <br /> <br /> And yes, we have to call up to 20th Fox for a DVD version that earns the DFZ's legacy.
