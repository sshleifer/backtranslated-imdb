The real best photo of 1947 also deals with anti-Semitism and is in virtually every section better than Elia Kazan's GENTLEMEN AGREEMENT (the ultimate winner of that year's Academy Awards). Edmard Dmytryk's perfect direction, John Paxton's keen author and J. Roy Hunt's expert Expressionist lighting, is superbly named by an excellent ensemble cast. Although Robert Young (with an easy, methodical and very fair policeman) and Robert Mitchum (who are actually discarded occasionally, are the nominal stars of the film, this is Oscar nominees Robert Ryan and Gloria Grahame - as well as Paul Kelly in the small but leading role of Grahame's pathetic man - who gives the film's most memorable characterization - Ryan was as convincing as a murderous racist who he had picked out for a while, also shouting in the same scrubs in films like ACT OR VIOLENCE (1948), CAUGHT (1948), THE RACKET (1951), CLASH AT NIGHT (1952), THE NAKED SPUR (1953) AND BATH DAY AT BLACK ROCK (1955). The film is also striking for its atypical structure, as Ryan The flashback series, a complete production, is shot straight, while the real truth comes from the awkward distorted memories of the real protagonist of the movie, which has not even been played by any of the movie's stars.not! Also, CROSSFIRE was originally treated for homosexuality (according to Richard Brooks' original source story, The Brick Foxhole), but this taboo topic was unacceptable at the time to the Hays office - far from the situation we have today (at least) 3 gay-themed movies is going for this year's great Oscars! <br /> <br /> The pressure used by Warners DVD transmission sometimes shows signs of wear and tear, but the Audio Comment by noir experts, James Ursini and Alain Silver, is a good one, although I don't their opinion that Dmytryk's career had fallen steadily after his HUAC problems, as such excellent pictures as THE SNIPER (1952), THE CAINE MUTINY (1954), BROKEN LANCE (1954), THE JONGE LIONE (1958), WARLOCK ( 1959) and MIRAGE (1965) proved largely; He said his collaboration with RKO with producer Adrian Scott and screenwriter John Paxton - MURDER, MY SWEET (1944), CORNERED (1945, hopefully it will be part of the next Film Noir Box Set by Warners) and CROSSFIRE - his best work . Anyway, according to me, the latter is not only one of the key films of the 1940s, but also one of the best noirs ever made.
