After seeing the original when I was 13 (and yes, I was happy to see it while I was doing!), I was excited to see these remakes. <br /> <br /> Camilla Bell did a good job as Jill Johnson. And the fact that a teenage horrorflick can be made in 2006 without tremendous vulgarity and gore, made it even much stronger from a movie. I had a good time not to chew my nails! <br /> <br /> This movie will not win anyone for Oscar, but it is entertaining and worth the matinee price tag I bought to see it. I think girls all over the world should look the original and the remake ... and then decide to never be babysitting again. <br /> <br /> All I can say is, I'm glad I'm too old to babysit! There is just something to be in a dark, creepy home with sleeping children that makes this movie classic. No blood, no gore ... just good psychological fun! WINNER!
