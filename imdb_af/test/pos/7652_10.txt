My girls 4 and 6 love this show. We stumbled across it at a PBS station and they always ask when it is. It reminds them of their grandmother who cares every day in the summer. It's also funny and sometimes they can't stop talking about some scene. I would definitely recommend this show to all young children. It's very clean and shows you how to slow down and it's not about television all day long. When Nana reads a story, it's slow and she talks about every page with Mona. It reminds me to slow down when I read the next book to my daughters during bedtime and talk about the book, instead of going to sleep fast.
