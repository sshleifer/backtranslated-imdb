Alexander Nevsky is rightly regarded as a film masterpiece. However, it became very aging. People decide not to speak and talk about the big battle and the great music. The sound effects might have been good, but all the sounds are over, except the vanguard. I might be shot by the movie buffs for this, but I'm sure the modern viewer of Alexander Nevsky will agree that blatant propaganda and terrifying music will detract from the movie. I gave this film 10/10 because it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. It does have its big bits. The costumes of the Teutonic knights are wonderful and the battle scenes are pretty good for the time. However, this is a masterpiece that shows age.
