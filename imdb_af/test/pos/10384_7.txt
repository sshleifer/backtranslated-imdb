"Beyond the Clouds" is an over-the-top art group of four vignettes, each with a look at a man-woman relationship from the turbulent to the turbulent. Although the film offers great cinematography, some beautiful visual beauty and a fine art film, there is little meat on the legs of this fragmented work. A taste of a relationship cannot convey its fullness and synergism suggests that much more can be achieved with one story over 2 hours than with four. Nevertheless, "Beyond the Clouds" will feed for dilettantes and a visual feast for the superficial, stilted and in-substance lack.
