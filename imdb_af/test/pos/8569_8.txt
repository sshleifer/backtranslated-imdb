H.O.T.S. is a fun movie for a journey back to when flicks had a more positive, pleasant agenda. They are simply made to titillate and have a few laughs. Everything looks less cynical and uncomfortable. The girls all have natural figures and some are playboy playmates. The simple plot deals with a group of young women who open a non-sophisticated congregation home to come back to the snooty girls who cheated and insulted them. Instead of the moderate tricks of today, most of the buzz is simply innocent fun. The women are decent actresses for this genre and are usually very attractive. To keep us in mind between the topless scenes, we have mafia henchmen, a stolen bear, a hot air balloon, a funky housewife and the cheapest robot ever seen. There is even Danny Bonnaducci from the Partridge family. If you have a sense of humor, let yourself go and enjoy some light entertainment.
