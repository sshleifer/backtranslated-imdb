I believe it's been over 40 years since I saw this series, but its memory didn't fade a little. Of course it will be for DVD reissue, it seems to me. Many of the artists went on to boast (Robert Hardy, Sean Connery, to name a few); Although it was a minor role, I still remember Judy Dench, then in her 20s, as Katherine of France (Henry V). She was very nice now. <br /> <br /> There is a hint on this site that the series is filmed in color - is it so? Which of us would know - virtually no color TV in those days. Sir, pity, no videos; if so, some may have recorded it. As a way to teach English history, this series has made it alive in a way that few classroom teachers can manage. <br /> <br /> What a fine re-issue it would be!
