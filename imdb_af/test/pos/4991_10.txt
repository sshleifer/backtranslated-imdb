I am very impressed with the play in Comanche Moon. Before I start looking at it, I didn't expect it to be as good as Lone Dove. I couldn't believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters. It made me think how well they played every role! In my opinion, it was almost as good as Lonesome Dove. It is difficult to compare any movie with Lonesome Dove. If you don't make the comparison, I'll give it a thumb. It was very entertaining! I don't put much comment on this site, but I just felt that I had to get my opinion about it. Amazing! I don't want to call every brilliant coach, because I will probably have to list each one. My favorite was Steve Zahn. He hit the nail on the head and played captain Gus. His ways were perfect.
