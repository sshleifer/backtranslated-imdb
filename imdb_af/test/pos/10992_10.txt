"Manna From Heaven" is a gratifying movie. <br /> <br /> Within the shift paradox of values ​​in middle-class Americans from 40 years to the present, the plot fits the concerns and hopes of an interesting series of `Damon Runyonesque 'characters. <br /> <br /> They struggle with moral dilemmas, which are "what could have been" hoping to fulfill even young, youthful dreams, romantic desires, and "big bang" for a most entertaining movie. Rather than relying on sexual explicit testimonies in your face, the emerging relationship between Inez and Mac / Bake is classically subtle but clear. She untying the knot in her shoemaker at the art gallery and their heat in their poker game is excellent. <br /> <br /> The script's sharp writing is skilfully interpreted by an excellent star and supporting role. One of the few films I have ever seen to see twice in his opening, "Manna From Heaven", guarantees absolutely national distribution. <br /> <br /> Conrad F. Toepfer
