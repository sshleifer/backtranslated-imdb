I recently watched this movie for the first time in over 30 years and was very pleasantly surprised. I remember a film that caught Britain's mood and feel in the mid-1960s without falling into the Swinging Britain cliché that so many other films thought they had to reproduce, my memory proved right. Those who think it's like a TV play aren't completely wrong, but while Andrea Newman was famous for the TV drama, this movie is more in the tradition of the 'kitchen sink' movies like 'Saturday Night and Sunday Morning' but with the emphasis on middle class rather than work class life. Rod Steiger is excellent as the middle-aged terrified head, unfortunately married to a repressed and apparently infertile woman (Claire Bloom). The onset of the 'Technological Revolution' is the backdrop for the drama in which old values ​​and certainties are challenged. This is the boost for the central character of Judy Geeson, a role that at the time was a shocking departure from the typical primary behavior of contemporary heroines. Reversing roles, with the girl judging her conquests in a small-black book, was a forerunner to the Feminist movement and was criticized at that time for promoting promiscuity among young girls. The irony of this criticism is to be seen in the characters of Claire Bloom and Peggy Ashcroft who are both acceptably dissatisfied. Peter Hall made little films and this evidence is a great shame. Scaffolding is exemplary and completely credible and shows why he was so highly regarded
