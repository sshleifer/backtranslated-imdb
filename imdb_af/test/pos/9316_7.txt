Intentional with 'Erotic Nights of the Living Dead' with the same casting and setting, but surely this one did not have Laura Gemser. Much of me, I prefer this movie. Sure enough, the storyline and the dialogue are codswallop, but it's so beautifully filmed in such a wonderful environment and I really like the hardcore. I immediately find it naturalistic and exotic, and that doesn't just mean there's a black girl and some slack penis! I find the many and varied sex scenes very credible, even though there are two on a tree trunk on the edge of the sea, with the waves constantly splashing. The creature doesn't mind appearing till half an hour before the end, and it must be said, a disappointment. In the remaining time, he manages to kill all but two of the expedition and in case the girls first have sex (or at least one case afterwards!) And this film is not as slow as some maintain. In addition, there are a few fine moments of sexual exploitation, not least, the female scientist and her urge for two 'natives', and the glorious finale when the two survivors flush in their boat, looks back at the island where they escaped. and find there is still time for one last act of copulation.
