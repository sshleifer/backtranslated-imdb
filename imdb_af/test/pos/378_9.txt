In Truffaut's book-length interview with Hitchcock, it is clear that Big Al's fear of police is returning from childhood. His father sent him to the police station with a letter. The note said, "He was naughty, caught him for an hour." The policemen are obliged and ever since Hitchcock had a deep fear of being wrongly accused and by the police. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is probably one of the best in its "wrong accused" series. The movie is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. It's the same author who wrote the Ripley series. She is always fascinated by clever criminals. <br /> <br /> Hitchcock's opening is very strong and immediately takes you to the lead actors: Guy Haines, a well-known tennis player, and Bruno Anthony, the aspiring criminal. The two guys share a chemistry that in that day and age was probably much more than the audience could chew. Bruno tries to persuade Guy to commit the perfect murder (without clues) if they switch the victims. Bruno would kill Guy's wife who wouldn't give him a divorce, and Guy would kill Bruno's father. The motives are love and money respectively. <br /> <br /> Bruno's performance is meant to be tempting and homosexual. This is not something that was accidentally done. In fact, Hitchcock changed two versions of the movie: one USA, one UK. In the American version, the magnitude of Bruno's temptation is quite turned off. <br /> <br /> "Strangers on a Train" is a very deep movie, but more importantly, it's another excellent Hitchcock thriller. An excellent example of an exciting scene is when Guy steps up to Bruno's father's room. Hitchcock thought the audience's attention should now be diverted so they couldn't figure out what Guy would get in the room. Hitch treated us to a big, threatening dog at the top of the stairs that gave the necessary distractions. <br /> <br /> The best-known shot in the movie takes place during a tennis match. Bruno continually knocked Guy off so Guy would keep his end of the bargain (killing his dad). When Guy looks at the audience, all the heads turn back and forth. All but one - Bruno's. He looked straight at Guy with an "I-Get-You" smile. <br /> <br /> The end is another example of tension. Both men are fighting for an important piece of evidence on a cheerful round that rotates at crazy speed. A worker crawled under it so that he could come to the controls. When we finally get off this ride and the movie ends with Guy proving our innocence, we are exhausted and nail-free (for those we still bite with our nails!). <br /> <br /> "Aliens on a train" are easily one of Hitchcock's best "wrong accused" movies. Some also acknowledge him with one of the best villains (Bruno). All in all, the movie may look slightly dated, but it is a lesson in the excitement of the master himself. I won't turn Leonardo off if he teaches me Renaissance painting, too. <br /> <br /> << Overview posted at FilmDailies.com >>
