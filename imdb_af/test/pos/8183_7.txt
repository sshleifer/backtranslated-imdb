Completely a production by the director who tells the story of Qin Emperor's ambitious plan to unite all kingdoms of China. Some great characters, sets, costumes and scenes. However, I was not hidden by the film, as far as the actors ability (which was good, I enjoyed the Marquis most) or its appearance (although the massaging of troops was extremely impressive, if it were true man who is very extras! ). <br /> <br /> I saw Li Gong in other movies and she is always wonderful. Good period piece I think, but not one to judge its true historical accuracy. Good movie and didn't find the 2 1/2+ hour a problem. <br /> <br /> Rating 7 out of 10.
