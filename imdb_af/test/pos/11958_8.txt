Okay, so there are always people out there who don't seem to be worth watching movies, because they are good but prefer to keep movies based on how depressed or boring they can be, or they come out a foreign country. . Aside, One Crazy Summer is the perfect example of what a great American teen comedy should be. The jokes are a good mix of slapstick (a la Bobcat Goldthwait), surrealistic (Bobcat under the direction of Steve Holland), and dry (John Cusack, one of the most beautiful dry and funniest actors in American cinema) and there is Yes, it is immature, yes, it's screw ball, yes, Bobcat dress like Godzilla and garbage a scale model of a seafood restaurant. It's also funny like hell. Beware.
