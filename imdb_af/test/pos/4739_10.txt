If you want to see real evidence of what a wrong and unmarked government can do to an unpopular nation, this movie offers it. Read what some people have said about the "Patriot Act" passed after 9/11 and then look at this movie. Is it worth it? Do we really want to give our freedom to these people? Regardless of what you've seen on TV, you're not fully informed until you've watched this movie. I apologize for quoting another reviewer, but must repeat it. Roger Ebert van Siskel and Ebert said: "What is interesting if you are looking for people who are unbalanced zealots ... you do not find it under the Davidiane Branch, you find them under the FBI and the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, these are the people in this movie who deserve to be feared, I think. "I think every person responsible for 9/11 should be brought to justice, but I think the government doesn't have a history that has the duty to protect people's rights. This film shows it dramatically.
