This movie has one of the best club scenes, very good soundtrack (if you like techno / trance music) <br /> <br /> Some situations (As the main character Carl begins to use drugs) is a bit off reality, but the plot is entertaining, but the characters are all a little level ... <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie if you don't like techno music <br / > <br /> For the plot / action alone, this movie is a 4/10, with the very cool special effects and the sound tones and soundtrack being a 7/10, but if you want to go to the movies not to good hear songs and grab a small club feeling, it's a 10/10. <br /> <br /> The special effects are sometimes hidden, sometimes clearly visible. (ie fast moving clouds / sun / moon, morphing background, morphing cuts) <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it, a shame there was no dance floor in the theater;)
