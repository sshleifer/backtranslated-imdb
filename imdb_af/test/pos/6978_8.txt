Early Coppola with sublime throws that most people should never see (sorry). There are some wonderful things happening in this one. Shirley Knight's best performance (an underrated actress), a road trip in the late 1960s, James Caan very much held and moved, Robert Duvall in a part he was born to play (edgy, motorcycle policeman) and touch with F. Coppola behind the steering wheel. <br /> <br /> Five years later, if no-one made it, it would be a smash (so much for timing). Anyway, I recommend it to all people who don't need extra-space explosions and bad mother-in-law jokes or a billion-dollar budget to watch a few hours and watch a story. Give this one a chance if you can find it!
