On Sunday, I provided venue services in London's Berkeley Square. David Niven, the gentleman thoroughly enjoyed the role of the gentleman, unfortunately to be his last. We had a moment of panic as a tribal drain for Krugerrands (which was played for the movie) drains a storm. <br /> <br /> Imagine a thin crew that opens the drain to repair every last one. Knowing and loving London will love this comedy skirt. Also started Richard Jordan who died of a brain tumor. A good movie, great crew, excellent role. Look for current stars of coronation street and then crowd screens or extras. The car lot and Ivan's retail businesses are all shot in west London, Chiswick's entire shop parade and the American used car lot was dressed overnight, the car lot is still there just like the shops. A restaurant was suddenly transformed into a funeral room. If you see the movie on the lists, try to see it! Incidentally, Sally Harrison, the bank's receptionist was married to production designer Tony Curtis. <br /> <br /> April 2007 I thought I'd add some extra comments in places: <br /> <br /> Pub: just outside Berkeley Square Every Sommers Cottage: Back Road next to Twickenham Film Studios Ivans Used Car Lot: along Chiswick High Street and all the shops near the roundabout. Workshops (converting armored vans) Roundabout factory versus the Fullers brewery phase (see workshops above) Telephone box sees Every Sommers cottage (it was the wood studio prop in many films, watch the lighting cable at gound level and hang the wood Computer room Honeywells near Olympia Graveyard - Chiswick - Just excavate off the border on common land donated and mixed with the crew, extras and so on ...... Niven would eat in the Connaught hotel and join the crew with coffee!
