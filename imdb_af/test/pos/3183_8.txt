After seeing the uncut version, I thought this movie was beautiful. It caught my attention from start to finish; the tension has been transferred wonderfully. Nasaan Ka Man depicts the typical Philippine family with accuracy in presenting secrets and lies. Even the religious culture, the human tendency to stop acting and maintain a pure reputation, are shown with the vivid liveliness of Gloria Diaz's character. There is no small scene in this film that does not have a purpose - cinematography is excellent and the writer brilliant. <br /> <br /> Although the plot is great, I personally found that the turn at the end, the Revelation to do with Jericho's character, was not as much of a shock as it should be. But then it might just be me because otherwise Nasaan Ka Man is a very clever movie. <br /> <br /> The casting was good to start with, but Deither and Claudine's scene was the icing on the cake. Not one to miss if you are looking for a Filipino movie that will surprise and surpass expectations. Thumbs up to the director.
