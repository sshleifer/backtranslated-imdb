You can say this is the first presentation of the Director (who also wrote it), but you can also see the potential this man has. This is a naturally low budget film in the spirit of Boondock Saints. Of course, Boondock Sain Saints came out a few years after this, so you might consider it a diamond in need of some Polish. The acting was good. If you're looking for DeNiro or Michael Madsen in a crime drama, remember it's young guys and young men are trying to be criminals. They are not like "super cool" (tm) as some of the veterans are. I would have liked Justin Pagel (Joe - the main character) to see more movies - he was wonderful in this. Good movie - 3 stars out of 5.
