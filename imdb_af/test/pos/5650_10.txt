Fires on the Flats (1959) **** <br /> <br /> You don't see any more movies like this. 'Fire at the Level' is an incredible portrayal of the lives of the Japanese Imperial Army soldiers. Kon Ichikawa's masterpiece follows Tamura, a tuberculosis soldier while wandering around the Philippine landscape in the last year of the war. He is only sent to the hospital by his commander to be refused treatment and therefore he is sent back. His CO tells him to go back and if they refuse him again, his last command is to kill himself with his grenade. He is refused again, but meets a group of squatters sitting outside the hospital. The next day they were dropped by American troops and Tamura fled, preferring not to kill himself, and from there he went to Palompon from place to place. He discovers that some men eat human flesh to survive, while others trade so much tobacco than they can for whatever they can return. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with a silent sense of despair and devastation, with a hint of madness. Everyone we see is skin and legs, covered with dirt that carries torn and worn cloths. Ichikawa uses his camera to capture some beautiful shots of the destroyed landscape and the Japanese soldiers who run it. Kon Ichikawa was known in Japan for making many comedies and satires, and there are moments in Brande on the Plains that are bitterly Hilarious. Take, for example, a shot of what is apparently a dead man lying in a pool of water; a soldier walks and asks himself aloud as this is how they will all end, after which the man lifts his head out of the water and answers: "what was it?" and then his face falls even deeper into the puddle than before. Another hilarious sequence involves one man who gets some boots along the route. He took the boots and replaced them with his parents. Another man walks through and sees that pair of boots and puts on his old boots. The scene continues until Tamura finally finds the spot and examines the boots on the left without barely any tongue. He looks carefully on his own and on the ground, deciding that they are both capricious, removes his own and goes barefoot. The film is filled with incredible scenes, one after the other. Like Mizoguchi and Kurosawa, Ichikawa knew how to use his camera to paint beautiful and beautiful photos. There are many beautiful shots of men in barren empty plains surrounded by nothing but smoke in the air and death or dying bodies on the broken earth. There is another amazing scene where dozens of Japanese soldiers are trying to cross a mid-night through Yanks guarded path, which crawls on their hands and knees as the camera looks from above. <br /> <br /> The movie gets its name from the smoke columns rising from the fires on the plains seen by the movie. They represent the lives of the soldiers a little more ordinary; the lives of Japanese farmers who have house grains in the meal. However, their beacons of hope for normal life are in hostile hands. <br /> <br /> The movie had a stir in his day with his graphic content. There is a lot of emphasis on the abomination of war, not only with the enemy but within your ranks and yourself. Could Ichikawa's Fires on the Plains is an incredibly authentic and moving, and somewhat disturbing, portrait of the horror suffered by men among the lower ranks of the Imperial Army. Clint Eastwood's letters From Iwo Jima, while being a very good movie, are nowhere near the realization of the war depicted in Brande at the Level. (Eastwood is undoubtedly influenced by the film, claiming to be such a classic Japanese film buffalo.) Many war films show that war is hell through the eyes of the winners. In Brande on the Plains, we are shown that the war is even brighter if you are on the lost end. <br /> <br /> 4/4
