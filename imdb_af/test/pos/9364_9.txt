Crossfire is one of those films from the 1940s that cry for a remake, if for no other reason than it may be, it should be done as originally written. The story on which the film is based is about the death of a gay man. But anti-Semitism was definitely a hot topic in the days of World War II with the Holocaust fresh in everyone's mind. <br /> <br /> In the Lee Server biography of Robert Mitchum, Edward Dmytryk, the director was interviewed and said the film had never been made about a hate crime against gays. The Code was firmly in place. It could have been because Robert Ryan's character is such an equal opportunity fan of everything that deviates from his societal norms. <br /> <br /> Mitchum has no doubt been strictly in the movie. drive. Robert Young was thrown as the captain of Washington, DC, who caught the case and while Mitchum was second announced, he knew from the outset that the film belonged to Ryan. But he was RKO's new star by dint of his appearances in The Story Of GI Joe and Till The End of Time, so he was there for checkout insurance. Mitchum's part was as a sergeant and friend of the original suspect in the case, George Cooper. <br /> <br /> Crossfire is not a whodunit, although we do not see the crime, it becomes clear that Montgomery is the one. killing Sam Levene, the savage Jewish seller. And it becomes clear to Young and Mitchum that Ryan is almost as fast as it does to the audience. It just becomes an issue to get the evidence. <br /> <br /> Ryan earned one of several Oscar nominations, which won the film, his best supporting category. Although he lost Edmund Gwenn, the movie was Ryan's breakthrough role. Similarly, Gloria Grahame was nominated for a short part as a party girl for the best supporting actress, but she lost Celeste Holm for Gentleman's Agreement. In fact, Crossfire acted against the Lord's agreement and lost to the best photo and best director of Dmytryk to Elijah Kazan. This is the fifth best script nomination and Crossfire has been short on the 34th Street winner Miracle. <br /> <br /> Gloria Grahame also had her own problems on the set that poured off her personal life. She had great problems with her then husband, Stanley Clements, who was an abusive man. He hangs around the set and causes Ed Dmytryk a lot of trouble. Fortunately, Grahame's share was a small one. In fact, the entire film was shot in a typical RCO economy style over 20 days. <br /> <br /> Robert Young has a particularly fine scene with William Phipps, a young Tennessee kid in Mitchum and Ryan's outfit, constantly keeping Ryan busy. Young is most eloquent to talk about the corrosive nature of hatred and how it influenced his family as Irish Catholics who came in the potato famine years. It was one of Robert Young's best moments on the screen in his long career. <br /> <br /> Like a movie like Crossfire, it's time to come back as a story about an anti-gay hate crime. Especially with the real murder of Barry Winchell of the past decade and the debate on gays in the army. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that has arrived and is almost gone.
