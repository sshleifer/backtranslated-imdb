I read the book before watching the movie and it emotionally drained me, but I felt it had transported me to Afghanistan, a culture I know very little about. I had great hope for this movie and it didn't disappoint. I watched it with someone who didn't read the book and he also enjoyed it. They had to shorten a few things in the movie, but it was a well-educated and well-shot film. It reminds you of the movie long after it's over. You feel for the characters and their lottery. I recommend this movie to those who are emotionally draining drama and want to experience Afghan culture. There are some disturbing scenes that aren't suitable for kids to watch. It is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime.
