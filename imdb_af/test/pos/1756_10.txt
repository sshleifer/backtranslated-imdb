Hello again, I've been thinking of this movie all my life. I saw it when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles, California in 1942. What a wonderful story to be good to each other, kindness and love. You forget these are the errors that are related to each other. It was just as if they were people. I love this movie and so do my adult children. Such a beautiful color in this movie. I need to see this movie again. There is a story about an envelope in the movie, which I just can't remember the "why" of it. <br /> <br /> Thanks for listening.
