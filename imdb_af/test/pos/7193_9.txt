A great combination: - Chabat's humor - Uderzo / Goscinny world and characters - limited presence of Christian Clavier <br /> <br /> The original comics were great - one of the better of an overall grand series - and Alain Chabat , one of the funniest members of the famous French group Les Nuls, was able to film, repeat and supplement the great work done by goscinny and uder by cleverly enforcing the story and Djamel Debouze gives his best role (eventually a bit far from his usual repeatable part), a lot of good actors gathering (Gerard Darmon is wonderful, so often Chabat himself is a great Cesar). <br /> <br /> In addition, while being forced to hold Christian Clavier as Asterix, Chabat played his part in the movie to announce Darmon and Debouze. It's always a good idea! <br /> <br /> => Great environment, great scenario, good director, good actors, great humor, beautiful Cleopatra ... This movie would earn a 10 if Clavier didn't have bees involved.
