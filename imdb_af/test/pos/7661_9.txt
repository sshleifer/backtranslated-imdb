Hercules the Avenger is by far the best single entry in the muskleman genre that I can remember. The charge against what has been made by critics - it is a cut and paste of two previous Hercules films, with some new material to make it look fresh - misses the fact that this cut and paste approach is one of the central problems of the sword-and-sandal films. With most of these films, the middle third thing awful - which is usually a juicy love story or arcane political plot or both (queen falls in love with Hercules and her evil brother, against them, etc.). It's often hard to keep up to see the exciting finale. Hercules the Avenger cuts all the crap from the source films, adding a rather quick story of a Hercules mimic that is his way in power. (It should be noted that this episode also functions as an abominable but critical remark about the rise of fascism in Italy.) It also creates a fine final wrasslin match between the true Hercules and his imitator. <br /> <br /> In a smaller focus, I can also add that further editing borrowed improved individual scenes from the other movies. For my money, the mutiny scene here is much better than it first appeared in Hercules and the Captive Women, as it was stepped up with the reduction of various characters and their plot complications. <br /> <br /> There are also floppy monsters, creepy underworld atmosferics borrowed (literally) from Mario Bava, an entire city destroyed, and the usual amount of lovely babes in public dresses. As none of these films are expected to compete with The Seven Samurai - or even with The Magnificent Seven - it seems a bit fussy to keep the movie's loans from other films.
