This is the best work I've ever seen on television. The story is compelling - all the more so because it is true. The authors did their homework - the accuracy of the events is well documented. The acting is wonderful. It should be the best role Sam Waterston ever had. And the black and white cinematography was exceptional. My only regret is that it is not available to buy. A few years ago I contacted someone who was involved in the production (either PBS or England) and said they didn't plan to release it at VHS (then). It was a BBC production and ran on American Playhouse in America. There is such an interest in seeing it - just hard to believe that no one can make it available.
