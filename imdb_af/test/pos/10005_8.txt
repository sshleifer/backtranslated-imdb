Maybe I read it too much, but I wonder how much of a hand Hongsheng has in developing the movie. I mean, if a story is told that the main character is thrown like himself, I would think he would be a heavy hand, write, write, etc. And that will make it a bit biased. <br /> <br /> But. His family and friends also had the chance to get the real details about Hongsheng's life. I think the best views would be interpreted by Hongsheng's family and friends' perspectives. They saw his transformation and were not so wasted on drugs that they remember everything. <br /> <br /> As if Hongsheng is full of himself, the consequences of the Jesus Christ present him as a martyr who is his Life (metaphorically, of course, he is still alive as he is thrown to himself) for his family's happiness. Huh? <br /> <br /> The viewer sees him at its lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex. He lies on the grass that comes from him (during?) A height and with his father he considers life and he has visions of dragons at his window, he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle as he extends his arms, she head to the side. <br /> <br /> It's great that he's now a drug, but he's not a hero. He's been a highlight in his career to respond at his most vulnerable point while returning drugs somewhere in the middle. <br /> <br /> This same device is used in Ted Demme's "Blow" where the audience empathizes with the main character shown as a defective hero. <br /> <br /> But, "Quitting" ("Zuotian") is a recommended movie, mostly for the ghostly soundtrack, excellent acting and landscapes. But the best part is the feeling one gets as we assume to be home to Jia Hongsheng, is actually a stage adjustment for a play. It makes the viewer feel as if Hongsheng's life was just a play that was told in very difficult parts.
