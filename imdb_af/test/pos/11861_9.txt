Well, maybe this movie is not a revolution. But it's a very good entertainment, and it's Liv Tyler's variation of Alicia Silverstone's Clueless or Cameron Diaz. There's something about Mary. Liv plays a femme fatale who just wants an own home and all sorts of material comfort in it. And well, she does everything to just get it ... even crimes. Many crimes. And she drops every boyfriend who doesn't work to get these things. In addition, she didn't really mind having a few additional lovers next to her current boyfriend. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is even more fun to see if Liv is actually a star sign - and cancer is reported to be very domestic. So the character that Liv played here is actually a parody of a cancer! <br /> <br /> I was alone in the movie watching this one. It was pretty comfortable, because I could laugh as hard as I wanted all the time - but it also felt strange that no one was really interested in this movie. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed it. The acting was between very good and excellent, especially the main actors where brilliant. There are plenty of jokes, lots of blacks and good dialogues. <br /> <br /> It's a rubbish movie, and it's full of black humor. If you like these movies, try this one!
