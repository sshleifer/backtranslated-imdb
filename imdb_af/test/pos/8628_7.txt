For us, an Abbott and Costello movie is something you should be about. I am very glad I recorded it - my wife remembered it when she was young, but I have never seen it before. The family wanted to see something that wasn't too serious for the bed and it was chosen. <br /> <br /> Our daughter has watched many of the old movies with us - always complaining in the beginning, but usually comes around. She initially ignored it, preferring to verify her email, but she started enjoying herself - often laughing out loud for the zaniness. <br /> <br /> It's great to think you can have a fun night with a 55 year old. The mono-color introduction that blends into the colorful fairy tale. It's a fun twist of a story everyone is familiar with, including a small song and a little dance, along with everything you and Lou expect to deliver. <br /> <br /> Watch it with your kids and have a great evening!
