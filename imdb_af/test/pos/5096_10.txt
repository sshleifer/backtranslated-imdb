"Chips" is an excellent mix of music, light comedy and drama with a perfect picture of Peter O 'Toole and effortlessly romantic supporting performance by Petula Clark. O 'Toole is able to show the shy, unrelenting teacher who wants so much to love his students and can only express his love when married to Katherine (Clark). She brings him the world "What a lot of flowers" and he is changing forever. He became Brookfield's beloved head by the tragedy, but knew that he could only achieve his purpose through Katherine's love. The songs (with the exception of the Music Hall number) are all "thought songs" that stem from character's emotions and thoughts, and the more you listen, the more beautiful they become - "Walk the world with me" and " Me and you". O'Toole's best moment is the final speech he gave to the students (that was the reason for the Oscar nomination). As a teacher, we question what "book" ever teaches - but, as Chips says, we have taught them how to behave and that is what really counts. Beautifully filmed, perfectly orchestrated by John Williams and one of the most moving films about love and how it can change you. "Did I fill the world with love?" The boys sing their school song. By the end, Chips realized he could do it - just because Catherine was there.
