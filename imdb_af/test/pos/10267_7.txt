As with FOOTPRINTS (1975), I accidentally became aware of this one: it was mentioned in a review by THE LIBERTINE (1969), which I investigated when the film appeared on Italian television Italian. ear; Incidentally, I missed the show by THE LIBERTINE (although I got it later on the same channel), but saw the movie through a rental of the R1 DVD in England during the departure in Hollywood in late 2005. / early 2006. In light of the enthusiastic reviews for that, I was put in the LIBERTINE. It was too light-hearted in nature, because it was essentially a serious theme (the sado-masochistic relationship between a young couple)! To be honest, I was very scared that the WOMAN WOMAN would go exactly the same route ... but later officially redeemed by a bad (if not exactly unpredictable) final turn. <br /> <br /> The film covers the free-standing social attitudes and brilliant creative arts that occur in this era: a leading philanthropist (Philippe Leroy) invites a female journalist (Dagmar Lassander) into his fashion house for the weekend. However, it appears that he is a misogynist who deceives all members of the opposite sex and rather dominates them (or even kills them)! Therefore, for the first half of the story, we see the heroine enduring pain and humiliation at Leroy's hands (including being forced to make a dummy in his own image!) Until the tables have turned subtly but indifferently: She not only frees him from his control, but teaches him that Man and Woman can live harmoniously - except that Lassander also follows her own personal agenda !! <br /> <br /> The clues are thrown perfectly, and the movie itself is often darkly comical for those in the mood; In addition, it is greatly affected by a typical bustling Euro-Cult score (from the trusted Stelvio Cipriani) and the imaginative - even outre-look (the giant structure depicting the lower part of the female shape, with a steel drop where His sexual organ should be, seems to come from Freud: incidentally, this strut has prominently been in stills I've seen before from the BELIEVE WOMAN ... but it's hardly registered in the movie!). Other bizarre attacks include the preposterous radio program "Sexual Aberrations And The Stars", and an idyll at a castle of Leroy's family, with a secret passage through the wardrobe and a dwarf man. One of the highlights is easily Lassander's erotic dance, virtually in the nude - an episode that actually reflects Leroy's humanization; Finally, the two characters have a 'showdown' in the latter's pool - amusing a Spaghetti Western-type theme! <br /> <br /> In the long run, for all its style, the film is considered inferior to the similar but much more extreme eternal Japanese masterpiece by Yasuzo Masumura BLIND BEAST (1969). Finally, it is noteworthy that the US CLEAR WOMAN was distributed by filmmaker Radley Metzger's company Audubon Films; He will even use his production designer (Enrico Sabbatini) for his own CAMILLE 2000 (1969)! To go to the issue I watched: apart from the usual shortcomings in the English dubbing department, the presentation was further devastated here by a rather flabby look and short cases of distracting excessive noise on the soundtrack! Incidentally, there is some confusion about the movie's hard time: the length provided on different sources ranges from 84 to 108 minutes. All I can say is that the copy I own ran for 87 minutes. !
