I know it was a goofy movie, but I really enjoyed it. This is one of the experiences that makes me smile when someone says "Bill Murray". I almost always like movies that involve the underdog, and this movie has more underdogs than you can count. It is generally a good movie - some of the adults are not tightly wrapped, but rather laughter rather than cruel like so many teenage movies. The rich kids over the lake are beating, but nobody knows me at all. I never went to the camp, but I did things that were somewhat parallel and most of the "little" and tricks came true. They were sometimes underestimated, but I'm sure it was an accident. The role play did well, with Bill Murray pointing to what he would become. It's not Groundhog Day or Broken Flowers, but hey, a good goofy laugh must be appreciated these days, but then ... it doesn't matter ................. ..............
