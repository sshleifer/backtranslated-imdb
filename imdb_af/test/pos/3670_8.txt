Yes, sometimes "Unconditional Love" becomes overwhelming because it stops - no, as it ricochets - from one story element to another in the most unconventional use of thematic elements and characters. In fact, it was only when I watched the movie for the second time that I began to understand what I think P.J. Hogan would have tried to deal with this strange, unconventional movie. Perhaps the whole movie itself is a metaphor for the unconditional love that Grace (Kathy Bates) desires and describes in the later part of the film. Grace insists that unconditional love is the same, without condition and without qualification. That's why I looked again at "Unconditional Love". I laughed a lot more than I did the first time, I became more involved with the characters, I began to understand, sometimes absurd turns needed the story. The performances are often at the top, but no more than they need to fit Hogan's strange and shaky vision, a vision that has led me to tears, desires, and outbursts of silvery laughs. Yes, Hogan asks a lot about his audience. But I came to really love his movie - unconditionally.
