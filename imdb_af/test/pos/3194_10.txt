I'm a new convert you can say so well. I borrowed the DVDs from my local library. I was interested in samurai since I watched 'The Last Samurai'. "My dad told me he was waiting for Shintaro when he was a child. He said it was pretty good. We are in series 3. I absolutely love it. It takes a little while to get used to the crazy English voices about the Japanese speaking characters, but I really enjoy it all. It is a bit strange to watch the light pauses when the ninja stars are thrown onto characters and stomp them into a tree or wall. I wasn't used to it, but I'm now. But I think it's the technology they had in the 60's. I have noticed that Shintaro is friendly, willing to help the needy, he is very humble, most of the time he does not like himself (he only says he is better than the enemy ninja). I admire Shintaro for these qualities. It is very interesting to watch the sword maker who has Koichi Ose. It is wonderful. This series is for anyone interested in samurai.
