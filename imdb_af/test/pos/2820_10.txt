I'm not usually in the dark / psychological stress type stuff. However, SEIZING ME is really a wonderful piece of work. The story, acting, filming, psychological themes, erotic quality and spiritual understanding are all really complex and compelling. Rose really plays the complexities and shifts of a psychologically disturbed woman very accurately. My partner was particularly impressed with the sophisticated way the power exchange problems were handled. It was so intense for us to see that we left immediately, three quarters by "getting tea" and I was forced to shower. The story was tempting, but we couldn't handle the energy in one straight shot. (It delves into the eager and grim side of people, but doesn't leave you there). I have long thought of the characters and deeper meanings. I would highly recommend this one. Be prepared for an experience you don't expect.
