To do just a few movies with his life is the late Big Chris Farley. Farley died at the end of 1997 and will mostly be missed by his co-actor in Tommy Boy, David Spade. From the Police Academy Academy 4, Spade really did well with his career in movies. Tommy Boy is a classic and we will always remember Chris Farley when we see it. From appearing on Saturday NIGHT LIVE to do Tommy Boy, Black Sheep, Beverley Hills Ninja, Almost Heroes, Billy Madison and Dirty Work. I think Chris Farley had a short and successful career. Tommy Boy was the best in my case and I would look over and over and laugh the same way every time. Thanks Chris Farley.
