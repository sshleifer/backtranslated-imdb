With all the continent of Europe under his control, Hitler prepares for the last obstacle in his path before going to North America, Great Britain. With an overwhelming edge in the air, Goering's Luftwaffe seems unstoppable on paper. Once in the air, however, the RAF disrupts the paradigm by blowing the enemy out of the air at a rate of seven to one. The Battle of Britain is furious for over a year, as the island nation is bloodshed, but inflexible, giving significant time to their American allies to produce more weapons for the inevitable battle. <br /> <br /> Using more plays than the three previous documentaries in the Why We Fight series, the Battle of Britain has a more propaganda, such as making it feel dramatic (some with undeniable Warners) -music-score) scenes that are clearly visible to the image. In an ironic twist under the devastation of German air strikes, Beethoven's seventh symphony is used to emphasize the visual suffering. The story itself is one of the remarkable courage of a challenging nation who has refused to bow to the devastating attacks that are being inflicted by it until then an invincible war machine. This is the 20th century version of the 300 Spartans. <br /> <br /> There has been more extensive research and better search for commercial efforts made on this battle since this film, but the immediacy and motivation provided by Britain will always make it more valuable document from England during his "Finest Hour".
