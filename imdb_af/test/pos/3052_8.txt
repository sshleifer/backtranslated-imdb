Along with almost every Republic image ever made, it appears that Murder in the Music Hall has faded undeservedly into oblivion. A shame because this well-crafted, knowledgeable and written and clever mystery point boasts a seductive windy thriller against the introduction of Radio City Music Hall. A murder in one of the building's beautiful penthouse apartments reflects the nice Rockettes. Among them, Vera Ralston (who offers an attractive display of subtlety and vulnerability, offers some brilliant skating production numbers), Helen Walker, Ann Rutherford, Julie Bishop, and various other 40's B-movie stories. Long, blonde and attractive William Marshall (usually in musical movies) chases off the killer as the complex and increasingly creepy plot unfolds, against the heaviest settings you'll ever see in a movie noir. The end is so much of a surprise as this sad forgotten, classic murder mystery. Reverent recovery and revival on cable TV, VHS or DVD. Republic has sank a solid budget in this Grade A production, and "Murder in the Music Hall" is as smooth, unpleasant and incredibly enjoyable as any of the great studios of its era. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Notice the rhapsodic song composed by the victim before death. Then, try to get the one who makes the deadly melody amid the incessant conversations in their changing rooms. You will discover who the killer is just like William Marshall does. Great fun, the kind of movie they really no longer make, and what a loss - both for movies and actors.
