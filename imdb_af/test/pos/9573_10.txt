Functioning as a kind of hub between Waiting for Guffman and A Mighty Wind, 'Best in Show', shows a dog program and the various people who bring their dog friends to participate. Some are strange, some are crazy and otherwise, but everyone makes the movie good. Director Christopher Guest is especially funny as gay Harlan Pepper, who is keen to promote his dog. Eugene Levy, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Catherine O'Hara, and Bob Balaban also do good work (I can't think they're not doing good work, at least not in a Christopher Guest movie). As someone who has never attended a dog program, this movie is my main exposure to them. They certainly look neat.
