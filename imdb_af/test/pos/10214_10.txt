With some wonderful and wonderful characters, a new mythology, beautifully designed and executed sets, Nightbreed is a great movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the lack of well-known main actor leads to the film eclipse. <Br /> <br /> Perhaps the director's homosexuality also leads to the film being unknowingly censored by the white audience covering the film. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the movie is a treasure of the monster movie / superhero genre <br /> <br /> A sequel with Highlander style flashbacks to different periods in history would be interesting. <br /> <br /> Another idea will be the foundation of the new Midian. Maybe in Texas somewhere or the marshes of Lousiana with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus.
