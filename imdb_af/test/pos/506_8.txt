Leaves are a dark, gloomy but meaningful vampire movie and one of the best. A little gore, but nothing really that bad. Wesley Snipes played a strong role in eliminating the vampires. Not really like buffy, because it's too tame, but Blade delivers a decent plot and it's the kind of movie you'll probably want to watch on a dark stormy night .... it's best to watch! <br /> <br /> 87%
