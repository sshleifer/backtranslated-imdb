I can't believe people are giving bad reviews about this movie! I wonder why ... maybe because of the book ..... I have to admit, it doesn't really follow the book ... sure ... the book by dean koontz is much better. But the movie is good too! it has the tension ... the acting is good ... especially Michael Ironside, who gave a great play in this movie! <br /> <br /> Come one guy ... give this movie a chance. .. this is much more worse movie than this .... like sum of all fears ... fantasies ... the da vinci code ... these are some of the worse movie I've seen .. Really boring as compared to viewers who have really big elements in the movie ... this movie has a lot of tension and non-stop action !!! I'm looking for this movie ... but it's really hard to find on DVD ... <br /> <br /> at least ... I really recommended this movie to everyone ... watch it! !!! you will never regret <br /> <br /> 10/10 *
