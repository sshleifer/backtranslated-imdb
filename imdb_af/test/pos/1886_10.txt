It is screaming funny (well, except if Bruce is in the hospital scene, which is a bit sad). <br /> <br /> Ted Raimi and Stacy Keach are both excellent and worth watching. <br /> <br /> Sure, it's not a big budget beater that's controlled, but that's all it promises to be and more and VAT women are great in their parts, though I don't know of other movies, I'd love to see them again. <br /> <br /> The two-brain-walking scene is inspired and definitely a showcase for Bruce's outstanding physical comedy - he's one nice guy! <br /> <br /> Thank you Bruce, for your brain, it's your baby!
