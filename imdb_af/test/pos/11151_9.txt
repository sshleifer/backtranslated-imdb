From a bald description of the TOLL GATE's large platter elements, one might think it's a revisionist Western of the 60's or 70's. <br /> <br /> * Our hero is a robber, killer and arson; <br /> <br /> * The love interest is a single mother whose oblique husband has left her and their child; <br /> <br /> * twice, our criminal hero was "unofficially" released by authorities in exchange for some good deeds, and it is presented as a commendable act; <br /> <br /> * The only acts that are presented as really evil are the betrayal of one's family and the betrayal of a criminal; <br /> <br /> * the hero tries straight, but returns to a life of crime after he can't find work; <br /> <br /> * The hero is in the running of both sheriff's posts and a criminal gang; <br /> <br /> * The hero's final redemption is achieved by strangling a man with his bare hands and <br /> <br /> * and the good bad guy ends the movie by the young mother and her sending a child back to civilization and driving alone into the Mexican desert, never (presumably) paying for his life of crime. <br /> <br /> It just goes to show you that there is nothing new under the sun. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Toll GATE does not show the cynicism or moral nihilism of its successors: the hero's salvation is set up when he survives to the post after reading a passage from the Bible. Can't really think that Clint Eastwood did it. <br /> <br /> The Toll Gate has an excellent movie by any standard and Hart was a very good actor, not given to the broad histrionics often used to convey emotion. for sound. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
