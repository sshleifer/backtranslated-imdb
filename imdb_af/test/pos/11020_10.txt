I like movies about impressive people. "One Flew About The Cuckoo's Nest" is perhaps my favorite time, so one might think I had an explosion with this one. It's certainly not one to see if you want to smile. This movie is unpredictable and intense. Some scenes are really scary, even after several views (because these kinds of things can really happen). It will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat for the whole ride. And after you see the end, if you're not deeply disturbed, look for a pulse. <br /> <br /> The acting was phenomenal. Marcy, with her rather extreme case of tourette's, moves from cute to terrifying, and sometimes it seems so out of control that she looks like the undead. Seth was also wonderful. The focus of the movie certainly does not fall as much on him as it does on Marcy, although he is the one who gets the most momentum as a thriving character. <br /> <br /> It's a classic love story with a few unconventional twists, and it's also my favorite love story next to "True Romance." There are two bad reviews on this, but one of the people who made such a review did not have his facts straight and did not allow to see the whole movie, while the other was just looking for Hollywood excitement without the deep characters (and perhaps a little thrown by the apparent flatness of the plot, as the end goal turns to steal a black bobbi head from a toy store). The point is that this movie is not for those who want to see "normal" or "light heart". This one is mess and indie as it can be, and will not allow you to go to the heavy climax.
