Real stories make the best stories, not them? There is always something nice about a story, whether it be novel or movie or whatever, simply by the fact that it is actually making the story more fascinating. This film is based on a true story of two young American men, one a state employee and a hawk enthusiast? Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton)? And the other? Andrew Daulton Lee (Sean Penn)? Is a drug dealer. These two started selling the government, mostly CIA, secret in 1975 to the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> The film focuses on the human aspect of the two men, as well as their growing personal problems (especially Penn's character with ever-worsening drug addiction), rather than glorifying their status as traitors to America. This would undoubtedly hurt the credibility of the US film. Boyce gradually becomes more cautious and eventually becomes frustrated and paranoid, as their relationships survive and dig deeper into the treacherous area. Daulton becomes more dependent and addicted to cocaine and heroin as he becomes more frightened and desperate to maintain control over a situation over which he has no control. In addition, he already has problems with the law. The torture of Boyce and Daulton's families because of the way they lead their lives is also well portrayed and adds to the idea that spying against the country's land, even if it is justified, only leads to big problems and the destruction of lives? including the deterioration of friendship and trust between the two main characters. <br /> <br /> Here's the outline: <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> - Hutton and Penn each conducted extensive research on the characters to determine their individual appearance capture so they are portrayed with extensive depth and realism. <br /> <br /> - The acting is excellent. <br /> <br /> - The atmosphere of paranoia builds fairly well. <br /> <br /> - The story is fascinating, and of course, if one based on actual events, it has an extra kick. <br /> <br /> --Nice steal. <br /> <br /> - The Soviets who work with the Boyce and Daulton are portrayed very well, and not stereotyped or angry, just to make them look bad. <br /> <br /> Don't Shoot It, Didn't Help: <br /> <br /> - The music is good, nothing is perfect. <br /> <br /> - Linking is sometimes a bit iffy ?? <br /> <br /> The bad: <br /> <br /> - Chris Boyce (Timothy Hutton) has a relationship with a woman we hardly know. Due to Boyce's problems with the US and Soviet government, her life can be endangered, but it has not been so extended because it feels it should have been. Lower problem, though. <br /> <br /> The Ugly: <br /> <br /> - The apparent simplicity needed to sell government secrets is a bit unnecessary. Nothing like a constant state of illegibility to make the masses feel as unsafe as possible. <br /> <br /> Memorable scene: <br /> <br /> - See the first CIA report that was accidentally sent to the wrong place with The reason being "rough night." <br /> <br /> It was another movie that suffered massive delays due to the controversial content of the story. Studios and producers have not seen a film about two American traitors ever accepted by American audiences. Fortunately, it is filmed and portrayed with a high degree of class and quality. Of course, does this mean that the treacherous antics are not heroically portrayed? More like some young men who made big mistakes in judgment in their lives. As such, it becomes a very human drama, and one has shown very well and very credibly. <br /> <br /> Acting: 9/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Cinema: 8/10 Character development: 9/10 Special effects / Makeup: 8/10 (small quantity, high quality) Necessity / Sexuality: 2/10 (one scene in a comic club) Violence / Gore: 7/10 Music: 7/10 Direction: 9/10 <br /> <br /> Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10 <br /> <br /> Overall: 8/10 <br /> <br /> If you love movies about spying and spies, then you can't go wrong here. Keeping dramatic movies with a strong focus on the humanity of the characters can also work for you. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> www.ResidentHazard.com
