With the obvious exception of Fools & Horses, it was, according to my David Jason's best series. <br /> <br /> Get straight to his TV debut on "Don't Set Up!" Not, these 13 episodes have not seen a mastery of comic timing since the old silent movie days. For comparison, Pap, Open All Hours and the horrible series 'Lucky Man' did not come close. <br /> <br /> I believe Jason has prohibited the series from being repeated, as it showed him at his rawestoon. Sorry for him. A new generation deserves to enjoy it. The series actually went into the ratings, but this is probably because it is shown against 'The Brothers' broadcast on the BBC at the same time, before video recorders were general. <br /> <br /> VAT, I just noticed that his long-suffering assistant, Spencer, was played by Mark Eden; Alan Bradley from Coronation Street. I'm surprised he didn't try to kill Edgar Briggs !!!!
