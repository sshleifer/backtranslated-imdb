I watched this movie on television as SCREAMERS and loved it. I heard an interesting story about this movie. When Roger Corman released it in the summer of 1981, his trailer sent an advance ship that wasn't really out of the movie. Imagery of a naked woman is allegedly being rushed around a laboratory by a monster. When opening the movie at the launch, the irregular clients complained that they didn't see the movie they paid to watch. Theater owners mentioned Corman and said their clients had cut down. So, Corman had to copy copies of the footage and send the positive movie to theater owners to spy themselves into the movie. Since the footage was never part of the movie, it did not appear in any video, DVD or television broadcast. Has anyone ever seen this footage? Anyone who saw this movie during a driving in in the summer of 1981, remember it?
