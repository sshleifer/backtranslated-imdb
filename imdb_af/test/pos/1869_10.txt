I was a big fan of this series. Yesterday I watched it again on DVD. I was worried about laughing or not? But in a few episodes I laughed hysterically and some episodes were good. Riddle and Satish Shah are brilliant, while Swaroop Sampat is really bad, but I think she's getting the job done. Maybe a better actress was in her place. This series shows what good, clean comedy is. <br /> <br /> If this series were to fly in the current year, I would have given it 9/10. And to think that this series is almost 25 years old and the comedy is still good. I give it 10/10. I strongly recommend this series to watch DVD.
