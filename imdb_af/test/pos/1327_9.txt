I heard that the prosecutors were starting to walk down the first Oceans movie. I believe this is not the case (at least not for this movie). This movie is even better than the first movie! The original crew returned three years after they robbed Terry Benedict's casinos successfully. Now Benedict visits each of them and tells them personally to get the money back within two weeks. To do this, they need to do a few lifts in Europe to get the money. <br /> <br /> The acting is very good. The all-star cast exceeded expectations. Matt Damon, Brad Pitt and Catherine Zeta-Jones were probably the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> There are some confusing moments in this movie. But it doesn't matter, because there are only a few confusing moments. Anyway, this movie is made for innocent fun only. <br /> Overall, this is a great movie. I rate this movie 9/10.
