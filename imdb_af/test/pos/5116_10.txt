I love Ernest going to jail. This is one of my top 3 favorite Ernest movies. The other is Ernest Scared Stupid and Ernest Goes Camp. In this movie Ernest (Jim Varney) works as a bank guard for a bank, but he wants to be a bank clerk. Soon he will be appointed jury service, but will soon be in trouble when evil killer Felix Nash (Varney) also eliminates him and changes places with him! Soon Ernest is in jail and is forced to act like Nash, otherwise Nash will kill Charlotte Ernest's love interest. When they take Ernest to the electric chair and thinks he is Nash, he explodes so he gets windy to break out and leave and save Charlotte from the evil Nash! Filled with hilarious scenes and comics Ernest Goes to Jail is a movie that makes you laugh so hard! It still does me! Jim Varney was such a fantastic actor! He played a good job as well as good old and bad guy! Varney was like his Toy Story star, Tom Hanks. No matter what role they played their roles, memorabilia was one of the things Varney will remember forever! TEAR. Jim Varney 1949-2000. Thank you for bringing Ernest and other fantastic characters to life! 10 out of 10!
