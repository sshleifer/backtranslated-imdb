Uzumaki (it's Japanese for "spiral" or "vortex") is one of the most absurd movies I've ever watched. A village is obsessed and is largely consumed by the vortex pattern on some. Finger tips are cut off, people commit suicide in washing machines ... just wanted and crazy Japanese horror. Possibly as psychologically damaging as "The Ring". Generally not as scary as "The Eye", but the images in this are more sick than most of the things in "The Eye". And not as stingy as "The Untold Story" ... but that's not to say there's not a fair amount of blood and disintegration. Seriously, if you enjoy horror movies and especially Asian horror - you should list this movie with you. Some parts are a bit strange with the sound effects (the story is adapted from a manga comic and it shows), but it really does fit. Unlike some movies that are trying too hard to capture the original "House of the Dead", this one is perfect. The most original movie you'll see ... not just this year, but probably ever. Recommended!
