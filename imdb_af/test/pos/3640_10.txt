This movie, based on a true story by Gerrit Wolfaardt, is one of the best films I have seen at race relations in South Africa; a very good history lesson of the 80's unrest South Africa. I put it on the scale of American History X, as it depicts how a young man can be seduced by the Aramaic doctrine and how the "certain" segments of the Christian church have learned a false doctrine of race. justify an injustice. <br /> <br /> It's a strong message of forgiveness and redemption, one of the scarcity of films today. The violence was well done to show the seriousness of Gerrit's crimes and the greatness of his transformation. <br /> <br /> One word about Jan Ellis that Gerrit Wolfaardt played. He carries you through the darkness of Gerrit's beginnings to his enlightened transformation. He went to some dark places as an actor and was praised on his performance. <br /> <br /> Another notable performance was that of Mpho Lovinga who plays Moses Moremi, one of Gerrit's crimes. He was able to pull from some places of pain that really touched you when you looked at his performance. <br /> <br /> Very good movie to show the teens.
