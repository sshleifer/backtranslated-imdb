<br /> <br /> `` The Last Frontier '' is a superior western that survives many shortcomings around its story of trotters Jed (Victor Mature), Gus (James Whitmore) and Mongo (Pat Hogan) and their relationships with weave the army. especially Captain Riordon (Guy Madison), Colonel Marston (Robert Preston) and Corrina Marston, Colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft). Appointed as scouts after losing their supplies to the Indians, Jed, Gus and Mungo, adapted to live the "civilized" life within a fort on the edge of the "last border". Jed, who was raised by Gus, inspires both and looks at the "older" Gus and Mungo, and has a particularly difficult time getting busy with "civilization". His real problems begin after he is strongly attracted to Colonel's wife, Corrina. Colonel Marstonis, a reckless man who threatens everyone around him with his dreams of relentless victory over any opponent. Corrina, a woman suppressed by her station and responsible, loves her husband for what he can be and Jed for what he is. Trapped in the middle is Captain Riordon, a brave and similar man under his duty to the army, his strong friendship with Jed and his fear of the likely catastrophic consequences of the colonel's recklessness. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so interesting (as well as entertaining) is that the weaknesses and strengths of "The Last Frontier" are in most cases exactly the same elements (forget the undisputed title and dated music) <br> /> <br /> First, the script. Almost all the subplots (especially the reckless colonel) are better done elsewhere, but are rarely associated with such eccentricity. Just when you think you know what is going to happen next, take this one in a different direction. POSSIBLE SPOILER: The Last Frontier is a Production Code movie (back in the day the word 'virgin' was taboo). It is very surprising that the adulterous factor has been handled in such a mature, tolerant manner. I expected either Jed or the colonel's wife to reap some retribution for their sin. I was amazed and a little disappointed, the movie didn't exploit that expectation to make a less predictable end. <br /> <br /> Second, the decisive. Adult is at least ten years old to play the part of Jed, the unmarried innocent in the forest. "James Whitmore, who plays Gus, the man who raised Jed, is actually five years younger than Adult. Yet, Adult is very engaging, playing a character who is innocent of civilization, but is by no means stupid. There were several actors who played the role at the time (especially Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas), no one could have played better Jed. Preston (also adult's junior) plays Colonel Marston, lacks the tics and affections of such a driven Preston, however, endorsed the honor that someone in Marston had seen to promote such a reckless fool to Colonel's rank, while Bancroft's dark-haired hair was blunt and Bancroft's dark hair was dead. effect as for Winona Ryder ("Edward Scissorhands") and Christina Ricci ("Sleepy Hollow"), that is, I was confronted with the character without knowing exactly why; I believe the answer is that blondes and brunette are very different in skin color and oogskakerings has. Furthermore, Bancroft has always projected a toughness that borders on hardness (however, here the blonde hair is slightly softened). This enables 24-year-old Bancroft to face up to 40 with both 40-year-old Adult and 37-year-old Preston. Yes, she can be a colonel's wife. Madison balances Riordan, a complex role and sometimes a cumulative dialogue. A role similar to that of John Wayne in Fort Apache Madison does a more skilled job. <br /> <br /> This movie has a 'Silverado' type of companionship. It alone makes it worth seeing. It also has memorable performances, beautiful scenery and good action and direction. I just hope that a letterbox version is available (many are lost) because this movie is fully beneficial to the format.
