Well-made melodrama that tells the story of Sally, Tomboy dancer in the circus, by McGargle (played by WC Fields), of the top hat, little mustache, checkered pants and skill as juggler, bag and runner of carnival games like Three Card Monte and the Old Shell Game. McGargle raised Sally, who worshiped him as her "real dad" since Sally's mother (who was kicked out of her house by her father, a judge when she married a circus man) and left Sally orphaned. Sally is versatile and loyal to McGargle, whatever he gets. But McGargle looks a bit blame if he keeps her in the circus instead of her own family for years. When they finally act in a carnival in the town where her wealthy grandparents live, McGargle uses the opportunity to investigate Sally's true family, with the idea that he can restore her to them. But Grandpa, the judge immediately takes Sally off because he doesn't like a "show girl" - who is a strict, meticulous man, a real job the old one! And meanwhile, Sally is being pursued by a handsome and rich young man, the son of the man who helped to get grandpa his wealth. <br /> <br /> It's a very good movie with a few laughs here and there and some kind of a strange editing style (I don't know how to describe it, but it shows long shots, then jump it back a few seconds or suddenly change suddenly as a closeness is shown). Carol Dempster, who plays Sally, is great here - very cute and comical in her performance. W. Fields, even without his familiar voice, are very funny - just as he moves and his amusing, comical reactions to things (like a small dog seen in one funny scene), we even see him briefly in it. I love the few peeks at the old-fashioned circus and carnival shown here. The printing of this on the DVD appears on the DVD is very nice, with a light sepia tone shown, and the piano score for this is really excellent, performed by Philip Carli, based on the original pages.
