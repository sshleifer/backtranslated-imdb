Helen (Kate Capshaw) owns a bookshop in the sleepy coastal town of Loblolly by the Sea. Divorced, Helen has a young daughter who is camping for the summer, and gives her a little more freedom. Helen's shop worker is Janet (Ellen DeGeneres), a man-crazy village gossip with eyes for the beautiful fireman, George (Tom Selleck), and two young students, Jennifer (Julianne Nicholson) and Johnny Tom Everett Scott ). One day, Helen stumbles upon a romantic, gentle love letter and she suspects that Johnny wrote it to her. Clearly, for the wind, Helen and Johnny start a little thing. But the letter then landed in others' hands, including Janet's, who thought George had sent it to her, and Johnny's, who thought Helen had written it to him. And, going up and down the letter. But in truth, George may have eyes for Helen and Jennifer fell for Johnny. The town's museum curator can also have a secret love. Will things like this ever rectify themselves? This is a cute movie with beautiful surroundings and skilled stars. Each of the main actors gives a pleasant performance, including the addition of Blythe Danner and Gloria Stuart to those previously mentioned. Then the coastal landscape is also the most beautiful, the costumes are selected quite well, and the photography is very nice. There are a few surprises, including a subtle gay plot development that doesn't please all viewers. But for those who love romantic comedies, this one should be included on any list of good choices for the genre.
