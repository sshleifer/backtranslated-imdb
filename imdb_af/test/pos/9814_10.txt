In response to "Confusion", it appears that dog injuries suddenly disappear, but it can only be a mistake in continuity. But, as the kids are trying to build a plane out of junk, it's just a simple matter of imagination. They are two very young children who have extremely active imaginations and rely on the imaginations not to expose themselves to the reality of the level of abuse taking place in their home from their stepfather. As far as the stepfather is concerned, it is very interesting that the director chose not to show his face. It makes him look more monstrous. If you show his face, that character becomes a person and not just this "monster" that terrorizes the childhood of these two innocent children. By showing only the effects of his abuse and not focusing scenes on the abuse itself, the children become the main focus of the movie. This movie has no loose ends, but just like a father's story, he tells his children. It has decorations. It's a fine American classic.
