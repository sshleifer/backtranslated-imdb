I have never been interested in the past, although I love Shakespeare and have seen most of his plays and enthusiastically studied some at school. Something about this story and all the fuss about it seemed to me. I never played the harlot to see Hamlet, until I decided pretty recently I should at least try and look at it and I borrowed the Olivier version of the library. Well, I struggled with that. Olivier was too old, not only in his appearance, but also in his play. The play was cut to fit a more conventional film length and I think it should be missed too much, because I found it hard to concentrate on it, quickly got bored and touched it. I still think Olivier's Henry V is the best version I've seen of the exciting play. It acknowledges that I have not yet repented of the Beeb version and cannot remember how it was when it was first shown. <br /> <br /> I heard about the Branagh full-length version of Hamlet. Although I enjoyed her a lot of Ado, I think the Beeb version is much better and I wasn't quite impressed by his Henry V. But I was from Branagh a little after he saw his disappointing effort on a musical by Love's Labor's Lost what a play is I love and was made so well by the Beeb. <br /> <br /> Eventually I received the full Beeb Shakespeare recently on DVD. I soon repeated one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, Richard II, and was simply left by Jacobi in the show. It was immediately persuaded to watch his Hamlet next. . What a revelation this play is for me now! Yes, it's great, but I feel it needs an actor to think about playing Hamlet and it's Jacobi. Amazing. Striking to note that although he is older than I understand the character of Hamlet, it does not show while Olivier did. Now I know he is also in the Branagh version and has a lot to do with training Branagh, so I'll have to see what Jocobi does with Claudius! I'm interested to discover Jacobi has trained Branagh as yes, you can definitely see the influence. <br /> <br /> And now I'm going to see it again.
