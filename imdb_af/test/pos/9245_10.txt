Nice doco Stuie! <br /> <br /> Although it didn't work out how you wanted the original movie, you have a fantastic piece of work and good performance. <br /> <br /> It is obvious how much you put into it. <br /> <br /> This also applies to everyone. It's great to see the warts and all accounts of the process without being "too nice". <br /> <br /> Love it! Worth to see. <br /> <br /> Now, the author of the original movie can't appreciate what you've achieved. <br /> <br /> Also like the attitude. Big piece. Looking forward to the next job. <br /> <br /> Keep going! Paully
