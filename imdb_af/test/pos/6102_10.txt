Just watch this movie on TV and it was great. <br /> <br /> I was just planning to watch it while I was doing work, but I finally watched the whole movie without doing work because it was so good! <br /> <br /> Actors don't know very well, but the story line makes it right. the fact that the actors are making less known makes it just more credible that events can occur. I didn't feel a bias towards one character, because I have no opinion on the types of character, as I've never seen one of the actors in a movie, which made it even nicer. <br /> <br /> recommended to watch It.
