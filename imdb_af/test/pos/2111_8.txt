I had the privilege of being one of the Still photographers on the set of the "Grand Champion" and enjoying every minute of the 42 days I worked on the movie. I've been in the Photography business for 25 years and have worked at 16 movies and I can't think of a time when I enjoyed it. The Kids were great to work with and little Emma Roberts has so much energy that she is a real journey. She even grabbed one of my camera during the show and started shooting. Some of her images are used for PR. I could have made more money for a production with a bigger budget, but I doubt I would have had the fun and so many great actors and the great people of West Texas like me.
