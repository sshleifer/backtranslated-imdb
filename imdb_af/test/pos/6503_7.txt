This movie is mainly for those who have had little or no introduction to hip-hop, specifically turntables, as was the case with the director before starting this movie. It was cool to focus more on the bay than expected, because NY always gets credit, but comes out of the bay. The Q-Bert worship is a little out of control. This film did not introduce anything new to me, but it changed my mind when I thought about it. I was sketchy about the prospect of distinguishing the tables from a bona fide instrument. This movie should convince anyone it is right there with the viola and clapperboard.
