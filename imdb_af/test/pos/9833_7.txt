I admit that I've been a fan of Harrison Ford for years. So it didn't surprise me that I enjoyed his show here. But I also enjoyed how the storyline evolved and thought the casting was done well. I don't know if I buy Kristin Scott Thomas as a congresswoman, but she is a good actress and a beautiful woman. I noticed her in the first Mission Impossible. Although her part was small, she jammed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Here, her and Ford play people whose spouses are killed in a plane crash. They sit together, and that's where the plot comes. Apparently Ford, a police detective in Wash D.C., discovered that his wife had a relationship. He also discovered that the relationship with the New England Congresswoman was. <br /> <br /> The story takes a lot of subplots, because Ford and Thomas find themselves drawn together by revelations of their marriages, the deception of deceit and the pure sadness and wrath of the loss of a loved one. <br /> <br /> I think the movie is worth either renting or catching on the cable.
