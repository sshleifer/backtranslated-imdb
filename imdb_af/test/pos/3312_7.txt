Although dated, this movie is definitely worth a watch. I saw it about eight times as a teenager when it opened and it changed my life. I just had to live in New York. It has huge opening shots from the Manhattan skyline with Johnny Mathis making crowns. "Romance is still ... the best of all ..." competing West Side Story competitors. There is a rather stilted performance by the world's first-ever supermodel, Suzy Parker (sorry, Janice D.), but it's great! It also provides some insight into the late 1950's American mores - our obsession with (and suppression of) sex (in the workplace, no less!), Romance and female liberal marriage. It represents an era in which New York was at its best and a super-fine thing by Joan Crawford is just the icing on the cake.
