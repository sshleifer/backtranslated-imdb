Now before people start to have an outline of this movie (those who play rugby anyway) it's a movie! The Hollywood treatment is given to entertain people and therefore those who play rugby (myself included) naturally play holes in the choreography of the game in the movie. Overall, it is a decent movie and draws attention to the moral and ideas behind the game of rugby. <br /> <br /> The movie is based on a real team, a real coach and his job to help the children right. direction to be better people in the future, and also based on real people who played for the highland team. It's just a typical sports movie with a character that is wrong and eventually comes back on the right track through the rugby medium in the event. Is generally a good movie that is nice, but has errors in terms of portraying the game. However, as I said it was a film under Hollywood treatment.
