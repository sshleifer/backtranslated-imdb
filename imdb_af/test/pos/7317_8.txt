It is an early of the boys, but some may not be satisfied with this one like everyone else. I found it to be different from the average Stooge slap stick. It was more funny because it was jokes rather than the bat in the eye or bang. Look for a hilarious part when Larry grabs and sings Moe's stethoscope. Moe gives him a good slap. That part made me crack for a good ten minutes. Another hit for the Stooges.
