It's another jewel from Daniele Thompson's pen. In the same year (1999) she wrote and directed La Buche, the first of three author / director credits so far. Belle Maman is in the first place 'French' whatever it means, which of course is different for different people. The point of departure is simple: On the altar where he marries Mathilde Seigner, the groom, Vincent Lindon, gets his first look at her mother, Catherine Deneuve, and suffers from what the French call a coup that we face as love. know. In theory, the story is either 1) on the right and on the assumption that he has taken the wedding off, or else. 2) Just the beginning when he goes through the wedding and so stays lying until it's somehow resolved. Thompson is looking for # 2, but not without hitting us with the weird subplot, like Deneuve's cigar-lesbian mother Line Renaud (in real life, if anyone cares, Renaud is in a long-term relationship with Stephane Audran , co-stars here) and throws a brilliant set-up in a luxuriously appointed man's room at the wedding reception, which takes the form of a hilarious song-and-dance form. Relentless writer that she is Thompson also leaves the comedy with drama like the brilliant climate scene, where Vincent finally expresses his feelings for Deneuve at a family gathering while destroying the joint simultaneously. This is one to enjoy. Again and again.
