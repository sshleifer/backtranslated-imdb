If you're a fan of early Duke movies, this Lone Star Oldie is a good one. What more can you ask than Duke, Yak and Gabby. Very good ridin 'and shootin' !!! I found it surprising that Duke's singing voice was Bill Bradbury, who is none other than Bob Steele's twin brother. It was reported that Bob Steele was a high school classmate and friend of Duke, also a twin brother Bill could have been. Anyway, if you miss good, clean, early Western movies this one. We don't have to wonder about hidden meanings or finding out underlying themes. Just sit back, relax and enjoy a western movie of a simpler day and time. It calls entertainment people !!!
