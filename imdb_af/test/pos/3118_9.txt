For the first time in 1959 I saw this movie on TV again when I was eight. I knew nothing of westerners, but recognized Ben Johnson of the movie "Mighty Joe Young". What attracted me to "Wagon Master" was the great songs sung by the "Sons of the Pioneers". The film, made by Merian C. Cooper, was the first to order original music to suit the mood of a particular scene, creating the modern film soundtrack. Cooper hired Max Steiner to create the mood for his classic creation King Kong. Steiner will later win an Oscar for the theme "Gone With the Wind." Cooper was also the producer of "Mighty Joe Young." If you remember, music was important to the great monkey who will only respond to the sound of Stephan Foster's "Beautiful Dreamer". In 1947, Cooper would work with John Ford. "Wagon Master." From all Ford's well-known westerners, this one is my favorite who knows his brother Francis and a sullen Janes Arness.
