Maybe my score should be a 9, but the movie absolutely amazed me when I first watched and my last performance confirmed my initial conviction. Stylishly so, every scene has trimmed views, fantastic corners with a perfect soundtrack that accompanies them. <br /> <br /> Stay big, especially with Toni Servillo, collect it with one of the most beautiful and beautiful women in Olivia Magnani, and a fine plot and you'll see this little masterpiece over and over. <br /> <br /> Paulo Sorrentino's next film "L'Amico De Famiglia" will be eagerly awaited.
