This BBC series is excellent. I'm not a Paleontologist, but this series gives the best historical representation of dinosaurs I've ever seen. The 3D animation and animatronics are very good and let you believe you have traveled back in time. The BBC deserves a backbone for such a good series, as well as Tim Haines, who had to spend a lot of time airing this series.
