It was indeed a wonderful adaptation. I missed the first episode, so I unfortunately missed out on the relationship between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline. But when I looked the second and then the third installment, I was just blown away. I ordered the DVD less than a week later and couldn't wait to get it. I went straight out and brought the book. From the moment I opened it, I was addicted, I couldn't do it. I decided to complete the entire book before I dared to do it. I chose the book because it came within the characters' minds, you could completely understand where they came from and what was in the story. They missed a lot of adaptation, which was disappointing because the book is a masterpiece and I think they could have done so well if they could stretch it over a long period of time. But as I can only fit in a 3-hour slot, I think it was excellent. It brilliantly followed the main storyline. And the actors who entered as main characters were wonderful! The love making scene was beautifully beautiful. It was so soft and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be. I was totally blown away with both the book and the TV adaptation! I both loved Sarah Waters's previous novels and also found that the Tipping the Velvet adjustment is quite pleasant. But when I read and watched Fingersmith, I knew none of her previous novels / adaptations could beat it. Sarah Waters has surpassed herself this time! I recommend you look at this adjustment! If Tipping the Velvet wasn't your thing, don't let it sit. Vingersmid is a whole new ball game. It's a beautiful but dark, twisted story about love, greed and betrayal ... <br /> <br /> A MUST SEE!
