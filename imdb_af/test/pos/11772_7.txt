This is the kind of movie that can give you a nightmare. In addition, it's great fun. <br /> <br /> Hardware Wars is the only good spoof on Star Wars, other films like Spaceballs failed. This is the only good movie I have ever seen. It doesn't hurt Star Wars, it makes fun, and that's what spoofs are supposed to be.
