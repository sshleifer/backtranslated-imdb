I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it. What a movie. I'm in my 40's now and have 2 teenage girls and I want them to see this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music. <br /> <br /> I watched most of the stores selling both new and old movies, but didn't come across one. <br /> <br /> I bought some old movies like "Melody" in Hong Kong, which had quite a collection of old movies, but they didn't. <br /> <br /> I also look at the successor, Paul & Michelle. <br /> <br /> Can someone please tell me how to get a copy of the VHS or DVD or VCD. <br /> <br /> Many appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Thank you very much.
