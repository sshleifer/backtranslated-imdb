Cliche romance drama movie with a very simple plot but very good cinematography and script.The screenplay, director and acting was also good. The flow of the film is kind of manipulative to let the audience tear through the excellent love music and circumstances that work but later to the movie, let one feel raped in some way. Jones makes her character very memorable and lovely. A deeper story can really take this movie to a higher level, but still delivering the film for its genre. Only for hopeless romantics, great love story fans, great soap drama fans, 50 Cinemascope cinematography fans and protagonists ...
