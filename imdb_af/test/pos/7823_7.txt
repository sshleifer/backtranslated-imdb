This is made for TV movie by Hallmark. Hallmark has always made quality films that are family oriented. Just Desserts is a boy and girl who fall in love while working together. Two bakers competing for a $ 250,000 prize at a field of professional bakers. It's fun and light hearted. The desserts look good. The movie has a catchy, excited, small song played during the competition. I suppose this is a producer for the movie song by Roger Bellon. Too bad there is no soundtrack available. I'd like to get a copy of the song. I don't even know the name of the song, because the credits are pasted at the end of the movie to make room for hundreds of promotions. Anyway, the throw is great. It is always nice to see Brenda Vaccaro. She is very bubbly and optimistic. Lauren Holly is always a plus and Costas Mandylor looks good guys with a great show. Professional chef Wolfgang Puck has a guest look. The movie is worth watching.
