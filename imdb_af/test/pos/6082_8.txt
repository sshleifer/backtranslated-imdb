One of the most charming and at least the most powerful elements of Anthony Minghella's enchanting Best Picture Winner, The English Patient, was in the mid-90s when Hollywood was in the beginning to lose its nerve for Big New Projects, a movie was created that brought back tracks. Many powerful traces of the cute majesty made by movies like "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962) and "The Ten Commandments" (1956). "The English Patient" contains a lot of what made the films so powerful. It has that glorious feel, a stretched run, which doesn't look like long, and fascinating characters with past and stories. <br /> <br /> "The English Patient", based on a novel by the same name by Michael Ondaatje, is like "The Godfather: Part II" (1974) in the way it was built. It is a blend of two stories: the past and present and it all revolves around the titular character: an English patient in the years of World War II. Ralph Fiennes plays the English patient, who has been hit by a plane crash for life and is cared for by a single nurse in an isolated church, played Juliette Binoche wonderfully. In addition to the conciseness with her raspy, hidden patient, Binoche comes across his past as a stranger (Willem Dafoe) arrives and the two men know each other. <br /> <br /> It's just one of two beautifully crafted stories that make up this movie. The other one said in the jump, the patient's past, before he died scarce and dead in a bed. The story of the present is mixed with the patient's past and his love affair that has changed his life forever. <br /> <br /> Being blunt, "The English Patient" is a love story that blends with an exciting epic sensation and blends it nicely. What I really admired about the love story between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas was how passionate, how obsessive, how charming it was on the screen. Usually in love stories, such as Minghella's later "Cold Mountain" (2003), the romantic elements look much more desirable to me than obsessive. Some of the love stories contain elements that are more likely to associate more with love than love, but still because it develops so well and is not rushed and is not exploited out of proportion, we can believe there is a certain true love between these characters. It reminded me a lot of Vertigo (1958) how well the filmmakers and artists convinced us were two real people who really fell in love with each other. <br /> <br /> Performances everywhere were wonderful. . I was especially surprised by Juliette Binoche's performance, which took the Oscar for her performance the following year. I also liked Willem Dafoe who plays the kind of cynical, dubious character he always plays in the game. And of course I can't leave Fiennes and Scott Thomas and their portrayals of two very passionate lovers. <br /> <br /> Despite my tremendous enthusiasm for this epic, I would be dishonest if I made it a perfect movie. There are two mistakes I can't see. Number one, it's a bit too long and the reason is my second complaint, there are some unnecessary subplots. I was not intrigued or particularly interested in the second love story between Binoche and a bomb specialist who was played by Naveen Andrews. My research has led me to assume that this plural element comes from the original book and I'm sure it worked perfectly in it, but in the movie it just looks a little bit? Distracting and the relationship between the two characters did not fascinate me. I was much more interested in the character of Fiennes and his relationships with his two leading actresses. <br /> <br /> However, these two errors are easily forgiven, even though they are doing slow things. Those who put aside, "The English Patient" is an extraordinary achievement of films. For me it was kind of a bad mix between "Casablanca" (1942) and "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), two remarkable and better films, and this effective blend was worth it. It's a pity that Anthony Minghella left us. Because he was a really talented filmmaker. That's all the evidence anyone needs.
