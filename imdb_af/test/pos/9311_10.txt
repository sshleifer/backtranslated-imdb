It was a very funny, fast-paced movie. I watched it more than once and rent me to show others. I would like to take this opportunity to ask someone in the knowledge, how do HK producers choose their authors? I'm very curious. Please recommend me. <br /> <br /> Again, to return to review, it is a very cinematic movie with lots of content, subtleties reminiscent of the classic but full of slapstick. The memory of the Mexican comedies of Cantinflas. <br /> <br /> The film does not disappoint the fans of the director, who noticed that he explicitly chose Chinese themes, and seldom tried to be investigated. The director's entire collection is a way to look within culture in a disarming way. <br /> <br /> And I don't see how his funny girl in Chinese Festival can be covered.
