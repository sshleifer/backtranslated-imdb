The only way to understand and understand the characters in this movie is to experience the situations themselves. For many, this movie is almost mock-bio, a kind of snapshot of one weekend in our lives. (I did about 85 percent of things in this movie and saw the other 15 percent, usually all the same weekend). For me and others I know it's nice to look back at this movie because, unlike some pictures of people we kind of remember and nights are shivering and blurring, this movie is our generations "Studio 54", a piece to add to our scrapbooks to look back and smile. Personally, I'm glad the days are over, but it's great to watch this movie and say, "I remember when ........." Thanks Justin for making this one-week mock biography in my life.
