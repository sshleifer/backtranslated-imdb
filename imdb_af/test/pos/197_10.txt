This movie has won a special award in Cannes for his acting and it's not hard to see why. (A few spoilers - but for the end you should see the movie!) A simple story - in Moscow on the eve of the war between Russia and Germany in WWII Veronika (Tatiana Samoilova) is in love with Boris (Aleksei Batalov) but they have a spit when she learns that he has been in the army. Boris left before Veronika told him she loved him. Boris was shot, but his ultimate fate remains unknown to Veronika or his family. Mark, Boris's cousin, rapes Veronika who feels compelled to marry him. Veronika and humiliated by the cowardly Mark, Veronika cling to the hope that Boris will ever return. Wonderful camera work and wonderful pieces by director Kalatozov. (For anyone interested in movie technique, another movie is from Kalatozov, I AM CUBA, at least two fantastic pieces - one of them a long track record that begins with a funeral procession through the streets of Havana, two stories rise a cigar factory, traces all the window and follows the procession along a long, long avenue - all without a cut.) Excellent performance, especially by Samoilova and Vasili Merkuryev (as Boris's uncle), which is becoming increasingly understatement made. A devastating romantic movie with a passionate show by Samoilova. (This movie is often linked to the other Russian classic Ballad Of A Soldier.)
