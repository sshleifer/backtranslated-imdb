Despite the fact that there were aspects of this movie that I felt were not developed enough, I enjoyed it and recommended it to others. Richard Gere and Diane Lane are big in their lead roles. The basic premise of the film is that both were in the aftermath of broken marriages when they met. Both are also looking for healing. Unexpectedly, they find that they can heal each other. There were aspects of the movie I wanted me to play more - where simple flashes suggested only themes that my mind had to fill in the spaces, such as the apology for the deprived widower and how Adrienne felt feeling guilty of having Paul slept to feel quick. An opportunity for a tremendous love show is lost when it is only suggested that they make love with the hurricane. But in the end, the film really appreciated me from the relationship my wife and I share. And there were moments that moved me to the edge of tears. So, I have to say it's worth watching.
