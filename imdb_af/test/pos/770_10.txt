After watching the Harry Potter movies, I was a fan of three actors Rupert Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson. However, we wait to see if they are going to do other projects, except for the same year or two years of the J.K. Rowling series. Mainly instead of a trio, the cameras and magazine articles focus more on Daniel and Emma, ​​namely that they are the leading male and only leading woman in the saga leaving Rupert's death career. No matter, every actor has a time to shine and Rupert's light hits him once in this movie. <br /> <br /> "Drive Lessons" is called the Harold and Maude of this generation with Rupert Grint playing Ben's role. Marshall, a young British boy living with his dominant mother (Laura Linney) and a lash of a pastor father, for whom he wants a job in the summer, but can't find work while writing his management tests (and failed) and writes poetry for a young girl who has no interest in him. <br /> <br /> Ben is looking for an ad in a church newspaper where work is needed to care for an elderly lady. He takes the job and realizes that he is a surprise surprise, like Evie (Julie Walters, Rupert's mother in the Harry Potter series), an actress who is also a poet who gives Ben the run for his money. They connect and tell each other secrets with Evie acting like a child and getting in the accident where she dragged Ben for a trip in the countryside. Not only do they drive Ben from Britain to Scotland, as Evie has to report to a local library, but at the same time an older woman falls for the young man in which Ben starts to become a man. <br /> <There is an accident and at the same time staying with Ben and Evie with the fact that I was very happy about the movie when it came to the theaters and I was impressed with Rupert Grint's play, especially if he was the rest of the world that even brings him a little bit of Ron Weasley in Ben Marshall, there is not the actor on his brilliant performance to stop.
