Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid movie in all respects. Everything from the scene to cinematography was solid. Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there was nothing you couldn't see. Maybe it's a bit melodramatic on points, but again, a pretty decent movie. Definitely worth checking out. If you have any doubts about which movie to rent this weekend, give it a go. Although you may not like to walk out and buy it, I found it to be reasonable.
