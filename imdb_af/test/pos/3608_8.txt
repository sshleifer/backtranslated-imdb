In fact, I went to see this movie just because Nicolas Cage is my favorite actor. People may disagree, but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies. I haven't seen a movie with Penelope Crus yet, so I was anxious to see if she was a good actress. So here's what I think: <br /> <br /> The movie is good (but I didn't read the novel). Some moments were very exciting and ... unexpected. Overall, you find the plot quite simple. So, the only thing that can save the movie, which an experienced viewer will know from the beginning, will either end tragically or happily, was the performance of both Cage and Crus. And this was GREAT, GREAT, GREAT !!! In the last part of the film I even have a fairly broad accent of the actress (Spanish, but for those who do not speak Greek, that is OK, and she even looks like a Greek girl). Overall, the movie is very enjoyable and has a great deal of irony (classical music fans will definitely have fun in a few moments :) <br /> <br /> I give it 9/10. You have to see it!
