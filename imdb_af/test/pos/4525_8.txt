"New York murder" is fun, but not as good as most of the other Fox chances. This movie would be better known, "Charlie Chan in New York", the movie's work title. It's Toler's chance to play Chan in the Big Apple. There is a lot to do here, but also the guest star Shemp Howard of the Three Stooges. <br /> <br /> It has one of my favorite Chan words, "Accidentally like ancient egg, leave unpleasant odor." Tolerant and Yung is good in this one and so is the supporting role. But there is little or no mysterious atmosphere I am looking for in these movies. Yet it is good to see.
