Ghoulies 4 is a nice ghoulish successor. The ghoulies look very different from the first three ghoulies, but there is still cool. There are some nice flashbacks, from Ghoulies' first movie. Jonathan is back in this one. However, he was not in parts 2 or 3. The movie is sometimes a low budget, but fun to watch. You have Tony Cox as the Dark Ghoulie and Arturo Gil as the Light Ghoulie. The ghoulies in this movie are actually good guys, instead of angry as in the first three movies. Both Ghoulies are pretty funny characters in the movie. Then you have the very hot Alexandra! It's a big dark comedy and funny! Any fan of the ghoulies movies will enjoy watching Ghoulies 4. The DVD finally comes out of this July 2007! Hopefully one day Ghoulies III will be on DVD in the US. One day I also want to see a sequel to this movie. I doubt if this will happen. It's 2007 now and no sign of a successor. If there is ever a successor, I hope Jim Wynorski will do it. <br /> <br /> I give Ghoulies IV a 9/10
