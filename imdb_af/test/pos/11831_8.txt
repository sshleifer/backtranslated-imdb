This early Warner Brothers talkie "Son of the Gods" (1930) deals with the racial intolerance shown by Anglo-Saxon Americans to the Chinese. Chinese-Americans are treated like second-class citizens, and whites keep in nothing but contempt. <br /> <br /> Prolific scenario Bradley King based her script on Rex Beach's novel about a young, impressive Chinaman, Sam Lee (Richard Barthelmess of "Only Angels Have Wings"), who experiences first-hand racial prejudice when the girls bringing his college chums for a party, revealing their racist sentiments about Sam as soon as they learn about his inheritance. Sam goes to his father, Lee Ying (E. Alyn Warren of "Gone With the Wind"), who is a wealthy Chinaman with offices, not only in New York but also in San Francisco. Sam is deeply hurt by racial riots and he wants to leave New York and go where he can't be injured by Americans. His patient father warns him that racism is a fact of everyday life and the only solution to racism is tolerance. Sam still taught this lesson. He refuses to take more money from his father and catch a ship to London, England, while on board. <br /> <br /> During the trip, he met a British playwright, Bathurst (Claude King or "Arrowsmith"), who needed help writing a play about the Chinese. Sam and he make a friendship and Sam provides him with cultural information about Asians. As they relax in France, Sam meets a beautiful young woman, Allana Wagner (Constance Bennett of "Two-Faced Woman"), who falls in love with him. It seems that Allana and her affluent father are on holiday in the same motel. Everyone at the motel knows that Sam is a Chinaman, with the exception of Allana. Feeling about his racial heritage, Sam Allana keeps her arm length until she convinces him that nothing about her can change him. They fall in love together in love. Allana's dad drops the bomb when he reveals that Sam is a Chinaman and all the memories of life in San Francisco and dealing with coolies flooding Allana's mind. She storms into the dining room at the motel and throws Sam along with a rowing crop in front of a chick room. <br /> <br /> Of course Sam is terribly devastated by this turnaround of events. He thought Allana loved him, but she didn't. Over this time, Sam's father, Lee Ying, tragically ill and Ying's secretary of sorts, Eileen (Mildred Van Dorn of Iron Man), sent Sam a telegram about Ying's disease. Predictably, Sam rushes to New York to be at his father's side. Since his public humiliation, Sam has promised not to love Anglo-Saxon Americans; Eileen is an Irish Catholic and probably one of his few white friends. Lee Ying dies and Sam takes control of the business and he exercises his anti-white racism until he learns that he was an Anglo-Saxon founder member who has given a San Francisco police officer to lend to Lee Ying and his wife. give. The police forgot it until two white busy social workers wanted to take Sam away from the Yings. Sam learns this revelation about the same time Allana comes to New York and gets sick. During her illness, she repeatedly expressed herself in her sleep and her devoted father went to see Sam and requested that Sam visit her to help her recover. Unbeknownst to Allana, Sam visits her and she improves, but she has no memory of his visit, but a disgusting idea. Eventually, Allana learns the truth that Sam is not a Chinaman and they always and happily marry. <br /> <br /> This socially conscientious Warner Brothers / First National Pictures Release is honest and unwavering with the first-hour or out-of-the-road race before the revelation that Sam has no Chinese blood in his veins, touches him the audience surprised. The reconciliation between Allana and Sam expands credibility, despite their confident love for each other. But in the name of a happy ending that will erase all the negativity that came before them, they find each other's arms. <br /> <br /> The epitome of the race issue with the revelation that Sam is not Chinese damages some of the film's moral power. Incredible, "Son of the Gods" is a Pre-Code movie that looks almost pure; For example, Sam is an American, not Chinese! Constance Bennett gives a great performance as a petulant beautifies and she keeps your attention when she swings Sam with her riding crop. Claude King is good as Bathurst, and E. Alyn Warren is convincing as Lee Ying. Interestingly, Warren had a career to portray Asian characters. Richard Barthelmess is flawless like Sam; He is delivering a highly nuanced performance. Despite his age, "Son of the gods" is a boy of a good movie!
