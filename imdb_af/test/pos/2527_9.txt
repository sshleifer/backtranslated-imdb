This is probably the best movie by director Hector Babenco. It shows a Brazilian reality unknown to foreigners, which is the same reality as all Latin American countries, poverty and survival instinct. Most affected in this reality is that the children are usually left orphaned or abandoned by their poor parents, making it into a "dog food" community, often in the rift of delinquency, prostitution and crime. Well done and with a "no frills" approach, this movie will come to you, Big story plot, have a movie on anyone's collection. The leading role went to Fernando Ramos da Silva, a young boy who fell into the crime wave, killed a few years later during a robbery. I would suggest people to watch the movie "Who killed Pixote?" so you can have a more in-depth idea of ​​the lives of these characters. Some other characters from the movie had a similar fate, some died and others were in jail. Nevertheless, this movie will last in your memory long ago
