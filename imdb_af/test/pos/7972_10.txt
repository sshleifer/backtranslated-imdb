"Hell to pay" counts itself as the rebirth of the Classical Western ... it succeeds as a Western genre movie that the whole family could see and not the movies that baby boomers experienced decades ago. The good guys are good and the bad guys are really bad! . Above Svenson, Stella Stevens, Lee Majors, Andrew Prine (excellent in this movie) Tim Thomerson and James Drury are all fantastic and it's nice to see them again. James Drury really shines in this one, perhaps even better than his days as "The Virginian." In a way, "Hell to pay", reminds me of those movies in the 60's where actors you know of so many performances make an appearance. If you are of a certain age, Buck Taylor, Peter Brown and Denny Miller and William Smith offer a "wow" factor, we can rarely see these icons these days. "Hell to pay" features screen legends along with newer names in Hollywood. The most remarkable feature of the "Newbies" movie is Rachel Kimsey (Rebekah), whom I have seen recently on "The Young and The Restless" and Kevin Kazakoff, who plays Kirby's Anxiety-Hidden. want to live and live or step in to "do the right thing." William Gregory Lee is excellent as Chance, Kirby's naughty and female brother. Katie Keane plays Rebecca's sister, Rachel, a woman who did what was necessary to stay alive, but to give her pride in the process. In a small but unforgettable role, Jeff Davis Mean Joe, a formerly Confederate with a rather mean streak, plays. I think we will see more of these fine actors in the future. "Hell to pay" is a fun movie with a good story to tell ?? Grab the popcorn, we're mainly West!
