A group of trivial teenagers go to a former funeral room for a Halloween party. They are trapped, and are occupied by demons to accidentally wake up. The possessed teens start killing the others and look under the direction of Angela (Mimi Kinkade) who drives and speaks in a very deep voice. The remaining teenagers who are not yet occupied are forced to fight off the demons and try to escape the house. <br /> <br /> It's a pretty decent horror movie with great special effects, including Linnea Quigley (which has some naaktonel as usual) that expels an old man's eyeball and squeezes a tube of lipstick in her nipple . There is also a scene where a couple has sex in a coffin and a guy gets his tongue out. It's a good movie to watch with a lot of friends at night while eating pizza. The terrible acting and horrible dialogue already ruins it. Overall, I'll give it a 7 out of 10.
