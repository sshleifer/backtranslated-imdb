Never before posted anything before, but after watching Noroi, I just felt that I had to write down my thoughts about it. <br /> <br /> First, I don't compare it to Blair Witch, this movie is much better than that! Simply put, Noroi is (probably) one of the best horror movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot!). <br /> <br /> I really liked how the movie does not offer itself as a standard horrorflick, but filmed as a documentary by a reporter (I think?) called Kobayashi and his cameraman. Without spoiling too much about the plot, I can say that it starts with Kobayashi researching a series of seemingly unrelated events, which seems to be linked to something much dark and sinister. <br /> <br /> While The story may not be the original in itself, it really hung me with Noroi. It was the incredibly awful atmosphere. If you are looking for cheap scares and sit-jump scenes, this movie may not be for you. This movie is about the mood it offers, with ghostly images and a general sense of prosperity. The documentary style filming makes it more credible. <br /> <br /> It is also greatly helped by the excellent acting, but not perfect for the general part of the movie! Much better than most other movies in this genre. <br /> <br /> Well enough, I recommended Noroi to everyone, it's exciting, creepy, well behaved and the first movie that scared me in ages.
