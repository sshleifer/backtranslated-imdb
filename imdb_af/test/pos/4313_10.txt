NOBODY (1999) is a fantastic piece of Japanese noir. It's about three salaries that get in the way when their innocent, drunk cheapshots of three other guys come to a bar one night. When these three mysterious aliens, who are far more deviant than the movie allows us to know, beat the living daylight out of one of our "heroes", the trio decides to return the favor in kind - only them per accident kill one of the other guys! The remaining two bad things then begin the systematic destruction of all that these poor shadows hold, including their rapid deterioration. Phaedra Video's DVD hat has a critique that the movie "A paranoid street crime freakout!" Name. or some of them, and the term more than applies here. Bread, tense, very violent and low-key (but still beautiful), largely shot at night with many deliberate vague moments and character motivation provoked by the audience, along with the beleaguered protagonists (who in any case earn everything get!). I give it a 10.
