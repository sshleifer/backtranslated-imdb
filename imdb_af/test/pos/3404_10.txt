I saw this movie when I was much younger, but it caught me. I loved Orry and George's relationship so much. I was so surprised in Orry and Madenline's love story. I'm a hopeless romantic, so it really got me. I loved it when he first met her. I just wish he had more time with her and their baby. So you know in book three, I was so hurt that he died. I didn't really understand it because they had little time together. I just loved Patrick in this movie. I bought all three books together and I can't stop watching them. My 12-year-old son is stuck to it. He likes fighting in the war. I cry every time. I wish I could personally meet Patrick and Madeline! It was a great movie and throw!
