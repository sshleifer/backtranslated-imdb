As a child I loved the song "Never smile at a crocodile", and if I find myself in this state, actually inspired by true events. Smile would be the last thing in my mind. From the beginning I had never been so frightened, trapped and finally exhausted as I was when I watched the limited budget of Independent Australian horror movie, about three people in the Northern Territory trapped in a very fine mangrove swamp crocodile waiting in the water among them. What really made the film alive was how realistic it was to transport the fear and uncertainty of the characters' situation to the audience. Semi-documentary camera work with a disturbing ominous background and authentic performances will effectively take you out of your convenience zone. What we get is a patient survival story as just a bloody, all-out creature feature. Think of Open Water (2003), where its budget and time constraint ensured that it was low key, but this minimal barrier improved the experience. <br /> <br /> The slow-moving story can be black and white, but it never seems to be disposable, or it has given in to formal patterns. Not very much, and the connection between the characters was emotionally captivating even with a bare, straight forward writing. Though you can say less, with the actions and expressions that illuminate the passing thoughts that affect their minds. The ordeal is terribly frightening, because the threat is very alive and never appears to be. This is what drives the film's chaotic adrenaline, and in which it lasts (even when buried) to the end. <br /> <br /> Writers / directors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich's economic leadership alienate and clever strings alongside the viewer with his tight pace and sad psychological features. In some spots, the notch falls, with pressure-induced stress and surprising images. The way the night series is performed is extremely cold and pulsating. The threatening crocodile manipulative toy with its fresh meat in a disturbingly exciting approach. Certainly a few moments felt unlikely, but it never gets in the way or leads. Sound FX is the key, and at times the lack of any just eats away. Rafeal May's musical score is modest and doesn't really touch the mix much, but when it does, it builds an organic sound quality. The cinematography of John Biggins is beautifully conceived and quickly aggressive when the mood changes. It was always going on and claustrophobia, but not one of these rough movements. The editing is sharply handled, and the effects are professionally provided by the lively crocodile image. <br /> <br /> Something like this production will also have to be relied upon to sell the story in a credible way and they do it. Princess Glenn, Andy Rodoreda and especially Maeve Dermody are convincingly good. Much of the responsibility falls on Dermody, and she delivers strong with an inspired turn. Now this item can make some comparisons with another killer crocodile movie "Rogue (2007)", but the two can't be different in what they want and how they end. If I had to choose, I would lean more towards this outing for his mere involvement with you. <br /> <br /> A remarkable effort on all fronts, with everyone having the potential to really look out.
