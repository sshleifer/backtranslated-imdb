This is a movie you will love or hate. I loved it. If you're looking for excitement, great special effects, action, sophistication, cynicism, etc., you won't find it in this movie. It's a good movie, sentimental, positive, constructive. The heroes of the movie are Coach Jones (played by Ed Harris), a man of strength and integrity, and Radio (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) A mentally disabled man who finds a way to contribute to his world. I think I didn't find this movie as "sentimental hogwash" as much has done, as it made me feel very real. I know people like this. I saw jocks who think it's nice to choose the vulnerable. I have seen men of integrity stand up for the vulnerable. I saw people thinking high school soccer is a serious matter. I saw people who know what's really important in life. Any of these people could have been people I knew. I laughed; I cried. I made the movie feel, remember that there are people like Coach Jones and Radio in my world. If there aren't people like them in yours, you might not like the movie. If you don't like a movie that shows the better side of human nature, you will hate it.
