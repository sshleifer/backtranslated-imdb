This film is exceptional because Marlene & Raymond deliver outstanding performances. The acting in this movie is the greatest power of production, but the writing, direction and editing deserve applause. There is an extraordinary chemistry that exists between the two stars. If you like Marlene and you like Raymond, you'll love this movie ..... (This is a classic comparing Casablanca.) <br /> <br />
