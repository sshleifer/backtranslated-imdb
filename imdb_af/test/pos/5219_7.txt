I don't like boxing, don't understand the appeal. I liked this movie. Positive portrayals of Latinos, without drugs, sex or street violence. The plot actually showed stable, loving families. The battle order is violent, just like boxing, but not as over as Rocky movies. Nothing wrong to try familiar themes with a different angle and ethnicity. It's a good rental.
