I thought the storyline came in very well. I love this movie a lot. If you go to a Bridget Fonda movie, you can only rot. I thought it was a bad idea to attack movie stars. Apparently, somebody doesn't think so. I rather enjoyed the movie. I even think about buying it. I want it to be my first DVD for my room. That's how much I like it. I'd rather not start an online argument with someone I don't know and it's about a movie. If someone who told them about the storyline could kindly withdraw, I would be more than happy to withdraw my insult. However, if they feel that I am not a withdrawal, I can only feel that they are not one worthy. But I can't control their actions, I can only encourage them in the right direction. Hey, they don't have to pull back, but I really appreciate it.
