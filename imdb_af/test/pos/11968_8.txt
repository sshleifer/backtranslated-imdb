When I wanted to see this documentary documentation on Communist block music, I expected something completely demented, in the line of a Communist "Cop Rock". Some scenes have been delivered, including a snapshot from a Soviet movie called "Trekker Drivers." <br /> <br /> You'd think the filmmakers have given the ideologically correct musical singing, dancing and stimulating the Party line to insurmountable chances. And yet, one of the surprises of East Side Story is that some of the movies on offer are actually promising. One was a mid-1950s East German attempt, called "My wife wants to sing", in which an unfortunate haus woman starts a singing career about the objections of her traditionally wise man. <br /> Another really interesting movie, also from East Germany, is called "Midnight Revue." In this film-within-a-movie, producers have plundered their own creative fate with the story of a group of movie makers under Party orders to make a musical. (The screenmakers themselves get a musical number about avoiding "too hot" subjects reminiscent of the scene of the 1957 movie "Silk Stockings.") The documentary is crushed by a little indifferent narrative. , but it's still fun to watch. (Look for the last commitment to the person who made it all possible.)
