Well, what do you know, I painted my home today and an Elton John song came on the radio, which immediately took me back to this movie I saw in 1971. So long ago and so far away. Ten years later I ran across the country side of France, and I would have liked to see Michelle. The movie is probably not very sophisticated according to today's standards, but more is a pity, but it was rather noisy. A few years later, a follow-up was made with Michelle who lived in a high rise in Paris and Paul returned to meet her, just as the life they moved was the film very indifferent. The original was quite amazing, and if you could get a copy, remember, remember to give it, and don't treat it carefully. I notice that Americans may be rather pompous, so beware, contain scenes and themes that may be upset in the middle of America.
