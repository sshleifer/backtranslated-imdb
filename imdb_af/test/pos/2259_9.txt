I saw it last night and voted it an "8". Since then it has grown on me and I give it a 9. <br /> <br /> The movie (initially) has a seemingly slightly attached facade between the first and second half. The first half is a comedy and there is a small indication of the turbulent truths of eras, life, wars, religious intolerance that will be revealed in the second half. While it may be a bit disturbing at first, it is a little unknown storytelling, on reflection it works. <br /> <br /> The acting was good (Hultz in the role of Alex, the interpreter, was particularly large). <br /> <br /> I scanned most of the other "User Comments" and saw that some who read the book were happy with the movie while there were some who didn't. Of course, both feelings are valid. <br /> <br /> For me, a retired family therapist and one-world believer, the film was relevant to two different levels. <br /> <br /> The first, as history, has given a powerful reminder of how common polarizations happen - with demonization and trying to eradicate any of those with a different moral value system than ours. <br /> <br /> The second was that we first made the community public for EVERYONE, all our families - that we should each return to our roots to understand ourselves more. br /> <br /> TS Eliot made it excellent in the fourth of his Four Quartets when he said: "We will not stop exploring. / And the end of all our exploration. / Will be coming where we started. / And knows the place for the first time. " <br /> <br /> Jonathan is going on a fulfilling journey that will illuminate some of us wonderfully - to discover and discover our roots; then what were those people, who were they - really! - before, when, and during the early years before and after we were born? Etc. <br /> <br /> So first, the film gives the impression of a comedy, then moves to give us a lesson in history and human shortcomings, but by all means it also gives us - subliminally - a message about each of us. All of us will be rewarded abundantly to go back and understand the place from which we started.
