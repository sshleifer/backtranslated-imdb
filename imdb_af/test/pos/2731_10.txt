I just watched the movie "15-car park" which was the first night film in Asia's human rights film festival in New York. I was really surprised by the subject of this movie and also the excellent portrayal of "mithi" by the main actor konona sen sharma.i ran only one word for anyone reading this comment to get a copy of this jewel and see it. My sincere thanks to director Aparna Sen, who again did an excellent job. It comes once in a blue moon and I was happy to see this movie on the screen and also participated in a movie discussion / question and answer session with concona sen sharma. In a simple word a wonderful experience.
