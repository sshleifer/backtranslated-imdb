The above profile was written by me when I used the nickname of OldWereWolf56, which is still my email address. I still believe Andy Devine's character of Frisky is the best Twilight Zone's episodes ever and I watch this episode at least once a year as I consider Frisby to be a happy man, as he has many friends who love him very much. <br /> <br /> In case many of you are too young to remember, I'm 61, Andy Devine presented a children's entertainment show in the 50's. I believe Andy's Gang. Then he had three assistants: a cat named Midnight who played the violin, a mouse called Squeaky who played a hand organ and a devilish road called Froggy that could appear and disappear, much of Andy 's funny gas stars like Billy Gilbert embarrassed.
