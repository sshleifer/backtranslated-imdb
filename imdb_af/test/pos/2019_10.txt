Well, let me say so - I have always been one of the "hardcore brothers"; I've always loved rock music, and especially heavy metal !! Therefore, this movie is like a gift from God! I believe this movie is one of the best movies ever (except Neverending Story and Star Wars, of course ...). It's great to hear all the classics like "Long live rock and roll" (DIO), "Stranglehold (Ted Nugent), songs by Jon Bon Jovie, Deep Purple, AC / DC, Zakk Wylde and several other legendary rock bands Very Wonderful! WONDERFUL !!! I hope they will make more movies like this (otherwise it's just crap movies, like the "AC in da USA" or whatever they call it, and 8 miles.) Bulls ***!) Everything what I miss is some Stratovarius songs! But besides that, it's one of the best movies ever! Ten out of ten!
