I enjoyed the play in this movie. Except for the sister. She reminded me of Janice on Friends. I could never really believe she was nothing but unnecessary. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the movie was the anti-climatic end and the performance scene with the sister and brother-in-law. The man falling from the explosive car? Maybe if his hand was blown out and he ran to the mute for help and she kissed him and rushed to a hospital, I might end up. I think someone should die in the performance scene. Mainly the brother-in-law. He was in any case such a pain in the hole. Or maybe the sister had to kill the man who had accidentally saved. I could even have bought in the brother-in-law who killed the hero and the end is that the two sisters are put in snuff movies. <br /> <br /> It is worth looking at again and, as I always say, it is much easier to be a reviewer instead of a writer.
