This movie is good for entertainment purposes but it is not historically reliable. If you're looking for a movie and thinking to yourself, "Oh, I want to learn more about Custer's life and his last point of view," don't rent "They've killed their shoes". But if you want to watch a movie for the pleasure of an older Western movie, with a little romance and just for a good story, it's a fun movie to watch. <br /> <br /> The story begins with Custer's (Errol Flynn) first day at West Point. Everyone loves his beautiful personality which enables him to get away with most things. The movie follows his West Point career and his many struggles, including his struggle in the Civil War. The movie ends with its last stand at Little Big Horn. Between the battle tones he finds love and marriage with Libby (Olivia De Havilland). <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn portrays the arrogant, but keeps George Armstrong Custer good. Olivia De Havilland plays the cute, lovely Libby very well, especially in the flirtatious scene that Custer and Libby meet first. Their on-screen chemistry believed in their romance. The play in general was impressive, especially the comic role (though stereotypical) of Callie played by Hattie McDaniel. Her character will definitely make you laugh. <br /> <br /> The heroic war music brought out the excitement of the battlefield. The beautiful costumes set the tone of the era. The screenplay was sometimes thin, though the movie was still nice to watch. The directors' portrayal of Custer was a hero and history shows that it is debatable. Some will see this movie and see Custer as a hero. Others will see this movie and hate him. <br /> <br /> I give it a thumb for this 1942 Western movie.
