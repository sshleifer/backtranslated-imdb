This movie is about a bunch of misfits that are supposed to be assigned to a task that is expected to fail. The misfits come together to complete their mission successfully. <br /> <br /> Happiness follows. <br /> <br /> Like the "Police Academy" movies, the humor comes from the crazy characters on the boat. I thought it was an entertaining movie and I will stop watching it on TV. No, it won't cause you to consider your relative role in the cosmos or inspire yourself to do good things for the service of man, but it's fun enough entertainment for 90-minute moments. Plus, Lauren Holly looks warm in a navy suit.
