Director Don Siegel really impressed me with this movie. It has been sharply shot, graphically without being visually graphical, well-acted by all concerned, and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a real, near-expected normality that has not been in any other way to date. movie seen by this reviewer. I didn't know what to expect to put it down to see it: a civil war movie or a kind of 70-year-old softcore that came down with Eastwood at a school for girls in the South. But really it is not one of those things, but rather, exploring, exploring and designing the soul of men and women - a dark commentary on what is at the heart of civilization. As one of the judges mentioned earlier, none of the characters of the film's end is yet, and each one is interesting, complex and mysterious. Eastwood plays Cpl. McBurney, a Union soldier found by young Pamelyn Ferdin (you will recognize that voice as soon as you hear it), a girl at a school for ways led by Geraldine Page amid the chaos that the Civil War was - especially in the South. Soon, Page, teacher Elizabeth Hartman, beautiful young seducer Carol, and even Ferdin (Amy) have emotional / sexual ties with Eastwood. Everyone has their own needs and secrets and problems. Eastwood is not a nice man. he plays the girls apart and always tries to get the sexual benefit. In the unfolding we get some interesting things that are revealed from latent lesbians to innocence. The Beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front. This can be (except for the Body Snatchers) Siegel's best movie. It's definitely one of Eastwood's best real achievements. page is always so good and Hartman, Fe5rdin, et al is excellent. The Gothic Manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic. Some of the sexual iniquities scare. And what happens to Eastwood is a lot of much of the creepy, honor, demented movie competition.
