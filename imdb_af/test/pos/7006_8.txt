Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about surviving in a hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task becomes even more difficult when the closest enemies can be found in your own surviving group. <br /> <br /> The plot of Pitch Black is very normal and has been seen in several variations several times. But what makes this movie shimmer over others, it is well written characters. <br /> <br /> The group consists of many different people with less interest than the other: Jack, a boy with a secret; Braai, a pilot who has hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty hunter with a drug habit; Imam, a holy man who learns that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a culprit and a murderer learns to appreciate others, not just himself. Characters start to stay in the movie. They're not just paper like many other movies of this genre. You start to care for the characters, especially for Riddick, but it feels rather strange. He's supposed to be the bad man. In this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All the characters both know. <br /> <br /> Other things that work in this movie are decisive. Rare actors apply this stuff to their roles. Radha Mitchell is suitable for braai. Cole Hauser brings Johns the right amount of cruelty and sense of responsibility. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does good work as Riddick. In his hands, Riddick is rather dirty, certainly very dangerous and also deep in character, just as he is supposed to. <br /> <br /> So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and even closer to enemies.
