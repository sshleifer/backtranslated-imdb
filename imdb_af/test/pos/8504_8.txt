The famous French detective, Henri Cassin, takes his first holiday in 11 years in St Margot, where he meets Nanette, the daughter of the holidaymakers. Despite the fact that Nanette is promised the childhood sweetheart, Leon, Henri and Nanette fall in love and decide to marry, despite Nanette's father objecting to Henri's age. On the day of their wedding, Leon came back and Nanette ran to him. Nothing is heard of the two until both are found dead, and Henri swears he won't rest until he finds the killer. Henri's only idea is to find a footprint found by Leon, but he is also warned that others will soon die. Soon Nanette's mother was found dead and Henri had no idea about the killer's identity. If he is a failure, he returns to Paris, then he realizes (and fears) that the killer can only be one person, although none of his colleagues can believe his explanation. The ordinary murder mystery does not follow the formula in others of the genre by Columbia or other B-studios. Credit for that is definitely directed to director Lewis, who manages to turn into a noirish movie, despite setting up the movie, also by using good camera work and lighting. Geray turns into a very good performance in probably his only lead and the rest of the players can perform their performance. Evaluation, 8.
