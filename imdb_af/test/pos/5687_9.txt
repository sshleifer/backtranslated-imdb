This movie sets out to do something very specific, but also not to do certain things. In short, it has a definite presupposed trajectory - to handle the idea of ​​death (with very few choices and all of them bad) as serious and really rather as something comfortable or amusing. In search of that realism, it disrupted certain conventions such as obvious character bows and brackets. It's not about the characters as much as about the human condition. Remember what the actors would do ... what would YOU do in their situation? <br /> <br /> Open water might be a start for this movie, but it goes a lot further. Unlike the movie, it doesn't end up with the audience if you find out that there are no sharks whatsoever at all. It has a real monster, not just the idea of ​​a monster and not just an animated stand. It also has good production values ​​given to what these very inventive filmmakers had to work on. And unlike the other movie, it has some exciting and brilliant action at the climax. And let's not forget, our "bright" screen presence of his youngest star will say. She might be a reasonable discovery.
