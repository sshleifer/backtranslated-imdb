Recently released on British DVD, this is a good movie (as long as you have an attention span and IQ of more than a fruit fly). Not as depressed as it could have been, it's the kitchen sink at its most dirty. Terrance Stamp is wonderful, the music is sweet, Carol White is very credible than the single mum-tart who can't stop the love of criminals. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where Carol and her girlfriend work in The pub with her (the one with the huge beehive hairstyle that comes across one eye) sits exuberantly and gossip over all the men walking past . <br /> <br /> The only thing that ruined it was the shakey acting Carol's first man, but if you can get it, you're right. And Donovan gives some of the most beautiful, mellow, bittersweet lyrics from the 60's.
