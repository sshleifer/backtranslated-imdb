Without a doubt, a large round shows that, if it is shown today, there would be a large following. Guardians were only 6 episodes and a trailer, but earned a few more series to really speed it up. With outstanding performances by highly talented and versatile Sean Pertwee and the dynamic Louise Lombard, it really did put in the professional, The Sweeney and Thief Takers. The story lines are based on the Diplomatic Protection Services and with great filming and story lines and play sites it was made up of some of the junk that is being found by other TV production companies. I don't think it was also shown on rural TV, such as Sky or Freeview, witch is sorry as it is shown today, I'm sure it will get a big viewer. So I hope one day the guys at Carlton TV decide to drop it on DVD, Nick, screaming.
