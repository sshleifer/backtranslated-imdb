Oz, was the first original television program that HBO put on his channel (in the 1 hour forma) and it remains the best today ... The story is simple ... Oz is a surreal look at the lives of high Maximum security prisoners in Oswald, mainly on "Em City." Now there are many things to compliment this show (which, in my opinion, was the best on television when this show was broadcast), directed (top heel), acting (the best of the best) and the characters ... This show only I literally blew my socks out. This show was a critically acclaimed jewel until The Sopranos bowed. Then critics kept an eye on the epic story of trust and family to see this compelling drama ... Oz to me is a better performance than Sopranos in general and it's a pity I never won a big Emmy's kudos did not have anyone involved in this beautiful, awesome show. <br /> <br /> KUDOS
