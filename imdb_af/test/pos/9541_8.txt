This almost perfect collection of Edith Nesbit's popular children's book follows the lives of Roberta (Bobbie), Phyllis and Peter, and their mother, after their father was unfairly accused of treason and sent to jail. They will live in an almost uninhabitable house in the country that is located near a railway line ?? Mom writes stories to make enough money for food and candles, while children spend a lot of their time blowing the station and specifically on a specific train to send a love for their dad. <br /> <br /> Always an acting and clever novel, the characters are brought to life under the acting leadership of Lionel Jeffries (better known as a fine character actor). Jenny Agutter plays Bobbie, while Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren are her sister and brother. Their mother is Dinah Sheridan, while the other unforgettable characters are played by Bernard Cribbins (Perks the railway man) and William Mervyn (the old man on the train). <br /> <br /> "The Railway Children" are quietly entertained by another age, but do their work beautifully. As we look at how Bobbie grows up with the concern of an absent parent struggling with her own needs, being alone and having fun, we can only be happy when events come together at the end of the picture. Throughout we have a sense of time and place? whether it's from the steam trains, the university paper, or the red flannelette petticoats worn by the girls (and use disaster prevention!).
