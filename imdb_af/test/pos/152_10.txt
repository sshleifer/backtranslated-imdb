After watching Oldboy, I was a little disappointed with the rest of Park's work, but some are good, but it never comes to the level of humor and originality Oldboy had. This one does, it's nothing like Oldboy in plot or style, but the same level of quality is there. <br /> <br /> The acting is good with Kang-ho Song, OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin performances. In particular, Kim recommends changing the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest slip. <br /> <br /> The plot is strange with lots of turns and turns and takes a huge swing at the vampire cleats. /> <br /> Directing is in the right place with tons of fit and humor throughout and some of the most memorable scenes I've ever seen. It boasts what is probably the strangest love scene you'll ever see. <br /> <br /> It's just a good movie.
