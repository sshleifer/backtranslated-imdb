Cute movie is a good movie I have never heard from this movie, but ran it while I was looking for something to rent. I had great hope for this movie that was just based on Flex in this movie. I have never seen him anything that is not worth it. It is true to form this movie for me. I enjoyed the story. The movie is full of great actors and actresses. The hilarious Tasha Smith, Essence Atkins and of course Tangi Miller. I loved this movie very much. I didn't give it five stars because it didn't discuss certain issues that I thought the movie should have discussed in detail. The problem was apparently resolved, but I would have appreciated a discussion that resolved the issues. I love the movie so much that I now buy the movie after renting it and watching it.
