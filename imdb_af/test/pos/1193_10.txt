For many reasons, this is a cult film. First, because of the phenomenal success as a musical, both in Broadway and London, then as a music movie. The film is near the play and some of the play's provocation is no longer provocative twelve years later. The discourse against the Vietnam War is no longer a protest song against the war itself, but a strong song that shows how the young people of the late 60s managed to bring down the political settlement. Milos Forman plays at the end of the 1970s with some situations, such as the meticulous justice, the self-centered nail justice of the rich or of the little ones who have only one rank of power, more than the powerless. He also plays heavily with the racial element and the sexual ambiguity he constantly builds. The film remains pleasant and thoughtful. And of course it's a great excitement to remember these years when we had the privilege, and it wasn't a chance to live them. On November 11, 1969, Nixon celebrated the 1918 truce. It has become the teachers at all levels to take their students to the celebration and march, supporting the full-scale Cambodia invasion. And some dare to give lessons in democracy abroad. I also remember the long campaign for the persecution of Nixon in 1973-1974 which will eventually lead to his resignation and the curse of Gerald Ford, the first vice-president and ultimately president of the United States who has not been elected, as he is through appointed Senate as Vice President after Spiro Agnew had to resign for the trial, conviction and embezzlement sentence. Of course, this makes us consider today when, in 2000, a US president was not elected by the people, but by the Supreme Court, or by a war that was rejected by millions worldwide and even before the beginning. and started against the better judgment of the United Nations and of three permanent members of the Security Council. And some speak of a new world order based on the respect of others. The modern Western man has problems understanding that the world is changing and has already changed widely. The modern Western man seems kind of sync and needs special evening classes to learn that democracy wants the majority in the world to be the majority, and the West is far from that majority and that if the Soviet bloc was able to understand that the market economy is not capitalism, but that the market economy can be either socialist or capitalist, the Berlin Wall would have fallen, but vice versa and that China learned that lesson wonderfully well and at the foot of the wall is to climb to learn that their socialist market economy must lead political democracy, but they will, like Vietnam, be able to rebuild thirty years of brutal war aggression and damage. In other words, Hair is a perfect food for thought. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Dauphine University, Paris University 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & Versailles University Saint Quentin and Yvelines
