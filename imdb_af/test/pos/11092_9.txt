Based on the true story of Christopher Boyce (Hutton) and Daulton Lee (Penn), and their involvement in the sale of US secret government pieces to the Soviet Union during the 1970s. Boyce works for the government and his job is to protect these specific documents, which eventually upset him about his country's affairs and practices. He then testifies to his drug dealer friend, Daulton Lee, who has become a desire to be the courier for these sensitive documents. Lee infiltrates the Russian embassy in Mexico, and makes contact with Alex (Suchet), and they both start playing the espionage game. <br /> <br /> Lee's interest is pure about money while Boyce is outraged by the system he is involved in. Alex believes Lee is the inner man in the US government. Things start settling if Lee's drug addiction and reckless behavior in handling the courier position offset both Alex and Boyce. Lee becomes more paranoid, and the initial spying game becomes more deadly and consequently for everyone involved. <br /> <br /> It's a real spy thriller without the cheese activity. The character motives and analysis of real subjects are sympathetic but very well written, and the film cleverly divides the real events with underlying political themes on human predatory behavior. Where a larger nation uses their political power to control the smaller nations. Well-directed, and intense in parts, especially where the lead players in their spies in the spy world become awesome. Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn give amazing sounding performances in a film-demanding movie yet there is no simple answer to the political message or the complexity of the system. The fate of the protagonists becomes the underlying message in 'The Falcon and the Snowman' and makes it a smart political excitement with a gripping element on society, human relations and the American system. Great movie! <br /> <br /> **** 1/2 out of *****!
