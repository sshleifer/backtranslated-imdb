I saw this version about a decade ago and have been looking for it ever since. I recently got an original VHS version, and bought it for $ 125.00. Sounds crazy, but if you, like me, see it as one of the best that Broadway musical stage ever made, you won't even think twice. <br /> <br /> Why is it just a little more to pay? A Broadway ticket today. I really hope they will release it in DVD format soon. It's a piece of musical theater screaming to be seen by everyone!
