While the film has its faults, it has revealed some of the problems that come to life in a country that has no democracy. It empowers people with such a government and teaches you more about their lives, their struggle and a potential leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. It makes a wonder why our government interferes with places we don't want, but ignores those who ask us for help.
