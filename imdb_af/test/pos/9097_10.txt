Watch this movie. It beats everything great about rock and roll, the band comes with some good songs (Classico, Pick of Destiny, Master Exploder etc). All this with the Humor or Teancous D makes it the best movie ever. <br /> <br /> The Kamee is right from behind, with Meat Loaf and Dio singing to JB. Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are wonderful, I love Tim Robbins' character. You also find out who Satan really is! The music and music references are hilarious and awesome. Playin songs great songs from The Who, Dio, and others, just complete it. Personally, I didn't think the group could overload the amazing songs of the D, but they did with songs like Classico and Master Exploder. Seriously wonderful music. <br /> <br /> Look, it's a must have for anyone who loves rock!
