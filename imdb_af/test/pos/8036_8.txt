I will not comment on the story as such. I agree with most people's remarks that this is a good everyday action movie with a well-known story and good acting. <br /> <br /> This movie earns 100% for filmmaking for its opening sequence. The opening shot is stunning and I haven't figured out how to do it yet. The movie is worth watching for that shot alone! I'm sorry to hear that the current DVD is just the movie and no information is given about making the movie. Let's hope someone comes with the special edition. <br /> <br /> And the better thing is that the opening order also ends, so you totally guess! Good stuff. A must for a classic movie collector moments.
