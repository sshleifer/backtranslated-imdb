Since then, Midnight Cowboy has been watching for movies with Dustin Hoffman and is mostly not disappointed. Since then, Kramer vs Kramer, I was looking for movies with Meryl Streep and are mostly not disappointed. She gave an excellent performance, really one of her best, in 'Sophie's Decision' and I loaded her into 'Out of Africa'. That these two actors came together for Kramer vs Kramer more than twenty years ago was definitely a very good idea: the result is an excellent character drama with a theme that is still very relevant in today's society. <br /> <br /> On separation, everyone has a very bad time, although the kids are suffering most. ?????? .. Beautifully handled by Robert Benton in some original directors who present unforgettable scenes: even the apex takes on character and belongs to the cast! And as for the breakfast scene with Billy (Justin Henry), simply beautiful. Just how do you get an eight-year-old to act? Benton did it, and of course with Hoffman there was good electricity: the result is definitely engaging, engaging and convincing. Justin Henry's performance should be among the best 5 or 6 children's performances of all time. The best thing was once again the naturalness. There was no longer the top, so often. <br /> <br /> The other night, this movie climbed on the small screen, although I had it In my video collection for years: it is still worth watching and paying attention to everything. About 7Â½ out of 10.
