Adam (Eric Jungmann) and zealous best friend Harley (Justin Urich) drove land to a wedding. Along the way they pick up the sexy hitchhiker Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Then, for no reason, a monster truck keeps trying to run them off the road ... and maybe they are dead. Who does this and why? <br /> <br /> Pretty good horror movie. Its energetic and full-fledged direction that gets you through the action. It's also a horror comedy. Most of the humor is childless and VERY coarse, but actually somewhat funny. This film is also at stake - but that's a good thing! The acting is OK - Jungmann survives his nerd roll a bit; Urich is stuck with the hopeless role of the dirt leg, sex-obsessed best friend - but pulls it off; Brooks is also well into a limited role. <br /> <br /> BUT I could see the "turn" end coming long before it happened and logic disappearing completely at the end (especially the rescue). Yet it is a greedy, sometimes funny and sometimes frightening film. I give it a 7.
