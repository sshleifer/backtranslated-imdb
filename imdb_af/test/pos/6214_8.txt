It's a wonderful look, you have to forgive the pun, at 22 women talk about breasts - they, their mothers, other women, and how they touch so many aspects of their lives. Young girls, old women and everyone between them (with all shapes, sizes, configurations, etc.) talk about developing, responding, celebrating, concealing, improving or reducing their breasts. <br /> <br /> It's charming, beautiful, sad, funny and everything in between. Intercision with documentary footage and clips of the well-known old "young women films" that the girls took to the cafeteria to see, the interviews are a fascinating window for men who love women and their breasts in what the other half should say than they don't know you are listening.
