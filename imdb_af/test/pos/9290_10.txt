This show is not Stop Hilarity. The first joke will make you pants. And that's probably the worst joke of them all. I started watching when the second half of season 2 started to air. and right away. I'm addicted. just 2 weeks after I started watching. I downloaded episodes and bought the DVDs. Recurring tracks Like the "Ad Road Test" and "current affairs", quiet hilarious. Then there is the ad they take. Use Emo. Use your own tears for more effective use. Also funny in politics. Nothing is wrong with them to do it. It's funny. Any Australians Who Don't Find This Funny. Don't complain and don't look at it. ALL AUSTRALIA TUNE AT Wednesday AT 9 AM
