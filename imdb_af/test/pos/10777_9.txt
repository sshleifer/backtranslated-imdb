Oliver Stone strikes the bull's eye on this film, mainly through the Bogosian's electrifying screen presence and biting, brilliant screenplay. Every moment cracks with an ever-growing tension, climbing into a real, memorable movie event. If there ever was an indication of a writer and a director's ability to report two highly volatile temperaments in a seamless union of creativity, then it is! The result is a power generation performance that is now made more timely, perhaps because of our culture's disturbing fascination with celebrity personality. These are distorted interpretations of fame. <br /> <br /> An ultimate indictment of our society's increasing morbidity and devastating hunger for the next great excitement. <br /> <br /> A movie that is not easily forgotten. I recommend it to anyone interested in the dark side of human nature.
