Okay, so it's Pulp Fiction, but I think it has its own voice and identity, mainly because of the music video style, sketchy narration and good performances. Thomas Jane is great (the drug dealer show is exceptional), Aaron Eckhart, too. James LeGros has a short and vibrant look - good humor - "they had the Wong house." The Porzikova interrogation and rape scene is unforgettable, culminating in Mickey Rourke's cameo appearance. <br /> <br /> Big Hollywood popcorn B production with strong A-level aspirants and apostates (Rourke) achievements. <br /> <br /> Well, make a peak, it's worth it.
