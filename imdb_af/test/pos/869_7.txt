A very interesting plot of the movie based on the novel "Wals in Darkness" by author Cornell Woolrich. It's a drama rather than a movie noir trying to send a message that love changes your life, that is, your love for any person and the love you received from him / her. A rich man really changed his life for love, while his partner finally understood that he was the only one who loved her. Belmondo played well as usual, while a somewhat young Michel Bouquet played his eternal role of a detective or police officer. Frankly Bouquet was not as impressive in this movie, but less than that was the performance of Catherine Deneuve. She was not as convincing in her role as a prostitute then lover / wife of Louis Mah√© (Belmondo). For those who like to visit the world, the film offers the opportunity to see part of the Ascension Island, and also Lyon city in France.
