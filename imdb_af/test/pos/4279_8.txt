Fellowe's drama about a couple's marriage threatened by a younger third party interested in the home wife (Watson). Wilkinson plays the role very well as the troubled man who cannot control his wife's fraud and deals with the issue. I also like Rupert everett much in his role as William Bule, the man with whom Watson has the relationship. Although I think Emily Watson is a great actress, I had a bit of a problem with the way her character was written, she didn't make it too nice (I know a cheater is not supposed to love but some of her actions and things she had no reasoning behind them). The script was perhaps the weak part of this drama, though Fellowes's direction was good and the performances were also pretty good. This movie is better than unreliable, but not a masterpiece in any way. --- IMDB Rating: 6.7, my rating: 8/10
