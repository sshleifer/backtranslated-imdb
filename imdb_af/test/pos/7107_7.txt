"House of Dracula" is not that bad of a movie and is sometimes pretty decent. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Come home to Dr Franz Edelmann, (Onslow Stevens) in his cottage, Count Dracula, (John Carradine) strategically looking for a drug for vampirism. He began working with a possible drug involving blood transfusion, the Wolf Man, Lawrence Talbot, (Lon Chaney Jr.) joining his estate for a drug for lycanthropy. With the two patients, he discovers a potential drug in a form found near the laboratory. He buried the Frankenstein Monster (Glenn Strange) near the grave. Be busy reviving it, and dr. Edelmann keeps the requests of Dracula and Larry away, and after insisting they get their treatment instead of working on the Monster, they turn into a climate conflict. <br /> <br /> The Good News: It was a pretty good movie. There is one main idea that is quite creative and imaginative. This is the first film to openly suggest the idea of ​​vampirism as a blood disease, and one that can be transmitted from person to person by exchanging body fluid, something that is taken up by later genre works, but rarely as directly as this. There is even a microscope slide of the parasite responsible for the condition. It works in a couple of ideas that are used quite well and is a pretty good idea, even though some of the performance is a bit outdated. The fact that each of the creatures has at least one striking scene is a nice idea. The Wolf Man has a wonderful scene where he transforms into the jail cell into the dubious members of the search party and becomes crazy. Dracula's initial appearance to appear like a bat and sleep to a inclined figure and then appear in human form seems really impressive. The sample rampage is handled well and an appropriate amount of destruction is caused. The big bat that transforms Dracula always looks fine, and it's done fairly realistically. This is a thorough decent thing. <br /> <br /> The bad news: There are several things that were not so good about this one. The fact that the film combines as much as possible intriguingly and ideas that do not really know what to do with them. There are several different retreats that need to be mixed together and must be clear enough to combine well and look coherent. It really has nothing of this. The plot is rather bland and doesn't really give any preference to any of the stars, but rather focus on one and the other and then close all three in the end. The monsters just get engaged with each other, for the least possible reason it makes a big distraction. The end is a major deviation for one time and looks exactly like it has been changed at the last minute. There are a few other little things that weren't so spectacular, and they also contribute almost to this. <br /> <br /> The Final Judgment: It's quite a decent movie and manages most of the time through an entertaining style. Nowhere near the classic status of every monster's debut features, but it's a pretty enough look for monster fans and universal films in general. <br /> <br /> Today's Rating PG: Violence
