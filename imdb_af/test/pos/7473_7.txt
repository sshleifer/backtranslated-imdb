I don't know what the critics saw when this movie was released, but it surely overtook it. It is well written, spiritual, satirical and thoroughly pleasing. It's like a video game brought to life. You never know who is behind the door or what will happen next. Violence is not free or excessive for splendid effects. <br /> <br /> One last word: For your Mickey Rourke fans ... the Mickster is back and at his coolest in the cameo performance at the end.
