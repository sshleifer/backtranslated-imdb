The title of the movie looks pretty fitting with the character of the main character, Fanda. He is an older man who lives in the late autumn of his life, but is quite excited about a jubilant schoolboy who just entered a spring pasture. The irregularities of the age and the warning signs of death are all illusions to him. His wife supported this idea when she saw: "Fanda laughs at funeral and death." In other words, death is not something that Fanda takes too seriously; He has more important things to do than worry about what is already inevitable. Life, and the pursuit of living life in full, is the philosophy that determines Fanda's existence. He is not one to simply exist, but must be every day and every moment, because tomorrow is not guaranteed. <br /> <br /> The film seems to make a strong comment on life as if there is no tomorrow, let alone death. Too many people take life far too seriously and therefore miss the real living part of life. Fanda's wife, for example; She is so worried about preparing for death, not in a religious connotative way, but in a far too practical, even lifeless way she forgets to smile, laugh and just had a good time. Her humanity seems to be turned into the zombie-automatic pilot. Fanda, on the contrary, may be too blunt and absent for his own good. He needs a person like his wife, Emilie, to help him balance. <br /> <br /> It is as if Fanda possesses a child's invincible spirit, such as a child trapped in an older man's body. He is introduced as the adventurous species; He pretends to be people who do not have profit, waste money, virtually lies and are always a good laugh. Meanwhile, he is a sad and gentle old man who wants to be submissive to his excessive pragmatic wife. The two nurture each other, though none of them really appreciate the binary quality of their relationship until they have metaphorical chance of death: meaning, their divorce. It is during this courtroom scene that Fanda realizes the reality of death and what it means when he is separated from his only love. His wife emotionally remembers all his mistakes, but is fairly drawn to love him, despite his crazy behavior. In this moment in which she forgiven him, Fanda realizes his selfish behavior to manage his wife's bonkers and makes an internal commitment to make her happy. <br /> <br /> Ironically, but after making this commitment, he who calls his wife later becomes "a living body." The lifeblood in him drains because he becomes more like a zombie going through the day-to-day movements. He no longer seems to live, but exists. For example, he gives up his zany pranks, doesn't waste money, stops smoking because of his wife (not his health), and overall, just accepts what she wants from him. Successful, he changes because he wants to make her happy. So the binary quality of their relationship is slowly disappearing. If she realized that her husband was not what he was, there was a part of Emilie who missed the old Fanda. She misses her husband's sincerity and the battles they used because it was in those moments that they really lived, not just exist. <br /> <br /> I believe the filmmakers have been trying to get a specific message about this; that true and loving relationships will not always be easy or convenient, but often times will have sacrifice and endurance to wade through the seemingly bad times. The possibility of death at any moment is what reminds people to live for every moment. Life is often taken for granted, but when it is threatened with death, is it literally or figuratively? Waking them up from their ungrateful slumbers, they wake up to start life to the limit. It is as if they are afraid that they will never live again, so that they can make it better while they have it. Fanda and Emilie were married for 44 years along the way, but it wasn't until they were both threatened with the possibility of death as they began to show their true colors. As the old crowd goes, "Love doesn't know its own depth until the hour of separation." They both begin to see what is most alive and that is the people they meet along the way. More importantly, the intimate relationships they make with their significant others.
