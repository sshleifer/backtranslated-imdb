"Showtime" falls somewhere north of what some critics said, and a little south of what I expected months ago when I first heard of Eddie Murphy and Robert Di Niro working together for a comedy. Overall, it was pretty good! If "real life" goes crime or police - and plot, for that matter - it's pretty illogical, but DUH --- it's a comedy. Also, while the special effects, chase, aerial photos and skyscrapers inflated, but lower key than a Schwartzenegger movie, I found it a little tiring and exaggerated. Aside from 9/11 sensitivities, to me, whatever the pyro-techno hyper effect is good, is really old for the past few years. It was a lame substitute for characterization, story and engaging emotions. I hope the lesser amount of it in "Showtime" is an indication of a trend in Hollywood. A tendency of precipitation, less use of the stupid, less use of the explosive building. <br /> <br /> Di Niro and Murphy are two of my favorites. Their screen presence and charisma - and even their character depth - was a joy to watch "for many years. It can't be discharged here - they are doing actors, and entertaining and attractive in this movie. not put my finger on it, but maybe the explosions, the excessive FX, and all this reduces the final product ??? Maybe, or maybe it was something else, or a combination of factors that give one that the movie doesn't At its highest potential, whatever it was, "Showtime" was entertaining, I'll probably buy the DVD when it comes out - but I had the vibe that it wasn't all it could have been. everything I hoped for. <br /> <br /> Very good movie, but not a good movie, I gave it an 8 out of 10.
