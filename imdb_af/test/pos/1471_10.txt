Well, I saw it yesterday and it was much better than the other discharge from VH1, bad than this one, but it's pretty outdated, but you see all the staff that make South Park very interesting things. <br /> <It's also funny as this documentary version Trey and Matt, like selfish, greedy snobs creators, who don't work and spend all the time having fun or relaxation (which is ironic because they are pretty hard at show work). <br /> <br /> It also shows the animation process to make an episode in the South Park, an interview with the actors who bring character's voices and more. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of South Park, recommend it.
