It is by far one of the best films ever made by India. The following are the pluses of the movie. <br /> <br /> Wonderful direction, cinematography and editing, editing is very smooth and the timing of conversions is excellent. <br /> <br /> Although the film shows the life of Mumbai Police officers and their hardship, it never gets boring or sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Mind-blowing acting by chief actor Nana Patekar. One can certainly hope that he is nominated for the best actor for the academy awards. <br /> <br /> Managed violence. The violence is being controlled and the film does not become a bloody mess. <br /> <br /> No stupid songs like in ordinary Indian movies. <br /> <br />
