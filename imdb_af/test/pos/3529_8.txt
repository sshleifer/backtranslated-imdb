One of the many backwoods horror's that came out in the early eighth centuries and fortunately this is one of the better ones. Yes, it has a cheesy plot, but I was pleasantly surprised at this movie, because I thought it was really good and really entertaining, although the killer could be made a little more scarce, he just like a fat slab looked. <br /> First, we have the local sheriff or whatever the hell, who warns them not to go to the mountains because they are very dangerous. But when the teenagers arrive, it doesn't look as dangerous at all, according to me. It's a pity that we no longer get such movies, and if we do, it's usually a boring horrible movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is more stressful and frightening than gore, because the gore factor is really low in this movie I wasn't happy with, but otherwise it's still a good movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, you have to look long and hard to find this movie and if you find it, you will love it and also look forward to ending up with the final girl and the killer, this is completely not what you would expect.
