It's a Hollywood movie. The credentials of those involved are not revolutionary. This movie won't change the world. However, it is well made, well plotted, and well done, which is very important. <br /> <br /> It's the cat-and-mouse story of a disgruntled former CIA assassin who feels betrayed to chase a Secret Service Agent protecting John F. Kennedy when Kennedy was murdered in Dallas. The agent was upset by this failure during the subsequent years of his career upset and when the movie picked up in 1992 - or certainly in today's America - it would be murderer Mitch Leary (John Malkovich in a creepiness rarity). in which he gives a transformational display, was used with frustration and anger and decided to kill the president. He thinks he has a common cause with Frank Horrigan (Clint Eastwood in his cool, calm, good-natured grouchy best), whom he allegedly has to resent as he does because the Horrigan commission warned Wrongly, for the murder of President Kennedy. The tensions are held by calls from Leary to Horrigan-Leary to keep Horrigan close but not to betray his location and plans. <br /> <br /> Rene Russo is excellent as Lily Raines, a co-agent with whom Horrigan develops a mature relationship. It's nice to see a relationship between two equally capable peers (even if Russo is a fair deal younger than Eastwood at the time of filming). Russo is a tranquil, capable agent who can go against the side with the quick Horrigan in a friendly banter. It's a good part for Russo, so she can play the role of a competent professional woman and not just the standard romantic interest of the older man. The actions of the leaders, Wolfgang Peterson's capable direction, the thoughtful use of music in plot development and excellent cinematography make it a movie I can watch over and over.
