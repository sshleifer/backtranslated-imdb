In the end, credits from "Shadows", after we read "directed by John Cassavetes", can see some white letters on the screen: "The movie you've just seen is improvised," they say. I am always busy with the fact that words are so important in movies because filmmakers have used them because there is basically no film without a script and many other reasons. Cassavetes pursued the same goal, and he believed in the freedom of words; "Shadows" is the perfect example. It's a movie with no real main characters, with no real headlines; These are mostly people in different situations, talk. Yes, some of the situations are linked, but Cassavetes, apparently always in a hurry to speak, uses a quick forwarding technique when the characters go somewhere or escape from someone and speak. <br /> <br /> Appearance is all in this movie. For example, there is a brilliant score, full of jazz influences and many fantastic solos, and there is one character who says he is a jazz musician and plays the trumpet (Ben, all the characters' names are the same names as the actors) ). But we never see him playing the trumpet or jam with a band; He doesn't even talk about music and just walks around with his friends. They talk a lot, and about everything in their minds; go from how intelligent each of them is to the hilarious analysis of a sculpture. <br /> <br /> "Shadows" are funny in its intellectual references in parts like the one above, because these friends are not grown. The only important female character in the film (Lelia), however, wants to be an intellectual. But again, she has one very interesting conversation with an older man at a party, about a book she's trying to write and about confronting reality. but nothing to do with intellectuals. At that same party, a woman actually makes an intellectual statement, full of complexity, and asks a man next to her: "Do you agree?". "Yes," he says, but you can say he doesn't know what she's talking about. <br /> <br /> Another character, a singer (Hugh), sometimes talks about his glory days and we see him performing only once; but there are no references to the music industry. Cassavetes' focus is the singer's relationship with his manager (Rupert), who speaks most of the time about trivial things and not actual 'musical' conversations. So the trumpet player's important deal in "Shadows" is the time he spent with his friends; The intellectual Wannabe girl is her way of handling romantic relationships (one of the strengths of the movie) and the singer is tied to his manager. Appearances. <br /> <br /> The reason why performances aren't important in this movie is simple. Cassavetes needed people who could master improvisation without matting if they were really good. I believe some of them are not, but they certainly know how to improvise in a scene and you can see how well they are doing it. "Shadows" are not about artists; it's about making a movie based on the magic of the conversation; And there you can say that gigs mean something. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the camera in each conversation is like a stalker, constantly on the eyes of each character, constantly looking for the expressions that come with natural speech. There is a scene where the trumpet player and his friends try to pick up some girls. They are three, so each one sits next to one girl (the girls are three two) in three different tables. They all speak simultaneously and the camera shoots through the table, and sometimes the friends look at each other as they say what they say. That is, of course.
