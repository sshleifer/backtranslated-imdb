STAR RATING: ***** Saturday night **** Friday night *** Friday morning ** Sunday night * Monday morning <br /> <br /> Once, heroin addict Frankie Machine (Frank Sinatra) gets out of jail after his bumbling prison wife Sparrow (Arnold Stang), needy lame of a woman, Zosch (Eleanor Parker) and little on the side of Molly (Kim Novak.) He tries to make it big as a drummer in a band, but to his great break come along that he stuck and do the only other thing he was almost different from a junkie trading card in high-game games. And try, as he wishes, even the prison did not cure him of his addiction to the devil's drug, thereby lying and deceiving all the people around him and taking desperate measures to feed his habit. His desire to get out of it is his only motivation for a happy ending. <br /> <br /> When people think of Frank Sinatra, they usually think of classic high songs such as Under My Skin, New York New York and it had to be yourself. But no one forgets that he was actually a well-known actor, and if his performances in the award-winning Van Hier till Efficiency were not enough, he would also be remembered for this premier drama about what was then the ultra-taboo subject. was of substance abuse. <br /> <br /> The movie is often referred to as one of the first graphic heroines used (probably the reason behind the certificate) at a time when it was a subject that was still heavily printed underground. Sinatra is in his portrayal of the chief professional, good, despair, despair and sincerity of a man who gives every second chance given to him. His cold turkey scene is much more intense than Ewan McGregor's in Trainspotting. The first co-star to impress is Parker as Machine's demanding needy lame from a woman, using her husband's guilt and sense of duty for all the effects she can. Novak as his secret lover still manages a few moments, but is less of a star than Parker. Stang does his usual comic relief thing, like the clumsy sidekick that walks the leading man with his muscular New York accent. <br /> <br /> Director Otto Preminger allows the pass to slip a little, but it's still a Powerful movie recording, with many unexpected turns and turns, and to be admired as one of the first movies to bring such a grim subject so vigorously to life. ****
