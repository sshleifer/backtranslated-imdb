I have been waiting since October last year to watch this movie! (It was supposed to come out October 1998) and now I've finally seen it. I'm not disappointed. Blood wonderful! OK, it was a bit slow in the beginning, but as soon as it started, it was a very exciting time. Robert Carlyle is so different from Gaza in 'The Full Monty' and Begbie in 'Trainspotting' that it hardly recognizes him! And Johnny Lee Miller, no longer with his Sick Boy of 'Trainspotting' blonde hair, plays his dashing gentleman highway man with the right humor and sensitivity that makes it easy to see why Liv Tylers is attacking Rebecca for him. A good movie. As Hades in Disney's Hercules would say, "Two thumbs are upright!"
