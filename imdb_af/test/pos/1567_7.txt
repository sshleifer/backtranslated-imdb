There is nothing in the story. A young woman steals money from the brave Vermont supermarket where she works, decides to run away to Florida, where he dreams to go to school with her friend Julie and meet a strange couple on the highway. If you remember the elderly couple of "Rosemary's Baby", you have an idea of ​​how these two are. Bill has a comic face and is retired from the army. Sandra is an ex stripper who is now becoming a lorry truck, although we do not find it immediately. They are loving, helpful, and full of common sense. <br /> <br /> They adopt more or less the girl Alice, and promise to give her a ride in their extensive RV, although they don't run directly "to Florida. <br /> <br / > This is where the film could be one hundred percent wrong, all the filmmakers had to do was change the elderly couple into the personification of the evil, and they would take the virgin Alice (handcuffs on the bed or whatever) and sell her body to any Greaseball manager who has a lot of money and likes rough sex. (Alice would have had a little time to escape, with many cut-off efforts, before the final shootings.) But no. beautiful, and Alice is far from virgin, Alice handing Sandra to a client, asking about the business and trying to make a trick herself, bill preventing anything from happening and insisting that she do the job right if she sleeps it They will not do it, they will not talk to her, they will lead her. <br /> <br /> Alice makes a few dogs erd dollar, which is a few hundred dollars more than she had when she met the couple. Bill and Sandra keep her money in the safe where clients will not get it. Alice misunderstood. She doesn't find a very pleasant job, and she thinks she'll never be paid, because Sandra responds every time she asks to drop. "What? Not here, honey. Not in the middle of nowhere." However, after talking to her to hand over her gun to Sandra, the couple gave her the money she wanted, and lovingly gave her free to continue her trip to Florida. <br /> <br /> You know what I'm the most tragic moment in the movie? It has nothing to do with prostitution or theft. Alice expects to come with her girlfriend Julie after she arrives in Miami. July is a legal student. But when Alice gets her friend from Alabama to secure her, she's on her way, but is late, Julie hesitates and says, "Well, my mother doesn't think you should be with us. And to tell you the truth. tell me, my roommate is not cool either. I invited you, but I thought it was just a visit for a week or something. Go back to Milford, Alice "There is a long silence before Alice hangs." br /> <br /> Only one shot is fired (some white frames of film) and no one is hit, tears appear only once, no one swallows anyone, no car explodes in a fireball, no police Chase them in the Interstate. <br /> <br /> The direction is sometimes clumsy, too much cross between Sandra trying to disarm Alice and Alice's hand holding the shaky pistol, and there is almost no musical score. male and female nudity and it is uncomfortable, as is probably supposed to be, Alice is not unattractive, but she is also not babal not. His sports Asian eyes, a kind of robust version of Molly Parker. The cinematography looks cheap and the colors are washed out. The direction is a simple story, with some illuminated flashbacks. Nothing was wasted. And it was apparently shot around Danbury, Connecticut. The city stuck in my mind as I drove through it to one of its floods and remembered the cars jammed with a muddy film to the door handles. <br /> <br /> I don't know exactly what Alice found. (I even fear to think the answer to the riddle is that she found herself.) The play is not bad at all. Judith Ivey is better than that. It is definitely worth seeing, a quiet, orderly film that treats the audience like adults.
