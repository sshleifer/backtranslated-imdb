I'm sorry to see that SURFACE was not included in the NBC 2006-2007 season. I suspect that the market demand for cumbersome gaming and reality shows on broadcast television, a reflection on our cultural sense, won a good story. I hope and pray that some networks pick it up so that it will continue like STARGATE and it's spin-offs. <br /> <br /> I also hope the producers will find a place where they can produce the level of post production in a TV guide. Right now, the reruns will have to do on Sci-Fi, marathons. I'd love to see where the story goes to the tsunami that ended Episode 15. I would like to find the mastermind of the effective effort to alleviate the true identity of the beings. <br /> <br /> FYC Morningbear
