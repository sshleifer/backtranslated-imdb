Although the concept of a 32-year-old woman depicting a 12-year-old girl can be a stretch for today's sophisticated audiences, it was in the 1920s that Mary Pickford fans expected and expected their favorite star. . The opening scene shows Annie's cute character as the apparent leader of a multi-ethnic street gang in a "battle" with a rival. The face of a young girl who is kicked and kicked in the jaw can be a bit rough, but the scene is played in such a "Our Gang" mode that it would be difficult to take it seriously. Anyway, Annie can also fix it and take it. As soon as Annie returns to her home and replaces her street killers with more girlish clothes, it becomes more difficult (especially in close-ups) to introduce this beautiful young woman to a street-like pony. But for those who can measure the required suspension of unbelief, the rest of the movie has the reward. At the scene of the comedy (Annie's gang pointing to a show) (Annie plans a birthday surprise for her Irish policeman's father) to tragedy (her father is being killed on his birthday), the film gives Maria a great opportunity to display a variety of emotions that would satisfy her fans of any era. <br /> <br /> Of course, the required "happy ending" is finally achieved; The unjust are arrested with the help of Annie's friends and rivals and she is last seen in the company of her pals riding on a busy day on a sunny day. What a great way for any Mary Pickford movie to end. <br /> <br />
