So it's a bit dated, it's almost 30 years old. Surprisingly, I did it on BETA tape and it still plays well. If it comes to the DVD, I will fit it into a heartbeat. <br /> <br /> Nowadays, the drug humor is not appreciated, as it was then. Then it wasn't so "harmful". Much like driving without airbags, seat belts and child seats. I can remember my dad crying he laughed so hard to watch it. I had colleagues in the 90's who saw it and I could squeeze them by coming on the intercom and saying, "Iiiiiiiivvvvyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy." <br /> <br /> Big lines, great spoof of the original, and anyway funny to me even three decades later!
