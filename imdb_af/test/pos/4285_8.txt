Another great Tom Wilkinson performance distinguishes 'Separate Lies', a 2005 film that also starred Emily Watson, Linda Bassett and Rupert Everett. Directed by Julian Fellowes, this is the story of a couple, James and Ann Manning, where the man (Wilkinson) believes he and his wife (Watson) are happy together. An accident near their home at night, they have a festival, bring the police around. It's a hit and run that killed their girlfriend Maggie's Bassett man. James becomes suspicious of a neighbor, Bill Bule (Everett) when he sees any damage to his car. He confronts Bule, who admits he did this and promised to go to the police the next day. When James comes home, Ann is angry that he's making such a big deal and says she's driving the car. Of course, James is not so eager to rush to the police. She suggested they call Bule and tell him their decision. "Oh, F___ Bule," James says. "Well, that's just it," Ann says. "I'm Buley." James's destruction is just the beginning in this well-crafted drama. Without giving away the plot, it's a good example of how gender change changes a story. Example of what I mean: Susan Smith drives her car into a lake and her children drown. She gets life in jail. What if the dad did it? The chair. You will be surprised how often the outcome will be different. The same is true here - if it was James who had the affair and did the subsequent activities, viewers could feel different about the story. If Ann were in James's place, it would be crushed. As it is, it is very sad. <br /> <br /> Tom Wilkinson is heartbreaking as a man blinded by the woman he worships, and Emily Watson does a wonderful job as Ann, who once freed herself from her lies - her involvement in the accident and the happy marriage - know what to do. Rupert Everett as Bule is very effective - cowardly, openness and ultimately in need. Everyone here is very civilized in their relationship with one another, and no one is good or bad. <br /> <br /> There are separate lies - James that his marriage is happy, Ann is as mentioned above - and there is one unifying lie - the accident, over which all parties remain silent. That's enough for Ann who knows Maggie. Ultimately, everyone must deal with the separate lies that uncovered the single lie. <br /> <br /> Brilliant movie.
