The deterioration series is wonderful and director PS can't get enough credit to make these movies. I'm a little surprised to see that not many people have seen this one or the other two, but are worth exploring if you want the picture of punk in the transformative years between the late seventies and early eighties. The movie starts with a blurry collection of tracks played on band X music. Many interviews with bands and punks that provide an enlightening perspective on what survivors were like on the low rung of the mainstream stone ladder. No internet, crappy jobs, and everything from hostility clashes in this genre. For new kids who haven't heard of these bands or just started one, this movie is a real lesson in how to rock. All the performances (and there are many) are wonderful, especially FEAR that never stops me from amazement. These and the second installment are wonderful time capsules that offer those who give a rare look to the lives of these crazy people. It's true punk, as in the interview with Darby Crash's girlfriend when they remind a painter who died mysteriously / suddenly outside their home and it took a week or so to find out. They take pictures alongside the old and everyone who has the EMTs on this one and in the true form the interviewer asks the girl whether she was sad or upset that this man was dead while painting their house, the answer " no i hate painters ". How about Black Flag renting their apartment / rehearsal space for $ 16 a month! My khaki almost fell when I rented a ten at ten cups to practice 400 for. Watching this and Deadwood, I feel like I've been born in the wrong time, missing out on those cowboy days and nights. the old way. The film-related people and ties paved the way for the more difficult music today, and they did it in their own unique way. Brilliant movie, ten stars, see part 2 too, it's just fantastic, part 3 though, I don't know what to say.
