Jack Palance, (John Witting), was usually a bad man in most of his films and in this film he showed his great actors over and above my expectations. John Witting returns unexpectedly to his son's farm after years and years of separation. Christopher Walken, (Jacob), has a hard time accepting his father's appearance after he spent the night in the family shed. Jacob's son and younger daughter greet their new grandfather and accept him, like a very old man, at the end of his ropes. Glenn Close, (Sarah Witting), delves into the character of John Witting and begins to convey the truth about what happened to him during his absence from the family. It is a very warm and loving down-to-earth film about real-life events that come and go in most families for generations.
