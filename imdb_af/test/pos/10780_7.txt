Talk Radio sees a man who accidentally stumbles through life, indeed the American Dream, of what bog standard and everyday work he has in a store; Presentation of a local radio program before heading straight to the same work, which has only been syndicated countrywide. It is a role he takes from his own aggression and natural ways, a malignant approach to freedom of speech, as he attacks only everyone and everything, even those who often agree or compliment him. His role as a man who is good, evil, right, wrong, politics, religious, moral and immoral is something that looks like people in one form. that of 'it is entertaining and worth to agree', but additionally on a level of rejection and antagonism ?? two things born out of many things seem to have been encouraged in the professional work life of the Western world. It is the direction of a man as he comes to the very best of his game at the American Dream and to handle freedom of speech when people take to a man but do everything he says. <br /> Talk Radio launches a high-rise, high-rise building in a business-based area of ​​Dallas, Texas. The skyscrapers are shot from a corner and tower over the viewer, plus all others in the general environment, as this one-man voice blows through the images, smiles statements and information on items as these monolithic buildings dominate. They are the physical representation of capitalism, while the voice of what we learn to be a radio DJ is the oral representation of the free west; personal speech and opinions on anything and everything. Stone will make his film exactly the same as he started, although the film is nothing but a circular, as the characters undergo monumental changes in both what they testify and their general existence. The shots of the buildings serve rather than an anchor over which the study is observed. The ideologies and ideas of a way of life exist; people endorse them, but it makes them more angry than good; Before the Restoration, this proud lifestyle still exists and will continue to exist in the variety of people displayed on the screen until someone or something changes drastically. <br /> <br /> The DJ is Barry Champlain, a man with a radio program at a local Texan station who deals with everything. Champlain's somewhat carefree attitude towards a beautiful explosive content is established as he flew a call with a fiancee, who recently visited a Holocaust museum to a young drug addict whose girlfriend is thought to be over-fed and on both assessment and ridicule of a pizza shop is. For us, the content comes across as pretty shocking; For these people, everything looks as usual, planting some serious seeds of both doubt and horror in our minds, newcomers to all of these things. <br /> <br /> What Barry's performance is about, no one ever really looks at: everything and nothing. Indeed, time is taken in the form of jingles or dialogue which is the pre- and post-operative actions immediately before and after Champlain's performance on specific subjects; gardening, for example, and is offered by calm talk and methodical people that I probably won't flash from one random or extreme to another all the time the game increases. One wonders what Barry's jingle is, the kind that plays over lunch during someone else's show: "The Barry Champlain show will appear later! With the idiot and psychotic drug abusers!" Indeed, his performance's introductory piece shows a matter of fact, a scream to the audience, as a hard rock track accompanies it. <br /> <br /> Barry's success comes in the national syndication proposal. It was born of confrontation and a relationship built on the disdain he has for his listeners and what they have for him. Promoting the material and building the game should only be compromised, however far they think they can do it, and whether it is a trace of entertainment, is really worth it. This is when the show reaches this broadcast, after which Barry appears for the first time in his broadcasting life, when an alleged rapist invokes and mostly leaves everyone a bit stunned. It is at this point that the camera on Barry remains silent, and with the depth of focus, the same impending, high-rise buildings that the film has started, stand outside the window directly behind Barry. They remain proud and proud. Specifically, of the ideologies on which they are built, and the promotion of freedom of speech to extend Barry's countrywide as one man climbs his profession, suddenly clashes with the kind of content offered. Everything reaches a point too far, and it must at least be brighter with freedom than just an excitement. <br /> <br /> Oliver Stone made Talk Radio right in the midst of both a fascinating and explosive film-making period in the late 1980s. During this time he made a series of very well-received films in a very short time. start with one of my favorite war movies in Platoon, before going with the rather brilliant Wall Street and finally ending up with the 1991 JFK. One can even say that this run continued in the mid-nineties with Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio is like its main character in the sense that it is loud, thriving, sharp and confrontational. It is not anti-capitalism, as much as it aims to draw a line between what is considered entertainment and which goes too far for the sake of popularity and wealth. Talk Radio is definitely a movie that clings to memory.
