While amusing and amusing to gay audiences, Frank Oz's film "In and Out" is about a gay teacher exhibited by a former national television student. He has been purified and deodorized to appeal to the bigger and more profitable straight viewers. protected "The Bird Cage." Although audiences have probably put themselves on the back because they were tolerant and liberal enough to watch the movie, the movie revolves around Kevin Kline's Howard Brackett, who is a very stereotypical gay man. The film claims that a tendency to discourage music, decorate in Barbra Streisand movies and dress well, indicates the sexual orientation. Like the "Queer Eye", the movie actually takes a handmade slap on straight men and stereotype them as sloppy, dull witted, and lacking in taste and culture. OK, so "In and Out" is just a comedy, but even comedies send messages that can hurt. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, humor in the middle of the film is somewhat pathetic. Howard was middle-aged, deeply closed or self-denied, and apparently never had a sex life. A three-year involvement with a female teacher in the school where he works is described as a series of sunsets, long conversations, and looks at "Funny Lady." Fortunately, Joan Cusack plays Howard's intention, Emily Montgomery, and she steals the show throughout. Most of the film's funniest moments belong to her, though Kline's attempts to resist dancing during a command tape on macho behavior are hilarious. He is a gifted physical artist, but the film only gives him a few moments to shine. Matt Dillon also stands out as the student actor, and the clip from his Oscar-nominated film about a gay soldier is hysterical. However, despite the movie's gay theme, there is no boy-met-boy romance, and just one man-to-man kiss, and the smooch is about as erotic as the one between Michael and Fredo Corleone in Godfather II. <br /> <br /> Although well-meant, "In and Out" fails to address the injustices and prejudices that it illustrates. Howard is dismissed from his teaching duties despite his outstanding achievements and credentials, yet little outrage is expressed. Most characters are more upset about the canceled wedding than about Howard's self-realization, which seems to be overnight, and its sudden and unfair dismissal. Not surprisingly, Howard's parents, portrayed by Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley, exhibited to support him. The pure final, however, is so embarrassing for the audience as it was clear to Howard Brackett in the movie. The movie would have been more refreshing if it was a gay man dressed like a slab, a racial fan of soccer, driving a station wagon, listening to country music and living on fast food. Despite some good performances and funny situations, "in and out" of stereotypes and, whether positive or negative, stereotypes should be sent to the social history trash.
