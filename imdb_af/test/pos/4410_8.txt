I was delighted to see this jewel of a movie on DVD. Despite being a TV movie and shot at 16mm, it provided a wonderful insight into the different types of people who wanted to become a London cabbie, along with their foibles and family ties. Even the most indifferent candidates, "Titanic" with his relentless wife, were able to see Jack Rosenthal, in an entertaining 90 minutes, producing an often funny and sometimes tragic piece of London's life. <br /> <br /> Originally presented as a vehicle for Mick Ford (pun intended), the quality of the acting of an ensemble cast, including Michael Elphic, Nigel Hawthorne, Jonathan Lynn, Lesley Joseph and Maureen Lipman (Mrs Rosenthal) but he had to work hard in the face of such competitive talents. <br /> <br /> Even 15 years after the 1991 release, it's still as fresh as ever!
