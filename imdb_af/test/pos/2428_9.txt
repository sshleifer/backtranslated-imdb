I won't be so sure to accept the DNA tests as irrefutable evidence against Anna Anderson. First read Peter Kurth's book on which this film is based. Anna Anderson knew that only the real Great Duchess Anastasia could possibly know (forensic evidence in Anna's favor aside). Second, compare the pictures of Anastasia and Anna Anderson. Anyone can see that they are one and the same person. Third, visit Peter Kurth's website (url below) where you can read detailed information on the DNA tests, as well as why Franziska Schanzkowska and Anna Anderson are not the same person. (Browse the link, "ANNA-ANASTASIA NOTES ON FRENCH SCHANZKOWSKA"). Even Schanzkowska's family believed their sister and Anna Anderson were not the same person. <br /> <br /> I always believe that HIH Anastasia Nicolevna Romanova and Anna Anderson were indeed the same person; I will never pursue the opposite. <br /> <br /> www.peterkurth.com
