After getting the mini-series "North and South", I could barely wait for the continuation, "North & South II." Then years later, Book III, "HEAVEN & HELL - NORTH & SOUTH - BOOK III." Eventually, the last installment for the Maine and Hazard families continued saga. I was so surprised by this series that I tied every part of the TV and then managed to get family and friends, and I saw it again every time someone wanted to see them new. My ties are old and I am looking for this trilogy on DVD. If you missed Book III, you didn't get full satisfaction and you didn't know how it all turned out. Do yourself a favor and claim this set on DVD!
