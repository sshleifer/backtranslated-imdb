seriously relieve people and just assume that funny is funny, and this movie is f ** king hilarious. Better than the first, and Knoxville really made some for this movie and did more crazier stunts than the first. If Ebert and Roper (I'm not saying I'm a big fan of them) can look at the pure idiot of this movie enough to give it 2 inches, then I think other people can. I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I was on the floor and it's scarce if a successor is better than the original one. This new one believes I have exceeded the first big time. so do what i did, just relax back, try not to burst on some points and laugh your ass off.
