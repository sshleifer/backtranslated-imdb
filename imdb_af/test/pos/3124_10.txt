This film should be so close to making a movie made by John Ford. The movie is magic, a masterpiece, why Ford was, Ford. If you want to know why Ford was good, explain this one. <br /> <br /> Of course, photography is wonderful, black and white, because black and white should be great shots, not a shoulder conversation in it. Pure Ford, great moments, big and small. The well-known torn trousers of Ward Bond. Apparently, two dogs invaded and advanced the set, so Ford wanted to use them in the firing zone, but instead of fighting, one dog ran away and the other attacked Ward Bond and tore his pants. It didn't end Ford. An entire scene to braid a rope. The way Ben Johnson burns, sniffs his rope, wonderful shadow and anticipation of the final. Harry Carey's naive trial of caution. The usual Ford line is to be scared and not to show. Bond's horse accidentally falls into him and it's in the movie. Johnson and Bond are fantastic in that scene. Help any Ford actor who doesn't stay in character while the camera rolls even when a horse falls on top of you. <br /> <br /> A few very nice novels that don't focus on the whole, two very nice clues, not to mention the girls, the number of times the cameras focus on Ben Johnson's proper back. <br /> <br /> Many old stunt people get lines and roles, Cliff Lyons, Frank McGrath. Some wonderful characters mostly study faces that are staring, all the villains and the main stars. A set of villains to compete any group in any west. <br /> <br /> Many Fordian shots of faces, groups, kids, women, little things, foals in the background. , women in aprons, who allow the moment to walk over rivers and the camera. <br /> <br /> This is probably not a western creature as an artist's picture in the west. <br /> <br /> Lucky the movie was made in 1950 because it is impossible to think that such a movie can ever be made again, but then it is such an artwork that it will be a saint to it to try
