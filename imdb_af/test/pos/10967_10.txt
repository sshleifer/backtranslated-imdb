John Cassavette has decided to play as a first film, of course as a shot in New York, not even having a screenplay, and delivering a 1959 feature equal to Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm. All the actors know what to do and say and even the right look in their eyes when they speak. In other words, this is one of the most realistic look at the beating generation, jazzed sweetly in the score and tells a story of racial tension. A group of black brothers and sisters is at the center, with one trying to get better performances than the average strip club, and has a sister, much more light than he, who is entangled with a white man in a relationship, which smashes both sides. However, the film is not exclusively about it; Cassavettes likes to wander his characters in New York City (which didn't do many movies in 1959/1960) and his storytelling is like that of the improvising jazz artists of the day. Dated, sure, but worthwhile for movie buffs; Martin Scorsese called it one of his heaviest influences.
