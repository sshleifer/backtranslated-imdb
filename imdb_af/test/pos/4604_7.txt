The Black Castle is one of those films that found its way to a Boris Karloff collection and is mistakenly expected to be an absolute horror movie. While some horror elements exist in Nathan Juran's movie, it really is a multi-genre piece that is rigidly produced and depicted effectively. To participate in Karloff, in what is a small but critical role, is Richard Greene, Stephen McNally, Lon Chaney Jr., Rita Corday, John Hoyt and Michael Pate. It was produced inconspicuously from Universal International Pictures. The plot sees Greene's English gentleman traveling to the castle house of Bruno's sinister Earl (McNally). He is investigating an investigation into the disappearance of two friends, an investigation that ends up in danger and surprise each time. <br /> <br /> It has everything that fans of the old dark house / castle can wish for. Real good and bad guys, a fair girl, dark corners to do thunder, devil's fall, ticking clock finals and we even get a good old-fashioned little swashbuckling in the bargain. The film is all in action, especially Greene and McNally. While Jerry Sackheim's writing is lean and without the useless stuffing, he has put the similar films of this ilk so often. A recommended film provided that Karloff fans understand it's not really a Karloff movie, and perhaps more important, that horror fans don't expect blood to be the order of the day. A good atmospheric story with a sense of fear throughout, The Black Castle is a good viewing experience. 10/07
