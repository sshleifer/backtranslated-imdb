Although this film is 11 years old, I only rented it yesterday, and I found it to be a very enjoyable movie. The story of true friendship in the face of a very real monster is an inspiration and reasonable touch. <br /> <br /> I don't care much about the amount of language some of the young actors use - especially Renfro - I understand that art imitates life. Renfro does another wonderful job of the difficult, many (and I mean RELATED) disturbed wannabe bully (his role in the client occurs), and Mazzello does a wonderful job of the witty, somewhat peculiar Dexter - a child who realizes that his life must end too soon. <br /> <br /> While there are so many and funny moments in the movie, I must say my favorite was when the boys were heard by Pony. In the deserted church, and Dexter (Mazzello) cut himself and said his blood was poison. While very resourceful and somewhat amusing to see a grown man running away from two little kids, it is one of the most difficult scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> Definitely this one, but prepare with your Kleenex - you'll need it!
