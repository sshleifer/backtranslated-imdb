I'm 15, usually not kids, my age usually looks at these old classic movies. But this is one of my favorites. I was totally addicted to watching it for the first time. It's really good if you think about technology and movies back in that time, music is great, storyline is right, choreography is good, see it. I don't know why there is a prequel for this movie. Not many people like this movie, but I love classic movies, they are so much better than movies! This movie will make you smile, cry and start dancing. The music is absolutely about catching and beautiful. I haven't seen Dirty Dancing 2 Harvana Nights (prequel), prequel must star the original actors, that's what I hate about prequels, they ruin the original. Nobody wants a prequel, they want a successor. Many people would agree that for a movie - the original, successor and the third one is enough. In addition, people are not bothered to see it. Who remembers the movie about St Benard Beethoven? I think there are a total of 5 movies.
