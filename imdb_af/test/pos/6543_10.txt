The movie started, the wheels turned, your car had a race against the Fox. You're behind you can't be front, you figure, "If I go out, I'll take you with me ..." You smash in the cars parked on the side of the road, you turn Fox, but your purpose is bad. Afraid, you went on the back of a VW and you broke you landed. in a reservoir. Your car lights up. You can get out if you want, but the shame to lose has taken you ... BANG! Your car blows, everyone looks in despair, some cry ... The sound of a siren tells you that the police are coming. Everybody gets in their cars and bolts so you burn. The charred remains of the cart frame sit there and haunt the viewers. You're dead. <br /> <br /> It's one of the screens; actually it's the first scene in the movie. There is much more to it. As you enter the Fox's cabin in his played V8 suburb, Terry Serio in his crazy GTHO, and many others in this past blast .... John Clarks Masterpiece, "RUNNING ON EMPTY" "He'll win against any cost "
