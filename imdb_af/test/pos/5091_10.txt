It's a wonderful love story. I like the songs, but even if you don't, you must love the story. Peter O'Toole is at his best and Petula Clark is also doing well. I only saw it when I was about 13 and then loved it. Now in my forties I still enjoy it, probably even more. Let me still cry and laugh and feel good. It's a movie to just watch with a new-aged man or yourself, as it's a chick spot. But what's wrong with that? Need some romance and maybe a little cry, try this movie. <br /> <br />
