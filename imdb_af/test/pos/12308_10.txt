The Argentine music poet, Atahualpa Yupanqui, once said that some folk music is repeated on any country of the world. They look the same, but everybody sees them as their own folk music ... <br /> <br /> This movie, as I feel it, is about the same music that is world-wide at some point in every country's history repeat. First, some listen to it and try to make the others hear. Then some believe they hear it, but they don't. Then no one says anything and some people seem to listen to it. And others admit they heard it, but didn't think others would hear it. Finally, everyone listens to the same music, and suddenly it doesn't sound any longer. <br /> <br /> Love and poetry, as a true nationalism and the legacy of a father to his children ... <br /> <br /> Why would he call the movie, The Dead, as no one don't die? The Spanish translation of the title refused to follow the same rule and we call it Dubliners, after James Joyce's title ... <br /> <br /> A fun 1900 Irish filmed postcard!
