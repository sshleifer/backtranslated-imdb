Before I forget, let me say the artwork here is outstanding. From rubbish bins to the big ship, the drawings are beautifully finished. If it isn't animated, critics will reward the "direction" in it because it's really good. <br /> <br /> For the story: Sylvester picks up the garbage at the shipyards, but the pickins are slim. While he was brewing at the dock next to a large ship, he saw Tweety in his cage. Tweety also touches him, and you know his first remark - the same one he always makes when he protrudes the cat. Anyway, Sylvester walked over, opened the gate, and said, "Hello, breakfast!" Tweety hit the porthole window on his face and said, "You've got your old pepper!" The cat falls into the water. <br /> <br /> The uncivilized Sylvester cuts back aboard the ship, taps into Tweety's cabin, grabs him and is ready to go when - what! - There is 'Grandma' at the door with her umbrella. Sylvester, like the old lady again, protects her pet. But, "flippety gibbet," said Grandma, "I dropped my glasses. I can't see anything." Heavens to Betsey, where are the cheaters. "Now Sylvester has the upper hand .... and the usual cat-try-catch-bird shenanigans are back on, like Grandma's glasses. Sylvester's smartest act was to take her glasses and a picture of Tweety on them. When she wakes up and offends, she sees the bird and thinks it's good. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very entertaining animated card that was fun to watch, as you can with the quotes tell me, I like the dialogue in some of these old cartoons.
