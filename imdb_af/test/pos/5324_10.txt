Every roll, up to the smallest, was thrown with bravado and performed. <br /> <br /> The extraordinary Jena Malone never takes a slip. Her two co-stars are equal to her in this movie. Ryan Gosling can be the best actor of his generation. Chris Klein gives his best performance to date. This is a thought and conversation-producing film that should be seen by teenagers and young adults. You will think and talk about this movie for days. Highly recommended.
