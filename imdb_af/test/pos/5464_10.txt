Striking story of backstabbing behind the curtains. The movie follows the fate of David Letterman and Jay Leno as they struggle for the elusive Tonight Show spot. Letterman led his desire for the coveted time slot and Leno led by his agent and small devil-on-the-shoulder, Helen Kushnick. <br /> <br /> Kathy Bates (Kushnick) is excellent in this movie, alienating herself from such top dogs as Bob Wright, Warren Littlefield, and Howard Stringer. By the end of the movie you are so worried about how she handles every situation of gas booking to slow down, that you want yourself more. <br /> <br /> John Michael Higgins (Letterman) plays his part in the tea. Sometimes I wondered if he was a relationship with the right Letterman. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in entertainment or the world of corporate negotiation.
