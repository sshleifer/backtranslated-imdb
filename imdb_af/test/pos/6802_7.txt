It was one of the first color films I saw at the cinema when I was a kid. It's good to remember. The girl, Liz Taylor, who later became a beautiful woman, played with the small and excellent actor Mickey Rooney. The content of the movie plot is good for all ages, good will and behavior. Good ethics of Velvet's parents, especially her mother, is something to consider. Our generations must be well educated and this film can help to this end. Velvet loves the horses and race, and Mi Taylor (Rooney) brought her to an international horse race competition in England. In the end, the young Velvet won, but was disqualified because they were female.
