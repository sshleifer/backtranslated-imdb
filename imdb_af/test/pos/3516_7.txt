A quick glance at the forefront of this movie would seem to indicate only another dumb 80's inboard / backwood slash party; the kind where sex equals death and the actors are all annoying stereotypes that you really want to die. But, "JBD" produces significantly more. <br /> <br /> Instead of focusing on naked flesh and gore (although there is a bit of each - no gender), the movie focuses on providing threatening / upward tension amidst a beautiful scenery. These feelings are further enhanced by a cast of realistically nice characters and antagonists who are more amorous than carton definitions of evil. Oh yes, George Kennedy is here too and when isn't that a good thing? <br /> <br /> If you kept "wrong", look to see how much of his methodology came from.
