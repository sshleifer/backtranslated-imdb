While not for everyone, Crackerjack is a pleasure to watch, with the tongue firmly planted in the cheek. The similar character of Jack Simpson, played by Mick Molloy, bumps the local "bowlo" for free parking and bucks a few dollars and sells the parking space to colleagues. When the Bowling Club members have to raise money to save their club, they call on Jack to join their bowling team and play competition bowls. <br /> <br /> Filled with Aussie Charm, shows the laconic white of Mick Molloy (he also wrote the script), reminding the viewer of his previous work in Radio. Perfect Aussie with Bill Hunter as Jack's bowler mentor Stan Coombes, John Clarke (of The Games boast) as the ruthless businessman and competitive bakkie owner, Bernie Fowler, with Samuel Johnson as Jack's flat mate Dave, and Judith Lucy as the dressed journalist, Nancy. . <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought only Molloy fans wanted to keep this movie, but judging by the number of the blue bobbin set, the cinema is a movie for everyone.
