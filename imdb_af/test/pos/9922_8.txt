This is the standard rate of a director who has long been my favorite. <br /> <br /> Although it is very flat compared to many of its other work, but its Argento and it can be biased, but I'm going to give it a good review anyway. <br /> <br /> It contains many good ideas. The subtle voyeuristic element. The needles under the eyes. The boring and disturbing deaths. And the Argento clich√© flashback. <br /> <br /> Supports include the heavy metal soundtrack, acting and the end. <br /> <br /> All the movie is made worthwhile for the birds in the theater order near the end. <br /> <br /> A pretty good movie from Argento, but he did better. Much better!
