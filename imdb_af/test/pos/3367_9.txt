I have to say that some of the other reviews of this movie I have read show very little understanding of the original TV show it came from. Dad's army was a sitcom and therefore has humor and therefore he must have a smile on the face of the difficult situation. The series, however, carried very serious messages such as the episode 'Branded' over the joists and ignorance attached to conscientious objectors. The film was true to the series and was simply like an extended episode. So I'm scared that the reviewer who claimed that Columbia had improved the humor was totally wrong and we faced it. The BBC's works of this period have beaten everything that came from America's hands. Also comment on propaganda was also off the point. The Hemeguard were people who were found innocent of frontline services that still wanted to serve. They were very brave men who knew they were sentenced to death as soon as they reported, as Hitler had announced that anyone who did so would be executed if and when Britain was invaded. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to make the record straight, as it is always good to actually talk and comment on what has been seen, rather than compiling it as you go.
