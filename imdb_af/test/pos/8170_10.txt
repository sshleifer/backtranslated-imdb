I might be a sentimentalist. But I really moved this movie. It was the first movie that reduced me to tears. And it did more than once !! I recommend it to everyone gay and str8. Religious or not! Supporting co-star Jackie Bisset stole the show, especially with her one linen. The naaktonele was also excellently produced, and everything in was good taste. Most shocking was the portrayal of the orientation reversal programming introduced by the Mormon Church to the main character. It shocked me that it was still in the world. Yet I enjoyed this movie immensely. It's been the best gay movie ever since Torch Song Trilogy. And much better than the other gay movie that was presented that year - The Fluffer.
