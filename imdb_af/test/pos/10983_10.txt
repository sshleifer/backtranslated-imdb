If Hollywood had the welfare of the audience at heart, we would see 20 movies a year with the kind of healthy strength behind this movie. There are several experiences of personal growth in this movie and while the characters are still very human, even the lessons learned are not that greed will earn you, or do-to-other-what-you-like things -long-like-you This is what our sad, irreconcilable lives need, more sense ... more love ... more do-it-yourself-like-you-want-to-you ... more hope . (thanks Ursula!) This movie has an intelligent white, not 'yo'mama' cracks running in the so-called comedies. People need to feel good. This movie will make you feel good and may inspire you to improve your life and the lives of others. Side notes Each person counts in ticket sales. It's a truly independent movie. If you want more quality movies, support them.
