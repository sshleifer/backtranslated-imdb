I own a video store with hundreds of documentaries. I saw many of them and love all the great information out there. Just a small hand even comes close to providing information that is so important. I read other people's reviews of this movie and can't help but notice that the most important things people criticize are irrelevant. Like "It is very one-sided". Such a pathetic criticism, where in the society you look, you will see the other side, and if you still need help, go to globalpublicmedia.com. "These are the same people over and over." Uh can be led to believe these people are the experts, so maybe they are the best people to support. "Filming style is all the same, shots with a few exceptions." If you want to flash and dazzle, look at Micheal Moore if you want the information to look true documents like this one. Since you cannot see any of these complaints, it is relevant to the information contained. My guess is that these people just miss the point and don't want to give it. <br /> <br /> My recommendation: Watch it. Learn from it and continue with your training on such subjects. These are very important things for everyone.
