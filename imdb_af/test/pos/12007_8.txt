Fun movie! The writing is terrible, but the quality of the actors saves the day. John Hurt is perfect, just like Jane Alexander. Beau Bridges is fair and the actress playing his wife is very poor. The story is the true star. Based on a true story, the pace moves well and the whole concept of East Germany escapes you and holds you in. Joyful end gives enough temptation to compensate for writing. Don't expect the Oscar qualification, but it's a good ride for the whole family.
