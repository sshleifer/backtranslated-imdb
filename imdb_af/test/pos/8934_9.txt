I always loved Brenda Blethyn and "Undertaking Betty" was no disappointment. I saw it on satellite on a thirsty Sunday morning. Life is stressful and this movie made me laugh and see things that we usually enjoy in a joyful way. I wish she would make more movies like this and "Save Grace." Brenda Blethyn is a big gal for us to see 60 in action. She is cute, beautiful and full of life without preventing plastic and evil. Not many actresses are out there to relate to us in a realistic but comical and / or serious way. Brenda - if you see it - stay with gems like this. We need more Mrs. Bennetts, Bettys and Graces.
