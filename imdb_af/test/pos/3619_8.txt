As is often the case when you try to take a 400-plus page book and capture it in a two-hour movie, many are lost. Here, director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) is taking an extremely ambitious project and almost takes it out. What we get is a beautiful and emotional compelling movie that somehow looks incomplete. <br /> <br /> There's a lot about this movie that is great and fantastic. The cinematography by John Toll (Combatograph for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, Oscars for both) is wonderful. Working with Madden, the choices for places on the Greek island of Cephalonia are wonderful and the visual images that come from these majestic locations in varying light are lazy and beautiful. Madden also uses many Greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town a real feel. The soundtrack is also fantastic and the mandolin passes and stamps of the Italian soldiers are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian profession and romance, which makes up the bulk of the film. . There are many sweet and funny moments throughout this segment. However, by the time the serious throttle drums are ready to unfold, there are not many movies in the bobbin and this component is being rushed and shortened. While the battle scenes are being done well, it is clear that there are increasingly greater compromises for running the film for too long. By the time we reach the post-war screens, the treatment is just skeleton. Another negative is that the DVD is exceptionally thin on features. <br /> <br /> Nicholas Cage loves the romantic lead role as the sentimental Captain who apparently joined the army to rather sing than fight. When he fights, Cage must link seamlessly into a man of rigorous principles and solve it and somehow remain faithful to both. <br /> <br /> Penelope Cruz, who loves the camera, gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia. In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen, but Cruz just seems to be calm in a part that has to be emotionally urgent and dynamic. She allows the character to reflect on Corelli's love interest, rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right. <br /> <br /> John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows so much about nature as medicine. However, Christian Bale looks a little overwhelmed and tight as Pelagia's fianc√©. <br /> <br /> I reviewed this movie an 8/10. Despite a few drawbacks, it's a touch movie that's worth seeing. Photography alone is worth the price of admission.
