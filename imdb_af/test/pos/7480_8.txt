Very violent and nicely filmed film. Paulina is a bad sexy girl who will show that men can also be raped. This movie has a lot of black humor. This man would kill anyone just to forget he was a gunman. There will sometimes be if you don't want to know if you have to shake or smile and don't think, "I'm laughing at someone killing people?"
