I'm not really viewer - except between the ages of 6 and 8 and the "General Hospital" still had Luke and Laura - but there are a few exceptions and I definitely think King or Queens is one of them. Every decade it has classics and I think this performance (or damnation) will be the best of these decades. The comic timing is wonderful and can sometimes deviate. On a more serious note, the actors manage to wear subtly - and not so subtly :) - complexities in their characters without becoming hokey. One commentator wrote that it might take a few episodes to get there and I agree; It's definitely one that grows on you, but once you're done, you're pretty much hooked. And for good reason!
