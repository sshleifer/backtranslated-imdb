I borrowed the three Sarah movies from a friend and looked ill during one weekend. I thoroughly enjoyed each one of them. I enjoyed how the last movie gave a glimpse of what Caleb and his sister were when they grew up. In addition, I liked the performance of the "Billy-boy" song that was first heard during the credits of the first film, entitled "Sarah, Plain and Tall." The one thing I didn't like in Winter's End was the youngest daughter. She was a very cute girl, but she had just too much spirit and looked like a brat compared to the other kids, even when compared to talkative, yet good Caleb when he was younger.
