In these modern times (as a subject known to the director of the short film that this German score is going to speak?), Politically correct films are the "leitmotiv" of modern young film producers' projects. "Shoulder arms" by Mr Charlie Chaplin during WWI (the film released just a few weeks before the ceasefire) is a clear example of why early film pioneers were a very brave people! To lead a humorous movie inspired by terrible life, was the bloody First World War a complicated matter that only a few directors could be allowed with those dangerous and daring ideas? To venture on such a delicate business, and successfully reserved only for genius. <br /> <br /> As this German score said, "Shoulder Guns" were made during WWI, that time in which the whole world certainly lost its innocence (Fortunately not the German fianc√©e of this aristocrat?) and that is a hilarious, inventive social satire about that and any war. The film is full of perfect gags and entertaining movie continuity for a story in which the tramp will live, but risky and brave adventures in front? Or a hero for the allies ?? or not. <br /> <br /> To mock the war graves, the ill health, the frontal attacks and the Germans (how dare you !!. By the way, there are many inaccuracies in the movie? not to mention that the Kaiser had many medals in his uniform?) in an elegant, funny and delicate way, even today a film miracle is impossible to surpass. Keeping in mind the terrible war time conditions, the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent. It is clear that Mr. Charlie Chaplin had a lot of it. <br /> <br /> And now, if you allow me, I have to take my leave temporarily, because this German Count must go back to the Schloss trenches. <br /> <br /> Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien http://ferdinandvongalitzien.blogspot.com/
