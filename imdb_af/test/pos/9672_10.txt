Family Guy must be my favorite cartoon. It's definitely the funniest TV program ever made and is better than The Simpsons. I have never laughed so hard at a TV program in my life. The things that make the show so funny are the plot, characters and themes that are dealt with in the show. There are very few themes not dealt with at Family Guy. <br /> <br /> I just saw just about every episode of Family Guy ever made and should say the show was better in the first two seasons. My favorite characters are Peter because he is very funny and is the best character of the show. My second favorite character is Stewie because he is the funniest villain to be on a TV. show.If you like Family Guiy, you have to watch American Dad, as it's similar and created by Seth McFarlane. I hope this show never ends because it's a comic genius! 10/10
