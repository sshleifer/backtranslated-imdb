Milo is an exaggerated and understated horror flick from the late 90's, but the feeling and atmosphere is more than an 80's horror flick. Looks like a lot of little girls at Milo's father's office, a gynecologist, and a reward to see what's in pots (yes, a gynecologist plus something else ...) "doctor" with Milo . Hmm, his first patient and he lost her. Now Milo is a creepy little child who always wears a yellow rainbow, rain or shines, and he speaks funny .... but it's not all that is strange to him. Fast forward to the present where these girls are adults and there is a wedding planned for one of them, but tragedy strikes and leaves one girl who has come in from outside the village, with the choice of replacing her friend as school teacher or not she does. And then strange things start to happen again. Which of course involves this little baby in a rain slide. It's not too violent or graphic, but has a clear creepiness that you don't get in many modern horror flicks, and it's worth seeing. One wonders why it is so hard to find any good horror flakes in this day and age, but here is one that is criminally overlooked and definitely worth your time if you look it up. 8 out of 10.
