It is a breeze of highly entertaining drama with an excellent role. Garfield is fine as a boxer hiding with the police with deadly crew Dead Dead Kids. The most striking of these is the beautiful Billy Halop who has a few very moving moments. Gloria Dickson, who died very young in a domestic fire in real life, is strong and very attractive as Halop's sister, and in the early scenes Ann Sheridan, on the edge of the stars, is a knockout. May Robson be very funny like a crunchy old grandmother, but Claude Rains proves here that even a big actor can rock if it goes wrong (who thought of him as a tough New York policeman). <br /> <br /> Here, Busby Berkeley proves that he was a good director with or without musical numbers. The movie moves at a tremendous pace and the water tower range is very exciting and well-photographed. The end is confronted, and the plot is not disturbing or original, but I still have a very pleasant experience.
