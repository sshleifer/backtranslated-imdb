Another decent presentation of Vince Gilligan's pen. <br /> <br /> A front "Malcolm in the Middle" Bryan Cranston plays Patrick Crump, a distorted man who eventually shoots Mulder over the gun and drives him at high speed. . It has something to do with its serious ringing ring (and possible lethal burning - its wife just experienced it), and the pressure just seems to be relieved by going to the left corner. Only Mulder can relate to this man's fate, and actually be connected to his farmer before the entire night drive is complete. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Scully looks the case with a possible solution for Mr. Crump solved and will meet them at sea. Check it out to see if we can join Dynamic Duo at the Pacific Ocean, or somehow Fix Crump's big problem.
