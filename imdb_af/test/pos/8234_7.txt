Note the wide-ranging date of August 8, 1945 - about a week before Japan surrendered in World War II, so there will probably be a message for us in "Over 21". Irene Dunne (This happens one night, the 1939 version of Love Affair) is Paula Wharton, who will live on an army base while her newspaper editor is in training school. Alexander Knox (the longest day) is her husband Max. Look for Charles Coburn (Monkey Business, Lord Prefer Blondes) as the stuffy, commander, newspaper boss. Also look for Cora Witherspoon as Mrs. Gates, The Women, Bank Dick, Libeled Lady. War story written for the woman's point of view, which was not too common in those days. fun commentary on the detached condition of "married housing"; Irene's wardrobe in this movie was definitely not at all. Since they never had to leave their little house, the whole movie budget seems to have been spent on her beautiful dresses and hats.
