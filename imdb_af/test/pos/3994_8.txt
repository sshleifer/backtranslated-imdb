This film, which Im Kwon-Taek won the best director in Cannes in 2002 (linked to PT Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), deals with a 19th-century Korean painter with common roots and a significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths of the film is that I try to help us see the eye of a painter, so we see more screens and objects that help our drunken painter, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik), receive inspiration. <br /> <br /> The costumes and the arts are all impressive and the acting is even good. It's not a movie that moved me, but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it. It's pretty cool. It is also interesting to see a version of Korea in those times before the beginning of the century, where Chinese and Japanese forces are both in Korea and the Chosun kingdom comes to an end. More than one revolution and political ideology is collected in the film, but is never the centerpiece. It is solid on the painter. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a good movie about the life of a painter. But it doesn't exactly plot the usual three-action structure, so you should take a non-standard Hollywood story to see it. Yay for art! 8/10
