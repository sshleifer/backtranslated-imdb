Although it cannot be Cassavetes' best work, Minnie and Moskowitz are almost perfect in all his efforts. The plot is quirky and charming, and surprisingly dramatic with an impressive array of emotions - much more drama than comedy, unlike IMDb's profile. Yes, the story is whimsical, but not arbitrary; It manages to be credible, though a touch is forced - for which I return. All the artistic aspects are of the true Cassavetes form: the cinematography and camera work is delightful, and the soundtrack - though rare - is free. In addition, I noticed a few nods for Godard and so on in the editing - as I did in a few Cassavetes' other films - (the sudden cut of a song in one scene). This is interesting. <br /> <br /> I feel the plot is beautifully built, with the first half being particularly enjoyable. For example, Seymour's conversation with Morgan Morgan (Timothy Carey) in dinner is wonderful and fascinating, and sets the tone for the philosophical commentary made throughout the film. This philosophy - a tradition in Cassavetes' films - is what made the film for me. Seymour's amusing and profound monologues eliminate the first impressions he can have of him as a hippie - even though his character is strangely similar to that of his faces (1968). However, this (at the second show) testified to me that it was on Cassavetes' best work. I got a love for this movie I miss on the first show. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, there are several aspects that make this movie imperfect. I find the plot unbalanced. As I said earlier, it builds nicely, but it weakens here and there, especially at the end. Due to the spontaneous style in which Cassavetes worked, and especially the freedom with which he allowed his actors to improvise, the quality of his product could somehow be easy. In this case it is inconsistent. I judge that most of this film has been improvised, and most of it is beautiful. But one or two scenes unfortunately do not work. In particular, the scene after Seymour fought with Minnie's work was associated outside her home. While intended to be the most intense scene of the film, Cassavetes allowed his actors to freely release the dialogue - assuming some were pre-planned. I believe it was a mistake. One gets the impression Cassel does not quite know what to do, as he repeatedly falls into his speech, often does not make sense and overwork It all damages the scene and character development. I understand Seymour is meant to be a little foolish, but Cassel's efforts here are wrongly applied. Why does he cut off his mustache? These errors are due to: a lack of direction on the Cassavetes section; lack of understanding and understanding on Cassel's part; lack of rehearsal and preparation; etc. Of course, Cassavetes did not learn from his mistakes, as he allowed the same thing in his next film, a woman under the influence (1974) to happen the same. <br /> <br /> The mistakes I mention are not minor, but they do not destroy the movie. They merely make a few scenes worthy and unrealistic, spoil the flow of the film and impair its potential. However, I am very, very fond of Cassavetes and all his actors, especially Cassel, despite the mistakes I have made. This is a very enjoyable film, though it is proven that the Cassavetes style is very indifferent.
