Shame represents a high point in a master's career. Ingmar Bergman urgent, existential study of a couple on the island of Gotland who persuaded a long war to survive. Liv Ullman and Max Von Sydow give painstakingly detailed performances in this savings, drama drama. The film intensity is based on Bergman's focus at the moment, intimate relationships of his two characters - both completed musicians - trapped in a landscape they have ceased to understand. We see how the external pressure of the war complicates and destroys their relationship. Both characters are forced by the material circumstances of the war to betray their own ethical sense. In one of the most powerful episodes, Bergman forces us to reflect on the manipulative power of the movie medium by showing us a filmed interview with Ullman's character that is revived and distorted for political effect on one side of the conflict and is used on the other hand, as evidence of war crimes in a brutal interrogation scene. <br /> <br />
