It was very good, except for two things I would mention at the end. The animation is great, highlighted by Nick Park and the brand of exaggerated teeth and mouths of the characters that leave you almost every time you see someone. The color was also wonderful. <br /> <br /> However, the best part of the movie is the clever comedy that is woven throughout. This is yet another of these animated movies in which there is so much to see each frame and hear that it will require many views to catch all the gags. It's just a nice exaggerated look at the oddball "Wallace" and his silent and clever dog "Gromit." Along the way, it's fun people who are carried away with their vegetable gardens, something similar to how the obsessive dog lovers are portrayed in the best of the shoulder. <br /> <br /> My only complaints were two typical features of today's movies, animated or not: 1 - let's look the spiritual in the movie like a total idiot; 2 - Let us redo the final action scene with the predictable result, but exaggerated. On the one hand, it is still a very amusing movie that has many laughs and a movie that has to be enjoyed several times.
