Angela (Sandra Bullock) is a computer expert, but she is shy and a bit of a rest. She does all her work from the boundaries of her apartment. Just as she wants to take a vacation in Mexico, a co-worker sends her a computer disk with disturbing information about it. Angela agrees to meet with her co-worker, but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash. Angela heads to Mexico, but takes the disk with her. Swearing on the beach, a wonderful search engineer, Jack (Jeremy Northam), made her deliberations. She fell for them and the two ended on a boat to Cozumel. However, Jack works for the people who generated the secret information on the disk and he's out to get it. Even after Angela escaped from his clutches and returned to the US, Jack made things difficult. He changed Angela's identity on every computer across the country, losing her apartment, her bank account. Can Angela, a computer worm, beat Jack in his own game? This very exciting movie has many assets. First, Bullock and Northam are two very beautiful, interesting actors and their presence adds immediate fascination. The writing is very clever and certain in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today's world. The costumes, sets, production and direction of the movie are also wonderful. And despite how it sounds, there is a lot of exciting action when Angela goes to defeat her enemy. If you like thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence, it's a good choice. It delivers high frequency turns and turns, making it possible for the viewer to "just" make a very good evening of entertainment.
