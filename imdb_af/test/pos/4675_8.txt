I enjoyed this movie. More than I expected. It has enough action, plot and places to make it worthwhile. While I can't see Mark Wahlberg as leader, he has become good enough to be a trusted manager and that's OK. <br /> <br /> The superhero of the movie is the Mini Cooper. It is shown that the speed, dexterity and muscle of any work come down. And to handle a maniac driver like Charlize Theron's character.
