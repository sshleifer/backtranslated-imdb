I watched this series on PBS in the eighties and still watch the old bands every few years or so. Very atmospheric and creepy sometimes. This is a very good show, as the characters all well defined and acted. You are signed into the plot and take care of these people. The villains are angry, especially the Nottingham Sheriff. Man, I'd like to knock the s - t out of that snotty bastard. Nicholas Grace does an excellent job and had the Sheriff had a wonderful time. His sweep boy, Mr Guy, is equally hooked, but is also pathetic. Many murder and abuse in this series, along with tons of black magic and devil worship and things of that kind. I noticed that this is a children's television award that is surprising. If I had children, I wouldn't show them. Outstanding use of places in this display as well. It's now on DVD, so go out and buy it.
