Paul Thomas Anderson's attractive and compelling recording on the 70-year-old porn industry follows Eddie Adams, also known as Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), through six years of gender, drugs and disco. His accidental encounter with porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds) began his career as one of the greatest adult actors of the time. Dirk's character is based on real porn actor John Holmes, who, like Dirk, was known for being extremely kind. This is where Dirk achieved the first success. <br /> <br /> The main themes in Boogie Nights are obvious with regard to a movie of this genre; pornography, drugs, sex, treason, violence and music. Boogie Nights deals with the pornographic theme with some control. It is not transferred and the sex scene is surprisingly minimal, but mentally explicit when it is on the screen. <br /> <br /> In the film, cocaine is abusively abused, and the film's environment, Los Angeles 1977-1983, reflects the popularity of the drug at that time, which captured the film. However, Boogie Nights does not promote cocaine, as there are screens that include addiction and overdoses. For example, at Jack's party, they find a girl recently and graphically overdose; blood pours out of her nose and she starts an unconscious fit. The film, in front of these scenes, was pretty optimistic and comical, but from this point the darkness moved it. <br /> <br /> The musical scenes are performed brilliantly, from spectacular scenes to a down-and-out Dirk terrifyingly in his new music career. The soundtrack is also excellent, with songs from The Emotions, ELO, The Beach Boys and the unforgettable sound experience. The striking scene in the whole movie comes down to the music; Dirk, Redd Rothchild (John C. Reilly) and Todd Parker (Thomas Jane) visit drug dealer Rahad Jackson's home (Alfred Molina) to earn quick money to sell fine drugs, but the Northern Ranger's sister Christian, who is in the Background, Increasing the intensity of the scene, and proving that music can bring so much more depth to a scene. Boogie Nights is filled with such scenes, making the movie even more fantastic. <br /> <br /> The striking show in Boogie Nights is Burt Reynolds as the enigmatic, yet moody movie director. In the scene where he attacked a young man to hit his movies, it was a complete shock to the audience, because before that time he was reasonably soft and content. Other notable performances are Julianne Moore, Heather Graham as the beautiful Rollergirl, John C. Reilly, and Mark Wahlberg, who are performing his career. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is also a surprisingly original movie with general-purpose themes but filmed in its own sharp and realistic way. Anderson's approach has captured these characters completely in a time when nothing went wrong or at least until the 80's. From then on, things are becoming very dark, and all the signs of the recognizable characters and situations of the first part of the movie have disappeared. However, this does not reduce the high level of entertaining entertainment that this film offers. <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights was not a cash success, earning just Â£ 2m at UK theaters. But it's not the film's or the director's concern. Anderson acknowledges quality, not popularity, as evidenced by his three other films, Hard Eight, Magnolia and Punch-Drunk Love. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a simple parable with excellent and variable situations, because at the end of this movie you will realize that Boogie Nights is a simple morality story, but one that will stay in mind after you look got it. Boogie Nights is immediately shocking, hilarious, devastating and both visually and audibly excellent.
