If I didn't see the 1936 version of this story, I can't offer a comparison there. However, I can say that Stephen Sondheim's musical treatment of this story is absolutely genius. Only Sondheim can find music and lyrics that die in their own right, yet perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject. If someone has an explanation of what a dark comedy is, they should see it (and Dr Strangelove) as well. When mrs. Lovett from the "worst pies in London" to a booming business with high praise, we do not speak "Soylent Green", but the ingredients are similar. Especially brilliant is the song where Mrs. Lovett's idea to Mr. Todd instead. Even in the introductory number, the line "... they shaved their Maker flawlessly ..." gives a good indication of the point of departure, the drama and the comedy that comes. Outstanding!
