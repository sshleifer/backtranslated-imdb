Can you catch the moment? When do you first hear rain on a roof? Some things are beyond the sum of their parts, which express the poetry of life. The things that matter. <br /> <br /> Thicker Dylan Thomas caught the seemingly unspeakable. "A good poem helps ... to expand everyone's knowledge of himself and the world around him." (Bob Dylan called him after him). So why did it take so long to make a movie of the great Dylan Thomas? A simple biopsy could have missed the point. Author Sharman Macdonald took a different, better approach. <br /> <br /> In The Edge of Love she creates the world of passion and complexity that fills the poems so we can swim in it. The lives of four friends. Dylan, who desires and loves abundantly. Woman Caitlin (Sienna Miller), his inventive support. War hero William (Cillian Murphy), who rescues him from a street rumor. And then there is his childhood darling. Vera. Dear Vera. Take your breath away Vera. She is Caitlin's closest friend. William's wife. And, like a muse, the 'star' in Dylan's dark sky. <br /> <br /> It all starts in the 1940 London Blitz, with bomb shelters in the Underground. Perform Vera (an impressive Keira Knightley) under the preliminary stage lights. She met Dylan for the first time in years, her heart was flushed. Their eyes shone through the smoke of the room. The purity of their previous passion. Dylan (native Welsh speaker, Matthew Rhys) is not sanctified, purified poet. Master of his vices, he must fully experience them. He introduces his beloved wife, and continues with Vera. <br /> <br /> The Edge of Love is a visual surprise. The soundtrack will gladly leave you. Performances are probably the best by these actors in their careers. As a sumptuous love story, it's pretty good. As insight into Dylan Thomas and the reality of poetry in all our lives, not at all bad. And as a tribute to a great man, inspire. <br /> <br /> The production is busy projecting the spirit of Dylan Thomas without harming the historical accuracy too much. Dramatic tension is a draw between artistic freedom and conventional morality. Audiences looking for an experience based on the latter can be disappointed. And it will play less well for audiences whose borders are that of Albert Square. <br /> <br /> Sharman Macdonald was aware of the cardinal nature of artistic freedom and its boundaries when she was with producer Rebekah Gilbertson (granddaughter of the true William and Vera). "Think of all the things you don't want me to write," she said, "because I have to have a carte blanche." For Macdonald, the boundaries were as if she were offending Dylan's memory. But for many artists, especially men, the boundaries the woman and family can set on them are. A woman is not going to interfere with lofty ideas with hands-on common sense issues, and will even set her children's interests ahead of her own. (It sometimes happens the other way around, as when the wide genius Virginia Woolf refused to love her, Leonard brought her to earth - in hours). <br /> <br /> Despite the tension between Caitlin and Vera, these two women become closest friends. This is one of the most important (and very beautiful) themes of the film. <br /> <br /> The film's colors tell a story in themselves. In an attempt, wartime Britain, Caitlin and Vera are lively highlights in a gray ocean. Shortly after meeting with Vera's league stage person, we hit Caitlin through her blue blue eyes, sparkling in a darkened railway. Her dramatic red dress cuts through stripes of colorless homogeneity, triumphantly on a beautiful staircase as she reunites with Dylan. But Vera's lipstick red brightness is less lasting. For her, marriage is second best, even when she is in true love for her husband. <br /> <br /> Outstanding cinematography extends to the use of montage to put images on top of each other in a manner similar to the fact that poetry's adverb of unrelated words to create further meaning. Terrible war styles in Thessaly are subservient to screaming by Vera during pregnancy. Does it give birth or is it abortion? We're not told right away. Pain is universal and goes beyond time and place to this day. <br /> <br /> Constant echoes of Dylan's poetry throughout the film lead us past terrestrial opposition. It reminds me of Marlon Brando who now reads TS Eliot in Apocalypse. A light beyond the horrors of the world. Another way to see things. "I'll take you back to a time when no bombs were falling off the air and nobody ever died," Dylan told Vera as they walked along the beach. Elsewhere, Caitlin remembers the childhood with Vera: "We are still innocent in Dylan," she says. <br /> <br /> There is a time to leave your knickers at home or share a universal cigarette. (Not literally, maybe.) A time to be inspired. Enjoy what may be the best British film of the year.
