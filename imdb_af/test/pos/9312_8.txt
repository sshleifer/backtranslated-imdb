The first time I saw this movie was a flight between Guangzhou, China and Los Angeles. It was a real hoot and overtook the journey with much less discomfort than the normal 10 hour flight. I tried to find a copy of it without success until I discovered a copy for sale on eBay. Now that I've watched it twice, I recommend it as a good entertainment. My only real criticism is that the choice of English translation words for the captions is subservient, even to normal standards. Also the subtitles are too small, mixing in the film too often and traveling too fast to read well.
