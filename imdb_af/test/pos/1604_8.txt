Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> Luchino Visconti's movie adaptation of Thomas Mann's novella is visually, if not philosophical, true to his source. (British opera offers a more faithful reading of the Apollonian / Dionysian struggle that consumes the aging author). It's definitely one of the most beautiful movies ever made. <br /> <br /> In the Visconti version, the emphasis is more on the physical aspects of the story. Venice never looked beautiful and tempting, more decadent and effete. If you've read the novella, it's like getting the descriptions on its pages. Dirk Bogarde gives an excellent performance as Gustav von Aschenbach. Although he has very little dialogue, he carries the bitterness, passion and ultimate, sadness of Aschenbach through facial expressions alone. Bjorn Andresen, the young actor who plays Tadzio, the beautiful object of Aschenbach's desire, was thrown perfectly. He also plays the part with facial expressions and gestures. The Tadzio character is crucial to the story, so any actor in this role should be worthy of inspiration and desire. Visconti, with his incredible eye for beauty, knew exactly what he did. And ashenbach changed from a writer to a composer based on Gustav Mahler, and then with Mahler's music, especially the Adagietto of the 5th Symphony, was another brilliant stroke. Although I would read the Mann story before the movie, Mahler's music and death in Venice will always be inextricably linked to my mind. Just like the backdrops that appear through the film, especially when the last one of Ashenbach on the beach dies if Tadzio walks slowly into the sea. <br /> <br /> One day, this movie will be released in the DVD Widescreen format and its Visual Splendor that we've completely restored.
