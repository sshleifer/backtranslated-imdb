Like another poster called Ch. 56 (a local TV station in Boston) showed several times over the afternoons on Saturday afternoons. They paired it with the first successor "Return of the Ginat Majin". <br /> <br /> Now I haven't seen it yet ... but it never left me. Apart from the horrible dubbing and faded color, it was a pretty good fantasy. Technically, it's not horror ... until the image comes to an end. It's just about a town that is dominated by an evil man. There is a huge stone image where the villagers continue to pray to help them ... to no avail. But things go too far, the law comes to life and destroys the bad guys ... but then it also starts to the good guys! Well done with some cool special effects at the end (LOVE how he got rid of the head bad guy). There was also an enchanted forest that was also interesting. <br /> <br /> No masterpiece, but an unusual combination of fantasy / horror movie. Worth catching - but not when it is printed.
