Personally, I think Kevin Spacey is one of his greatest actors, perhaps the greatest. This, in combination with another incredible actor named Jeff Bridges, can't be that bad. And that's exactly what this movie is! "K-PAX" is one of the most enjoyable surprises of recent years. To begin with, the movie has a brilliant written story. It's part of what makes the movie so good. The other aspect that contributes to the greatness of the movie is the play. The combination Spacey-Bridges really works. <br /> <br /> It's been the second time I've seen the movie and I'm sure it won't be the last time. "K-PAX" has it all. There are moments that are very funny, parts reminiscent of a real thriller and others reminiscent of high-class drama. I think this movie deserves a much higher rating and many more awards. Great movie! <br /> <br /> 9/10
