A notorious big budget flop when released. This Robert Altman-inspired comedy has some fantastic moments and an occasionally inspired role. Although it lasts a long time, its focus is completely lost, there are plenty of funny moments that will keep a strange viewer to the end. If you are a fan of character actors and actresses, it will be a treat to you; you will recognize so many fantastic, little-known artists throughout this movie (you may not know their names, but you know their faces), even the child from a Christmas story comes in a small part. If you rent it from Netflix, if you read it, you will enjoy it.
