This movie blew me away - I only saw two episodes of the show, never seen the first movie, but went to a preview where Johnny Knoxville himself introduced the film and said we should make our sense of moral judgment for " an hour and a half. "He was right. As a movie, it will probably rate a 2, as it has zero graph, no structure except randomness and very little production value. However, this is not the point. Everybody in our theater was laughing and gasping throughout - not only were some of the stunts creative (see trailer if you need to know it, but they hid some of the best (or worst, depending on how you like it)). But some of the things they did completely surprised us. These guys do a few things that won't make it in your newspaper reviews (and probably can't even be published here), with lots of stuff under the band. But almost three quarters of the stunts are fantastically hysterical (even if it is morally condemned, but remember Knoxville's statement), and if you're in the right mind, this movie is hysterical to watch. Just about 20 minutes from this movie could actually be shown on TV, so consider yourself warned. Some things are disgusting, but instead of forcing, you end up with its mere folly. As a person who thought Jackass was, the TV show was an overheated whore with just a few funny sketches and very unnecessary pain. The amount of fun I had with this movie made me realize that there are no limits, the best environment for these guys to work in. It's fun and should be a great comic solution to the Borat movie. With this movie you can think you know what you're getting, but these guys are a few steps ahead of you - I guarantee you'll be surprised at the 3rd sketch. So enjoy, and don't worry: you won't want to do any of their stuff at home.
