It's absolutely one of our favorites from 2007. <br /> <br /> The story of two boys coming from different worlds, but being as close as brothers, is brilliantly told. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot and written - it never falls from childhood to adulthood. <br /> <br /> A brilliant insight into a lost culture and a great way to understand Farsi cultures and traditions is also an exceptional story in its own right. It is both compassionate and exciting, exciting and filled with great sadness, joyful and depressed. <br /> <br /> With excellent performances of the cast and great technical skills behind the camera, it's really the best movie. <Br /> <br /> Highest recommendation: a real part of life that lifts up and informs.
