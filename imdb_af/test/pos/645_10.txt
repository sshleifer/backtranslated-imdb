I felt that this movie had a lot of heart and should have been a loving work for Eleanor Bergstein. The primary actors (Campbell Scott, Jennifer Beals, Yancy Butler, James Goodwin III, Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron) were very well-chosen and played their parts with excellence. It was a very exciting movie that I wish was available on tape or DVD. A rare jewel.
