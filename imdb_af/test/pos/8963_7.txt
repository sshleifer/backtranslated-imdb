Summary: Based on the true story of Charlie Wilson, a US Congressman, who (according to this movie) was instrumental in the American secret war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> Comment: A little funny movie about Not so funny, especially because they were real. But with the emphasis on the film, Hanks plays very well as an unashamed female congressman with a good heart who champions the secret war in Afghanistan. Hanks, and the whole movie, Philip Seymor Hoffman, has a very humorous tone. As much as comedy adds to the genre will be appropriate. But the story that tells it, and perhaps the end of most, is indeed serious. <br /> <br /> A story of what happened to some questions about what might have been. So the movie works as a comedy if you want one, and a much more serious one if you want it. Something for everyone? 10/07
