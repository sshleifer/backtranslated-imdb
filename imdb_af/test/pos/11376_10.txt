It was the best movie of 1998 and one of the best of the 90's. Yes, this is a deterrent to Goodfellas. But as the saying goes, borrow good poets, steal great poets. And PTA stole brilliantly from some of the best, plus some brilliant touches of its own. I gave it a ten (it's very rare for me). <br /> <br /> The main reason I commented on this (because I can only get rawe all night) is all the people who saw it on VHS. standard problem ... what do you think? It deserves the full screen experience. Look at the relationship in which it was shot! I saw it 5 times at the theater and didn't bother to watch it on video. <br /> <br /> Nuff said!
