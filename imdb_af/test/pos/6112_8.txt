I was first introduced to John Waters movies by seeing "Female Problems" on IFC. I was disgusting, but for some reason I enjoyed it. Then I recorded the Pink Flamingos DVD in the John Waters Boxed Set. The film is about Babs Johnson, "The Filthiest Person Alive," living in Maryland with a trailer in her excessive egg, and her confused son, Crackers. In the movie you see such sick as sex with chickens, drag queens, people who eat feces, torture, and all other kinds of random humiliation. The movie features a 60s rock and roll soundtrack. The only problem is that some parts of the film seem to be moving and can become a bit boring. I found "Female Trouble" a little more fun. Valued NC-17 for explicit sex, violence and disturbing images. Enjoy.
