Seen it at the Newport Beach Film Festival the other day. The movie is VERY exceptional. The crowd I went with all loved it. Funny, gripping and wonderful. I'm tired of the tried and true Hollywood romance that may be related? David Krumholtz (Max) is really wonderful as the true and true lover of the Ultra-Screwy Grace (Natasha Lyonne, who is also excellent). When Max falls for Grace, we believe it. Why? Because love at first sight is crazy and we are about two lost, and perhaps not so crazy, souls. Also note is Giullmo Diaz as Hector and Rosanna Arquette as a sexless / sexy neurotic, both Max and Grace roommates before embarking on their journey to Sheboygen, WI and finding themselves. Don't miss this one, it's something special! P.S. The soundtrack, led by Kevin Hearn (from Bare Naked Ladies fame) is also super super cool.
