BONJOUR, MONSIEUR SHLOMI is simply a wonderful movie! Author / director Shemi Zarhin created a story, unlike any other, and played it with such consistently fine actors, it seems to me a mystery that this movie has not become an audience favorite around the world. It is intelligent, emotional, edifying and warm, entertaining, and in all categories it is a winner. Hlomi (Oshri Cohen, in a brilliant underperformance) is a 16-year-old boy who takes care of his highly dysfunctional family: his mother (Esti Zakheim) is about as unpleasant as a shock and in a constant state of poor mood because her husband cheated on her and because she is stuck, two shifts work to support her poor father-in-law (Arie Elias, who, as Shlomi's grandfather is a bright, funny, wise, loving old man who cares deeply for Shlomi); a married sister, Ziva (Rotem Abuhab) who regularly walks back home due to constant splashes with her husband who does not help her to look after their twin sons; his brother Sasi (Assi Cohen) whose life is great electric guitars, braggadocio about female conquests and his mother's favorite son. Stir this mixture and the result is the penultimate dysfunctional family unit. Shlomi cooks gourmet meals for them, shops, home cleaning, walking plots, bathing and caring for this grandfather and generally leads a life of presentation to a family who sees him as a 'retard'. Hlomi longs for a girl and virtually fails his school because of his lack of time devoted to caring for his family and lack of concentration. Serendipitously begins his maths teacher Begin (Nisso Keavia) his natural mathematical genius on a discarded test. With the help of the principal (Yigal Nair), the two encourage him to be tested and discover that he is a genius (? With dyslexia?). and arrange for a special school in Haifa. Shlomi's mother won't hear about it, but between battles with Shlomi's absent father (Albert Iluz) and confrontation with the teacher and principal, they finally accept his test for the school. Meanwhile, Shlomi is discovering a girl who has moved his Rona age (Aya Koren). alongside and gradually the two become intertwined in a physical and intellectual relationship. Always in the background is the support of Shlomi's grandfather, and when the grandfather dies, Shlomi is traveling to live his life for himself, to realize his gifts, to find his happiness. The way the family handles it is the highlight of the movie and does not have to be revealed in order to lose the power of the message. The film is beautifully photographed, the musical score is creative and the final result is one of the rise of the human spirit. Highly recommended at every level. In Hebrew with English subtitles.
