It's a great documentary and top comment makes a brief summary of how good it was, so I won't repeat the same compliments. However, Faith similar, a Turkish-oriented man who probably knows the country more than an ordinary European, falls in the fall of orientalism that other Western artists usually fall. But come on man, you are Turkish-blooded and your movie can be deeper and can describe what is outside the "beyoglu-old city". This is a missed opportunity for Akin for that reason. Performances by Muzeyyen Senar and Orhan Gencebay are the movie of the movie and Ceza (a very talented and bad ass Turkish rapper) makes a little garbage over American gangsta rappers that I totally agree. I would recommend this movie to my American friends.
