As is often the case when Manga is translated into live action, there is quite a bit lost in translation. However, it remains a highly entertaining movie. The premise is unusual and it is presented in the quiet, understated style so prevalent in Japanese movies (ha!). The special effects are a small 70's camp, but it adds to the comic book feel of the movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are familiar with (and enjoy) other Japanese horror movies like "Evil Dead's Trap", this movie will appeal to you.
