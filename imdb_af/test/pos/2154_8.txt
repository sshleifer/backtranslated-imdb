I saw this beautiful documentary at the Santa Barbara Int'l Film Festival. It is extremely absorbent and very well-made and draws you in the life and career of Harry Nilsson, one of the most transmissible musical talents of the 1960s and 70s. While I was familiar with his better-known compositions ("One is the Loneliest Number", "Without You"), I learned about this man's brilliant writing and beautiful song. If you like music, you will love to move to his world, unfortunately out of control, as his success has increased and his past has played him out. However, he was sad, but totally dedicated to his family and you would be so happy to meet this man. The profile is effectively told by Nilsson's own words and those of his friends and colleagues (a virtual Who's Who of Rock) who loved and respected him. Do not miss it!
