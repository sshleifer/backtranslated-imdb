How can anyone DARE say anything bad about this movie? Forgive Mel Brooks for being a brilliant comedian and making a movie more beautiful every time you see it. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw it, I cried to laugh so hard. Everything about it is funny. <br /> <br /> While "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" is not my favorite comedy (the place is taken by "Real Genius"), it is in my book above. So look! If you do not spend all the time, then you will at least sleep all the time about Cary Elwes.
