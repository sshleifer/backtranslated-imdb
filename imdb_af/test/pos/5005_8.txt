Talk show with Spike Feresten is one of the shows that the public will polarize. Whether you like it or not. Personally, I find most of the bits hilarious, but it has a few "huh?" moments. <br /> <br /> Stacks like "Idiot Paparazzi" are always good for a laugh, but my all-time favorite piece should be the one-time "Hollywood Douchebag". "Comedy for Stoners" is the only ordinary piece that makes me generally confuse (it's part of the point!) Spike and his team of writers repeatedly pass many new comedies, so the performance never gets old. Feresten's brand humor can't be for everyone, but it's definitely worth trying. <br /> <br /> The masses spoke! We love this show and want more. Note: I am not a friend of or affiliate in any way with Spike Feresten, "Talkshow with Spike Feresten" staff, or Fox network and affiliates. It's just funny!
