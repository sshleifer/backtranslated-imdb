Eichard Gere & Diane Lane back in another romantic love story. They are an excellent team, but somehow this movie won't be the best. <br /> <br /> Director George Wolfe uses a script by Ann Peacock & John Romanao, for Nicholas Sparks novel. This is another story of 2 strangers meeting and falling in love, then they go there, then meet again and start a life together. <br /> <br /> SPOILER, but not really. Tragedy happens, one of them dies. <br /> <br /> How many times have we seen this. <br /> <br /> Those who have never seen tearjerkers will hopefully do so more than I did. This story has about every clich√© there. <br /> <br /> I'll give it the only reason it has the ratings. is due to the fine acting & excellent production. The role players except our 2 stars include Christopher Meloni, Viola Davis and Scott Glenn. they really give good performances and do the best with the material they are given. <br /> <br /> There is a good but not passing storm sequence. The sex scene is well done, no nudity and no mistake. language, <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 out of 10)
