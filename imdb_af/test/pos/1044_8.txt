I absolutely love this film about a women's columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) for a great home page that features a monthly entertainment article. It contains details about her wonderful home as a wife and mother in a beautiful Connecticut home. The problem is when the owner of her monthly publication claims that she has a WW2 hero as a guest during the Christmas holidays. Why is she worried? Living in a small apartment in New York, she's not married and doesn't have a baby - and can't cook at all! Hilarity (and romance) occurs when she tries to establish a credible act to save the face / resign by the magazine owner (played by Sydney Greenstreet). It's a wonderful comedy; one that I highly recommend for classic movie lovers !!
