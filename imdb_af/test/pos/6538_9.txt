I don't understand why everyone hates this movie, apart from being jealous, their music careers never stepped out like Mega Popstar Aaron Carter. Like it or not, Aaron saw more success in his young life than most people could ever dream, so it just seemed natural to him to make a movie. Lou Pearlman and the company are known for over-exploiting their pop protégés, remember Justin Timberlake's fake TV Model Model Behavior? Granted this movie is not large-scale and impressive, but it's not supposed to be. It doesn't try to impress people or be an Emmy award winner, it's released straight to DVD. It's just a cute little movie about an uncomfortable teenager who gets her dream to be with her favorite Popstar; I know many of you out there, had that dream at some point over your favorite singer, don't deny it. It is sweet and gentle and I complain not to come into the kingdom of sex, violence and vulgar language that look even more and more of our movies today. Where is the decency? Where's the line? Teenage dramas come in decades today, because teens are a big market for companies. At least this one is more susceptible to me than Bratz (aka Slutz) with all the fake girls running to go. "Oh Mah Gawd!" in tank tops and mini skirts and is better than those gore fest films like Saw. I feel for the main character girl because I was nerdy chosen high school girl who loved Aaron Carter and NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys and other pop music and still does; And like Aaron's character, 'testophobia' will be crushed, especially in Math. If you judged this movie based solely on the fact that you aren't jealous of Aaron Carter and his fame, then of course you will hate it and talk it into reviews. The only reason Britney Spears's dribble Crossroads has a higher score is because she has boobs. Accept this movie for what it is, not what you want. I think this happy formal teen movie ends up on a high note and lets you sing.
