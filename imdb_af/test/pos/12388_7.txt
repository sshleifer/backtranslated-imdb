I just watched this movie at the Santo Domingo International Film Festival. Watching the movie, I felt like I saw a movie with a similar story before ... a movie with Ray Liotta, but I can't remember much about it. Of course, this one is very dramatic, especially at the end. <br /> <br /> This is the story: Emilio's life becomes a lie he can no longer sustain. After 20 years of his entire life to his wife, son and all the people he knows, the truth is the hunt and there is nowhere to go. <br /> <br /> To make Emilio fun and funny but after a while you get tired of the same thing ... the relationship with a young girl had to add something, but it doesn't. Despite this, the movie is still funny, excited and involved. Or it makes you want to help Emilio with his lies or help everyone catch him. I like the analogies, photography and the good performances. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10.
