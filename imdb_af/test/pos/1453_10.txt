It is easily one of the best films of the 1950s. Otto Preminger has only four or five really good movies and that is one of them. Frank Sinatra gives his best performance and the music score by Elmer Bernstein is dynamite. From the opening titles (by Saul Bass) to the hysteria of drug addict Frank who goes cold turkey, it's a sounding movie! With Kim Novak (delivering a very good performance), Eleanor Parker (giving a very bad performance) as well as Darren McGavin as the reptile flute and Arnold Stang as Frank's governor. Beware of bad prints: this movie is in the public domain so some copies are pretty rough.
