Greetings again from the darkness. Based on the biggest bestseller of author Khaled Hosseini, the film speaks to us of the ugliness of post-Russia invading Afghanistan and the Taliban's terror. Director Marc Foster adds a jewel to his CV, which already includes "Monster's Ball", "Finding Neverland" and "Stranger Than Fiction". <br /> <br /> The story of young friends Amir and Hassan and the unknown band share them in the next generation. It is a story of honor and courage and loyalty and is an unusual outdated story. Some great scenes of the boys when they are children and then some wonderful scenes like Amir return as an adult to find Hassan's captive son. <br /> <br /> It's a tough, compelling story telling with a message. The acting is solid throughout, without one actor stealing the screen. Although not a pleasant story to see unfolds, it certainly makes sense and feels the heart. Plus a quick shot of Midnight Oil playing in the swimming pool hall is a welcome gift.
