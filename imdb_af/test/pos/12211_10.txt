I want them to bring the surface back. I really enjoyed the show with my family. I felt the plot development and storyline were first rate. As the other person said, everything seems to be reduced to the lowest common denominator. Nothing but false, politically correct rubbish survived. Just look at the internet to see how many people watched the show. It's also not nice to let us hang on what all the characters at the show have done. It's the same thing that happened to the time series I think was called 8 days, but had to be called back. Did the Olympic Games kill surface? I know the authors killed another of my favorite shows, called the greatest American hero years ago.
