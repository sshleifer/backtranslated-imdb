Eisenstein describes his collaboration with Prokeviev as an equal partnership, where they worked together to fit image and music, scene on stage. Unfortunately, the sound recording was a disaster, so once the dedication to authenticity in Criterion DVDs. Fortunately, there is at least one restored version of the movie on VHS (BMG Classics) with excellent music re-registration (by the St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus). <br /> <br /> It is interesting to compare this movie with contemporary propaganda films in England, Germany and the United States. Eisenstein's film was made in 1938, in response to the fear of a German invasion; and Olivier's in 1943, when a German invasion in England was still expected. Both films are stages, but in different ways. Olivier begins with an increased performance of the play in the Globe Theater by Shakespeare's own company, and then takes us out of the theater to a more filmed (though quietly styled) setting. Eisenstein's film has been the movie from the beginning, but the dialogue and speeches are still influenced by the melodramatic acting conventions of the ancient Russian theater. It works very well for Cerkassov's speeches as Alexander, because part of his work as prince and military leader was a role in public. <br /> <br /> In Nazi Germany, the first big propaganda film was Leni Riefenstahl's boring Triumph of the Wil, who recorded a great political spectacle - masses of crowds raising Hitler's raging speeches. The propaganda in her masterpiece, the film of the Berlin Olympic Games in 1936, is much more subtle, with the worship of the athletic male body carrying disturbing undertones of the Aryan superiority myth. But warlike German propaganda films can also be subtle. Karl Ritter's Urlaub on Ehrenwort (Furlough on Respect) is typical. It indicates a young lieutenant who leaves the men in his company with a 24 hour leave before returning to WWI trenches (and almost certain deaths). Against the advice of veterans, he accepts their worship service to return, though he will be courted and shot if they do not. Of course everyone goes back, although some of them are renowned for it, probably inspiring the audience for similar services to their country. <br /> <br /> In the United States, one of the better WWII propaganda films was Howard Hawks Air Force. According to us, we are following the mismatched crew of a bomber, as they connect with each other with the experience of the battle and overcome obstacles to continue their part in the war. However, typical for Hawks' films is their true loyalty to each other rather than to their country. Eisenstein has to come a long way back in history to find any Russian military triumph. Ironically, Alexander (like the other Russian princes) descended from the Vikings who ascended the Russian rivers to conquer their own humility. He is therefore a conqueror who again rejects a victory. Physically they are not so different (although the actors depicting the German princess are obviously chosen for their uglyness and bad folly). But the real contrast is between the ordinary soldiers. The Russian farmers are as tall and strong as the nobles; while the German farmers moving out of the wall to kill wounded Russians, a foot shorter than their masters. There is some historical truth in this contrast. Russian livers in the Middle Ages were much better off than their European counterparts, as they could always escape in the desert and clean their own country. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein's film also gives us our first glimpse of Alexander as a fisherman. In the battle with the Germans, he uses his fisherman's knowledge of the ice, as well as his knowledge of their military tactics to defeat them. When Gavrilo breaks the shield wall, they must regroup and massage to the west of the lake, where the ice is thinner. <br /> <br /> One of the other pleasures of Eisenstein's film (which most audiences miss) is the historically accurate way he portrays the politics of medieval Russia. Cities such as Pskov and Novgorod owe their growing wealth and prominence largely to trade, which the traders put to power, and sidelined the princes until their military expertise and feudal charges were needed to avert invaders. In the film Alexander is not only shown as a military leader, but also as a master politician, who knows how to wait for his time and how to make the most of his popularity after the victory.
