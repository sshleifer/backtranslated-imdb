I saw this movie when it was released to theaters. It's definitely one thing to remember, I've forgotten the title recently. A friend found it via online search. <br /> <br /> A dark night is rather unusual for the stress / horror genre of the time because it doesn't contain blood. This is from the teenage horror variety, but the teens are respectful in their own ways. It's a nice old-school movie with props and scenes that reflect the times. For example, our hero drives a motorcycle without a brain-head. <br /> <br /> As mentioned by previous reviewers, One Dark Night is currently available on DVD. The original negative was not available for the DVD transition. Some rule changes are slightly rough, but it doesn't take away from the story. It is said that the colors are alive and the lighting is very good. <br /> <br /> Adam West plays a rather small role in RayMar's son-in-law. His role as an exuberant and indifferent man is grateful. <br /> <br /> The story builds on the course of the movie. Unlike many horror movies of the era, One Dark Night is a wonderful story story that gives the viewer time to absorb what's going on. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes or so of One Dark Night is what makes it so memorable. RayMar's telekinetic abilities are used to open up old graves in the mausoleum, take out the coffins, open them and move the bodies around. Attention has been given to great detail in the final scenes. The rotting, worm-like bodies really look real.
