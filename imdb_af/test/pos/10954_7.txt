12/17/01 All I can do with this movie improvises on my impressions. I did not give the "changes", do not know the "score" and were not trained in the genre. I always had problems with chord changes (trumpeter), so I was pretty limited to the basic "keep the voice in mind" and ad lib about it. What chased me on this incredibly muddy black and white blues piece was the knot that gave me my head and heart to try to find out if I'm going with the ensemble or picking a path alongside the song. went with the song as usual; I got lost on the changes - too deep, wide over my head, probably. Yet it was a guest trying to keep up. I admired the actors' play on the theme and story line. I didn't see things, or things that others look like I don't feel the light. I was not succeeding because she was either unaware of the color problem or wanted to ignore it. : Later she fought back. The vibrant light-skinned young man (his trumpet noodling mas ridiculous) was ambiguous, ambivalent, and - perhaps his best feature - remote. What did I think after the shadow curtain was closed on this challenging piece - is the basis of such a thing? Is it a way to find the "reality" by setting up a stage, using it with expressive characters and giving them a melody and theme? Is it more real or true than a well-crafted script - without the benefit of editing and reviewing? Is improvisation heroic, "artist"? - Moreso as edited work? Where is there greater or clearer truth: in retrospective art / craft or in manufacturing and reform? Well, I'm still lost in this question. I loved the movie; It was lost to me in a cool blue misty evening, where I just had to go home and get out of my horn. Guess what? I broke out in a twelve-bar blues riff, right and faithful. Reality is just too scary. Jaime says give them a 7 and more. I'm on break.
