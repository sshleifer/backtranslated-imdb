Fortunately for Bill Murray, it's such a lightweight project as he has to carry it pretty much. Meatballs are the story of Northstar rental camp and how his counselors also deal with the campers. Then there are many of their rich competitors from over the lake called Camp Mohawk, culminating in a two-day Olympiad competition. In addition, Bill Murray is clinging around and making a pretty memorable movie shot. <br /> <br /> The movie is sprinkled with medium-sized laughs, chuckles and more than a few troughs along the way. The biggest laugh comes from the pranks played on the northern camp director. Three of them involve the counselors displacing his bed in several places while he is sleeping. Morty, or "Micky" as everyone calls him, wakes up along the side of a road, pushing several trees across the ground in some trees and eventually floating on a raft in the middle of the lake! There are also some funny moments where the counselors strike each other, but it is a PG-rated movie with little in the way of raunchiness. <br /> <br /> The movie takes a serious note with a shy camper named Rudy who is played by Chris Makepeace. Of course, it is up to Murray to teach the child how to open, and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the Olympics. The sentimentality of Rudy's situation is largely in the offing. Notice how when Murray first saw the child sitting in the grass in the grass after being off the bus, he said to him: "You must be the short depressed child we ordered." Wondering if that line was really in the writing or Murray was just ad-libbing while the cameras were rolling. In other words, Murray might as well have said to Makepeace: "You must be that actor who hired us to play the stereotypical lonely child you see in most summer camp movies that don't fit." But before it's over, Murray's performance makes this plot device more than feasible. He really looks good chemistry with Makepeace. <br /> <br /> The movie ends with the matches between the two competing camps. Very little of the events we show are even slightly credible, but "it doesn't matter". It's a great movie on many levels. Don't let the absurd 5.6-grading of this movie scare you. Murray will make you laugh right through. Just be warned ..... avoid the persecutors !!!! Especially the one with Corey Feldman !! 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
