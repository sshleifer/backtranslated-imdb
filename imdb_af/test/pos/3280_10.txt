I think Mario Van Peebles' film Posse is a very important movie. This is an excellent entry point film on a side of history, many of which are unaware of. It is a story of early black settlers, cow boys and infantrymen who have returned from the Spanish-American War with a closet of gold. The main character Peebles is haunted by memories of his murdered father. The racism applied to the new black settlers and infantry is explored in this film, with excellent results, including Melvin Van Peebles (Marios father), Billy Zane, Stephen Baldwin and a wonderful performance by Big Daddy Kane. <br /> <br /> One of the senses that Peeples strived to use so much significant black (and some not so noteworthy - smiles) actors as possible :) Maybe too much, some well-known people (Issac Hayes, Pamela Grier) is only scene. In cameo, others briefly like Tone Loc. Peebles' feelings and efforts to expose these actors will be understood by some. The great film (a performance for any director) works well and does a good job of telling the story in the classic "revenge and fight against justice" western. <br /> <br /> Most notable was the wonderful storyline of veteran actor Woody Strode (from time to time in the west), whose own life was an obstacle, within the context of a previous era that not yet completed, the memory has disappeared. No other actor could have done this role better. Read the mini-bio on Woody Strode here as a primer: http://imdb.com/name/nm0834754/bio <br /> <br /> The movie does a great job balancing action with a little sardonic humor. The dialogue was excellent as a little contemporary! And as others have mentioned, the curse was not accurate until that time. The sex scene was a bit much - not really needed. There are some historical inaccuracies such as the apparent electronic trademark of the cattle, etc. But Posse is a good attempt to hopefully open the door to more historical and creative works that reflect other unprecedented stories and events. The real photos of real cowboys at the final credits were very nice.
