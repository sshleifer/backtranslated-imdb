River's Edge is an excellent film and it is a pity that it no longer made a point for him in film history. There were a number of gritty films based on schoolchildren made in the eighties, but of all I saw; it is definitely the most nihilistic and disturbing. The film takes a storyline that is upset in its own right and adds the theme of teenage sleepers and their unpleasant attitude to things, which takes the story to another level. The film works because the central story is interesting and it is played by complex characters. The movie starts with a murder. We then follow the killer, nicknamed John, as he goes back to school and tells all his friends what he has done. Rather than giving the expected response, most of them don't respond at all and the strongest response the killer gets comes from Layne; who makes it his number one priority to help John catch up with the mess and get him out of it. The other friends fall over the crime, and before long one of them goes to the police ... <br /> <br /> River's Edge has a host of good performances from his young role. Keanu Reeves has a reputation for woodworkers and for good reason; but he fits very well with this early role and this performance is easily one of his best. Crispin Glover is the biggest standpoint than the slightly stepless Layne. Glover is always in every film he is in, and while he is over, it's a bit; He convinced well as the lead role in this movie. Reeves and Glover are well supported by a talented young role that includes Daniel Roebuck and Joshua John Miller, as well as the great Dennis Hopper in another wild role. The film has a very sharp picture that fits well with its nihilistic tone. The central characters are all of the 'sleeper / stoner' generation and the way they really don't care about their friend's murder is more shocking than the murder itself. and the point the film is trying to make about modern society is strong and well-defined. The movie is also pretty funny, because of some characters' lines; but the humor is pitch black and clearly this film is never meant to be a comedy. Overall, this is an excellent and memorable movie that is definitely worth seeing!
