With nurse Betty (2000), the well-known Indie filmmaker Neil LaBute (In The Company of Men, Your Friends and Neighbors) makes his breakthrough in the big budget (Betty's $ 24m compared to the company's virgin $ 25,000) and remains its roots are true. While his film now consists of A-list Hollywood names (Renee Zellweer, Morgan Freeman, and stand-up comedian Chris Rock), his material remains as bizarre and peculiar as his first two features, proving that he is just the following can be. great thing. Nurse Betty is one of the darkest comedies advertised in years after a mainstream audience. Perhaps the film people are not as stupid and brainwashed as they were. The story follows (both figuratively and literally) a na√Øve waitress (Zellweger) who fell in love with a beautiful soapster (as good as it gets Greg Kinnear), but is trapped in a loveless marriage with a smart car dealership (Aaron Eckhart, who made his big-screen debut in Company). When her husband is horribly murdered by two hits (Freeman and Rock), she is shot in the shock and Hollywood is unaware of her object of love - unaware that he is just an actor. When Freeman and Rock discover that the car she took contains 10kg of cocaine, they also hit the road. Fans of LaBute's previous work can be hard to figure out how it might be the same man who has directed the Company of Men - a tragicomedy about two brutal sexist pigs playing a joke on a deaf colleague - but If you think about it, the connection is pretty clear: in the Company, a vulnerable woman is unaware that she is relentlessly used. In Betty, a vulnerable housewife is unaware that the man she is chasing thinks his true worship is nothing more than a joke. Some may wonder if LaBute is actually a kind of misogynist himself - as his recurring theme involves the destruction of innocent women. But personally, I think he is going to defend the just sex and deal much more with the abusers in his photos than the abused. One of the many charms of this film is that it is absurdly full: most directors, when dealing with a manuscript like this, will leave the story with two hits that a woman pursues pursuing a dream. But LaBute knows better, and one of the hitmen (Freeman) also fell obsessed with Betty. It was an interesting role for Freeman to take, as it allowed him to play his trademark "this-the-last-time" character (see Unforgiven, Se7en and 1998's stinker Hard Rain); The supporting film also includes the well-known Crispin Glover (Back to the Future), Allison Janney and 'Mad About You's Kathleen Wilhoite. The screenplay, written for the first time, John C. Richards and James Flamberg, is angry at the top (honest: have you ever seen a comedy - or any movie, for that matter - in which a man gets in the head become his own dining room?). You can argue that the end is a bit too perfect, but it's really not worth denying what is good for the movie for one trivial complaint. If nurse Betty is a sign of what LaBute is now for us in the store, you can bet I will act for everything he decides to follow. <br /> <br /> Degree: A-
