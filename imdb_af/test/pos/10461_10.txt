This movie offers many delights and surprises. When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from Don Giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent movie. The story unfolds in the Jutland in the 18th century and the use of period music played on periodic instruments is just one finer touch. You share General Loewenhielm's wonderful joy in his participation in the Cailles and Sarcophage, although you just watch a movie - but you just want a little example to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Babette is an artist whose medium is food. Perhaps no other art form makes the artist the opportunity to share her creations directly. <br /> <br /> The main theme of this movie, the potential for changing food how people see each other and how they see the world, is very similar to the theme of "Chololat", but "Babette's Feast" Don't skip the head with his message. The townspeople are conservative puritans, but not overly oppressive. You will understand and respect them and ultimately appreciate their humanity. <br /> <br /> Many issues are raised for you to think about: the nature of art, the consideration of roads, and roads not taken, the relationship between the spiritual and the physical, the effect of the environment on behavior, the taking of life to give, among other things, life. <br /> <br /> The only disappointment to me was General. Loewenhielm's speech at the climax of the meal. I expected deeply sincere observations, but I have some vague mystical ramblings. The speech had so little impact that I almost didn't remember. <br /> <br /> But this underestimate movie makes a lasting impression. The heat it generates is in contrast to the harsh background. You're going to walk out of the theater and dance under the stars.
