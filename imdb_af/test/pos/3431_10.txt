This thing works on all levels - it is intense as a thrill, full of Lars von Trier, but also his own movie - and it has a message: happiness comes from within, the best personified in the wounded soldier who is (and believes in) it or not, humorous) dissolve limbs through limbs throughout the film, and apologize to others to impose it. You laugh at him, but you also envy him. The central character is a well-meaning but clumsy writer who uses the entire movie to help those he finds on a Stockholm-Berlin train just after World War II. He connects the parallel stories, and really screws people into the process. To say things are going wrong is an understatement - and structurally, the characters are in perfect opposition to each other. It is as if each one has an opposite - just as strict as looking at anti-matter. You won't believe the sick things you're finally laughing at. To say more would qualify as a spoiler - all I can say is sorry, this movie was not released in the US, not even on DVD. Some moron probably told them. Americans won't get it - it's crazy because we're not just "getting" but producing things like South Park ... If this movie is marketed in the US, it must be sold as a mainstream black comedy, because That's what it is. Over-the-top, sick and twisted, but fuuuuunnnnnyyyyy!
