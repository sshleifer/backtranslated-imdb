It's about as good as with the wind. I like this movie, I can see it over and over. Scarlett always gets what she wants, no matter what the cost is. She really tries hard to forget Rhett, but she just can't do it. She loves him so much. It is a story of true true love. It started with the wind and finally in this movie. The only right way to end this movie for real true love. Scarlett and Rhett were back at the end. And that's the way it ended with them with their daughter. What more can you ask for. There is no better end to this great love story than that. What else can I say about this wonderful movie.
