I watched this movie because of Costas Mandylor and Lauren Holly. I worshiped them at Picket Gates, so it was a surprise to see them together again. It wasn't the best movie ever made, but it was cute. Very predictable, but sometimes unnecessary, movies are just what I need. <br /> <br /> The desserts were beautiful, and I wanted to eat them all. I loved it when that one fell apart. I said it tasted good. <br /> <br /> Costas and Lauren still have the great chemistry they had at Picket Gates, and I swam while kissing in this movie. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't see it again, but it was a nice filling for one night.
