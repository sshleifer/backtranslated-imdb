One cannot but admire Mike Judge for his hands on "I had that" approach. With "Office Space" almost anyone working a job can associate with the characters. "Idiocracy" has exactly the same feeling for it. One can easily appreciate the experience of our heroes 505 years later, because the director has once again tried to put things on a very human level. Something similar to Woody Allen's "Sleeper", this movie is very funny. Don't miss out on the deleted scenes, as the "Museum of Speed" is a classic. Imaginative comedy is a rarity, and "Idiocracy" is wildly imaginative, extremely funny and a solid 8.0 movie experience. - NOTE
