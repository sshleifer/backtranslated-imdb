Wallace and Gromit are the main characters in some of the best cartoons ever made. The great mix of visual humor and clay makes a Grand Day Out, "The Wrong Trousers" and also a Close Shave some of the best animated footage ever to be put on television. Nick Park has become quite the popular man in the UK, but his impact on the United States has not yet been great. Shortly after the third Wallace and Gromit, there was all this speculation about a Wallace and Gromit movie, but years did not happen. Then in 2000 instead of a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie, we get another brilliant clay film from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, nominated almost for the best photo in the Academy Awards. Perhaps it was the success of this movie that finally drove Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project. <br /> <br /> 5 years later (this kind of movies last as long as you know) and much anticipation, Wallace and Gromit finally hit the big screen. Despite the poor trailers and marketing campaign, this movie is delivering in so many ways. This movie will be a pleasure for both children and parents. With tons of mature humor hidden under the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit are one of the few films that perfectly manage to create equal opportunities for kids and adults. This tricky technique is one that has just perfected Pixar and DreamWorks has made a lot of effort lately. Despite the DreamWorks logo slapped on the poster, this film is primarily made up of the creative staff of Aardman Animations. <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are first seen running a business that protects the town's crop by being destroyed by rabbits, which are apparently already wild and in large numbers. Their business received them a lot of respect from the others who lived in the village because a huge vegetable competition was fast approaching and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits not to keep vegetables and then a delicious eating machine is unleashed in the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also the approval of the townspeople. To add to that, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, who also caught the attention of a snobster under the name of Victor. Simple plot yes, but there is more to the eye, be ready for a few surprises along the way, as in the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons. <br /> <br /> In animated movies with little dialogue, this is the animation that has to set the pacing and mood of the movie. In spite of 5 years of producing only 85 minutes of footage, the payout is fantastic. There is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one show to be noticed. Even more incredible than the detailed and almost flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor placed in the movie. Whether it's a creatively placed shot or a regular label, it's the funniest position possible, or it's the cute rabbits that are constantly shown in the film. Most of the curse of the Were-Rabbit's humor comes strictly to watch the movie itself and capture all the references before it's too late. Just the movie Madagascar, except snapper, much less pop culture references, and better animation. <br /> <br /> Watering was wonderful, though not so important in a movie with little dialogue. Peter Sallis does a wonderful job again as Wallace, although in this movie there was no outstanding quote that could be used at any time (The Wrong Trousers: "These are the wrong pants Gromit, and they went wrong!"). Ralph Fiennes does a wonderful job as Victor's main band and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult region "Fight Club") gives her beautiful voice because she plays Wallace's love interest. Although nothing could exceed the final chase in "The Wrong Trousers", the curse of the True Rabbit had many action scenes, including a fantastically chased scene between Gromit and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, the rabbits steal the scene in a few moments. Whether it's their cute expressions, their funny movements or their crying, the hair in the movie even captures the glory of the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the "cursed" rabbit himself, up to the end of the movie that he has let down. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Even though it's not as memorable as "The Wrong Trousers", this movie is as good and entertaining as Chicken Run. In contrast to almost every movie released this year, the movie doesn't wear at all, but within a short 85 minutes it still beats so much joy and pleasure, it lets everyone watch it more. There is very little fault with the movie; It was a great pleasure to watch. This film is a total contrast to the decent, yet vulgar, rough, raw movies that made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-year-old Virgin, Wedding Crashers and Sin City) and for families and those who entertain innocently; this is a good thing. Recommend, this is the top animated movie that comes out this year and among the best we've seen this decade. Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit: totally harmless fun from the second 1 to the second 5,100.
