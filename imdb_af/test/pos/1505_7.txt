Lucio Fulci was one of the most prolific Italian directors by his death in 1996, but his career has long been down to a downward spiral of increasingly useless genre entries that could hardly be in the shadow of his previous work. For many of the 70s in the mid-1980s, he remembered the stylistic abominations such as 'City of the Living Dead', 'The Beyond' and the brutal giallo 'The New York Ripper'. myself. And while "Cat in the Brain" falls into the era of Fulci's decline as a movie maker, it is a shockingly dark hilarious outing, while a clear inferior job (the framework, effects and acting below the level) proves An interesting, open meditation on puppet psychology and film's ability to desensitize. Make no mistake: "Cat in the Brain" is a total gorefe, and as disjointed as Fulci's previous films, but it deserves credit to try to be something more. Fulci plays in a delightful tongue-in-cheek touch: a director amid the filming of yet another violent horror movie that comes with perverted / murderous hallucinations; After getting a shrinkage that puts him under hypnosis, she begins to cross dreams and reality, to the point where the viewer cannot distinguish the two. Grindhouse Releasing's recent DVD calls "Cat" as Eraserhead's heir, and it also carries a similar disturbing, uncomfortable, funny quality related to the best surrealistic art.
