Soft and brilliant film seems to have been overlooked as a triviality ... and to be honest, the story is a bit tough and lightweight than drama .... but I feel the simple wonder and joy of the scenes having the first impact of a new art on an alien and skeptical society has a radiance and naturalness that captures romance between the cinema and audience over any film in years. Recently sympathetic performance by Jared Harriss (who inherited all his fathers charisma ... hopefully without poor Richard's fondness for large-scale and hoarseness) .... and a beautiful stocking by Costar Yu Xia to make it a real heart warmer . Radiant location photography (including glowing beautiful scenes at the large wall) and sensitive direction by Ann Hu impact film. In short, a must-have for anyone who is ever enchanted by a shadow shimmering in life ... and makes magic in the dark.
