I bought this movie last night, and I love it. Everyone had a lot of action, especially Ryan Dunn and Bam Margera. The whole plot was wonderful, and as Dunn said in the extras on the DVD, they seemed to be reliving the whole thing again. This movie made my number one place in my favorite movies! I can't stop scenes from being repeated just to see them again. I've never done it with any other movie. I would definitely recommend it for other people to watch, as it is such a great movie, and if you like Bam Margera, it's a perfect movie for you !! The small settings they show between each scene are just fine. I think this should be my favorite part of the movie. They are very sad, with mostly music from the group "HIM", which is of course my favorite band.
