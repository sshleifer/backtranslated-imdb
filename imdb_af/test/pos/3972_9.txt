From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar! The movie took a while to pick up from the beginning, at least for me, as I expected it to be a running America Pie movie. But it was slightly different - a fun slacker who completes high school and makes his own college serves it accordingly. As you can expect, there are lots of parties and hot girls in bikinis, but this movie tried harder than your average teenage movie. Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long) encourages his students / peers to learn through freedom of expression and eventually "push to the system". The humor was varied which I loved. All the movies have produced fantastic performances - rent this one with a friend, it's a bloody crack!
