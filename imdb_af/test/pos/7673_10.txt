I've probably seen it once like most people, my age (55), in the 60's. I understand both dissatisfaction with the final product by both families. But it's a good movie, it was a wonderful Opera; but as a movie it is wonderful. This movie should at least be released for video, other generations can get an appreciation for good music and storytelling. The film was from some of the greatest black actors ever, most of them died now; only Sidney P. is still with us. Please do not wait until he is gone and the movie like all the old movies will be useless until the time of the event. Again, this is a wonderful movie, something you don't see very often today.
