It was one of my favorites as a child. My family had the 8-track soundtrack! This gave us a video of the movie (until I was in my 20's) (my dad dismissed it from HBO or something). Every summer when we go to the beach (my mother, brother, sister and I) we lie on the beach and sing all the songs from this movie !!! WAS ABOUT THIS !!!
