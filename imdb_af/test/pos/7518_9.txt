Anyone who goes to the Manhattan Hospital Center takes his life in his hands. This includes hospital staff. <br /> <br /> I have never seen the hospital and was excited about how similar the characters and situations of the plot were to that other Paddy Chayefsky masterpiece, Network. There are elements in George C. Scott's character that have both Al Schumacher and Howard Beale's. <br /> <br /> He is the hospital administrator and he is crazy like hell and won't take it anymore. He is completely alienated from his wife and children. It takes a Faye Dunaway-type character in the person of Diana Rigg to get him out. One rolls with her in the hay and he is shocked at the reality and the fact that he can still contribute to the world. <br /> <br /> But first he has a real problem. Someone is dead hospital staff, four of them in a 48 hour period. And the nice part is their deaths can be largely attributed to the general incompetence of a medical bureaucracy. This is where the comedy enters. <br /> <br /> There is a real character by Howard Beale in the person of Barnard Hughes, Diana Rigg's father. However, his end is not as dramatic as Beale. <br /> <br /> Back in my working days, it was part of my job to pay medical providers. Some of them can be as large as you can imagine in hospital. The black comedy satire contributed it to me properly. <br /> <br /> George C. Scott was nominated for Best Actor, but he won and refused to accept Patton's previous year's Oscar. He wasn't about to get a second chance. He lost to Gene Hackman for The French Connection. Yet his handling of the role is unforgettable. <br /> <br /> Try looking back at the hospital and see how many similarities you see.
