Black comedy is not always an easy sale. You now and then get a black comedy that is extremely successful, such as Fargo. But usually they do not often find large audiences. People seem to mind their comedy, or for serious chaos. There doesn't seem to be a big market for a good mix of both. Throwing Momma From the Train was a pretty decent hit, but few people seem to remember much in this day and age. Danny DeVito hit the park in 1987 this year. <br /> <br /> DeVito plays a strange mom's boy named Owen to get rid of his outrageous, unpleasant and unpleasant mother with whom he is still alive. . The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who died shortly after she was released and she is quite a caricature. She is hard, ugly, rude, and persuasive. Although Owen hardly looks like he can take care of himself, he desperately wants to abandon his mother. He fantasized about it in some strange scenes, but he obviously didn't bother to do it himself. That's where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen's creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid intellectual novelist who claims his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions out of it. He is currently trying a new one, but can't even get a decent first sentence. "The night was ...." Owen heard Larry wish his former wife had died during an outbreak at the school cafeteria. And to borrow the idea of ​​strangers on a train, Owen decides to travel to Hawai'i and kill Larry's ex-wife. As soon as it turns out he did, he expects Larry to bring back the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often rather funny and even offensive. It is definitely never boring and often full of surprises. <br /> <br /> The play is exceptional, even though Ramsey is a bit on top. Crystal is as good as he can be, and DeVito has always been undervalued as an artist. The movie relies on quite a physical comedy that usually works, often painfully so. The movie uses some innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the chattering sound is really refreshing. I was often criticized by the late 1980s as a time of artistic malaise and right-wing film-making. Throw Momma From the train take chances. Both in how his characters as well as his general plot are drawn. How many comedies revolve around a boy who killed his mother? The film is not too long, and it is very full of laughter. Writers tend to find it more interesting than the general public, but it can still only be enjoyed by anyone. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
