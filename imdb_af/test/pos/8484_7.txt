Ray is interesting in parts, and technically it's made very well, but Ray is often slow, and forgets some important details about Ray's life. All the movie shows we are parts where he is in his first, and most successful, which is good, I just want to see a few bits about his older life. Jamie Fox simulates Ray Charles after a while, at times it's absolutely rude. I have to say, Jamie is the reason I got this movie. The 1st half is much better than the 2nd. It's more interesting, it has more Oomph, and it's nowhere as slow as the 2nd. I wasn't a big fan of Ray Charles to start being honest, so I really had no expectations for the movie, whatever. Ray's biggest problem was the over-length. It can be cut very easily, with more relevant scenes, other than the one they used. I found the early part of Ray's life when he was just starting out, the most interesting. He was humble at the time, and somewhat gentleman. And while the movie might have exaggerated its actions, he got a little too full of himself to take care of me. <br /> <br /> Performance. Jamie Fox shows for centuries as Ray. He looks like Ray, speaks like Ray, acts like Ray. He even sings like Ray! It's much more than an impression, I really believed he was Ray Charles. He was the heart of the film, and without his presence this film would be a complete and complete drill. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line. Sometimes Ray is very boring with others. When all was said and done, I was disappointed with how routine it seemed. Just because it is a bibliographic film, does not automatically mean Oscar worthy. Jamie Fox deserves his Oscar, but the film is at its best above average. Worth it, but if I were you, I would keep my expectations at a fairly comfortable level. <br /> <br /> 7/10
