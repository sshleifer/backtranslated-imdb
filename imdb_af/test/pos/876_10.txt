I love this movie. This is the first film master P ever done. It is based on the story of his life. This is low budget, but it is very good. It shows how Master p grew up in New Orleans projects. <br /> <br /> Not only did Master P start in this movie, he was also the author and director of Moon Jones. The DVD also has The No Limit-ysparty on it. This movie shows how master P of bad goes too well and how he has to deal with things around him. It also has a lot of The No Limit Records roster in this movie. You have to buy or rent this movie. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie to watch, you're like rap, or is a master P fan. I won't spoil this movie for you. Check this movie as fast as you can and watch it. You will like it.
