If you want your sports movies to be about dignity and the best values, it will be a great time for you. Overview in places? Of course it is - and proud of it. It is the biggest and best ride in the Carnival and should be so enjoyed. <br /> <br /> Great production values, simply telling, with creative shots: it's not complex, is a very nice and remarkable sweet movie. It really feels like a work of love from Bill Paxton; and I bet his son gets it. <br /> <br /> The build-up is slow enough to enjoy, the conflicts dirty, and the British against Americans handle some vaudevic villain, but the dignity of the two main transformational Atlantic actors is always in sight . I have a slight grip: the score is James Horner, but it is too much of a blow, and there are too many close-ups and panning shots for 2005, but if you want a straight, decent and nice sports movie, that's it . <br /> <br /> So here's the thing, and I feel like I know my movie, but I really liked it more than Seabiscuit: what's a better movie, but Biggest Story is simply Disney in its core and largely enjoyable! Thanks, Bill.
