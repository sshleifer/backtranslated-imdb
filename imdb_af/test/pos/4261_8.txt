Putney Swope is the story of a black man's sign on the board of a large advertising industry that was accidentally voted as chairman of the board when the owner of the firm overwhelmed while trying to make him think he was excited over. Putney obviously takes his new role in the heart and fires most everyone in the agency, hires a new crew (all black except a token-white man) and continues to eliminate the most offensive and non-PC ads what one can ever ask for. Now it's a tough crew he has, and despite being somehow successful while shed in the cash. Rather, I like the scene where potential advertisers get rid of cash bags and then tell them to come out. And their ads will follow later, like them or not. The story is good, but of course the highlight here is the nasty advertising itself, especially the one for "Face Off" acne cream. It is quite dated, but still a fun movie, and full of hilarious moments. Robert Downey sr. Was working for an advertising agency that did experimental advertising then and I think it was his middle finger for the Madison Avenue agencies. Very good and pretty damn funny. 8 out of 10.
