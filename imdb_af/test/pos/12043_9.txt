Darr (1993) was an amazing movie. I think it's one of Bollywood's best. The movie itself leads to feelings of sympathy, fear, confusion, happiness and sadness. Shahrukh's role was incredible, he actually gave a new face. Juhi Chawla's innocent and girl character confronted largely with Shahrukh's fiery and passionate character. Sunny Deol's role has made the "good old" role look like the "bad guy" one. The fact that Shahrukh, not Sunny, caught the attention of the audience, proves that everyone has the helpless inner drive to pursue something that is not really in their hands. Although the movie is several years old, it surpasses any recent one. The song "Tu Mere Samne" was full of passion and meaning. His personality fits perfectly with the role. He must seriously consider playing in a similar role again.
