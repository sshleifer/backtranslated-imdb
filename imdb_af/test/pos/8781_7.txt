Cummings is falsely accused of sabotage and goes on the lamb, looking for the right guilty. The well-known Hitchcock theme of a man who is mistakenly accused of a crime is well represented in this entertaining prize that features elements of "The Thirty Nine Steps" and "North at Northwest", although not as good as one of that classic is not. There are some impressive pieces, including the finals on the Statue of Liberty. The plot is indisputable and unconvincing and after a tremendous start it seems to no longer steam. Cummings are nice if they are somewhat stiff. Lane is the blonde, but not the cool variety of the director's later films. The supporting roles are generally well played.
