This movie is completely underestimated. <br /> <br /> This is a movie similar to Will Keenan and Patrick Hasson's Waiting, as well as Adrien Brody's Restaurant and the classic movie Breaking Away. It's all about young adults who are stuck and know they are stuck, with little or no chance of breaking free. <br /> <br /> Death By Pizza (Delivered) is about an intelligent, free-thinking, artistic young adult (Will, played by David Strictland) who is fasting and waiting for the world's hypocrisy and bitterly own lack of direction and desire. Will meet his nemesis, Reed (Ron Eldard), another intelligent young adult who is so bitter, he chose the path of crime. Both help each other to free themselves from their bitterness, enabling them to release. <br /> <br /> For these young adults it can be unfinished, Willing's life is filled with the brands of a young "fast" adult: a soul-sucking, sweating, underpaid job, rough clients, a ex-girlfriend who left him. because he was unmotivated, a partial college education with no degree, a house full of self-esteem and of course the new friend whose wicked choices help him save himself.
