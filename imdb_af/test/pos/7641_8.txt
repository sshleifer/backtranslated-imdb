I caught this movie on the Horror Channel and was very impressed by the movie's Gothic atmosphere and tone. As a huge fan of everything vampire-related, I am always pleased to see a new variation of the vampire mite, in this case a ghoulish creature living in a Lovecraftian other dimension. The director has done a brilliant job of transporting the dark mood of the subject by using the decadent art scene as a backdrop of what is essentially a story of love that spans time and space - the pure love of friendship towards the desire for blood and life. through the vampires in the story. The characters in the story are transferred to a different dimension through a thought-changing substance, where a form-shift of vampire desires their hearts, while draining their lives. There are some analogies about drug addiction and loss of control, and how it affects a group of friends in an artistic circle. I enjoyed watching the two main male characters in the story, Chris Ivan Cevic and Alex Petrovich, who were very attractive hunters, always a plus in a vampire story for the female viewers! The special effects and creature effects were well done, and the set design of the vampire's dimension was very effective. All in all, a pleasant approach to vampire mites, and recommended to anyone who likes their vampires with a little intelligence and not just action. The only thing missing out to make it even better would have been a bit more erotic and nudity, as it would fit the plot and themes.
