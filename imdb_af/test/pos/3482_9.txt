I don't usually react to movies, because I'm in the film distribution business, but I have to say it's one of my favorite movies of all time. The acting is fantastic and the writing is even better. There were no cheesy speeches or exploitation of disabled people to try to make this movie more "Hollywood". James McAvoy is such an excellent actor, I couldn't look away from him when I tried. I was also impressed with Steven Robertson. I can't believe it's his first real movie. Brenda Fricker plays a small role, but as usual she is outstanding. It's a movie for everyone to see how happy we are all. If you want Awakenings and Mask, you'll enjoy this story. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie.
