"The Last American Virgin", along with the "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", is one of the last big teenage movies ever made. This is a gentle story of envy and unrequited love in the early eighties. Critics have criticized that it was a sophomorous, banal attempt to recreate the magic of "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", but the critics did not acknowledge that the two films were actually filmed simultaneously and only at slight intervals. released. from each other. Either way, the studios will never allow such a bold and uncompromising portrayal of the issues many male teenagers face, as they reach their sexual maturity. Especially because of the heartbreaking discovery of the lead role, Gary is finally confronted. American Pie is not. The story revolves around a thirty male teenagers, and they are mostly unsuccessful sexual pursuits. Gary is the least successful of the group, hence the tagline LAST AMERICAN VIRGIN. Secret wish Gary to Karen, who is involved with Rick, his best friend. Rick and Karen start having sex, and Karen becomes pregnant, just dumped by Rick, who is not interested in the obvious responsibility that lies ahead of him. Gary slips into aid Karen, leading to the aforementioned unexpected conclusion. Generally as a movie, I find it very successful as a comedy, as a commentary on the sexual dilemmas of young men and a remarkable lifetime story dealing with issues such as envy, unrequited love and abortion, which are equally relevant is. today as they were more than twenty years ago. Also, it has made one of the rocking soundtracks ever !!!
