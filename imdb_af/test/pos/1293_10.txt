I saw this episode of Masterpiece Theater and immediately looked at IMDb to look it up. I was greeted by another user's comment, who believed it was nothing special, a 6 out of 10, and sublime. I will be morally rejected if I disagree. <br /> <br /> Now I'm an avid fan of Masterpiece Theater, but often the stories can be a bit stupid on television, for example, "He knew He Was Right" was absolutely terrible. "Carrie's War," is probably the best I've seen so far. The whole movie does an excellent job, and it has kept my interest more than any other piece I've seen recently. The character Mr. Evans is of particular importance, and through subtle images of, for example, an untouched birthday cake or a pomegranate, my opinion of him went from bad to really good. Really. His ultimate downfall and the story of how everyone around him left him a cold hard man, is what the bittersweet in this story brought out to me. <br /> <br /> The end is satisfactory in all sense, but one; that everyone could not find what they deserved, but overall things worked out. I absolutely recommend it to everyone.
