Crossing the bridge: the sound of Istanbul received one of the appalling applause of the audience when it ended and very meritorious. I didn't expect too much from a musical documentary, but the movie was much more than that. It was also a visual documentary from Istanbul with strong contrasts of old and new, western and eastern, poor and rich, modern and traditional. Black and white photographs of the ancient Istanbul by world-renowned Armenian photographer Ara Guler were extraordinary. But of course, the main theme was music, and by God, a variety of them! It was similar to Bueno Vistas Social Club; the love and respect of the interviewer -Alexander Hacke here replaced Ray Cooder for the musicians from the screen and engulfed us all. The music was mostly interesting. The jazz session by a group of Roman gypsies in a small western Turkish town was blowing. I won't be surprised if the travel agents start booking Kesan after the movie is released. But I loved most of Muzeyyen Senar, who looks incredibly elegant in a kind of burlesque way, and while she declared her "Raki" teasing: "My voice and I'm 86 years old!" Well done Faith Akin. I bet there are many Turkish musicians who are left out: please go for Volume II.
