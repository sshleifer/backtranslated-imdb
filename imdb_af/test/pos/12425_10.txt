I first saw it on demand. Or on TV. I'm not really sure. But it must be my favorite movie ever! I mean, this movie has blood, gore, laughter and cold fever through the movie. I recently ordered "Monster Man" from Amazon and I watched "Monster Man" since I got it. Believe me, you will love this movie. <br /> <br /> P.S. The comments on the DVD are very funny. They also commented on "Monster Man 2" during the comment. Let's hope they make "Monster Man 2"! If you have the chance, rent the movie or buy it. You will absolutely love it! This is the best movie released in 2003. <br /> <br /> 10/10
