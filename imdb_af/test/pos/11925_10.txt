Quick summary of the book: Son, Billy Tepper, about 12 years old, is the school's main problem maker, and if he is kicked off from one school, he will be sent to the hostel. His school boy's school in Switzerland (or somewhere like that) is taken over by Arab terrorists, why I'm not really sure. Billy has no friends and likes to use his laptop to catch up with his school's database. He, with the help of two teachers, violates the terrorists' plans and saves the whole school. The book was not bad, but was sooooooo clich√©. <br /> <br /> Now about the movie; They switched Arab terrorists to Cuban terrorists, and Billy made about 17 and the leader of his group of friends. They like to get in trouble, but ordinary teenagers. This movie was credible. Maybe not realistic, but the characters are real. You can watch Billy, Joey and the rest of the guys and see real kids doing the way they did (or at least). <br /> <br /> Great action scenes. Not everything goes like on either side. To overthrow the terrorists was messy, and good guys got hurt. I won't say who, but it's heartbreaking (I know, I use the word a lot). Sean Astin is excellent. As a teenager, he usually played the best best friend. This movie again proved that he could play the foremost man, child, whatever. The only show that may have been performed was Wil Wheaton, who was the only son of a New Jersey mafia man. He hated his father and everything he stood for. (A far from Wesley Crusher) Usually this genre of movie is one that I look for the soul's purpose to make fun; but not Toy Soldiers. The story line flows, the dialogue is usually credible. I can't think of a moment where I screamed on the TV. "Oh, this won't happen." Great movie that should be in everyone's collection.
