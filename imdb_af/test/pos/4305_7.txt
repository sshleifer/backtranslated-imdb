Double Shock is one of the very good Columbo episodes that reaches the level of a good movie. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements we hold in the Columbo episodes. We get the laugh when Columbo makes something awkward, and it happens more than once in Double Shock. I can almost guarantee that you will laugh a few times if you decide to watch this episode. <br /> <br /> We also get the riddle as usual with an almost perfect murder, but something about the killing problems Columbo. The end is the usual, we get the story about how Columbo solved the mystery. <br /> <br /> It's another good Columbo episode, and I'll rate it 7/10. It's near 8/10. <br /> <br /> "One more question" - The acting one? Peter Falk is very good as usual.
