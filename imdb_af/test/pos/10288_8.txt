All credit to author / director Gilles Mimouni who made this winding, perverted story of fraud and betrayal. Keeping the best in control, he keeps the audience at arm's length, so they are not fully aware of the action. Even his clever denial recommends you. <br /> <br /> The three central performances are also top class, with Vincent Cassel, Romane Bohringer and Monica Bellucci doing their utmost to add to the puzzle. Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey complements strength in his supporting role. To give away plot details or character specifications would not be fair. <br /> <br /> Thierry Arbogast uses the camera effectively to sweep us through this mystery, and Cardine Biggerstaff's editing keeps the story a step forward. Peter Chase's theme is sublime in his marriage with the ideal of writing. <br /> <br /> Many people can say that Gilles Mimouni is trying to confront several deeper issues about their love. For me, this is just a haunting, elusive mystery that weaves a fascinating web. Only the French are capable of such tantalization. Hollywood would have ruined it with a happy ending. <br /> <br /> Monday, March 2, 1998 - Hoyts Croydon <br /> <br /> Nobody likes the French. When they do, they'll get it right. <br /> <br /> Vincent Cassell is intriguing as the deceptive Max, Romane Bohringer obsessed with the new Lisa, and Monica Bellucci is mysterious as the first Lisa. The plot of Gilles Mimouni is a storm of deliberate deception and deadly crossed threads. <br /> <br /> All credit must go after its manipulation of the clever plot and lead the performances of the three. Like Lucien, Jean-Phillippe Ecoffey is strong and emotional. <br /> <br /> Friday, January 15, 1999 - Video
