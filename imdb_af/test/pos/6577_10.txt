A touch documentary that puts a human face on the 9/11 tragedy, by showing how one small community has been floating to honor two high school friends, loses on that day. The film interweaves the lives of Chris and Tom through interviews with family and friends and snippets of old photos. Through their memories, our two lives look tragically short. The film also shows how an inspirational memorial was produced through a series of coincidences through the efforts of many people, both known and unknown to the two victims. Through laughter and tears (and sweat) we see the power of hope and honor and love. These films evoke many different emotions, but the final feeling is one of the admiration of the human spirit undone by the tragedy.
