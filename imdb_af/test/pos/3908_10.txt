This excellent movie starring Elizabeth Montgomery has long been in arrears for release in DVD form. The same can be said for her earlier, also excellent film, a case of rape. I can only hope that my comment spurs some enterprising soul to place EVERY Elizabeth Montgomery movie on one DVD made available to her many fans. I believe that this excellent actress's role is unfortunately stereotyped by her role on Bewitched, and as a result, serious role-players were no longer made available to her. I am confident that if these two movies, perhaps even a trilogy with The Legend of Lizzie Borden, are released in DVD form, her fans will correct the record on how high they regard her serious acting abilities.
