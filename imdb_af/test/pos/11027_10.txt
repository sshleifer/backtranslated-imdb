I watched this movie in 75 and this movie was a kind of thought to me about how important it is to care for nature and wild life. When I got a dog in 83, I called him TRUSKA (In Movie..Avakun's dog) never to forget this movie. <br /> <br /> By the way, I have a copy of this movie, but I'm in Portuguese language and the quality is not as good as a DVD or a new VHS (I spent almost 20 years ago and in SLP recorded soon so the quality is not so good. <br /> <br /> If someone wants a copy, I will try to convert to DVD and I can send you OK? <br /> <br /> Ot's a big movie and I agree that a movie should always be watched. <br /> <br /> Waldemar Braz - Sao Paulo / Brazil
