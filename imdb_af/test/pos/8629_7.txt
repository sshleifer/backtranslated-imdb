So I think Bud and Lou just wanted to waste classic stories (though they had interesting results). In this case they are a bad boy, and Lou tries to read him "Jack and the Beanstalk", but falls asleep and dreams that he is Jack and Bud's butcher. They climb the bones to save the prince and princess. From the giant (Buddy Baer). <br /> <br /> I think my favorite scene was when Lou tried to make the giant an omelet, and ... I'll show you what's happening. Being an Abbott and Costello movie, they had some unnecessary songs, but unlike that, it was funny. For other interpretations of the classic story, "Bewitched" and "Gilligan's Island", both episodes portrayed.
