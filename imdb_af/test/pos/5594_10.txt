Yikes! and we all thought Joan Crawford was THE abomination Mom dearest ... Well, Laura Hope Crewes as a mother in this sturdy 4-character movie, delivers the goods in this cracker of a marriage force. The silver cord is a truly sensational pre-code drama by RKO made in 1932 in 33 out of a 1929 play release. So amazingly, honestly and honestly, every surprising verbal exchange between one boy's wife (IreneDunne) along with the other's fiancee, as these two younger girls go together in the war - in view of her fragrant oldest son virile Joel MacCrea and pay her younger 'beau' / son by the delicate and beautiful 25-year-old actor Eric Linden. I would have thought this movie was played to many thrilling acting audiences in big theaters in 1933 and even gave viewers even in 2005 a very fruity melodrama that is addicted to the cracked dialogue, not afraid to name Mother exactly as she is. This movie could be made impossible after the censorship came after 1934. Other viewer comments on the IMDb support my response and you'll almost find everyone happy to see (and band). The silver cord will agree that it is a memorable and sharp script in a wonderfully crafted film. It would have played like the VIRGINIA WOLF of 1932. Laura Hope Crewes had to kiss the sound stage at RKO for this role of a lifetime. Even more than her soft GWTW twist. Irene Dunne is as beautiful and coincidental and credible as ever, fighting for her husband again, and it is worth seeing The Divorcee made in 1929 as a companion to THE SILVERORD. Joel MaCrea is definitely in the same league as Cary Grant and Randolph Scott in the attractive and fun game. I have never seen Eric Linden in a real role (he amputated the leg in the hospital horror scene in GWTW) and here he is brilliant and youthful with an excellent role as Robert, the younger and sensitive boy. Some oral barbs that resemble him will pass by the Code office no later. It's a very good movie, and if the viewer forgives some of the time's grief and comes for a 1932 movie for a match of unparalleled speed, you'll be well rewarded. Initially I thought some of the throat clinging to Mother's melodrama had been dated until I realized it was a set-up of the excellent screenplay to make the viewer laugh at her as if she were a poor old lady. .... NOT. .... but also not the other two women in this power station playing on film, hence the fantastic retort dialogue. The sea liner seen in line one is the LEVIATHAN the monster ship that the US won in the first half of the Germans in the first half. It was so big and inflexible that teams' nerve wrecks wrestle on the Atlantic Ocean. It is notorious to erect a colossal wave in a storm and shoot over the crest. At such a corner, the spine cracked along the bottom and split the ship vertically between the pulls. It hit the harbor with rattling steel panels and cut hole holes ... and mentally crushed crew and passengers. It was beaten in 1935 after being cursed and having the terrible mechanical problems. Not such a war price. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the dialogue in THE SILVER CORD is enough tension for one night. For example: "Mother! The doctor said there was nothing wrong with you, he said it would take a stick of dynamite to kill you". Whammo!
