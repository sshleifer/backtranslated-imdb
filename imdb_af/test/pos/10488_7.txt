I wasn't familiar with this movie, until I saw it in a list of the Top 20 Spaghetti Westerns I've seen recently (after the marathon I made these last few weeks from the subgenre); So it was a good thing that the movie almost made Italian Italian show up (for the first time, I'm pretty sure in a good number of years)! <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the cable reception of the channel on which it was broadcast has not been wonderful lately: I recorded the movie on VHS, but I decided not to keep it due to this factor not; The next day I watched the movie, and I found out that it was available on a region 2 DVD from Italy (interviewed by accredited screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi). And I was impressed enough and decided to order it. There and then, even though I knew I wouldn't be coming to the DVD for a while, as I would like to spend a while between one movie and the next! A brief bracket here: When I recently bought a Spaghetti Westerns spade on Italian DVD, I chose not to order Sergio Sollima's CROP (1967), as I was under the impression that it was a bare bone relationship; However, I just learned that the disk actually contains an interview with the director (as in the case of THE BIG GUNDOWN [1966], which I bought). It surprised me as if Sollima would not make a similar contribution to the DVD issue of the movie, as he actually considered his favorite work (as per the director's talent bio included in the Blue Underground Region 1 disc of A Sollima Spaghetti West - RUN, MAN, RUN [1968]); The problem is that I loved so much of the GREAT GUNDOWN that I followed it with a viewing of FACE TO FACE via the recording I owned from Italian TV! I have now ordered the DVD of that movie - especially since it is still discounted - but as I said about a second look at THE PRICE OF POWER (although I can still see Sollima's interview when the disk arrives). .. <br /> <br /> OK, rant over: the movie under review is quite an unusual Spaghetti Western and a very interesting, indeed ambitious one, a conversion from the JFK assassination to an Old West environment! In fact, it reminds Anthony Mann's sharp black-and-white thriller THE TALL TARGET (1951) - which made a murder attempt on the life of the time. President Abraham Lincoln. It features one of the most popular Italian stars of this subgenre, Giuliano Gemma, in what may be his impressive Western role (many of his other films tended to have a slight bow). The supporting film includes at least two other notes: Van Johnson (in one of his few and especially unbeatable Italian films) such as the US President in the Civil War killed Dallas and Fernando Rey as head of a Southern African conspiracy - who not only judges his assassination but also the new acting American leader, Johnson's vice president, maneuver through extortion! <br /> <br /> Benito Stefanelli also makes a good impression as a corrupt sheriff who practices Gemma through the picture, and with whom he has been involved in a "duel in the dark" a few times - with the guns resting on the floor rather than their respective holsters and the only light in the room provided at the end of the cowboy cigars! Also involved is Ray Saunders as Gemma's black sidekick, whose story eventually changes into the doomed Lee Harvey Oswald figure. Stelvio Massi - who later cuts his teeth, as a director, on a number of police missions - is behind the film's light cinematography; Similarly, Luis Enrique Bacalov provides another great "Euro-Cult" count - which differs from Ennio Morricone's style to be equally distinctive. Valerii's direction here may be as impressive as in other Spaghetti Westerns, but he does the steps efficiently (the final rifle fight is particularly well done); the movie is definitely one of the more understated entries in the sub genre and for those who are so inclined, the novelty of the plot line alone should make it look ...
