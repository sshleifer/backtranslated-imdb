Blue Planet ... Wow ... Where do I start? The hard work of the years has paid out in what is undoubtedly one of the best documentary works ever created. <br /> <br /> The views and sounds offered by Blue Planet are scarce, like most documentary documents with the Attenborough seal, and have not even experienced most people. This alone should be enough to buy this series, especially if you are the curious type who wants to know. <br /> <br /> However, Blue Planet is not a perfect documentary. It gets a bit repetitive after the 3rd episode. How many ways can different sea creatures swim, kill, poo, mate and lay eggs, and should all of these be really investigated? But if you have a deep interest in sea life, this repetition should not be a problem for you.
