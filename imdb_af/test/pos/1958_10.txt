I hope the author, director, editor and composer (and let's not forget the producer) read it ... because their work was truly incredible on this movie. Let me start by saying that I am not affiliated with this film in any way. I'm just a regular man who has been a fan of this movie for twelve years and has seen it about 8 times. <br /> <br /> Every second of this movie touches. Each scene is classic. The acting is real. The movie is honest. You can relate to these characters with people, not actors. <br /> <br /> This story follows three different killers at different stages in their lives. The story is carefully thought out and each sub-graph is interwoven and woven together, resulting in a message that shows us what the right and wrong values ​​of each of us are. <br /> <br /> Crispen Glover, Daniel Roebuck, Dennis Hopper, and Joshua John Miller (as a 12-year-old boy) give absolutely wonderful, real performances. I saw this movie about 8 or more times and I am still being absorbed in their performances so I forget to watch a movie. It's so good. Great work everyone who worked on it. Great work. <br /> <br /> The music is also great and spooky. With the chosen cast, the meticulous timing and pacing, the mood and the tone, and even the subject, the director made the best decisions for a movie I have ever seen. <br /> <br /> This movie is real. It's honest. It's a real movie experience I will never forget. You may not be in the subject, but this is something you cannot ignore. Ultimately it's about people being people ... and everyone can relate to them. I recommend this movie to fans of drama, tension and horror over almost every other movie.
