Blade is by far the ever-growing comic book genre of comic book adaptation one of the most well-known and most faithful (overall) to the source material ... since the character has been nearly 30 years of history in comics since its debut as a backup figure in Marvel's Tomb of Dracula, the writer has taken almost all the characters and plot elements from comic history. While changes have inevitably been made, the finer points of the film roll are right about any criticism. Don't let any of your friends tell you otherwise: Blade is one fine movie. If it feels like "comic booky" for your Stanley Kubrick snobs out there, it's because it's supposed to. Handle it, but don't fix it.
