Christopher Nolan's first feature film got critics who saw it when it first came out. Shot at a $ 6,000 micro budget, it's a real class student pilot. The film is shot in black and white and contains people you adopt are friends of Nolan who appear in the movie. This is not to say they are bad actors because they are pretty good. You can see that Jeremy Theobald and Alex have appeared in other projects, but unfortunately they have not made it since 6 years ago. <br /> <br /> Nolan's excitement, like Memento, does not play chronologically, it shifts the scenes Just like Pulp Fiction. The writing is fantastic. It's a big spinning thriller, but because the temporal order of the movie is being moved around, it makes it even more interesting. I thought the last ten minutes in particular when everything became clear was excellent. <br /> <br /> For such a small movie with no recognizable names, it's so good. It's better than most Hollywood studios offer and Nolan to three movies (this, the superior Memento and not so good, but still excellent Insomnia) has highlighted itself as the most exciting new talent of the past. I can't wait for Batman. <br /> <br /> This movie is short and sweet and definitely a good look. It's very professional and the twists are fantastic and quite surprising. I also thought David Julyan's score was excellent too, very atmospheric and had a cold quality. He also compiled Nolan's other films. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would recommend it, I intend to get all Nolan's movies. This is a low budget gem. ***** <br /> <br />
