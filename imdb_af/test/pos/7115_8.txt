This moody, creepy horror movie starts on a castle on top of a cliff overlooking the ocean, a beautiful setting, like a vampire bat flying and crawling to a sleeping place (Onslow Stevens). The bat turns into a man known as Baron Latos, in fact Count Dracula (John Carradine). He's looking for Dr. Edelmann's help to heal him from his vampirism. Eventually, the good doctor also wants to help his nurse assistant (Jane Adams), Wolf Man (Lon Chaney) and Frankenstein's monster (Glenn Strange). But Dracula's trickery pollutes the doctor's blood, and he becomes a Jekyll / Hyde vampire himself. It's a bit better than last year's "House of Frankenstein", which is less episodic and more exciting. There is a frightening scene where Dracula is trying to lure the second nurse (Martha O'Driscoll) into his world, initially playing "Moonlight Sonata" on the piano, which will soon be the frightening music. Director Erle Kenton uses expressionistic shadows and ominous music to frame many series, including a wonderful assembly sequence that the studio often uses in their horror features. Two artists are up to date: Stevens, with his wonderful voice, is initially sympathetic, then convincingly threatening. Adams, her beautiful face in the terrible contrast with her twisted body, shows great pathos and sympathy. It all ends up in a diagonal climax, typical of the 1940s. Universal horror, a little sudden, borrowed from footage from "The Ghost of Frankenstein" (1942). I hope Universal releases it quickly to DVD (it's left from their Double-Feature editions).
