I played Sam (the porter, Lou's sidekick) in the movie "Dead Rail" which was later broadcast as "Alien Express". And I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. As a struggling actor it was a chance for me to work with fantastic people, it gave me big screens on my coil, and it allowed me to work for a month and a dream. (the director) And Steve and Scott (the producers) were very nice to give me the opportunity to participate in the production. I made many friends (Lou, Todd, Steven) and I consider myself very happy to work with these incredibly talented people. There wasn't a day gone by, I didn't laugh at my butt. The real tragedy is not so much the special effects, it is that every single person who watched this movie did not notice what happened behind the scenes and all the talent that really went into it. Artisans build the set, props, gaffers, wardrobe, makeup artists, script supervisors, film maker, production assistants, extras, craft services, producers, director and actors. It is a given that Sci fi did not spend a terrible amount of money on the film (2 million). But there was a lot of time, energy and manpower set in it. I now look at the film as a production that brought many talented people together for a fun project shot in less than two months without complications. It was a wonderful saucepan and crew and I am just as happy to be there! On a note to those of you who don't know Lou Diamond Phillips, Todd Bridges, and Steven Brand. They are fantastic people who are incredibly funny. Lou, I'm still working on my Deniro impression and can't thank you enough for launching me after midnight. Todd, every time I hear an Elvis song, I can't forget the story you told me to eat at home with him for dinner. "Can you please give me the daddy?" (IM A GREAT ELVIS WAIT!) Steven, "Sir Fire!" You are a true gentleman and all the advice and encouragement I have received from you will always be appreciated. I miss you guys and hope you are good. Thanks for the good memories, stories, jokes and friendships. Oh, and miss Utah say hello! twist. <br /> <br />
