Assy McGee is a show that you really need to be a certain age to appreciate. Otherwise, it is likely that you will miss the references to 80's cops and think it's a running gag about a walking rectum. Think it's brainless, child-like humor? Look at the Stallone movie 'Cobra' and you'll see what I mean. This show actually has a lot of subtle humor, which many say, both for a show that is broadcast on adult swimming, and for a performance on a running ass. <br /> <br /> All the standard genre clicks are in place that made movies like Dirt Harry and Cobra so big and ripe for parody. Sanchez is Assy's partner, who, according to the genre at the level, is constantly apologizing for his partner's murderous behavior. The police chief is, of course, a fire-breathing hard case that lives to shout: "I want your badge on my desk first thing tomorrow morning!" The over-the-top and sometimes completely stupid way in which the 1980s 'Renegade Cop' film is parodied fits the subject well. For example, while a bus robbery is being broken up, one of the criminals keeps asking Assy: "Hey, where are you, asshole!?" After which the title character of the one-liner is cut off: "I'm going ... to shoot you." <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for anyone who loves 80's action flicks and has actually watched enough of them to understand the humor.
