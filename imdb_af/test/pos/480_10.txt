If you're tired of the same repetitive, unintelligible material that releases the mainstream movie industry, you'll enjoy "You're alone". It's thoughtful, well shot and sounds. <br /> <br /> Without revealing anything you don't get in the first few minutes of the movie, it is the story of a young white high school girl from a higher middle-class environment who works as a guide and discovered by her neighbor. The vast majority of the movie takes place in a hotel room where he hired her to come. <br /> <br /> Through their discussion, you explore two shifting views of prostitution, depression, loneliness. Yet the film is not depressed. It talks about dark things without being depressed. <br /> <br /> As a viewer, your emotions and preconceptions are moved, but lightly. You get a lot to think about. I like it in a movie.
