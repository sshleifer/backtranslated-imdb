It is rare that I have the opportunity to review a movie for IMDb that is closely related to my own life. If someone with cerebral palsy (albeit less serious than Michael, one of the main characters in the film), I don't want to give this movie a 'free pass', just because it tackles a topic that is rarely approached. And when it is, it is usually treated with a serious face. There were little problems I had with the movie; and I would like to address the first, so that people are clear that it is not my situation that has darkened my judgment on this excellent film! <br /> <br /> * Parts of what I felt were unashamedly crowded at the expense of realism. If I had a pound every time, a benevolent member of the public said to my electric wheelchair racing, I would be much richer; But to speak personally, it fits more into the public perception of how we deal with our disadvantages, rather than the reality of what actually happens. The same thing about spending time looking at disabled people is going to the bar - it's not a big problem for those of us who actually do it, as much as it can be for outside residents. I appreciate it from Michael's pre-protected perspective; but I still think he will concentrate more on the experience, rather than reflecting on how big it was, that he was actually there, first and foremost. As such, the amount of time we spent spending time watching them felt like a little too much. <br /> <br /> * I felt that the terminal nature of Rory's disease was brought to our attention too late; which means that it was only used as a cheap sentimental device to come between the two, rather than dealing with something that everyone had long known. <br /> <br /> To balance that criticism, I have to have dish too a lot of praise. Though I thought some scenes they saw with normal life were a touch exaggerated; The script also ventured into some difficult places I wouldn't have expected, and made a lot of credit for it. For example, raising the issue of love and relationships; and the daily device often used to help and help the lives of non-disabled people. Also, despite the blunt emotional shock tactics of death that jumped on us, the movie as a whole is far less juicy than anyone has the right to expect these types of movies. <br /> <br /> Brenda Fricker can and Variations of her role happened on autopilot in a way that looks like for years; But Robertson and McAvoy share a special interaction that needs to be noticed. Inside, I do cartwheels that a group of people eventually made a film that justifies the lust of many disabled people.
