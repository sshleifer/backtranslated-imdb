There is only one movie I can think of as good or better than Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck - ALI BABA BUNNY. However, determining what's best is irrelevant. Just look at them and enjoy. <br /> <br /> I compared it to ALI BABA BUNNY, because both Daffy are at its worst, greedy, nasty and very funny in the process. However, I think I prefer RABBIT SEASONING simply because Bugs are also terribly terrible in this one - doing horrible things right back to Daffy every time Daffy tries a dirty trick. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Daffy leaving Rabbit. Tracks to Bugs' ass in the hope that a hunter (of course Elmer) will blow the rabbit and leave Daffy alone! In order not to break out, Bugs repeatedly takes Daffy's tricks and turns them around - and in most cases, Daffy is being shot in the face! It's all very, very clever and funny and I don't care how old you are, this cartoon will make you laugh unless you're a grouch. I especially love the big and unexpected end, but I won't say anymore because I don't want to spoil the surprise.
