"Rififi" is a terrific hoist movie, and one of the subsequent films has since pulled out. Jules Dassin has a feel for the seedy underworld in which these thieves live - you won't find the Hollywood glamor of Ocean's Eleven here. The robbers in "Rififi" do not rob the excitement and do not play a game. They rob to survive, pay for their children's education, prove to themselves and others that they still have something to offer the world. The beloved heist scene is a nail bite, filmed in virtual silence. I had the feeling that the plot went a little longer than it was needed, but the high-speed race to send the child to his mother ending the movie is classic. Be warned - This movie is very dark. But it is also very good. <br /> <br /> Degree: A-
