This movie is excellent in how it portrays the reality of sexual abuse. The girls express their contradictory emotions of love and betrayal. The location in the countryside is absorbingly authentic, and the soundtrack is inconspicuous, but moving. This film is a graduate course in a reality that is not recognized enough in American society. Personally, I am upset by the names of the characters - Lange's character is Ginny Cook Smith - my name is Connie Cook Smith, and my mother is Genny Cook. The youngest daughter is Caroline Cook, my sister's name, and my cousin's name is Larry Cook. But sexual abuse was not in our immediate family.
