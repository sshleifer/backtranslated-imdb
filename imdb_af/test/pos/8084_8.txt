It's a plot-driven movie and very entertaining. Nothing disturbing or original within the plot, but essentially moving very quickly and keeping your attention. I didn't really see the play I think is a good thing. John Mills was good, but he seems to be taking everything in his stride, considering how his life is falling apart. He will climb to the head, get up 20 seconds later, dust himself and continue as if nothing has happened. A small problem in a movie with a strong story, authentic places and a plot that constantly guesses to the conclusion.
