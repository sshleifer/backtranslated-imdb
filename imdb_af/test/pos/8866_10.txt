"I know I'm human. And if you were all these things, then you would just attack me, so some of you are still human. This thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to be within an imitation. it must, but it is vulnerable in the open. If it takes us over then it is no longer enemies, no one has to kill it, and then it is won. "<br /> <br /> John Carpenter's "The Thing" is one of the most entertaining horror movies ever made? fast, clever and pure exciting from start to finish. That's how all movies of the genre have to be made. <br /> <br /> In 1982, Antarctica began, and the film focused specifically on a group of American scientists. We don't get any introduction to their mission, but are put into existence when some seemingly crazy Norwegians appear at their base camp and chase an escaped dog. The Norwegians are killed, and the dog finds its way into the colony, that's when things really get started. <br /> <br /> It is soon made clear that the "dog" is actually a form shift alien organism, which manifests itself on the physical form of its victims ?? In other words, it starts to eat the Americans and imitate them so well that the remaining people cannot distinguish the difference between their friends and enemies. The pack of scientists, led by MacReady (Kurt Russell), begins to fight for their own survival, using white instead of brawn. If the thing is indeed among them, how about disclosing it? How many things are there? How can the thing be killed? (Or can it be destroyed?) <br /> <br /> The origin of creation in the film is easily explained: Thirty thousand years ago, a spacecraft came down to Earth and frozen in the Antarctic ice. The thing was trying to escape, and was discovered by the Norwegians in the ice, which unknowingly released it from its natural prison. <br /> <br /> "The Thing", the movie itself, is similar to Ridley Scott's iconic "Alien" (1979). Many comparisons are made ?? The protagonists are stranded in a deserted area, captured by a rarely seen enemy who succeeds in killing them one by one. But, "The Thing" ?? for all practical purposes ?? come first. <br /> <br /> Based on the famous short story "Who's Going There?" by John W. Campbell, Jr. (under pseudonym as Don A. Stuart), the film was originally adapted as a feature film production in 1951 by Howard Hawks and Christian Nyby. The result was "The Thing From Another World", an inexplicable classic. But to be fair, it carries little resemblance to the short story, and Carpenter's remake makes it more justice. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​adjusting the physical characteristics of anyone is what makes this movie really great, and is the key link to the short story. In 1951, the special effects were simply too poor to reasonably depict the form-shifting organism, but thirty-one years brought much progress in SFX. <br /> <br /> Creature effects artist Rob Bottin does an excellent job of turning that could easily become a cheesy gore festival in a frightening (and realistic) mess of blood and fear. The thing, though never actually one particular shape, is constantly seen in a morphing stage, and the effects are simply excellent. Twenty-two years later, they hit another blow. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone's score (nominated for a Razzie award at the time) is a bit too electronic and timid, yet it haunts it when used correctly. <Br /> <br /> Due to the fact that his cast is entirely made up of men, its end is one of the most thought-provoking and untypical conclusions of all time, "The Thing" ?? by any standards ?? is unconventional Hollywood at its best. It comes as no surprise that, at the time of its release, "The Thing" performed poorly in theaters and "E.T." ?? released the same year and with a lot of child stranger ?? In the long run, however, "The Thing" is almost every possible way better. Spielberg's story was outdated and fled during his 20th birthday re-release. "The thing," on the other hand, gradually climbed a doctrine of cult classic ?? It is one of the best known non-known films ever made. <br /> <br /> Carpenter is notorious for having a very uneven career? From his incredible "Attack on Precinct 13" (1976) to the wonderful "Halloween" (1978) to the disappointing and stupid "Escape from L.A." (1996), "The Thing" remains his best film. Although his reputation has never been enough to give it a place on most "big movies" lists, "The Thing" is still one of my favorite horror movies, and ?? At careful inspection ?? masterfully made. It's a daring and ingenious excitement that is unique and cool at the same time? A real relief for movie buffs that are tired of the same old horror knock-offs. This one, at the very least, is truly unpredictable.
