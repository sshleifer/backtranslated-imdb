House of Dracula works from the same basic point of departure as House of Frankenstein of the previous year; namely that Universal's three best-known samples; Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster and The Wolf Man appear in the movie together. Of course, the movie is pretty messy, but the fact that all three samples are there is usually enough to ensure that the sixty-seven minutes of the movie don't get boring. Obviously, the idea of ​​making another monster mash came into the author's head before a real plot did, as the yarn we gave was not exactly without holes. The plot sees Count Dracula arriving at Dr Edelman's house and asking for a cure for his vampirism. Then, which can only be described as accidental, Lawrence Talbot, viz. The Wolf Man turned up to ask for a healing for his misery! Dracula seems to be looking for Edelman's daughter, but Talbot is really serious. When it seems he can't be stopped to change into a wolf, the Wolfman throws himself into the sea ... where he finally finds Frankenstein's monster. <br /> Overall, this movie isn't as good as the previous House of Frankenstein. The 1944 movie compiled its plot better than this entry in the series, as the plot does not give equal time for every universal sample. Dracula's plot is the biggest in the first, but quickly fizzles out to just get up at the end. The Wolf Man is the star of the show, but his story never really develops, and is actually just another version of the plot he always finds himself. Frankenstein's monster is given the coldest hand, as he only appears in the movie as an afterthought, and a clear excuse to ensure that all three monsters appear in the movie. The story of the doctor, who is already three, is the most interesting, but it is a bit disappointing because he is not the reason people will see this movie. The play is good enough, with John Carradine showing his sinister side and Lon Chaney Jr. making sure his character is bathed in the tragedy. Glenn Strange is given nothing to do, and Onslow Stevens proves the real highlight as Dr Edelman. Overall, this movie won't do much for anyone who isn't a fan of Universal horror; but as foolish monster movies go, House of Dracula is worth seeing.
