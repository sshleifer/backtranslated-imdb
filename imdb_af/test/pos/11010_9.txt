The SF premise is not unique (although it was quite the case), but the focus is completely different from other artificial reality films. Particularly during the first part, it is an extensive crime photograph, which uses the SF premium to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of disappearing characters and unhelpful witnesses don't lie be unhelpful. Instead of an unreliable narrator, we have an unreliable world. <br /> <br /> In part two, we follow the main character's battle for common sense and it becomes more in a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation. He knows that she is nothing but electrical impulses, how does he handle this knowledge? He knows that there is a world more real than his, but he is trapped in an artificial world, a world where no one can understand him. The problem of thinking of knowing something that is essential to the world that no one else knows or wants to believe is a very real one with which many of us can identify. For me, the film carries this hopelessness very well, with its arid, artificial atmosphere that also supports the factual artificiality of the film's world. <br /> <br /> Unlike "The Matrix" or "The Thirteenth Floor," it's little worried about a sense of awe for his artificial reality plot, but rather focusing on the psychological aspects. Philosophy is just as interesting that certain philosophical concepts are essential in shaping and changing the character's perception of the world. <br /> <br /> It's probably longer than it should be (which is not a problem if you are as enchanted as it was) and part 2 is pretty low on steam.
