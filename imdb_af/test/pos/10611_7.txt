I saw Marigold on a preview that occurred a few days ago, and considered it a thorough and impressive film. The film is about a non-successful American actress going to India to perform in a low-budget movie, just to satisfy her there when she finds that the film's financing has disappeared, along with the producers and investors. A chance encounter with an Indian film shooting nearby leads her to be hired for a small dancer role in that. As the Indian movies contain a considerable amount of singing and dancing, it is a problem for Marigold, who has two left feet, not to mention a personality so tightly and thinly that she can hardly hear the music, To feel it, like Prem, the choreographer of the movie, recommends her to do so. <br /> <br /> But "premature" - the word, not the person - means "love" and Prem - the person, not the word - seems to embody that emotion in the way he interacts with him, or it is his production assistant who has shot Marigold, the narcissistic and arrogant director of the film, or the humble and sincere Marigold himself. Soon Marigold, under his expert supervision and engaging treatment, finds her feet - literally and figuratively. <br /> <br /> I have to say a word to those who are not familiar with the use of song and dance in Indian movies. Unlike American musicals, the story is progressed through these dance numbers, as plot developments unfold and character transformations occur in parallel with the dance. It should also be pointed out that Indian dance deals with much more than just movement. An essential part of it is determining the dancer's feelings and emotions while telling the story of the dance. This is the main purpose of the dance and the dancer. <br /> <br /> Reaching this stage of achievement, the Marigold is demonstrated in a beautiful dance number about halfway, when Marigold, while performing the dance she has to do for the film-inside movie, also speaks her love for Prem. It's an incredible show by Ali Larter, especially if one thinks she's not used to dancing in her movies, or motivating her character's feelings through dance. It shows her skill as an actress, as well as how much hard work she played in the role. <br /> <br /> Of course, no romantic movie can work without a credible Prince Charming. Salman Khan, who plays the role of Prem, adjusts the role of a T. Even when he appears to be a Prince, not so charming, he does not lose the audience's sympathy. Salman has been a Hindi movie (sometimes Bollywood) for years, and it's worth remembering that his first starring role was Prem. He is completely charming, loving, rich, sexy and vulnerable. For those who have never seen him on the screen, be prepared to be hit with mega-doses of mere magnetism! He and Ali Larter make a beautiful pair and are just as good as they look in their looks. <br /> <br /> Will they be able to solve their problems? It doesn't seem possible if we hear the last song of the movie, a beautiful fact and fantasy, reality and metaphor. The end certainly went from the audience, and I surprised it, but they were left satisfied. The songs are used very cleverly. They are in Hindi, untitled, for movie-in-movie series, and in English for other occasions. But their meaning is always clear from context and choreography. <br /> <br /> Marigold is a very satisfying romantic comedy - yes, there is quite a bit of humor. The Indian places and costumes give it a fairy tale quality, which contains a story that can be compared to a modern fairy tale. <br /> <br /> If you are or are curious about Indian cinema but were reluctant to try it, this is a great introduction. It captures the color and vitality of Indian movies, not only in the costumes and jewelery (which is very impressive), but also in the vibrant dances and world sound. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of Ali Larter, you should see it for her excellent acting in the portrayal of a selfish, demanding, "high-entertaining" woman who has an inner attraction that inspire the love of two men. If you are a girl, you will enjoy admiring Ali's beautiful costumes and mocking her with a leading man. If you're a guy, you can't just admire Ali in her sexy costumes, but learn from Salman Khan who needs to bring out the loving heart out of even such a person as Marigold.
