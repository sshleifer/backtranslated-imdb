I love pop culture, but I was a little anxious when I first heard it. Then I saw an episode, and I love it! I was a little upset when I found out that Christopher Eccelson would no longer play Doctor Who. He was probably the best one they had. He fits so well with the character. It's sad to see him go. I really don't think the new man is going to pull the doctor as well as Eccelson. <br /> <br /> I think everyone can overlook the caseus effects in some patches and creatures, such as the dare. The story lines and characters can do more than make up for it. I am waiting for season two and I will also revisit it if the quality of some reason falls. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I think everyone should try to see one episode. I've done this and I've loved it ever since. Well written, well thrown, and well produced, this show is worth the hour of viewing. Doctor getting a 10/10
