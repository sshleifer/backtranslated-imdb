Any film Bonnie Hunt, Sarah Silverman and Amy Sedaris in the supporting film, should be worth watching, and comic actor Jeff Garlin uses the tremendous talent he has gained for his 2007 director's debut. a sad comedy about an overweight man who feels stressful about the world around him. Known as Larry David's manager Jeff, "Curb Your Enthusiasm," plays Garlin James, a still struggling, 39-year-old Chicago actor who still lives with his widowed mother. His self-esteem is so low that he can't meet women, but it's the comic way in which he sees his ankle status involving his dilemma. If the storyline is a little known, it is because the film is partly a tribute to the 1955 Ernest Borgnine classic, "Marty", about a lonely Bronx butcher living with his virgin mother. Trolin actually uses "Marty" as the play James desperate to do, as he is so empathetic to the character's situation. Of course there is a love story of sorts in this new millennium version. Silverman plays Beth, a skinned, sexually fiery ice cream server who takes him to a lingerie shopping mall. Their best scene is in his favorite convenience store where they improvise different characters in different ways. Hunt plays a lonely primary school teacher who shares a passion with James for the jazz musician Ben Webster. They accidentally meet in a record shop and then on a career day at her school where he exposes his sexual neurosis in front of a classroom of first-graders hilaries, including his best friend, Luca's perther daughter Penelope (played by Dakota Fanning's look - like baby sister Elle). In a complicated cameo and looks quite like Jerri Blank, Sedaris plays the school's counselor who speaks to James for his inappropriate monologue. David Pasquesi plays Luca, a retirement home manager, and his scenes with Garlin have an easy report that makes their friendship easy to believe. Almost stealing the movie is character actress Mina Kolb, who plays James's cut mother with a cock and heart. <br /> <br /> There are also unexpected cameos from teen idol Aaron Carter and Gina Gershon (don't ask, but the essay is funny) as well as sharp plays by director Paul Mazursky (as the clever director of a revealing camera show, "Smear Job", Tim Kazurinsky (as the unsuspecting victim of the show) and Dan Castellaneta (as the hard-pressed lovers of the comfortable store). With its harsh attacks of insecurity and self-esteem, Garlin's comic sensitivity resembles that of Albert Brooks, and the informal dialogue at least reminds me of "Modern Romance" and "Defending Your Life". The one persistent problem I had with the movie is pacing, as some scenes are longer than needed. The problem is clearer in the first half when Garlin tries to establish the right pace, and the lack of real conflict contributes to the slowness. Regardless of what he does well, it is caught that the crunchy sense of despair feels one on the revelation that life is not what it is supposed to be, that a significant other can be out of reach and that a steady diet of junk food eaten on a hood is the only sure thing when it comes to satisfaction.
