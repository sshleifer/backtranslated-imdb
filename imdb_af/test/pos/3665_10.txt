I watched my honest piece of Bollywood movies as I grow up. You know the typical little boy meets girl, girl rejects boys, dakus (bad guys) takes girl, son saves girl by killing hundreds of dhakus and they are happily marrying of course I left out an hour of musical style numbers). Now I'm going to look at Hari Om, I expected another typical Bollywood style movie; But to my delight, it was unnatural and even quite comical. Bharatbala's Hari Om is what can be called as one of those 'off beat' Indian movies like the popular South Asian hits like Monsoon Wedding, East is east or bends like Beckham. <br /> <br /> Being South Asian decent and looking at several classic Bollywood movies, there was lots of humor and sub-dialogue that could be recorded that reminds me of the fun and charming side of Indian culture (eg. The various Indo pop numbers that were actually recreated by Nitin are Soni or the spiritual Indian snakes used). Hari Om can be enjoyed by all South Asian people, and is also entertaining for those who are not accustomed to Indian humor, as the characters and plot provide all audiences. <br /> <br /> In a cocunut shell is the movie of the car rickshaw driver (aka "quad bike" for those of you traveling to India) played by Vija Raaz (of Monsoon Wedding) who gets himself involved at a rogue and ends up a little money. To prevent him from selling his quad bike, 'Madhuri', he escapes serendipitously with 'Madhuri' and a very charismatic and beautiful woman from France, Isa (Camille Natta), who has herself bored with her boyfriend Benoit (Jean Marie Lamour ) escape in swimming pool). The film is about their journey over the beautiful landscape of Rajasthan? the land of love stories; Through humor you see the two main players trying to figure out who they really are. <br /> <br /> What made the most of the night was the director, executive, editor, and even the mother of me. Natta present at the show. After talking to Bharatbala (which actually has a Zoological background), many interesting tuckers were uncovered from the movie, including: after the film was finalized only 10 days before the Toronto International Film Festival and only 45 days to shoot, and only five actors in the play (the rest were the first real actors). When I got home, I realized two things from the movie. There is always a human connection between us and us, despite our differences. Secondly, as the director put it, everyone had a love story. <br /> <br /> It's a must see for everyone!
