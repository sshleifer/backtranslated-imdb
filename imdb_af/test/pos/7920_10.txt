This is only commented on because Serge Prokofiev (1891-1953) does not even know how strong a score and how majestic these lyrics really are. If you read the lyrics to Alexander Nevsky.7, there is nothing here less than a witness by the song to one of the most beautiful and moving scores in all music literature. This movie with its accompanying score has a special place in the world and it can be as true on the internet as anywhere. composers' own website endorsed by his estate offers additional care that has given such a score, as this score really deserves. It is as deep as it is wide, with so much boldness that you want to be one, the one they called the Great Novgorod. This is a song about Alexander Nevsky. Yes, it happened on the Neva River on the Neva River, on the wide waters. There we killed our enemies to fight men. There were a few fighters, the Swedish army. Oh! How did we fight, how did we move them! Ah! They beat their ship In battle, our blood is freely shed for our big country, our own Russian country. He, where the width swung, was like an open street, through their ranks a lane where spears ran! Swedes like spring grass grown on desert soil. We will never produce indigenous Russian land. Those who act on Russia will be killed! Stand up against the enemy, Russian country, get up, rise to the arms, great Novgorod! arms go on). Get up to the poor, your Russian people, in battle, only in the battle for death, arise! Your people are free and brave, defend our righteous homeland! To the living warriors high regard, immortal fame killed for the warriors! home, Russian land, people, Russian people! In our great indigenous Russia, no enemy will live. Rise to poverty, native to Russia! No enemy will act over the Russian country, no foreign troops will attack Russia, invisible The roads for Russia.no enemy will destroy Russian fields. (Dear reader, we are asked to live forever with the following verses. E) entitled "The Field of the Dead" - I will go over the snow covered field, I will fly over the field of death. I will look for brave warriors, my fianc√©, my stalwart youths. Their lies are through a wild saber, there is one that is placed by an arrow. Of their wounds, blood fell on our Russian lands on our territory. He who fell to Russia in the noble death will be blown by my kiss on his dead eyes, and to him Brave son, who lived alive, I will be a true woman and a loving friend. I will not be an attractive man, earthly charm and beauty will quickly disappear and die. I'll be the man who is brave. Give Look at these, brave warriors! (now concluding with Nevsky's access to Pskov) In a major campaign, Russia went to war. Russia laid down the hostile troops. In our own country no enemy will live. to death! Celebrate and sing, mother tongue Russia! In our own country, enemies will not live. Women will never see Russian towns and fields, those who act on Russia will be killed! In our Russian great, in our native Russia, no enemy will live! Celebrate and sing, mother tongue Russia! All Russia came in the triumph of celebration. Peace and joy, Russian motherland! - It should be noted that Prokofiev is doing well under reasonable pressure from Stalin, if you like. This musical score is really much approved by Stalin. To me, there is an unmistakable beauty in how we love this world and tell Nevsky about a hero whom God provides for all participation in that love. A truly beautiful and fierce narrative of the story of Alexander Nevsky.
