I only saw it for the first time in 10 or 15 years ... maybe close to 20. In some ways it was better than I remembered. In others it was much worse. <br /> <br /> First there is the music. It's just terrible. There are only 5 songs in the movie, most of which are used more than once. The opening song is shouted by a chorus of annoying kids, and the disco-y title track is performed by Rick Dees. It doesn't get any worse than that. Even the background music is terrible, with many of them repeating the themes of the other deceptive songs. We also get a little slapstick, mostly in the opening credits. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Bill Murray is as usual a brilliant place ... you have to wonder if he ad-libbed the whole thing or if the writers just gave him all the funny lines. Or maybe he is just as big - a poor manuscript in comic genius. The best part is his surrealistic PA announcements. ("Lobsters ... come out here ... you are a threat!") <br /> <br /> You also get much more character development than you have in a movie like this. At least half of the characters look like real people ... and mostly real people you like. Even "Spaz" gets more than any other Eddie Deezen-type character that ever did, and when he gets the girl, it's probably. (She is not absurdly hot, but he does not automatically connect with one of the nerd girls - see "Revenge Of The Nerds" for examples of both films.) <br /> <br /> And when the plot looks clichéd. Well, you have to wonder if it wasn't a cliché when they made it. While not the first summer movie, you should at least go back to "The Parent Trap" - it's definitely the movie that made it. It's his own genre. In fact, I was surprised that there was no Talent Show scene ... "Wet Hot American Summer" played the summer camp genre so perfectly. I just assumed that everything came straight from meatballs. (I also expect half-expectant Jon Cryer to put up with a chimpanzee in a convertible bag, thanks to "Mr. Show's" epic camp-olympic spoof "Monk Academy"). Anyway, this one seems to be a little disappearing as far as the comedies of the late 70's / early 80's. It's no longer a cable trap and certainly doesn't have the cult order of Caddyshack or Animal House. I was happy to see it on Showtime today - and in High Definition on it! Certainly, it's very dreadful in spots, but you can do much worse in a 70's / 80's teenage comedy. And again, Murray is a genius.
