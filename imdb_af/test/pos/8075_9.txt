LA ANTENA (Esteban Sapir - Argentina 2005). <br /> <br /> A completely unique take on the silent movie in this fairy tale like a story by Esteban Sapir, beautifully shot in black and white and virtually un Dialogue. La Antena "is a feast for the eye and a must for lovers of the German expressionist theater, with most nodding to the works of Fritz Lang and Friedrich Murnau. <br /> <br />" The City without " A voice '' La Ciudad sin Voz ', controlled by Mr TV, took the vote of the residents and is in total control of all spoken words and images, forcing everyone to eat his own brand TV food. Mr. TV is not just a monopoly, he is the embodiment of evil and totalitarianism, even the swastika appears a few times as a symbol, secretly working on a hypnotic device to keep all the citizens' minds. controlled by his television broadcasts, for this purpose he kidnapped the only one left with The Voice, a beautiful singer, but a TV repairman witness of the kidnapping and fleeing to an old TV antenna in the mountains to stop the mister's TV plans. <br /> <br /> The production design is amazing with beautiful sets and images, although Es teban Sapir was shot primarily with the basic language of silent cinema, he also added a number of fresh techniques of his own, such as a combination of typographic and animation techniques. Everyone talks to each other through text balloons (usually swings near their mouths), the harder they talk, the bigger the characters. The texts themselves can be pushed away or crushed. In the opening order we see a book, titled "La Antena", which opens and a paper town rises from the pages. There are scarce references to Argentina. It is constantly snowing, giving the film a very un-Argeninian feel, while the surrealistic setting represents a big city in the northern hemisphere, with only a few of the songs revealing the film's Argentine background. <br /> <br /> The pace is fast and there is so much happening on the screen, it's hard to keep track of the movie's surreal story. Not only breathtakingly beautiful to look at, but also some messages about media monopolies, corruption and totalitarianism, but they are bitterly packed. One of the most original films I've seen in years. A delight. <br /> <br /> The film was shown as the opening film at the IFF Rotterdam 2007. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
