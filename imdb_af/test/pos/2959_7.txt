The Lone Ranger & Tonto decided to bring a bunch of rope raiders who killed three Indians. It seems that there is no clear reason. This is until the Lone Ranger discovers a conversation with Indian Chief Tomache that each man had a medal. The five medals that Tomache gave his friends as gifts that we later learn when combined, will provide the master brain behind the canopy raiders with a map to a legendary lost city of gold. Can the Lone Ranger protect the remaining two individuals in possession of the medals before the canopy raiders hit their hands on it? Is there actually a lost city of gold somewhere in native land? <br /> <br /> To see this, I continued to know what was going to happen before and everything really looks familiar until I finally realized I saw exactly the same movie when I was a little bit. and I remember having quite a fun time as a kid enjoying this one with a lot of friends. As an adult though, the plot is somewhat predictable, but you know it, while it's not quite in the same league as the 1956 movie, be fun to watch. Clayton Moore is perfect as the Lone Ranger and Jay Silverwheels, as Tonto steals much of this movie, as he is probably in more action scenes than even the Lone Ranger. There are some very well-known faces on hand, including Douglas Kennedy, as well as Ross Brady, chief of the Hooded Raiders gang, Charles Watts as a grand sheriff, and Ralph Moody as a friendly Padre.
