One of the best silent dramas I've seen. As dark and shady as the German expressionists produced, but with performances that were rather understated and naturalistic for the day. No cameras and no unintentional laughter due to wildly harvested histrionics. Sjostrom produced a convincing performance as the drunken, moderate and frightening David Holm. <br /> <br /> Most of the night it was in a clear Swedish slum, but the movie has a very claustrophobic view for it. the low key lighting and the great use of iris. <br /> <br /> There was a deep, and typically Scandinavian, sense of despair and hopelessness in the story: the movie begins in a rather grim present, and then we told David Holm's story in a series of flashbacks (and flashbacks in flashbacks - a pretty complex story structure for 1921), where his character offered many chances for salvation, but he didn't take them and we know he won't take them because we saw him drunk and miserable die and mean as always in the present. The penultimate scene is as dark as I've seen in all the theaters. <br /> <br /> Writing and directing is stiff and intelligent, even according to today's standards. In several cases, Shostrom deliberately sets the audience in one way or another, and then he surprises. The end may not be such a surprise to some viewers, but I didn't see it. <br /> <br /> This movie earns a full recovery and DVD release. Or even a crappy budget release. It just has to be there so people can see and appreciate it. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10, which rounds to 10/10
