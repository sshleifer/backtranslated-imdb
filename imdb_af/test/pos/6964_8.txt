Okay, so Ghoulies 4 is bad. And it doesn't even have the ghouls in it. And the acting is bad. The storyline is stupid. But I forget to mention how funny this movie is. It is such a champion, and so ridiculous it is too fun not to enjoy. There are only 2 ghoulies in the movie, and they don't really look like the Ghoulies in the other movie. But they are pretty funny. And funny thing, Jonathon Graves is coming back for this one. If you saw the first, he was a character in it. I think it's better than the first. There are some classic scenes and some classic lines, one in a grocery store. "Attention K-Mart Shoppers!" Watch it if you enjoy bad movies. It's so bad, it's good. And did I call Barbara Alyn Woods hot?
