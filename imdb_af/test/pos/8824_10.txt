I saw this very emotional painful portrayal and it was fascinating. The conflict between the public and private faces of Williams and the pressure he was under was so relieved that even those who knew something about him would be surprised. The cast performed well, but Michael Sheen was excellent. I just realized it was he when I saw the previous comment. He looks completely different physically in this role, from any other role I've seen him in or about himself. Williams autobiography differs markedly from its diaries, as suggested in this film. The movie is sometimes difficult to watch because the emotional anxiety is displayed. However, it is a valuable experience and a highly recommended movie.
