action packed, with my favorite type of creature. I won't give it away if you haven't seen it, because it's worth the time to sit down and unravel in the mystery of things like this movie. It sometimes touched me, and it was the moments that had puzzled my mind that easily anyway, but moist of me, kept me quietly excited, holding it in your head instead of letting it go, probably mood I was in that time. Special effects and action sequences you can feel occasionally make silence. Of course, there is a shower over there, just like this one. The film still has its own style and flavor, which I respect anyway from underground independent horror movies.
