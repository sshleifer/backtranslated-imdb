As I read through the hundreds of remarks that loyal readers of the IMDB placed on this movie, I find it very interesting how little "middle of the road" comments are. Everyone loves it too, or they hate it. Having seen Apocalypse Now about 30 times and recently thinking about DVD (how did we ever live without the magical digital machines ?????), I can say without hesitation that I am one of those with a very special place in my heart for this movie. "Why do you want a movie that's so confusing?" Ask many of my co-workers. The answer is: Forget about the war, forget about the cruelty .... It is a classic story of society that protects itself from those who refuse to align with the status quo. Brando represents the individual who has his own way of doing the job. They (Big Brother) sent him out to do the job. He does it too well, without meeting the accepted "standards" of death and destruction. Am I the only one troubled by the fact that we have a standard for death and destruction ????), so they send the "Conformity Police" to eliminate the individual. Hmmmmmm .... Draw any parallels between these things you see every day? With the deepest respect for Mr. Coppola, which I believe is one of the best directors of all time, I think he has crossed his original intentions of the movie and probably only realized it until the movie was released. The subtle sub-text that permeates the whole movie has planned and depicted too much; Instead, it seems to be 'grown', like a wild flower in the middle of a vegetable garden. Again I have to repeat: I think FF Coppola did a deterrent on this whole production, just like the cast and the crew, but the sum of the film exceeded the individual efforts ten times. So if you haven't seen the movie, rent it, watch it, then look again, and maybe a few times, and look for all the generic parallels with everyday life. First, make a judgment on the quality of the film. Those of you who saw it, look at it again with the thoughts previously described. I think you might just have a whole new appreciation for the movie. Or maybe not! Whether you love or hate it, be sure to give Coppola credit for his masterful storytelling style!
