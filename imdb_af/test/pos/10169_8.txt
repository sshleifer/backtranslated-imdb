Alfred Hitchcock shows originality in the remake of his own 1934 British film, The Man Who Were Too Much. This 1956 recording is much lighter than the previous one. Mr. Hitchcock was fortunate to have employees who went with him from one movie to the next, keeping a standard in his work. Robert Burks did an excellent cinematography work and George Tomasini's editing shows his talent. Eventually Bernard Herrmann is seen in the wonderful Royal Albert Hall in London, at the height of the picture. <br /> <br /> James Stewart was an actor who worked well with Mr. Hitchcock worked. In this version, he plays a Indiana doctor on vacation with his wife and son. When we meet him, they are on their way to Marrakech in one local bus and start the plot. His wife is the dearest Doris day at her best. She was a well-known singer for her marriage and is now the perfect woman and mother. The film has some good supporting roles, Brenda DeBanzie, Bernard Miles, Daniel Gelin, Alan Mowbray, among others, doing a good job of portraying their characters. Although it is a "light Hitchcock", one cannot be dismissed as a failure. "The man who knew too much" is a change of pace for Hitchcock's fans.
