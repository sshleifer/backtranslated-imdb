Wow, I think the overall average rating of this movie on this site is incredibly low. There really is no reason to keep this movie. "Michael" is a simple but fairly original, and easily pleasurable, romantic comedy. The plot involves a group of reporters / experts who will investigate the mysterious appearance of an angel (John Travolta) in the west. The angel seems to be less holy and worldly than we would expect, and that makes it entertaining. His interest in women and the Beatles takes a new turn on the sting. The romantic side of this movie involves Michael the angel who tries to get Andie MacDowell and William Hurt together. The two of them may not have the very best chemical screen on the screen, but they certainly have enough to make it work well. Everyone who rated this film so low (a 5.4 ??) is coming up! The movie is not that bad. In fact, I found it very funny and memorable. Certainly, that's not the best thing you'll ever see, but it's still good. It's a movie I feel remarkably underestimated. It's fun, romantic, and recommended by me. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
