A family travels through the middle-west. There is widower Ben (Charles Bateman), his girlfriend Nicky (Ahna Capri) and Ben's little daughter K.T. (Geri Reischl). Then hit a town called Hillsboro where everyone behaves more than a little strange. Their car breaks down and they are forced to stay. They soon get witches that have a game over the town, and it is incredibly angry. <br /> <br /> The story isn't that good. People just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are ending. There are also many loopholes hanging at the end. The acting is also pretty poor. Bateman and Capri are lean and all are about the same. Only old supporter Strother Martin and L.Q. Jones gives good performances. Yet this movie works. It imagines blood and gore (there are some, but it is PG) and lots to work with some very creepy visual and atmosphere. The play obstructs it a lot, but it still works. Martin especially chews the landscape in his role. I can't explain exactly why I (kind of) like this movie, but it worked on me. It is a quiet kind of horror that is no longer made. Almost a masterpiece, but it deserves to be rediscovered. A 7.
