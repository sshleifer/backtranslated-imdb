This is one of the few movies recommended to me as absolutely brilliant, it's really. If you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point. You can describe Fosca as manipulative, but if it's really serious, she gets sick when the love she's sure doesn't answer. But what will you do if you are sure the other one likes you and is "just" rejected by the fact that you are ugly. You wouldn't fight for it. At least I think it's better to fight for it that dies in bitterness. And it reminds me of the fact that, like a man at first sight, I react completely to the physical ugliness of Fosca and look no further to the person she is or may be. This movie confronts me with many solemn questions about respect, trust, feeling manipulated and so on. How do I do when someone manipulates me or just tries to make contact? What I think to be the outstanding feature of this movie is that Ettore Scola made it absolutely credible that Giorgio fell in love with Fosca.
