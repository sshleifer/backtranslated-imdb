For a movie like this little hidden gem that comes from the 80's, it's shocking how many people don't know about it. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth a look. It has all the things you need for a horror movie. especially the good old cold fever. <br /> <br /> I remember watching this movie for the first time about 15 years ago, but I couldn't remember its name, so I asked IMDb a few years ago to ask for help finding the title. I finally got the title and bought the movie. I'm still crazy about it as much as I've done all those years. <br /> <br /> buy this movie !!
