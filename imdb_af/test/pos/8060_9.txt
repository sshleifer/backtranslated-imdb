It's a movie that every child should see before they grow and distort. Gender-to-generation ideas are often conveyed. I grew up in two different places, but only 20 miles apart. I went to school and had friends of every color confession and religion for the first 8 years of my life. Then I moved to the mountain country (though not anymore) where it was very unusual to even have one African-American child in your class. My graduation class in high school has 2 or 3 African Amercians (God why can't I just say Black? You can call me base or white or whatever! All this political correctness increases me as most others do!) In anyway Back to the movie, try to see what happens when people get a distorted view or what ignorance or lack of understanding of a culture or country! This is an excellent movie that everyone should see especially children.
