It is a very dedicated series that is well-cast and depicts a sensitive subject with great beauty. We follow Michael Ealy as the sheltered FBI agent Darwyn, who infiltrates a terror by Farik (Oder Fehr). The series is very well written and has enough plots to make you sit at the edge of your seat waiting for everything to happen. <br /> <br /> By definition, Michael Ealy is one of the best actors I have. seen the portrayal of a shelter agent. Icey cold on the outside, but still a good man under his best trying to keep his head on a highly emotional rollercoaster ride that FBI was doing to him. Oder Fehr on the other hand comes from a man who can pretty much fit in any social scenario. Big and strong, but can disappear into the gray mass if needed. Highly authoritative and extremely clever. The way the two communicate on the screen is nothing short of spectacular. <br /> <br /> The way the story develops and the level of detail that the writing offers make the whole story extremely credible and also true to life. would think. It's so great that you are left with the feeling of uncertainty, without knowing what can happen next in real life. We read about terror every day and here we are given a good sneak peak in a sub-world of which most of us know very little. <br /> <br /> It's a series that will surely come back for more, sit at the edge of your seat and wait just for the next weeks episode to continue. It's a sure winner in my eyes, and I have no problem with the statement that this series is on my best time list.
