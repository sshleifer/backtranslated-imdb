In this election year, where so much idealism is attached to one of the candidates, it is very enjoyable to see a film that warns us not to make an idol out of someone running for public office. <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is the author and director of "Choose Connor". There are significant parts of the film that reveal that he is a 'genius' when it comes to stories by the theater. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie before the election and then think about why and for whom you want to cast your vote. <br /> <br /> Let your eyes open like those of the young protagonist. <br /> <br /> A mix of "Citizen Kane", "Advise and Consent" and "Paths of Glory" by a young director as talented as those listed above.
