This movie is brilliant ...... without a doubt. I watched it a while ago for the constant harassment of family members who are right in their sci-fi movies (which I am not) and thought it was pretty good. But having recently watched some documentaries on outer space, we looked at it again ... and that's good. <br /> <br /> Kevin Spacey is without a doubt one of the greatest actors ever and I really like Jeff Bridges (Big Lewbowski, blown away, Arlington Road). The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home claiming to be from another planet. Yes, do you think ... but what if his story is so credible that even his psychiatrist is starting to wonder if he is telling the truth. <br /> <br /> This is how the story develops with Bridges that goes through all sorts of emotions dealing with Prot, as she is known, his own psychiatric colleagues, his wife and family, his brother-in-law, and his cosmologist astronomer co-workers (who, after receiving information from Prot, admit exactly that he may be telling the truth!) A great movie ... it gets you wondering ..... <br /> <br /> 8/10 Dave
