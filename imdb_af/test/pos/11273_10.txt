I loved it, it was really gruesome and disgusting. I thought the tear of the human flesh was thoroughly provocative. The way it portrays the human crucifix about Jesus Christ was very interesting. The tearing over limbs and jaws was terribly brutal. Don't look if you have a weak heart, you won't be able to stand.
