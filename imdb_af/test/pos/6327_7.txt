Barely three and a half years after he ran a month's run (7-31 October 1953) at Broadway's Coronet Theater (on the western 49th street, since his name O'Neill), MGM relied on the earlier solid London success of the play. to make a wonderful movie and for the most part - carefully "opened" on an unlucky cut-off script of this sparse, subversive boulevard comedy and rewarded with a modest hit. <br /> <br /> Ava Gardner is the increasingly frustrated woman of Stewart Granger, an internationally successful and totally dedicated "workaholic" (created before the term) by using the eternally frustrated David Niven to try and passionate repair her husband. When the second honeymoon cruise Gardner Granger launches in leaves, the trio (and Granger's dog) marked on a South Island island (were there other survivors? This is for later plot developments), and Granger continues to bring the world around him management. great hut for himself and his wife and a little one for the title for Niven - or the unattached man. <br /> <br /> At the heart of the real plot of the play is only halfway through the film, when Niven suggests that Granger and he alternate as tenants of the Little Hut - the only woman on the island share, since Granger only pair of shoes (she) want to share. <br /> <br /> Reason (which Granger regards as its strong point) governs and frustration ranks highest - for a while. <br /> <br /> David Niven and Ava Gardner are wonderful in their designated roles of suave, would be deceiving and seducing, and Stuart Granger - usually asked to simply be attractive and virile in action roles and the strange miskas species Lty (A spectacular son like Apollodorus in Shaw's CAESAR AND CLEOPATRA in 1945) - gives one of the better-performing performances of his film career than the man who can be as clever as he thinks he is. 33 years later, he will once again show this southern urbanism towards Rex Harrison in Granger's first (and both of them) Broadway involvement in a striking revival of Somerset Maugham's THE CIRCLE which only ended with Harrison's death.

To be honest, if you do not manage the controversial ideas, it gets a little stupid (the same basic plot is being developed much more satisfactorily three years later in the Cary Grant / Deborah Kerr / Robert Mitchum / Jean Simmons (Stewart Granger THE GRASS IS GROENER, based on an even less successful play, but for some reason a superior trifle failed at the box office. <br /> <br /> As cute as MGM having been unlucky forfeits - the psychology ending the island's stay, was cartoonly predicted in what had to be a moment of excitement - the sinking of the hunt they put on the island - eventually we only get about three-quarters of An hour from the real Little Hut, but ninety minutes from David Niven, Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger making the movie a fun diversion, not a high culture, but a worthy guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> We even get a very nice garnish in Walter Chiari (who was then Ava's real lover). As one of his better speeches goes, "Boola, boola!"
