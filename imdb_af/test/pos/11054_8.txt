It's an incredibly well-filmed early talkie adaptation of the Eugene O'Neill game. The biggest drawback of this is a static camera, and as a result it comes much of the time as the filmed play is, which is a pity, because it is a good piece of primitive movements made at a time when sound of all sorts created. of technical problems, and as a result, most films were experimental whether it was their maker's intention or not. Garbo is so mysterious and charismatic as in her silent movies, and her entrance is still classic. Her voice is strangely deep, almost childish, which only enhances her alluring eccentric persona. As her boyfriend, Charles Bickford is quite virile - he was apparently born - and a perfect companion for the divine Garbo. His Irish brother is not bad at all, and he always looks like a natural man from the sea, very O'Neill-like in his independent, breeding nature. Like Garbo's (very) confused father, George Marion really looks like another time. He has the kind of face and voice - open, unhindered, completely devoid of deceit - which has disappeared from the earth. Marie Dressler is also in the O'Neill swing of things. Her bare expression and intensity around the eyes speaks volumes, as she plays her boozy character as a woman who sometimes borders on psychosis. Poetic license, maybe, as it is not in writing, but we can. Dressler's redundancies forgive; she is too good not to do it. The story ends with a move to the next thing, unlike resolution, which is not the author's cup of tea; And those who keep their movies neatly worked out will be disappointed by the absence of any real surprise. In Anna Christie we are in O'Neill country, a place of sea, storms and dung, a sense of total and damnable uncertainty, which we now call ambivilance or anxiety neurosis. Instead of analyzing this mood, the author offers it simply and wisely, as weather, land, ocean and people interfere with each other and address each other in a unique language that we have heard.
