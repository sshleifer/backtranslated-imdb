This movie has to be exported to the rest of the world! An absolute masterpiece, featuring a bizarre and grim film about four different stories from four different locations in Sweden. The one with the newly refurbished hotel with the improper wooden figure of an old finance minister is absolutely the best of the four strange story about love or career. I want to see all four as a movie on their own, they can be expanded so much more. <br /> <br /> The unique break in the middle is something I've never seen before. <br /> <br /> Can't wait for the series (if they do one) or the extended DVD. Apparently they cut a lot to fit it in just 3.5 hours.
