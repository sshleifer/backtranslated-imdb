I watched this movie at the Lowlands festival (23, 24, 25 August) after a friend of mine said it was a very cool movie about the history of skating. I don't have what to expect from this movie right now. Was it recorded by some skaters who thought they could do some cool tricks, or was it a documentary skating. <br /> <br /> So, after waiting about an hour, I went to expectation. <br /> <br /> This movie is really a nice piece of work about starting skateboarding. It started with the Zephyr team, which was a good group of surfers. It takes place in a not so nice area to live in. At some point the waves are no longer so nice to navigate. So they try something different. skateboarding was a fact. <br /> <br /> If you were part of the Zephyr team at that time, you were one of the cool guys / girls. For many people have seen an escape from the place where they were with the Zephyr team. So they all tried there new tricks now on a skateboard. <br /> <br /> In no time, skateboarding was popular again. There were a few competitions and one national competition. The Zephyr team participated in various competitions and also the national one. But what they did there was skateboards incredible. But the jury does not now have to judge them. So they put the whole skateboarding world on its head. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I can tell you the rest of the film / documentary, but you should see this one with your own eyes. Because then you can feel the sphere of this movie. This movie got me a lot of style, so I rewarded it with an 8. <br /> <br /> Gijs and the rest of Holland greetings. Goodbye.
