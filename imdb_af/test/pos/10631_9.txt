As with all Haneke films, make your own decision - don't be concerned about what you read and if you are interested in someone using the medium of film for their own unique ends, see it yourself. Isabelle Huppert is beautiful in this movie - combined with Haneke, these two never pull their bumps. Haneke enters with the lure of the golden boy, Benoit Magimel, but it is an anti-romance as much as Funny Games was an anti-thriller. You will have to force yourself to look at it a lot and the catharsis is much more in the range of sustained anxiety than any kind of emotional release, but it is incredibly nervous and mind-set; Haneke continues to hold a mirror on how indifferent Western civilization is or has become. People can turn their noses on it, but it just takes what Solondz did a few steps further in Happiness. While basically grounded, much of what Erika (Huppert) does can be regarded as an emotional metaphor. I do not recommend it, but I will not dismiss you either ... it certainly divides people, but largely gives it to oppression - it is no surprise.
