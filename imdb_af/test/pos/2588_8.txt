We only saw this film before the release at the Norfolk (VA) Film Forum, and there were general agreements on two issues. There were excellent performances in a first class drama by the two leading and by others: and secondly, the marketing for that film would only bring a disaster. We've seen a tricky poster with chains and suggestive comments that imply a kind of wacko sexual relationship between Samuel Jackson and Cristina Ricci, while the movie has a real depth and a few thorough ideas. What is sad is that people looking for close porn will be caught up to see the movie and will be disappointed because it will be too heavy for them, while the people who really enjoy it will not be caught in the theater Don't show it. Sorry. A good movie wasted.
