Much better than expected. Good family movie - get it on reruns. The whole is more than the sum of its parts. Paul Giamatti chews the landscape - he has far more talent than the role. A treatment to look at Uhl's "The Illusionist" inspector is about the top. The blue man scenes had me 11 years old in stitches. The cameos were especially fun for the parents - nice to see Lee Majors and Urkel (Umm, Jaleel) again. It will be hard to think of 10 lines for this movie, but let's hear it for a movie that promotes honesty between a child and their parents! Amanda Bynes does a good job when she gets to be part of the sting. I can't usually stand Frankie Muniz, but he's just fine here. Hats off to the deciding director - if only for the rental of Giamatti!
