I saw this movie tonight in a preview and it was fantastic. It is good to portray problems that the average high school student undergoes. <br /> <br /> I laughed and left the film, yet grateful that this movie would have a chance to raise awareness by its audiences about these issues (bullying, rape, suicide and depression). <br /> This is a great Aussie movie. <br /> <br /> See it. <br /> <br /> Support it. <br /> <br /> Learn from it.
