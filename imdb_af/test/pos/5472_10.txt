For those of you who made earlier comments on this film and hope to see it again, I hope you did. It was broadcast today (November 28, '04) on the lifetime movie network. I endorse Dish. <br /> <br /> Karen Arthur advised William Petersen and Barbara Hershey in this southwestern Gothic-like story. The relief, editing and dialogue contributed greatly to the film, and Hershey and Peterson were perfectly cast for the roles, playing both sensitive, bold and intuitive characters. The screenplay was excellent as well as the supporting role. <br /> <br /> Not been known before, I was right to say that the story was based on truth, and now that I know it, I have to do the strange departure, since Santa Fe is a hop, ship and is a leap from Tucson. <br /> <br /> As an engineer, I was fascinated by the theme of the unique construction of the staircase and the man who designed and built it (who was he an angel?). But the storyline, and it's several images, of how it came, is what captures the most. You definitely get a strong feeling that God was in His heaven in every detail of this whole drama in history. For you who saw the movie, you know what I'm talking about. For those who don't, I won't spoil it. <br /> <br /> Bon Holiday, <br /> <br /> Bob Shank Jr, Raytheon Missile Systems, Tucson, AZ
