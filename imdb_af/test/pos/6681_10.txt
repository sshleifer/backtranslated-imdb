If you enjoy the Butterfly Effect, Donnie Darko or The Machinist, you will also enjoy K-Pax. <br /> <br /> For me, this movie has become really exciting and yet depressed. Spacey delivers a good performance as Prot. Also, don't forget the appearance of Saul Williams in the movie, because I'm a big fan of. <br /> <br /> After watching it, I recommended the movie to many of my friends, and everyone was almost blown away. <br /> <br /> But it's still much underestimated, perhaps due to the lack of action and explosions. I'm sorry, it's not a movie about the bloating of things, it's about how people behave and how people live in non-existent worlds. <br /> <br /> Continue and enjoy.
