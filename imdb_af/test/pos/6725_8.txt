Flowers! If this is one thing you will take away from this movie, it will be the flowers. They appear so prominent and are used as plot devices. You will become an expert to identify with daisies and black tulips by the time the movie ends. <br /> <br /> Daisy tells Daisy the frustrating love triangle story. between 1 girl and 2 men in her life. One a professional hit that has a life, the other an Interpol agent. With a Pan-Asian movie (Korean, Hong Kong) and crew (Hong Kong director Andrew Lau, author of Korea and a Thai post-production team), I could suggest the headaches in coordination. <br /> <br /> Park Yi (Jung Woo-sung) is a hit that found a soft spot for the painter Hye-young (played by the beautiful Jeon Ji-hyun). It is love at first sight in the pastures of daisies, where her clumsiness caught his attention. However, he is ashamed and always aware of the dangers of his professional career. He can only admire her from afar, do little (or perhaps big) things to her anonymously, but the one who takes the cake sends her daisies every day without failing at 16:15. He becomes her guardian from far, protects her and keeps her safe from evil. <br /> <br /> Hye young is in love with this mysterious stranger. She is constantly waiting for him to appear, but I really wonder how hard it can get the almost punctual daisy delivery. Nonetheless, she was terribly moved, and touched by this only act. As the stars would have, interpol detective Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) is on Hye Young in a town square during one of his shelter missions, and he is also captivated by her. In the same way, because of his profession, he is doubtful whether he should take the first step. <br /> <br /> Where the audience finds it frustrating. Of course, the lady would fall for the wrong man (then it is the good guy), Park Yi is denied by Jeong Woo's pursuit, but still refuses to step out and identify himself. Jeong Woo is the opportunist to grab the grab. free anonymous identity unconsciously. It's almost as if you are all giving a blow to wake them all up. <br /> <br /> It is this tension that intrigues you. And it's fun to watch the two male leaders who find it hard to fall in love without endangering their careers or their loved ones. But don't be action fans, there are plenty of cat and mouse revelations and uncontrolled comradeship in the form of Infernal Affairs, as well as ample rifle battles. Although I feel the end might be more stringent. <br /> <br /> Which rocks are the smart editing. To tell the story in a non-linear timeline (no worries, it's not that bad, you'll still be able to follow the story) from the standpoints of all the clues, keep yourself in tension and culminate in a three -divided screen showing all their emotions in a single converging event, which I thought was done very well. <br /> <br /> It is a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush pastures and busy city spots, with lots of classical music to articulate the soul. As with romance films, all the leaders are eyebrows - the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leaders, while the guys with a somewhat pudgy-faced should do (argh! OK lah, at some points) Jeon Ji- hyun. <br /> <br /> If you are in a storyline with an equal balance in action / tension component, Daisy will be your choice. If you prefer a more conventional whip, then the other Korean movie that makes its debut here at the same time, You are my sunshine, will be your alternative. And yes, I completely dig the final tones, which I thought, only the Koreans do it best? Kinda reminded me of the JSA one.
