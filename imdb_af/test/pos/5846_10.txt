Okay, so I've read the most reviews on this movie, as well as commented by visitors to this site, and the feeling I get is that most people who wrote reviews really don't like this movie. That's why I'm writing now. I represent the minority because I did it. I admit I saw the movie, because I am very impressed with Ryan Gosling's compelling capabilities and the projects he participated in were nothing short of incredible. He's a great actor. Besides, I wanted to see this movie because it was interesting to me ... why? Because it's a whodunit where you know "whodunit" from the beginning, and it's kind of unusual. <br /> <br /> If the plot goes, two teenage teams try to commit the "perfect crime" because, in a twist, they believe philosophy that only by committing crime, people are really free - the unobstructed, and Let us remember, indebted, acting for our own sake. The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex, testifying to homosexuality, and acted brilliantly by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt. Gosling was the manipulative, control of smooth talk, and Pitt was the most book-smart, socially uncomfortable. Enter Sandra Bullock's character, which most people don't seem to appreciate. I think when people see she is the executive producer, they automatically accept any role the actor has in it, it is a self-glorification. I didn't see it as the case here. Without Cassie's personal history of the ex-husband who nearly killed her, who did not share the same features with Richard Hayward, she would never have pursued her instincts about Justin and Richard. The case was apparently airtight against Ray, the unsuspecting schoolboy and friend of the boys. Even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie, Bullock and her partner also do not have much firm evidence about them, except the fact that they lied to know each other and leave the fuss, Justin, at the sight. In it lies the genius of the movie, because the philosophy that the boys tried to prove through the deadly act, the innocent act of the will of 'true freedom', eventually worked against Justin, who eventually had a conscience (and finally leaving part of his conscience on the body stop. Without that important piece of evidence they almost had a "murder by numbers." And for readers out there who have confused as much as I am about the title, I have looked at it and found that something "done by numbers" (such as a painting) suggests that it is carefully planned and required. There is also a song by Sting called "Murder By Numbers", but it is next to the point. :) <br /> Many readers question the need for the relationship between Cassie and her partner, but I think that means showing how cynical and manipulative she has become because of her history. As it may or may not, her history plays an important role in this movie, because without that she would probably never have followed her instincts about Justin and Richard. Yes, it was a piece of the clich√© "woman-rotten woman acting on vendetta in every facet of her life" but I think without the depth of Cassie's character you have just another movie about teenage killers, and they can only got away with it. There is no movie there. <br /> <br /> And to the reader who said the teens obviously did not commit the perfect crime because the police were from the beginning, I can remind you that the reason was the deliberate , and completely traceable shoe prints. The boys wanted to be involved - it was a game. They were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand, the problems the investigators would have to discover what they think is the truth. What they didn't expect was that Cassie Mayweather had an overactive instinct that worked for her. A little incredible? Can be. But many crimes were solved by police officers who followed their instincts. However, this is a movie! <br /> <br /> I saw this movie in the theaters about three times, and each time it revealed a little more to me, and I kept it a little more. The more I watched it, the more I was enchanted and terrified by the psychological depth Richard Hayward - there are people really like that. My main complaint about the movie would be that Justin and Richard's interactions had to be a bit more central (because look, let's see it, there is the plot in the whole movie) and my main props go to characterization. Each character was very clear and interesting in his / her own way. It was a very good act, although I would give Ben Chaplin's character a little more depth to work with (he is a good actor), and maybe Bullock's character has cut a forge. <br /> <br /> I think everybody should keep in mind that for a Hitchcock-type thriller like this you basically tell you the "whodunit" at the beginning is a huge challenge for the writers to pay attention to the to listen to the end. I think they did very well by using a few small plot twists throughout, a slow revelation of the different character dynamics, and the display of the screen with some emotionally charged performances by young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt . I think if we remove our innate cynicism and try to see how psychologically the characters are complex and their interactions, we can look beyond any obvious plot holes and see the right texture and quality of this movie, even if only in the characters which is brilliantly portrayed. Especially Richard Hayward. Not that I'm a bias. :)
