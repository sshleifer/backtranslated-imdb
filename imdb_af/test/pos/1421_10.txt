WARNING: Maybe some minor spoilers contain. <br /> <br /> Hard to say anything bad about this movie, except for one thing. <br /> <br /> YOU SHOULD NOT BE IT IT AGAIN AGAIN! !! Then again, maybe it's because you have to be home in the morning or at 03:00 to get the Fox Movie channel. <br /> <br /> Too bad, because it is another gem lost in time, Clifton Webb takes his patented acid, know-it-all the attitude he made as Lynn Belvedere ("Pretty Pretty" and continued), and becomes 'Nature Boy'. <br /> <br /> It's actually like that. <br /> <br /> Robert Jordan hosts an educational program of the Sunday children who are losing weight, and the network breaks it for him to do something about it. Or The problem may be due to the fact that the married host has no children. <br /> <br /> BOOMS !!! But as such things happen, the local church president needs a leader for an unfair gang of Boy Scouts and finds a willing victim ... ahhhh "volunteer" ... in the host, so Jordan takes the position. <Br /> <br /> Problem solved right ??? <br /> <br /> WRONG !!! It's a movie, there are other problems. <br /> <br /> For example, one of the Scouts seems to be the boss of his boss at the TV station, causing a little friction; especially because the child is overweight, has asthma and posture. <br /> <br /> And he's the more reasonable one. <br /> <br /> There is also this Cub Scout, Mike (George Winslow) who wants to move around, is the "apostate puppy" type. <br /> <br /> As it turns out, the reason he doesn't have his own people is being cared for by a family member who isn't. <br /> <br /> These are things that make his work harder than expected. <br /> <br /> All in all, Webb is getting more understanding for children, not just saving his performance, but learning a rewarding lesson, and eventually even accepting Mike. <br /> <br /> Another great movie after all these years.
