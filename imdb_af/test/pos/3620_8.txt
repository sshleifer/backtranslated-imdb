It is made clear that it is cheap to capitalize on the infamous "Mandingo". This indifferent pandering of a blatantly rancid Italian sex pledge junk really throws up the bad things with a laudable lack of taste and self-control: The evil, arrogant, white family who own and operate slave plantation owns a majority of the screen time involved in panking both each other and their different slaves. Director Mario Penzauti and screenwriter Tecla Romanelli bumps this dirty rubbish with an overwhelming surplus of sizzling sleaze: we have nasty rape, interracial copulation (one white lady makes a wild black stud wild while tied to a cross), big woman nudity, brutal whistles, boring degeneration, very lousy soft core sex and a heavily twisted tragic surprise that blends the elements of incest, murder and misconception into a dubious attempt to explain the terrible inhumanity of slavery. Special kudos are in order for the foxy brunette actress Paola D'Egidio, whose merry and unobtrusive depiction of depraved and capricious evil Rhonda burns the screen positively. In addition, Marcello Giombini's funky, beating tribe beat the brand new place. Maurizo Centini's fairly polished cinematography also does the trick. A satisfyingly naughty piece of smart swill.
