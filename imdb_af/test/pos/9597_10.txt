It's a real gem of a TV movie. Based on a completely false story, the course of the down-and-out soccer league follows the course of the English FA Cup, where the chaos is followed and the players are all sport seventies. The end is unexpected, the performances are wonderful, and Nick Hancock shows he can do other than host sports shows. My only regret is that I didn't leave it.
