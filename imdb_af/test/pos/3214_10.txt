it is a very good series. I love the show and I'm so glad it hasn't been canceled yet. It has very good humor and shows the realistic bond between a young mother and her daughter. oh yes to Gilmore girls! it is very awesome. they are such a sarcastic humorous bunch. they do everything together just like my mother and I. for Gilmore girls. Um, I'm running out of lines. but I love how Luke and Lorelei's relationship eventually builds up. they had to be together. and i just love Sookie St. James! she is so awesome. and the show wouldn't be anywhere without Michel. The whole show is dry humor, sarcasm, and life in a very small town where everyone knows each other .... especially the Gilmore Girls.
