This movie is just really great. I do not know why. I always have a weakness for Damian Chapa. It's not Scarface, but still I enjoy myself. It's a movie I can see more than ten times. He really tries to make a good movie, but he just can't do it. I feel sorry for him, so maybe it is a bit of a sympathy voice. I can't help it, but I can't give it less than 9 stars. Everybody had to see it once in his life. To see how to make a cheap film work. I live in Holland and buy this movie for only one euro! It's $ 1.50. I would also have bought it for ten euros. Great Great Great. On a small Dutch movie site, this movie gets 101 votes. Here's just a 260. It's not much more. So people all over the world. Buy this movie!
