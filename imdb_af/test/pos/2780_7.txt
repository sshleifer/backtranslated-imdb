I see many students now joining for student exchange to Barcelona and being disappointed if they don't have such an exciting time. <br /> <br /> The movie was nice. Of course it is always a pleasure to see Audrey Tatou. <br /> <br /> However, I have a very strong problem with the movie. The lesbian roommate tells Xavier that women are physically dominated (which I raise) and shows him a bit of a dimple that a woman can get. Xavier then tries the bat grip on a shy married friend, who starts saying "no no", "I'm married, I'm married", but then somehow conceded to the bat grip? Suddenly she sounds "yes yes" and they go there on the benches in Parc Guell. I really found it very offensive. Furthermore, it is much more stereotypical. How often have we seen scenes where the woman says no, but of course that doesn't mean that? No means no. Shocking / physical domination will not fix it. It only supported the stereotypical rape mite. <br /> <br /> I wasn't even sure how to read the next scene he believes in the lesbians, how it worked, and how next he'll just ask "suck it, slut" (or so something). Did he really think of forcing himself on a woman without respecting her feelings, was the way to go? <br /> <br /> This section really ruined the movie.
