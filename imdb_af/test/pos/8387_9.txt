I can't imagine a director whose thirst for blood and violence is bigger than Quentin Tarantino's. (At least in his films) Inglourious Basterds is no different. We all know Tarantino, the man who exploded on the scene early in the early 90s with cultists, such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Since then, he has been a disappointment to some. Well, I'm relieved to say that Tarantino hasn't lost his contact. He has brought us his best since Pulp Fiction and grateful. <br /> <br /> We know the story, a story of World War II, telling like Tarantino can. (Fiction of course) A war film has not been done so before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi-occupied France. Their goal - killin 'Nazis. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other hand. He is known as the "Hunter Hunter" and deals with his business as relentless as no other. The third sub-story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who testifies to the family of her family. And of course she wants to make revenge on the Germans for her devastating loss. There are actually three stories that fall apart and connect with each other. If you know something about Tarantino or his films, it's nothing new to him. <br /> <br /> War has never been so good. The Basterds are haunting, but at the same time it is very funny, sometimes even hilaries. The dark comedy aspect plays a big part here, as in many other Tarantino movies. The entertainment and grace are led by Brad Pitt. I found him very funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him again on the screen. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this kind of movie. MÃ©lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were great, also made good impressions. The film is filled with striking performances. <br /> <br /> The story itself has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It is not meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun, like us. The movie department deserves great props with beautiful, vibrant colors that emphasize the movie. You really should enjoy the last line in the movie ... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Quentin Tarantino is among others an entertainer. World War II is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some manage it to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun movie, it is incredibly entertaining, shocking, dramatic, exciting and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you're looking for in a movie done with that specific Tarantino style, it's worth checking out. It's time to experience for yourself what the war is like through the eyes of Quentin Tarantino.
