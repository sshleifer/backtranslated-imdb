<br /> <br /> Average adventure movie that took a serious story and "Holywoodised". The irrigation effect done especially on the average mini-dissertation turned this film's place as a solid classic. Why water such a big story? Probably because it deals with "sensitive" colonial vagaries and the producers do not want to create political heat, thank you quick profits. The directing, cinematography and soundtrack and acting were good. The script was average. The charm of Connery made his wrong Arabic accent and all the scenes with President T. Roosevelt were masterpieces. The costumes / sets here were very good. We didn't get any more from a serious historical drama, as that demanded the story. Just for big fans of the protagonists or fans of exotic Romance / Adventure Holywood movies .....
