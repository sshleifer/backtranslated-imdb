Brighton has a traumatic drama in their family's chest: Twenty-year-old Emily Brighton (Taylor Roberts) is delayed due to a fall when she was one and her overprotective mother, Martha Brighton (Amy Madigan), blames her negligence for the accident . . Seventeen-year-old Evie Brighton (Lauren Ambrose) loves her sister and reads poems and stories for Emily. Their father, Harry Brighton (John Savage), a bank investor, lives in the basement with his train and rail model. Evie sabotages her interviews mysteriously for various rejected universities, and teaches the poetry of her own to Emily. When Martha hears that Emily is repeating the poems, she takes notes and shows them to English teacher Stewart Worthy (Christopher Lloyd), who believes Emily had a moment of genius. When Evie's only friend, James (Fran Kranz) reads the notes, he immediately reveals the truth about the authority of poetry. But when Martha becomes aware, she finds the reality of Evie, which causes a series of revelations. <br /> <br /> "Admissions" is a very powerful drama about needy love and guilty complex. The performances are stunning, and this is Lauren Ambrose's first work, of "Six Feet Under", which I see and she is incredible. This independent film is a great choice for the viewers who are looking for a refreshing story based on the movie's play. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Cumplicidade" ("Complicity")
