Paul Naschy as a haunted security guard in this is scarcer than most of his fur and shoe police wolf features. The story is not unknown, a lot of kids are going to party at an abandoned school. The thing is, one of these children's fathers did the same years ago, but he is now deceased and the youngest group of children seems to be reviving an event 23 years ago. It's done pretty well for such movies and there is a secret of riddles about what's going on, because what apparently happened to the kids is quite a mystery and maybe the truth is not revealed. So no, not just your standard cut and dice. It moves along with a pretty good track and doesn't let you lose interest, as many movies do, and the oddball story is compelling enough to keep you interested, and there's a lot of tension missing in many movies today . . The end is quite sudden and I think it's mostly to your imagination, but then it is not again, it is also welcome. 7 out of 10, check it out.
