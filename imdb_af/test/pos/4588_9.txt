Mike Judge's Idiocracy is an interesting movie, and one that will undoubtedly track down and watch its fans. <br /> <br /> Before I start the review, I'll give it a foreword by saying that if you get the chance to see it, definitely do it, as it's worth watching, and isn't easiest movie in the world. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the premise - Luke Wilson is Private Joe Bauers, an army librarian deemed to have absolutely no outstanding features or shiny shortcomings, and make him totally average in all ways. This, along with the fact that he has no living relatives, makes him a candidate for an experimental cryogenic procedure. Also frozen with Joe is a prostitute named Rita who was pumped up by Upgrayedd, her abused pimp, to the project. Unfortunately, a few days after they were frozen, the top secret project was abandoned, and they were forgotten. <br /> <br /> They wake up in 2505 and find it with the dumbing of society following the trends of recent times, everyone on earth is only slightly intelligent as a chimpanzee. The way the "allman" Joe Bauers speaks is regarded as "phaggy", much like someone who speaks like Shakespeare, will now mock and a former professional wrestler is the president of the United States (actually this one is probably not so scandal not really). The best performance on the TV is known as "Ow! My Balls!", Which sounds good, and not only is it spelled wrong, but apparently run out of space for wording, so they end up . <br /> <br /> It's a funny point of departure for movie, but that's the problem. Apart from the initial premise, not so much in the movie is really funny. What I mean by that is that the ideas read from the film's presentation are probably as funny as the movie itself. Obviously it's not terrible, but it was probably better. <br /> <br /> There are a few winners in the screenplay, such as Starbucks, which is now offering a happy ending, and people who misunderstand their blind faith in the universal "electrolytes", but they are just too few and Far between so, unless you laugh hysterically every time, when one of the idiots of the future has a slack-jawed, profanity load with little or no logic and / or intelligence, then the laugh can be quite well spaced. <br /> <br /> It is unfair that everyone compares it to Office Space, because it is a very different movie, but as a movie, no matter what happened, the Idiosa is a funny concept you probably much more laughter in the opening of 15-20 minutes than in the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> I give it 5 out of 10 because it's nice, but it's not enough to increase it above the middle of the road.
