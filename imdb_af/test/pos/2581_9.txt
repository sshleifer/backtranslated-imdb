Craig Brewer is now officially a writer / director for whom I will watch any film, no matter how bad it may be. His debut, Hustle and Flow, was one of my favorites of that year, with his emotionally charged story and realistic, fallible characters. I was not quite sure what I would end up thinking after I saw this sophomore attempt. The movie looks good, the trailer used music effectively, but it seemed there was a good chance that it would stretch in absurdity and fast. Luckily, Black Snake Moan kills all his points. The play is amazing, the writing is excellent, and the editing style, as well as juxtaposed music, captures the whole side. Brewer seems to be a master to get his characters to have the right mix of compassion and malice as they move on their way to salvation. <br /> <br /> The first moment I knew I was a surprise was during the shortened credit line at the beginning. As he did with Hustle and Flow, Brewer puts the music across the widescreen shot perfectly, with simply titled fonts that come up statically. The 70's aesthetic was welcomed and helped show that it is another great character piece that is in vain from that of the decade of the best cinema. From here on, with the short bits we continued in the lives of both Lazarus and Rae, every vignette mirroring the other while traveling to the fateful moment eventually crossed their paths. The editing between them was fluid and relevant rather than suddenly cutting before the scene was finished. Rae's boyfriend leaves for service and Laz's wife leaves for his brother. Everyone feels the loneliness and returns to what they know in that situation? Rae sex and Laz to the bottle. Only when Rae is dead on the side of the road and her savior comes from his farm to take her in, the reasoning for their action finally begins. <br /> <br /> Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the older bluesman farmer tries to reconcile his life with God and those of the flesh and the pain it has brought to him. There are moments of stoic rigor as well as friendliness with his prisoners / patients. You never really look at the setup as comic or unrealistic, because he sells what he does so well. The character of Rae is not chained too long, despite what the trailers will believe you. The situation starts a bit uncomfortable until we see that the chains are for her own good and actually only used for a day or two. As for the chain girl, Christina Ricci really shines. I never saw her as something special, but this role is a real breakthrough for her. This girl is so upset that her past sexual abuse scared her deeply. Every time she's away from her love, she begins to see the flashes of the man who has carried away her childless innocence and knocks to be touched by any man available to let go of the image. Her nymphomania is not for pleasure, but rather for surviving the ghostly nightmares that are always hiding behind her eyelids. Ricci is fully aware of the role and shows all emotional trauma to great effect and realism. Also mention should be made of Justin Timberlake, who again shows real acting talent. Where this man comes from, I have no idea, but hopefully he will continue to take more movies and get away from the mostly shit music he looks out for. <br /> <br /> While not as solid and consistent as Hustle and Flow, Moan I still think it is the same, because when it's on, it's spectacular. By the end, we have a really surprising series with "This Little Light of Mine", and earlier the interactions between prisoners and prisoners, when the chain was first introduced, showed some top work. The real magical moment, however, is when Jackson sings (yes it is all the time, like Terrence Howard in Hustle) the titular song while a thunderstorm burns and the light flashes. If I don't see a beautiful shot sequence all year, I won't be surprised. What these two people do for each other is wonderful and shows what mankind is capable of. One thing I think I really enjoy with Brewer's work is the fact that he does not show that sinners become redeemed heroes. Instead, he shows us that no matter how bad you were or how bad life was, everyone can strive for salvation and better people. We do not have saints here, but infallible people seek their ship right. If the course is true or if it falls back into the dark, no one really knows, but at least they can say they have tried so hard.
