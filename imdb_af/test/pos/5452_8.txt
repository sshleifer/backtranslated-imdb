TV movies generally do not get as much recognition or credit as big movies, and that is usually good reason, but the 1996 HBO movie The Late Shift is easily one of the best TV movies ever. Based on Bill Carter's revealing book, The Late Shift is about dealing with NBC's handling of late-night talk shows, David Letterman and Jay Leno, when it comes to filling the vacant Tonight Show seat that once held by Johnny Carson. We see what happens to the camera - writer Bill Carter, director Betty Thomas and HBO show us what happened when the cameras were turned off. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, we never really know what really happened. when it was time for Johnny Carson to be replaced by either Letterman or Leno - but The Late Shift gives us an interesting potential reality. Although it's just a very well-made movie, The Late Shift also does a very good job of portraying all the sides fairly evenly - though you wonder if the movie is outputting Letterman and Leno for guys; especially Leno, which looks a little too sacred. <br /> <br /> The shows are also very good. In a very meritorious Golden Globe show, Kathy Bates plays Leno's extremely naughty manager, Helen Kushnick, who, according to Carter and the book / movie, was very problematic for the studio and Leno (the real Kushnick actually made Bill Carter fit for defamation on this depiction.!). John Michael Higgins breaks out his usual performances to get small, exciting comedy items and gives an excellent performance as David Letterman. He gives an excellent impression of Letterman, but also creates a dimensional and related character. Daniel Roebuck gives a good performance as Leno, but does not measure much of the other talent in the film. Roebuck probably did the best one could have done. It just seems hammy when someone tries to make an impression or representation of Leno. . Bob Balaban (a squirrel Warren Littlefield), deals with Williams (a magician like Michael Ovitz), and Ed Begley Jr. (a pompous Rod Perth) also gives memorable supporting performances. <br /> <br /> The Late Shift is definitely one of the best TV movies I've ever seen. I suppose, if you didn't watch David Letterman or Jay Leno, the Late Shift might not be for them, but it's an interesting movie for those who come in late night politics - something that has recently been his ugly head raised with the 2009 -10 Conan / Leno / NBC debacle.
