I saw this film at the Rotterdam International Film Festival. It was one of the less popular films on the festival, but it is becoming increasingly important. <br /> <br /> The story of an actor trying to get himself and his environment out of a drug addiction is based on real facts. Moreover, the characters playing in the movie are the real people who experience this experience again, this time for the film, which is partly set up as a stage game. Not only are they all good actors, Jia Hongsheng's parents are also real-life actors. The methods used to highlight their relationship with Jia are very effective. <br /> <br /> Jia Hongsheng is the actor of some Chinese action movies late eighties early nineties. Later you see him in big movies like the Frozen and Suzhou River. In between these two career paths, Jia becomes a drug addict and loses everything to act or even do something productive, except to make some futile efforts to become a guitar virtuoso. <br /> <br /> I like the way the writer of the scenario chooses to emphasize his behavior after withdrawal more than the abomination of drugs. We really feel the pain and struggle that Jia is in. At the same time, we hate him for the way he deals with those around him. <br /> <br /> The movie draws the viewer into a tiring pattern. Jia seems to be trapped, with him his parents and sisters trying to care for him. Because there are personal interviews with the characters, we feel that we do not only know Jia by himself, but also by others. <br /> <br /> The movie has a heavy feel, but scenes from Jia bike through Bejing and party with his friends illuminate the tone. So the bitter humor in many events throughout the film. The music is beautiful and stayed with me for a while. It's a movie that can't be easy with many people, but for those who are interested in the more serious and modern Chinese film, it's a strong recommendation.
