To discover something, the journey is so much more fun, so much more surreal and so much more emotionally galvanized than when you finally arrive at the destination. Falling in love may be one of the most cute feelings in the world. You feel energetic, upbeat and alive. You just want to be that person every second of the day and the sound of their voice gets you excited and sometimes awake. Love, and all the physical and emotional side effects associated with it, is pure happiness. Wherever it goes is anyone's guess, but if you start with your journey, nothing can be compared to it. <br /> <br /> Diane Lane and Richard Gere play Adrienne Willis and Dr. Paul Flanner, two emotionally shaded middle aged. In this film, they will go with the mystical journey, where love, and the discovery of emotions along the way, will help save them. <br /> <br /> Lane is the typical jerk of an ex-husband who still loves her, but in her eyes, just because the woman he cheated doesn't want him anymore. As painful as she was with him, as much as she really didn't like, there is a part of her that actually considers him to take him back. Why might you ask? Because in life and love, sometimes comfort, replace intelligence. Yes, this man cheated on her, but she has children with him, she has built a life with him and of course there is still a connection with him. <br /> <br /> Richard Gere plays a recently divorced man and alienated father. He also recently lost a patient because she reacted negatively to the anesthetic. He is now being sued by her family and he is guilty but hardened on the matter. This brings him to Rodanthe in the first place. Although his lawyer did not tell him, he had to visit the woman's husband in Rodanthe. He stayed at the inn that cared for Adrienne. Soon they find comfort in each other's arms and discover that they can also have a second chance in life. <br /> <br /> By now, it sounds like a simple idea for a movie, and though it may be something you "I saw or read before, Gere and Lane just got the movie. Diane Lane raised the screen with her smile. Her eyes shone in the dark and the life she brings to the character is worth watching. Gere's character is a little different. He is more hardened and bitter. It takes Adrienne's pain and her passion to bring him out of his shell. He blames himself for his tense relationship with his son and blames himself for the death of the patient. Outside, he tells someone who will hear that it is not his fault, and that she was a 1 in 50 000 casualties. But deep, it eats away on him. They find each other at a time when both need someone to listen. <br /> <br /> Gere and Lane have been in the movie before, but this is the first time they have played lovers. They were married in unfaithful, but here they play lovers to find each other when people in their lives left them. They have a spark and a real chemistry. I'd love to see more movies with them. In fact, I'd like to see more movies with Diane Lane, but that's another story. <br /> <br /> Nights in Rodanthe are a very passionate and romantic film about two lost souls who save each other. They both become better people, they both become stronger people. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone, not just couples. It is a film about salvation, absolution and second chances. <br /> <br /> It will also ask you to bring some handles. <br /> <br /> 8/10
