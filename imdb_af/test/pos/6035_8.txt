This Columbo episode is one of the better and perhaps one of my personal favorites. The film includes Rosemary's Baby John Cassavetes as the maestro, his wife played by Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mother) and his mother-in-law played by Myrna Loy (one of America's biggest leading actresses in the film of our time). Anyway, I don't agree with anyone who has criticism of this movie. This episode is one of my favorites because you have an excellent player who does an excellent job in performing. I like to watch Columbo with his beloved dog he never mentioned in the series. This time, the episode focuses on classical music at the Hollywood Bowl, one of L.A. s attractions. Of course, Columbo is as interested in classical music as he is involved in anything else with a crime.
