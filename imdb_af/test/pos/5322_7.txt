One wonders about the state of a society that a father like Albert T. Fitzgerald produces, which we first met on a plane while on his way to the place where he has long since left and where he is a woman and left child. is now accused of killing a mentally challenged boy. When we first saw him, he caught a head in the newspaper that the woman read in front of him. On the contrary, he asks her if he can have the newspaper, and the woman offers other divisions. Well, that's not what he asked. What he wants the woman to do is give him the front part she reads. <br /> <br /> Matthew Ryan Hoge wrote and directed this disturbing movie that reflects in many ways, our society as it is today. In fact, Mr. High points exactly to what is wrong with it. <br /> <br /> The film presents Leland, a teenager who can't even distinguish between fantasy and reality. Obviously, the death of a man, even the sweet and innocent boy who did nothing to earn it, would have deadly consequences, not just for himself, but also for his own family and the family of the murdered. son. In fact, Leland seems to have no idea what motivated him to commit the crime, because he does not repent. <br /> <br /> Obviously, Leland has been traumatized by his parents' divorce. His own father is a separate man who can care less about him. It is Pearl, the youthful detention center teacher who sees and wants to help the young man's unrest, but unfortunately he has no chance. <br /> <br /> The best thing about the movie is Don Cheadle, a good actor who always delivers. The ensemble throw does good work under Mr. High's direction. Kevin Spacey has a good opportunity to play the selfish father of the accused killer and let us seduce him because he is an arrogant idiot. <br /> <br /> Although it is a bit long, the film leaves us more questions than it answered.
