I was thrown into this series just as surely as the sea would devour me in his grip. Although it started slowly, I found that realism in the portrayal of the ship, the variety of characters and lively dialogue made me look. The protagonist was destined to be challenged, growing and changing on this journey and I wanted to be there. I was not disappointed. The series has you from humor to tragedy and everything in between, often in the same scene, the same breath. There was a wealth of emotional consultation, interaction and expression - relentless and compelling to observe. The movement of the ship has made an almost imaginative component for the many scenes, making the characters ill one moment and adding humor to the next. <br /> <br /> Edmund Talbot is a complex character, as we don't see regularly. We may know where the captain stands or Mr Prettiman, but they are older men who sit in their ways. Talbot was young and arrogant, still learning, testing himself and being tested. He struggled to go with others and made mistakes like a real person, but had a heart that could be touched. It grew with every difficult teaching. I appreciate the excellent characterization; It's too scarce in movies and television.
