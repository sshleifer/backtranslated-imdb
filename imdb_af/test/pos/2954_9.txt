I always thought my dad had a second life and was eagerly awaiting the development of 51 Birch Street when I sat down and watched it for the first time. Surprisingly, this movie's journey took me to places I didn't expect, and reconsidered my assumptions and judgments. While a remarkable personal story was spoken in a clever but simple way. I especially used the filmmaker to pull out the type of his mother's daily diary - very effective. I read the previous comment and would like to note that the sound was good when I watched it and suspects that the movie was also slightly changed or that the theater could contribute to the weaker sounds of the other writer.
