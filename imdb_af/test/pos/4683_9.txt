I really enjoyed the movie. Everything in Italian Job is simple. A handyman, a safe, a computer genius, a wheelman and a man with a spectacular plan to steal 35 million without using a gun. This film is entertaining, though it doesn't have a central idea. It is a non-stop movie with many actions. All the stunt work is wonderful. From the speedboat in Venice at the beginning of the race on the busy roads in Los Angeles with three mini-coopers and even a helicopter. The best I have ever seen. I like the mini coopers. The expert thieves used mini-co-drivers for the outbreak engines. The chase between the mini-coopers and the motorcycles is great. They raced underground. I can say there was not a moment I was bored. Mark Wahlberg (Charlie Croker), Charlize Theron (Stella Bridger), Donald Sutherland (John Bridger), Jason Statham (Handsome Rob), Seth Green (Lyle), Mos Def (Left Ear) and Edwin Norton work. I like the actors in this movie. I've seen a lot of heist movie, but The Italian Job & is one of my favorites. A great Hollywood action movie without a drop of blood. After all, I love this kind of movie.
