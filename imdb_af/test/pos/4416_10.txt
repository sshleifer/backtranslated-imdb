One of the most sublime of the American masterpieces, Morrissey, opens the film by sexualizing Dallesandro, with his open mouth snoring on a pillow. We wonder, does he come from a high heroin? We only see his face, then flash, his body, flash, his naked back. I can't think of another movie that used this flashy form of editing so well to create a hypnotic, moody mood, a modification method that works great as pacing and style. After the introduction, when Dallesandro opens his mouth, his accent falls out - we expect him to be some kind of soft enrogens; Instead, he has the voice of a street thief. Morrissey is not comfortable letting our assumptions go. The long opening is very sexy and playful - it's a combination of martial troubles, Dallesandro's fascinating lips-rubbing kisses, and early morning sexual escapades; it all flows together, if not always smoothly, then emotionally realistic. <br /> <br /> What I got from this was the same as I got from "The 400 Blows" when I first saw it - it's like a 20-something sequel to that story. There is a sense of companionship between the meat sellers and the buyers; When Dallesandro seeks the street for men (to fund his wife's abortion) there is a secret handshake, as boys are dealing with each other. I never found it boring, though nothing happened - nothing brilliant, the boys are hanging around, as they do, waiting for tricks. The main trick that Dallesandro finds is fascinating to look at, using Greek descriptions and only on his back, a form of aesthetic body worship on the man's side. It's also very funny ("I'm not talking about an empty bed, am I?"). This is one of the most revealing scenes in the movie - in any movie, I think; Definitely buy any movie dealing with sex and sex. When Dallesandro's eyes look red and swollen, we can't know if it's because he's drunk, embarrassed or embarrassed, or all. <br /> <br /> The conversations in the movie are cut off - they don't matter. . (The movie is quiet in a few scenes, some of the most beautiful and beautiful you'll ever experience.) But when Morrissey chooses to include one, how he includes it (we sort it out), it's scary , like a conversation between Dallesandro and a newbie hustler - and none of them ever calls the word "gay" or "hustler." What follows is a scene where we listen to some transvestites as Dallesandro is serving. That's just after we told the beginner. "Dallesandro" is a topic that deserves attention. paid to him, both by his clients and Morrissey. He is less than effective as an actor, in the sense that he acts, but if he reveals something, he is incredible. He is someone we want to feel right above, but we are going through his experiences, with all their complexities, being forced to know him again. He is the kind of empty slate we are drawn on, but cannot get hold of. And of course he is incredibly striking - forgetting everything else, it is partly proof of the beauty of the male body, Dallesandro's beautiful torso and permanent nipples. <br /> <br /> The movie has one devastating scene, but like Everything else, you can't really master it - a girl says she was raped and her only self-defense is to say that if the rapist just asked had sex, ordered her, he would have gotten a better leak. This is crushing. The movie feels to everyone, but even better than that, it's not just sympathetic, it tries to help us understand people - and without dictating what it is, it's our intention to understand. People in the movie don't seem to glamorize. It feels inclusive when we see Joe's arm around a transvestite. When he reads a letter (he does not talk about the eighth grade eight times), he is completely charmed, as he stops on a word ... then he says, "woteva" and goes on. <br /> <br /> You can learn something more in-depth about the interaction between Dallesandro and one of his clients in terms of gay straight relationships than you can from any case study. Here we have the young boy who smiles (his upper lip disappears as he does) when a 30-something gym-Korean war veteran walks his fingers through his hair; It's a very deep scene. This adult man shares something with a younger version of himself. It's not two gay men together, or a gay man paying a straight man is something else you can't finger. questions of sexuality are next to the point. (Never before had a pimple been worn, it was loving.) After talking emotionally to each other (although Dallesandro, as he is there for money, it is never clear why he is there, although he is never less sincere not, what can be its most disarming quality), "So ... can you help me?" The man probably says. "I don't mean my pants!" 10/10
