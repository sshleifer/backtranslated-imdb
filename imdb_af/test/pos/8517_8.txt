If you can see a Bond movie from 1983, it's not as good as Octopussy, and still enjoy it. <br /> <br /> If you can accept production values ​​that aren't as much as the level of a TV movie. <br /> <br /> If you can look at Sean Connery with wrinkles on his forehead under a clear toupee and still see James Bond. <br /> <br /> If you can get to an inexperienced Basinger, a weaker Largo and a big Q. <br /> <br /> If you can learn to have an idiosyncratic score, don't there with Barry on his worst day. <br /> <br /> If you don't believe the hyperbolic reviews are greeted with release. <br /> <br /> If you can meet a poker game and watch a video game, you will both enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Yours has never been said again. and everything in it. <br /> <br /> What's more, you'll probably enjoy it, my son!
