This two-character drama has performed extremely well and has a valid message and some very shocking moments (shocking, not graphical, but not ready for them when they arrive). But in the end it becomes oppressive, just like the somewhat similar purity of formality. Yet Alan Rickman must have received an Oscar nomination for his multi-dimensional performance, no doubt about it. (** 01/01)
