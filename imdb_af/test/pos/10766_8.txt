I thought it was a very good movie. Someone said it was sick so they couldn't look. I think if you realize the rated R you will be prepared for the nudity and drug use. It's a good story and the acting is great. Just can't be a pride to appreciate it! She is basically about a mother who does drugs and wants to clean up so she calls a very rich old friend and he moves it to his estate and crazy things happen. I think it's a drama. I'm just as sick of people who don't like movies because of curse or nudity. This is the world we live in. Of course, you're not comfortable with yourself if you can't see things like this movie. And it's rated R. So, it must tell you from the beginning that it's not all the pious happy rainbows. I liked it. I think you will too!
