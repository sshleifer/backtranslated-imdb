I watched Pola X because Scott Walker compiled the movie score and I admire his music a lot. Honestly, I expected a somewhat pretentious and possibly coherent French film. I was wrong. The vision of the film soon sparked my attention - beginning with the opening season, showing black and white footage of military aircraft throwing bombs in graves at the sound of music and Scott Walker's beautiful sounding voice. The film explores the identity crisis of Pierre (Guillaume Depardieu - a brilliant choice for the role) and its resulting (self) destruction. The story is divided into two parts ?? The first depicts Pierre's carefree life in a beautiful French country home, and the second follows his total personal disintegration after leaving everything and moving to Paris to sleep with his supposed half-sister. Both of them contain an amazingly impressive photograph? the first very colorful and bright, the second totally gloomy and almost apocalyptic - which adds to a real aesthetic festival. Pola X is a fascinating and very unique movie experience.
