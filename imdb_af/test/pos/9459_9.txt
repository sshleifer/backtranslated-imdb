Say the man is wonderful. It's funny, original and made me laugh so much that I almost made my seat wet. The day I went to watch the movies, I wasn't in the best state of mind (but trouble), but I left the movie and plastered a smile on my face. The story is a bit out there with no one who notices that she looks too much like a girl, but hey, who I have to say is credible, the jokes are wonderful and some of the one liners in this 2006 hit can decline in history. Amanda B. played a good lead role and Channing Tatum looks too good to be true to her opposite to the beautiful Duke. So girls are going to see it because it's a big laugh and there's a hot guy in it and boys, you're going to see it, because you can just learn something about girls! <br /> <br /> All in all, a brilliant, fantastic and fun movie I will buy on DVD when it comes out.
