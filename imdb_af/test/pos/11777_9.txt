I just got the DVD for Hardware Wars, in a shiny new package that looks irresistible. Paste it in my DVD player to find some extra fun stuff. The extra content on the DVD is even longer than the movie. For those of you who (Hardware) have never seen Hardware Wars, it's a fantastic stupid Star Wars spoof (of Episode IV, of course). Household appliances (such as irons, toasters, vacuum cleaners and a waffle maker) stand in for Ty fighters, X-wings, R2D2 and the die. Instead of Princess Leia, we have Princess Ann-Droid, complete with Cinnabon hairstyle. You get the point, I'm sure. Mad silliness, and a fun ride for any Star Wars geek (like me!) <br /> <br /> Now, the DVD - wow! A director's remarks where he basically goes to the movies, makes fun of him and the whole project. An interview with Fosselius on Creature Features (remember?!) And hilarious "director reduction" and "strange version" of the movie (all jokes of course). Anyway, it's wonderful. I loved Hardware Wars in the theater and am so happy to have the DVD in my collection - between MST3K: the movie and Thumb Wars!
