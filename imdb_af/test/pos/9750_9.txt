It was a thoughtful and well-armed and directed TV movie that took exactly and intelligence on a big topic. It gives a movie treatment that looks like a larger screen. The palette is a bit muffled for TV. If you're looking for a war movie or 'Bosnia lite', it's not for you - it's about an ordinary woman who is an extraordinary challenge for mankind. If you want to learn more about the conflict and how one woman's work influenced the world in a massive way, look at this movie as it gets your way. I do not see that many other TV films have dealt with the issue of genocide and ethnic hatred at this level. The story obviously avoids demonizing the bad guys, rather showing the denial and everyday hatred that resulted in thousands of deaths. I was moved on several points, not in a manipulative Hollywood way of driving music and flashy mise and theatrics, but allowed to discover the horror and implications with the characters. this is a film that is brave enough to make the content speak for itself and underestimate the footage to support it with dignity. <br /> <br /> The actors do a great job of bringing the intense dramatic scenes to life. The scenes where the victims give their evidence before the war tribunal are powerful, and Wendy Crewson, Stipe Erceg and Heino Ferch are excellent. William Hurt's British accent is terrible - no one else has given him a chance to play a Briton, and when he finally gets it, he blows it! - And while John Corbett's body was born to play a soldier / commando, he is a little bit eyebrow, though he does a good job.
