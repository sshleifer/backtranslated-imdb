After growing up in the tikpool era and having office politics and men busy making a meal of beauty in a delicious meal day by day, this movie is becoming the point. Good afternoon price. I understand that Louis Jordan wanted to work in this movie to play against the distinctive GORGEOUS Suzy Parker. Everyone wanted to be soon and I believe it did well and stopped over time. The best on the scenes between Hope Lange and late Stephen Boyd. <br /> <br /> It shouldn't happen that anything of this is likely, but actually it was and probably even the fear of sexual harassment is even given. I thought the movie was well-thrown except the terrible play by Evans. What a fat ball, but he also found his niche differently. Other than that, everyone was walking on the board.
