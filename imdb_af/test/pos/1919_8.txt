It's an excellent documentary about a story I haven't heard before. The first solo, non-stop sailing race in the world took place in 1968-69 and had a handful of riders. It is a truly fascinating story about man against nature and man against himself. The story focuses on Donald Crowhurst, the tragic figure in this story. The film combines chats with interviews with footage shot by the sailors themselves on board their boats. The story is very exciting and sad as we learn the details of Donald Crowhurst's history. This is one of the best documentaries of the past few years. It has real human emotion in it, as the men are experiencing this almost impossible task of driving the world on their own.
