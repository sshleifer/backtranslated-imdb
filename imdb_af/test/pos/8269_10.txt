Just reading the reviews of this amazing BBC mini series reminded me how much I enjoyed it when it was aired for the first time many years ago. At that moment I remember waiting with anticipation for the next installment and I fell in love with John Bowe and Janet McTeer, two talented actors we didn't see enough on television or theater today. <br /> <br /> I tried unsuccessfully to get some of the BBC's fantastic past dramas, including the 1973 version of Jane Eyre and the 1972 version of Anne of Green Gables, all the wonderful timeless classic stories, which unfortunately the BBC does not intend to release on video or DVD. If anyone else is learning, I would love to hear from them. <br /> <br /> In the meantime, we need to remember ourselves with our memories of how wonderful they were.
