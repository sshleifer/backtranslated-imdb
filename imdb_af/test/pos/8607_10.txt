It does not end me because I will have to identify this movie (which I consider a masterpiece and I do not use the word lightly) with the qualifier "Not the Michael Douglas movie!" Not only are the titles the same, but they refer to the same thing - the radioactive outbreak that rained on the survivors of the first nuclear attacks. In Imamura's movie, it's not cheap metaphor; The whole movie is about the fall, physical and emotional, of Hiroshima and the war itself. As the deterioration of a couple and their grown-up cousin become, the ironic imagery becomes stronger, from the old watch that is saved every night to the stone gods, which gradually steps outside the heroine's door. (This, in turn, is carved out by a scared veteran forced into a series of tragicomic episodes to attack something with a car approaching the town.) The bombing day itself is shown in piecemeal flashbacks that are horrible. Yet "Black Rain" ("NtMDm!"), Even repeatedly, can be watched because of Imamura's compassion for his characters. I repeat: a masterpiece.
