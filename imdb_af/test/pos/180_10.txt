Here is a movie of adventure, determination, heroism and bravery. Plus, it's back in the late 1800's which made it even more interesting. It's a wonderful, adventurous storyline, and Alyssa Milano is great at playing the healthy, confident, freaky Fizzy ... a great role model. This is one of my favorite movies. It is a movie that is watched again and again and will inspire you and enrich your life without a doubt. Not only is the storyline excellent, but the movie also has fantastic scenery and music and is wonderfully targeted. This movie is as good as gold!
