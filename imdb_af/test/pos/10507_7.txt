I expected in the DVD perversion camp of the creators of the Society and Re-Animator, and was quite surprised to engage in an authentic suspenseful story. Acting was top-notch (nice to see Vosloo in a protagonist role after a long rope of villains), the storyline, and the few spins quite surprisingly. I thought I'd move forward many of them to go to the kidnapping scene, but look it over and just drop in the end. Maybe I'm too soft, but if I said before, I didn't expect much more than alien sex. Of course, if you are looking for some hot foreign sex, you will be lowered. It was mostly quick cut exam table nonsense with a shiny-and-you-miss-it seems an interesting 'impregnator' alien.
