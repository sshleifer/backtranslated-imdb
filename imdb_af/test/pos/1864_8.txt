Wow! Fantastic movie in my opinion, I didn't expect it to be so good! I was fascinating from beginning to end. It is a very well-made and educational film that really gives us a fascinating insight into the trials that Darwin had to go through to convey his ideas to the world. He writes his life as a source of the species ", fighting both personal demons and the ignorant society of the time to do it. He struggles hard with his mind, body and soul, as personal issues break and even his family appears to slip away ... while the rest of the world stands against him, knowing that his findings literally underpin their lives, culture and meaning of existence, a subtle movie (not exaggerated in any way the typical Hollywood way, it is a British British movie, but thankfully powerful in meaning and thanks to the incredibly well-directed scenes as well as the amazing acting of Bettany, Connelly serves as a light supporting role but I enjoyed her here and she is so good to expect as ever, her chemistry next to her husband was definitely strong and engaging, you could feel the connection and their real husband / women band definitely shine through their performances. d his performance is definitely Bettany and he does a brilliant job, a very pleasant show. I both understood and had sympathy with him if he had his own humiliating health and the imminent "madness" to try to understand what he had uncovered and come to understand what everything really was and meant that he was thinking that his thoughts contradicted his feelings and found him to lose everything, including his wife who was, of course, a faithful believer in religion and a strict Christian while in the scientific field, two worlds that could not see eye to eye, so their relationship was also at stake. <br /> <br /> Anyway - a very good, well-activated emotional drama and dare I say that I tore a tear during the tragic climax. It was really heartbreaking as well as beautifully gripping and agile. The film is also symbolic and very intellectually artistic, and I can't wait to see it again, since there was a lot of first time I missed. Easily one of the best movies I've seen this year.
