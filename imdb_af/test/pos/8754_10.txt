The best thing to say about the movie "Traffic" is that it paid attention to the superior British mini-series "Traffic". As many people have noticed, the current film suffers from the shortening of the story to accommodate the short attention span of film people and the conversion time of the theater owners, which measures the success of the movie with excess food sales. <br /> <br /> I only recorded this mini series in 1990 when it was shown on public television and watched it many times. The entire documentary series has a strong element of tragedy and punishment over it, because the characters all move towards their ultimate destiny. The strongest of the three stories is that of the Pakistani family who are forced into the city to find a way to keep body and soul together after the poppy crop is burned by the army at a stage of violence that benefits Westerners. politicians have been placed. The hardship of the family is similar to that of the Rickshaw tractor family in "City of Joy". Eventually the farmer finds work, but he compromises his pride and honesty. <br /> <br /> The Pakistani segment of the film has a particular relevance for today, with the fight against the supporters of Al Quaeda, and gives some understanding of the support for such movements among the disadvantaged poor of Pakistan and Afghanistan, rarely receiving any of the money in those countries. The film points out that farmers see barely 25% of the aid that encourages them to grow other crops. <br /> <br /> With the American inability to see anything but in terms of black and white - good guys v. bad guys - it is interesting to see another view where there is no black and white, only shades of gray. <br /> <br /> Possible spoiler for. The only problem I had with the story was that, rather than what it used to be, as they would be in real life, a fiction job was to pack them with the bad guys they could get. Other than that, it was a fine piece of work of the kind that we seldom see. The cast was excellent and the German and Pakistani places helped to give the film a "different" feeling (which saw a change in Germans as something other than the villains in a WWII movie.)
