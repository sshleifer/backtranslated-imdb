The plot of this movie is not complicated. A very attractive young girl goes to Europe looking for the reasons for her older sister's suicide ten years earlier. There she meets with her sister's former boyfriend and together they travel to all the places where her sister goes, and gradually the reasons become clear. <br /> <br /> But what makes this movie so special, and moving above the limited plot, are the beautiful portrayals of the characters. Although the older sister's boyfriend is a hangover, he has noble ideals, moral standards and incredible strengths. And although the older sister, who sees us in flashbacks, shares these ideas, she has no limit or balance, of how much too much. And although the younger girl is very faithful to her sister's memory, she gradually finds the power to see her sister be a normal girl first. <br /> <br /> The most special moment in the movie is when the young girl and the sister's boyfriend eventually stop fighting each other. I can't remember ever seeing more beautiful, touching, romantic tenderness in love entertainment in a movie! <br /> <br /> In all these ways, it's a great movie, a movie to appreciate and to be seen again. and again. 9 out of 10.
