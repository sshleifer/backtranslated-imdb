After watching a lot of my movies for such movies, I found this one very easy to follow in both the unedited and cut versions. (Although the story has much more to keep it together in the unedited version. Unlike Ninja Scroll, this movie has hit a much more serious note and I think that's where it hits me. The animation while it's gritty is very original and i just like the way artists highlighted shadows that year to show different emotions, i think the story is perfect, movie gets really hard and as the film progresses, you get the feeling that you are with the characters in this adventure If they meet allies and find their greatest strengths, there is a lot of sadness.
