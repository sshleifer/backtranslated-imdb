I know what most people will think of this movie without even seeing ... "The typical movie of a famous singer ... It'll be a pink movie, a teen movie, it'll be stupid. ... and things like that ... And yes, it's ... I mean, it's a pink movie ... But, you know what? ... I love it. Seriously ... This is a very romantic movie ... I think every girl in this world dreamed of something like the "Popstar" plot ... With his favorite singer, know him as a person ... and even a romance with him ... right? ^ I really enjoyed seeing it. In addition, it is very funny ... <br /> <br /> I think the actors did a good job ... There are many loving characters ... And Aaron Carter (JD) is not the exception. "To be honest, in the first five minutes to see him perform, I thought" it would be terrible "... But then he really surprised me ... <br /> <br /> Also, I must say that the music performances on the film are GREAT! I loved the part very much when JD (Aaron) sang without a music (just with a guitar) a very nice song ... This guy is very talented ... The time will tell ... <br /> < br>> My advice to you? ... Look at it! Don't make a bias ;-)
