For the first time I saw Heimat 2 on BBC2 in the 90's when I lived and moved to art college among artists and musicians, hoping for future success. So 'The Second Home' - from friendships made after the departure of the family home, from the pursuit of a professional excellence - strong to my living reality. I was captivated by the characters, the storytelling, the lyrical camera work and especially the music. In it I was able to divide the start of the German electronic music of the 50's Stockhausen, Kraftwerk, Can, Neue, Faust of the 70's, the sound experiments of John Cage, Walter Carlos and the British electronic psychedelics of The White Noise. The soundtrack composer Nikos Mamangakis studied with Carl Orff from Carmina Burana fame, so I actually found the taste of the electronic pop / sound effects world. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen Heimat or Heimat 3, so I have it as a whole without a before or after. As someone else commented, it is both epic and lyrical - historical and artistic. Many favorite moments, including the wonderful voice of Gisela Muller (Evelyn), the Bach marimba of Daniel Smith (Juan), the piano of Henry Arnold (Hermann) and the selo play of Salome Kammer (Clarissa). <br /> <br /> I could write more, but this has already been said here. Why can't British or American TV produce such MASTERPIECES? The Wire had the realism and politics and epic sweep of a city, David Lynch and Dennis Potter also had imaginative tropics on their serialized TV work, but it is art house and soap in its most cinematic and narrative sublime. It has never been included in critics' choice of Best Movies, but it should be. Still so dense and powerful as when I first saw it 17 years ago. I look at the 3 box sets every autumn for their 'soft fertility'. Inspired and inspiring.
