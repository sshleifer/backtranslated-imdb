A ghost story at a typical Turkish high school with good sound and visual effects. Taylan biraderler (Taylor brothers) made their first shots on a television program a few years ago, as far as I know. It was kind of a Turkish X file, they had very nice stories, but had no visual effects. This time they seem to have what they need and use them well. This movie will make you laugh, that's for sure, and it can scare you too. It has a nice plot and some young, bright actors in it. If you are a high school student in Turkey, you will find so many things about this. There are many clues in the film about his story and ending, some you understand right now, some will make sense, the dialogues are very cleverly written. So this makes the movie one of the best Turk movies made in the past year. Don't forget, this movie is the first of its kind in the Turkish film industry.
