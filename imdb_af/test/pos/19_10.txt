This is one of my three favorite movies. My only doubt is that the director, Peter Yates, had too many cuts that show the actors individually rather than together as a scene, but the performances were so good, I forgive him. <br /> <br /> Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are absolutely wonderful; brilliant. The writing is wonderful and gives a very good picture of life in the theater during World War II (and therefore in the 30's). Very good, subtle touches, very broad, survived strokes, everything was done perfectly. Scene after stage just blows me away, and then there is the heartbreaking climax.
