I'm a HUGE Tenacious D fan, and I don't think it's the funniest movie in the world, but the most entertaining. It's not a moment, but it's not what the D intends to be. I went into all the HBO programs, both memorized albums, and it made it even nicer. Lots of jokes from previous Tenacious D albums, and HBO programs. Ever since I knew the new album, I knew 40 minutes of the movie because it is a musical comedy. I would say it has the best first 5 minutes of any movie and the best last 5 minutes of any movie. Hands off. <br /> <br /> See this movie now!
