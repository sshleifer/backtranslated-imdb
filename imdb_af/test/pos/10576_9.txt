I'm usually disappointed by what the media dubs "lesbian" movies these days: murderous bisexuals; psychotic murderous lesbians; women who experiment with other women but end up with men at the end; ridiculously beautiful women who just touch each other to dress men, etc. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, FINGERSMITH is on a very high pedestal above this garbage. It is a credible love story that MARVELOUSLY performed through every rollid, to the least of the supporting actors. Apart from a very interesting central conflict, the romance between the heroines is well developed and credible thanks to Cassidy and Hawkins. <br /> <br /> I also saw the VELVET, but FINGERSMITH is much better than the former, both in character / conflict development and the quality of the acting. <br /> <br /> FINGERSMITH is both satisfying and enjoyable, and offers lesbians a good follow-up action to BOUND everywhere.
