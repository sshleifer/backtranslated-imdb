La Antena, an avid film by Argentine director Esteban Sapir, manages to succeed both as a redesign of silent movie genre and a gripping cautionary story. The institution is a city in jeopardy of sensible television, depriving its people of the power of speech, except for a stand-alone and mysterious screen presence, known as The Voice. In an effort to capture their handle, the mr. Y pronounced the wonderful villainous duo of television to kidnap the voice and change her unique talent to their own dastardly ends. It is up to a young family and the voice's nameless, eyeless son to stop this evil scheme. The result is a mountain trail of a story that is staggering at times, but never less than staggering. <br /> <br /> It's a silent movie that carries many of its influences on its sleeve; The overt reference to silent movie groups such as George Melies and Fritz Lang will be clear to anyone with a passing fame of their work. But more subtle references and symbolism lie behind such tributes. I especially like the fact that Mr. TV and his henchman move around in typical 1930s gangster cars, pulled out of the decade when the silent film died and a completely different industry began to emerge. <br /> <br /> La Antena mines the rock-solid plot devices and theater overwork for so many silent movies, albeit in a very knowledgeable and humorous way. It is the amazing visual style of La Antena that really makes it except for the movies he pays homage to. From the hypnotic TV logo to the impending hill transfer station, is this film full of brilliant visual ingenuity that is the rival of a Studio Ghibli animation? and all this with real actors and handmade sets. <br /> <br /> Although the style is often intentionally corn and theater, it is still a disturbing, challenging and emotional picture. The use of religious symbolism throughout La Antena gives extra resonance to the struggle between the TV empire and the diminishing power of words. At the same time, many of the most powerful images are original, including the hypnotic swirl of television sets and the nightmare TV food factory. <br /> <br /> I hate to end this review on a sour note, but I feel the English version of La Antena is dropped by the captions. The original Spanish subtitles are used to have a good effect, with many playing with words on the screen. The English language subtitles accompanying the original dialogue, however, is frustratingly incomplete, with omissions and mistakes sometimes made by the viewer to put things together for themselves. La Antena is a striking piece of cinema; a visually stunning experience that shows great energy and humor while telling a powerful warning story.
