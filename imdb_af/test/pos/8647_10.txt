There is a sign on The Lost Highway that says: <br /> <br /> * LARGE SPOILS INSIDE * <br /> <br /> (but you already knew, didn't you?) <br /> <br /> Since there are many people who apparently didn't get the point of this movie, I want to add my interpretation why the plot makes perfect sense. As others pointed out, a single viewing of this movie is not enough. If you have the DVD of MD, you can "cheat" by watching David Lynch's "Top 10 Tips to Unlock the MD" (but only after second or third look, please.);) <br /> <br /> First of all, Mulholland Drive is straight brilliant. N masterpiece. This is the kind of movie that refuses to leave your head. Not often the comments on the DVDs are very accurate, but Vogue's "It gets inside your head and stays there" really hit the point. <br /> <br /> David Lynch deserves praise for creating a movie that not only has a beautiful stylish look at it - cinematography, has a great play (especially Naomi Watts), a ghostly soundtrack Badalamenti, and a very dreamy quality of it - but it also manages the viewer in such a way that there are still few movies. (When is the last time you've seen a movie that just won't leave your mind and everyone was forced to talk and write about it, whether they liked it or hated it?) <br /> < Well, enough about everything, it's time to justify those statements. <br /> <br /> Most people who have taken the trouble to try the plot together have come to the conclusion that the first half of the picture is an illusion / dream sequence. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's too bad for anyone trying to make sense of the movie by expecting "traditional" methods in which the story is laid out in time, logic and linear way for the viewer. But for those who expect it, I urge you to check the name of the director and return. ;) <br /> <br /> MD is the story of the sad downfall of Diane Selwyn, a wannabe actor who falls in love with another actor, Camilla Rowles. Due to Diane's lack of talent, she is constantly struggling to advance her career and feels she has not learned her own and her parents' expectations. Realizing that Camilla will never be hers (C. becomes engaged to Adam Kesher, the director), she hires a hitman to get rid of her, and then handles the debt it causes. <br /> <br /> The movie only starts with what looks like a strange opening to this kind of thriller; what is a 50-year-old dance / jitterbug contest, in which we can see the main character Betty offering a good performance. We also see with her an elderly couple (who will see us twice more through the film), and applaud her. <br /> <br /> No, wait. This is what most people see for the first time when they see it. There is actually another very important fact ahead of the credits - the camera moves in an object (though invisible) and the scene quickly disappears. If you look now, the object is actually a cushion, revealing that the next is a dream. <br /> <br /> The main characters seen in the first half of the movie: <br /> <br /> Betty: Diane Selwyn's imaginary self used in the first half of the movie, which the " dream sequence "make up - a positive portrayal of a successful, aspiring young actor (the complete opposite of Diane). "Betty" was chosen as the name because it is the real name of the waitress at Winkies. Note that in the dream version the waitresses name is Diane. <br /> <br /> Rita: Changed the fantasy version of Camilla Rhodes by Diane's dream and with the help of an imaginary car accident into an amnesiac. It makes her vulnerable and dependent on Diane's love. She is then comfortable in Betty's / Diane's aunt's luxury home that Betty has allowed to stay in. <br /> <br /> Coco: In real life, Adam's mother. In the dream, the woman in charge of the apartment complex where Betty lives. She is mainly a strong authority figure, as can be seen in both parts of the film. <br /> <br /> Adam: The director. We know from the second half that he gets engaged with Camilla. His only goal in the first half of the movie can only serve as a bag for Betty / Diane, as she develops such a hatred for him. <br /> <br /> Aunt Ruth: Diane's real aunt, but rather Being out of town, she's actually dead. Diane inherited the money from her aunt and used it to pay for Camilla's murder. <br /> <br /> Mr. Roach: A typical Lynchian character. Not real; appears only in Diane's dream sequence. He is a mysterious, influential person who controls the chain of events in the dream of his wheelchair. He serves much of the same function as the back-dwarf (which he also plays) in Twin Peaks. <br /> <br /> The hitman: The person who killed Camilla. This character is basically the same in both parts of the movie, although it is presented in a slightly better way in the dream sequence (more below). <br /> <br /> Now the different versions of the characters have settled In the movie we can start to dive into the plot. Of course, I won't go into every little detail (I won't explain it chronologically as well), but I'll try to explain some of the important scenes related to Lynch's "hint page". <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, Camilla was again produced as an amnesiac by her unlikely survival of a car accident in the first 10 minutes of the film, leaving her completely vulnerable. What I found very interesting with MD is that Lynch is constantly giving tips on what is really and what isn't. I've already said the camera is moving in the pillow, but watch how two cars drive in each lane the limo arrives. <br /> <br /> Only one of the cars actually hit the limo; How about the others? Even if they removed themselves from the accident, wouldn't they try to help others, or at least ask for help? My theory is that as it is a dream, the presence of the other car has just been set aside and forgotten. As Rogert Ebert puts it so eloquently: "Like true dreams, don't explain it, don't complete its sequences, run over what it finds fascinating, get rid of unimaginable plotlines." <br /> <br /> Shortly after Rita crawls from the crash station at Mulholland Dr, and climbs her way down the hill and sneaks into Aunt Ruth's apartment, Betty comes up and we see this scary old couple drive away, pounding at each other staring at themselves and the camera smiling. This is the first indication that what we see is a nightmare. <br /> <br /> Although the old couple Betty is unknown, I think they are actually her parents (since they are her jitterbug game). Perhaps she didn't know them so well and they didn't have a good relationship with them as she wanted them, so the couple are very pleasant and helpful in the dream. They also represent her guilt feelings of murder and Diane's sense of incompleteness about her unprecedented goals in her life. <br /> <br /> A long and hilarious scene is the one that engages the hitman. Diane sees him as the main force behind the campaign to try and push the director to accept Camilla's role in the film (from Adam's party in the second half of the film) and thus take a large part of her dream. Due to her guilt feelings and remorse after Camilla's murder, a part of him wants him to miss, so she turns him into a stupid criminal. <br /> <br /> This scene, I think, is also Lynch's attempt to completely screw his audience, as they have given a false pretense to see the movie. <br /> <br /> Gotta love that 'Something just bit bad line', though. :) <br /> <br /> The next interesting scene is the one with the two people at Twinkies, who talks about how one of them still retains this recurring nightmare that a man passing through him through a wall seen outside the dinner in which they sit. After a while they talk outside and stay at the corner of a fence, accompanied, of course, by excellent music that matches the scene of the scene. <br /> <br /> Upon reaching the corner, a bum-like character appears with a rejected face from behind the corner and frightens the living shit from the man with the nightmare. This nightmare exists only in Diane's mind; she saw that man in the dinner when he paid for the murder. In short, her relationships translate into the poorer nightmares. The bum also indicates Diane's evil side, as can be seen later in the movie. <br /> <br /> The Cowboy (along with the dwarf) is one of the strange characters that is always present in the Lynchian landscape - Diane only saw him for a short time at Adam's party, but just like us Our own dreams can give us unimportant people who know us hardly a big part in our dreams. So he can also play an important role in her dream. We also get further clues during his screens that what we see is not really (his sudden disappearance, etc.) <br /> <br /> The Cowboy is also used as a tool to mock the Director when he meets with him in the strange place (the lights here give a clear indication that this is part of a dream). Also note how he says he will appear once again if he (Adam) does well, or twice when he does bad. Throughout the film he appeared twice, indicating that Diane was doing badly. He is also the one who makes her wake up to reality. (This scene was probably made an illusion to fit into the requirements of his appearing twice), and shortly afterwards she committed suicide. <br /> <br /> The espresso scene with The Castigliane brothers (where we can see Badalamenti, the composer, like Luigi) is probably due to the fact that Diane had an espresso just before Camilla and Adam announcement at Adam's party in the second half. It can also be a statement from Lynch at the same time. <br /> <br /> During the scene in which they enter Diane's apartment, the body lying in bed is Camilla, but sees her accept Diane's sleeping place. Diane sees herself in her own dream, but the face is not hair, although it had the same wounds on the face as Diane had after shooting herself. This scene is also filled with true Lynchian creepiness. Since Diane didn't know where (or when) the Hitman Camilla would get and finish her, she just put her in her own home. <br /> <br /> In real life, Diane's audition for the movie was bad. In her dream she delivers a perfect audition, which leaves the entire crew ecstatic about her performance. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is the fact that the money used in real life is to pay for Camilla's murder now in Rita / Camilla's purse. It is part of Diane's terrible act of his terrible act of recovering the money, as the murder has not yet taken place. <br /> <br /> When her neighbor comes to get her piano ashtray, it's given; she took the ashtray out of her table and went, but later when Camilla and Betty had their meeting on the couch, we saw the ashtray reappear when the camera dashed over the table, indicating that Betty's encounter with the neighbor was a fantasy was. /> <br /> The catch phrase of the movie Adam is auditions actresses for is "She's the girl"; what exactly are the words Diane uses when giving the photographer of the hitman Camilla. <br /> <br /> The blue box and key represent the major turning point in the movie and is where the true identities of the characters are. revealed. There is a lot of symbolism going on here; The box can represent Diane's future (it is empty) or it can be a kind of a Pandora box (the hitman laughs when she asks him what the key will open). Either way, it is connected to the murder by the blue key (which is placed next to her after the murder). The box is also seen at the end of the movie in the hands of the disabled bum. <br /> <br /> Club Silencio is a neat, small add-on to remind the viewer that what he sees is not real. It also indicates that Diane is about to awaken her reality. Her reality is a nightmare she can't escape, even in her dreams. <br /> <br /> During the cold scene at the end where the creepy old couple appear again, Diane is so tormented that she sees suicide as the only way out to escape the scream and not to fear her fears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is my $ 0.02. Hope this can help people get rid of this movie and call it the worst movie ever, or something that serves it, without realizing the plot. As usual, Lynch is creating irrational fears, and it does this with this picture as well. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
