It's a very nice upcoming movie, very funny, and Russell Crowe is amazing! Those who just know him from Gladiator will be surprised to see the scale of his acting abilities. Arthur Baskin (his character) is one of the best nerdy virgins I've ever seen1 Look at this movie - how can we release it in NTSC format again? <br /> <br />
