Am I the only person who believes this American version is much better than the English film of 1934? The English version has no tension, looks antique and very low budget, and has an exceptional play (except for Peter Lorre). The 1956 version, except for having the highest production values, shows James Stewart as the perfect "innocent" American overseas, and gives Doris Day her best role ever. Of particular importance is the music - the music of the American film is almost classic; compare the "Albert Hall" order from both, and you will agree that the Bernard Herrmann music is much more exciting than the original version (even though it's basically the same music!). The only mistake in the 1956 movie is the ridiculous encounter in the taxidermy store. I would appreciate any argument that can prove to me that the English version is better.
