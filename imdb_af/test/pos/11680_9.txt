Absolutely one of the 10 best music movies ever! An absolutely essential educational experience for any music fanatic - especially young rock / punk fans today ... understand the beginning of a particular "artistic" movement absolutely requires the roots of the music, as well as the mindset and musical environment of the times .... not to mention the political and social factors involved in time. And besides, this documentary is out-of-the-box rock-n-roll F U N !! Do not miss it!!! what has said, someone can tell me if ever, "the decline of Western civilization" ... part 1, (not part 2, the metal version) will be available again. Hope on DVD?
