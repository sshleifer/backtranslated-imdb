Down Periscope is not a "Great Movie". But then there are very few flicks. So if you're looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom, it's a "big movie" without the capital letters. No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoils this light comedy about a bunch of misfits assigned to an ancient submarine. They will fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star. They have to take the entire US fleet with its core submarines. But they are underdog and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome. But you root for those underdogs and it makes it a very entertaining movie. Watch and enjoy ******** (eight stars what is)
