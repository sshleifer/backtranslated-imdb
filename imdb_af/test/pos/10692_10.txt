Wow. I have never seen or heard of this movie. It just came on TV (2:00) and I'm full of awe. Intent: a lot of rich fat cats are out of golf. One knocks a ball in the jerk. It lands by a NINJA !!!! A tuxedo man walks over to pick up the ball. The ninja grabs it. Break it in his hand. Man pulling gun. Ninja draws a shotgun. Ninja blows arrow in gun barrel. GUN EXPLODES !!!! It's just the beginning of the greatness, people. Everyone should see this movie. 10 great ol fat stars of reliable.
