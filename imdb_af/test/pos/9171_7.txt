Over the past century, there has been much progress in gender equality, but not so much in the world of movies. I'm not talking about what happens behind the camera, I refer to the taste of the audience. The idea of ​​a "chick flick" is alive and well today, while there are still a lot of action and horror movies that are mostly about men. Sure, there are men and women who enjoy the movies that fall outside their typical demographic cases, but there aren't many movies that have appeals across the board. Hitch, the latest Will Smith vehicle, attempts to change the trend by being a chick fly throwing a dose of male perspective. <br /> <br /> Hitch's Smith stars as the title character, Alex Hitch, Hitchens, a "date doctor" who trains men to approach a woman and have a successful date. Hitch enjoys his job and likes to see men successfully achieve their goals with the women of their dreams, but due to a bad experience in college, Hitch is a bit of love . As the story unfolds, the film suggests two seemingly separate story lines. Hitch's latest case is Albert Brennaman (Kevin James), an accountant who is very attracted to one of his clients, the beautiful heir of Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). Hitch has his doubts about Albert's chances, but if his clients want to sincerely, Hitch supports them. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Hitch meets gossip columnist Sara Melas (Eva Mendes) and is immediately attracted to this strong woman. However, the doctor cannot follow his own advice to follow Sara. Things become even more complicated when Sara's work leads her to investigate the relationship between the accountant and the heir. Will Hitch be able to balance his private life and his work? And more importantly, can Hitch again believe in love? If you are a true movie lover, at least once in your life when you have complained about the dismissal of the Hollywood movie factory and have called for something new and original. Well, Hitch isn't that movie. But most film lovers will also admit that occasionally a formal movie can only work at an entertainment level. Hitch qualifies as that movie.
