Now I've seen some episodes of the Leauge Of Gentleman that I found hilarious. When I brought the movie, I wasn't sure I knew enough about the series to get it, but I was wrong. It's one of the best comedy movies I've ever seen, and the clever play of the Leauge makes the movie. It has a very good and funny plot, as well as helping to use just a few characters at a time because it doesn't make it too confusing to ruin the movie. Even if you have never seen The Leauge Of Gentleman get this movie it will make you laugh and it is a movie that can be watched more than once and is a great movie to watch with your friends. It really makes it a definite 10 out of 10.
