It's not a movie to impress you with high budget, high-tech shots, quick camera movements or glittering costumes thought of by an overwhelming and hungry director. But it is a film by a director who is also a very good photographer. He has a very good sense of seeing things as a human being, not half a god, unlike most directors. It is not a film in which actors and actresses try to give their best 'performances' with unreal or, at best, learned gestures and imitations. On the contrary, it's a movie in which they work as real as it can be. Actually, they are not professional actors at all. The dialogue between the main characters, their expressions, their feelings is so real that they can easily be in real life. You tell the same lies to the people around you with the same regret that you don't express words. You show the same signs of nuisance to an unwanted gas. It's the same sense of disconnection you get in modern city life. And this is your chance to see yourself from outside, portrayed by the main characters. I have all the films by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, incl. his short film Koza (Cacoon) thanks to those who put it in the DVD. Many will compare him with Tarkovsky, Ozu and maybe Bresson or Bergman, as he emerges as a true author. And he is sincere to say that his films should not make money, but to give meaning to his life. This is the kind of sincerity you will find in Uzak.
