The wind and the lion are a wonderful moving movie. It is a monument to what movie was once, but is no longer. <br /> <br /> Despite the thick Scottish Brogue, Connery plays the Raisulu very well. He inspires the viewer in a way that many main characters cannot. <br /> <br /> In one of her early roles, Candice Bergen is wonderful as the kidnapped socialist. Pedacaris, showing courage in the face of adversity (and lots of humor too). A wonderful movie, rent or buy it and you won't be disappointed.
