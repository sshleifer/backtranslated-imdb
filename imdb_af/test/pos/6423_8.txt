I saw this movie many years ago, trying to find it, but perhaps understandably it is nowhere to be found. It was so esoteric, yet one of a handful of movies that has long been with you. I'm not sure what the reality of the movie is, and maybe, like the uncertainty principle, the darkness is the definite thing. Acting is wonderful, the atmosphere is always filled with a sense of premonition, an overall melancholy is permeated, yet it is difficult to not be recorded in the story. I rented it because it was science fiction (it was in the sci-fi section with a bit of deceptive blurb), but that's not clear. Or horror, or even tension. In fact, one feels grateful that the director has the courage to make such a movie, for which there is, of course, no fixed audience. I know some people complained about Klaus Kinski's brief role, but I think it's very appropriate - his limited exposure is critical to the secret of this movie.
