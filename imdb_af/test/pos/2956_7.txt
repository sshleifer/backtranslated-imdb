The Lone Ranger was one of my childhoods, and I never had a chance to enter his adventures again in the mid-1950s on Saturday morning. Somehow, this movie came to me until I had the chance to catch it with my local library today. I was hit by a number of elements during the story, since from the beginning you have a new Lone Ranger theme song before you hear the traditional opening on the TV program. The adventure uses Tonto (Jay Silverheels) in a pretty wide-ranging role, though he takes the whole lot of clogs and is beaten and shot more than once. Perhaps most interesting of all, the Ranger actually shoots to kill in a few situations, to violate its character with the vision created for the TV series that it would never use its weapon to kill, just to wound or protect himself and others. <br /> <br /> In addition, you have a fairly traditional Western adventure. The Ranger and Tonto come to the aid of an Indian tribe whose members are murdered by hijackers trying to put together five medals that are key to a great treasure. Interestingly, the leader of the bad guys is an already rich woman, disillusioned by Noreen Nash. Her top hooker is played by Douglas Kennedy, and it was no surprise to see Lane Bradford as one of the bad things. Bradford's character was one of the men shot by the Lone Ranger, which reminds me how many times it could happen in the TV series. A quick test showed that he appeared in the The Lone Ranger show fifteen times, while Kennedy appeared about six times. <br /> <br /> What would be the most interesting thing about the picture is to give Indians an impressionist light in a time when TV and movie west still have the red man as an illiterate depicting wilderness. The character of dr. James Rolfe (Norman Fredric) is the most revealing in this regard; He is an Indian who has been educated and become a doctor, and has returned to the country of his tribe to cater to the needs of all his citizens. For the purposes of the story, he had to personalize a white man to be accepted by local farmers. It was the hardest thing for me to go over the story, like Dr. Rolfe was the grandson of the elderly chief Tomache (John Miljan). That nobody in the story except Paviva (Lisa Montell) knew he was really an Indian was something of a stretch for me. I suppose it was possible that he had left the tribe at an early age, but without the back story falling out, it was not for me that no one else of the tribe would know who he was. <br /> <br /> I don't know why I'm so busy about this, but after watching over two hundred Westerners on this site, I suddenly got three movies over the last month using a blanket like the one performed by Tonto's horse speech in this photo. Roy Rogers' Trigger made a similar stunt in 1952's "Sun of Paleface", and I caught it again in 1958's "The Big Country" by a horse named Old Thunder in that movie. It is done as a little comical relief in a situation that would not normally come up for a horse, and that makes me curious when the little bit could be done the first time. I have to keep looking more ancient Western. Not to mention Silver also had a chance to shine in the picture, and to make an Indian baby saving about to be used as a hostage by bad old Brady . <br /> <br /> Talking of stinkers, Clayton Moore borrowed a TV series tactic when he issued a disguise as a southern gentleman to exterminate the villains who were devised by the canopy raiders. When doing this in the half-hour format, it was always smart enough to hide its real features, usually with a beard like this. One of the more interesting episodes I remembered was the Ranger depicting an actor in the cover of Abraham Lincoln. <br /> <br /> Keep an eye on some goofs I've seen along the way. In an early scene at the opening, an Indian is shot by one of the rappers, and in the close-up there is blood on his shirt but no bullet hole. Later in the story, Ross Brady and Wilson drive on the Indians after kidnapping one of the villains from prison. Brady shoots him from a standing position to prevent him from identifying the raiders, but is immediately shown to make his break with Wilson.
