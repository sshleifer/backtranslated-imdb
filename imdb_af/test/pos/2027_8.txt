I saw this movie when it came out. I thought what an average movie. I have now realized that this director was before his time. It's a good movie and a good soundtrack. I've seen my share of rock movies, but even though it's far from spinal tapes (which I didn't like)> This movie brings us to the life of an 80-climber who doesn't want to be anything. It's nothing more than our inner child who wants to grow up and be a * ROCK STAR *. Yes, I said it. Everyone wants to grow up and be on the spot (again said or not). This movie just puts you in the heart of emotions and you can almost feel the excitement of Izzy. I have to admit that the acting was less, but the music and story were still enough to keep you there until the credits rolled. Especially keep the watch when you are a fan of your mighty hair.
