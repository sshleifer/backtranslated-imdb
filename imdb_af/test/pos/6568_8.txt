It is very true that this movie convention is denied by not spotting the viewer. While some may have a problem finding out for themselves, I embrace "Uzumaki" for its inexperience. There's a PLOT, it's just that it's not immediately accessible to a lazy viewer. It's a film that invites many interpretations, like all good art - but this film is also very entertaining, making it a rare movie experience. It's both challenging and fun at the same time.
