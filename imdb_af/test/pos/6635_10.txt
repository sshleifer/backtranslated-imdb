This fearless and fierce film is against not only the war during which it was made, but all war. It doesn't matter what war it is. It can be the most emotional experience I've ever had with Ingmar Bergman's work. There are no sides of the two main characters in this impact drama that do not enter a point in any ceremonial symbolism as per Bergman's uses, but clearly show people and their lives and exercises that Bergman has already proved he understands from a person reaction to a movie. <br /> <br /> His top-loading regulators Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow play an internalizing but bitterly married couple who were once orchestral musicians. Now they live in a weathered farmhouse on an island. Part of the frustration in the building we are growing to share with these two people is in detail that nothing in their home seems to work. They are also not withdrawn intellectuals. They are a well-known well-known marriage that more or less resigned from life and is essentially apolitical; they only get wind of distant rumors about a war that is going on forever. Ullmann is worried about the danger to their lives and to her desire to bear children. Her husband, Von Sydow, shows that the war will pass them by. Their tranquility is interrupted by the screams of fighter planes flying low over their homes, the attack of a skydiver, the arrival of dubious troops, their inquisition, and ultimately their arrest that seems to be the local side, but loyalty has long split . <br /> <br /> They are returned to their home, testify of destruction and suffer from the vengeful effects of such a disturbing negligent marriage. This, one of my best favorite Bergman efforts, is a study of some of their safe self-conscious subconscious lives and violated by a manipulative despair to test them to reveal who they really are. She lacks compassion to some extent, self-service and restless to have patience for his capricious crashes to cry. His suppressed emotional problems led to the suppression of the many initiative and excitement they had attracted to start with. The tremendous last twenty minutes, interrupted sporadically by the overwhelmingly gray sky, is one of the closest to the true emotion Bergman has ever filmed. <br /> <br /> All systems of dogma and faith are the antagonists in this very essential and cunning portrait. The basic clearcut personalities of Ullmann and Von Sydow's characters are plunged into the degenerate war world because they are accused of being "sympathizers", but the film shot at Bergman's small home island of Faro does not provide information on where or When set, who are the two sides and for what they are fighting. For an uninvolved citizen caught in between, the knowledge base is probably very similar. <br /> <br /> Ullmann and Von Sydow are not sympathizers for the apparent enemy, but they are partisans for whom they believe. This 1968 reactive allegory can be about the common non-cooperating Iraqi, or Kosovo, or Vietnam, or Israel, or Palestine, or ...
