One of our all-time family favorites. When we need a laugh ... we just put this one in and laugh all the time because it's the first time we've seen it. This movie has good, clean family humor. Pauly Shore is brilliant! With no thanksgiving holiday plans, Crawl (Shore) is invited to spend the holiday with a conservative cow, Becca. Kruip, as a big city boy, needs to adapt to farm life if he falls in love with Becca. But, Crawl is not the only one to learn new things. Crawl teaches Becca and her parents how to be more open about their feelings and to accept others. It's fun for viewers of all ages.
