I just love this movie and I programmed my TV to record it when it comes back on November 2nd. It is a very sweet love story with a twist. The song played at the end of the movie is one you wouldn't think would be a big hit, but it's a song that stays in your head and I'm trying to find that song so I can hear it and play. I really have no style of the programs I see or the songs I like to hear and make it beautiful to see things with new thoughts. I want to say there are a few parts in this movie that are not meant for the whole family to watch. This movie does show the skin. It is similar to a lifetime movie for women, about women. I say look at the movie and you may as much as I did.
