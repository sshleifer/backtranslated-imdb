I just started to look and I thought it was wonderful. I rated it 8 out of 10. I plan to see it again with the directors' comments and then again in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I rented this movie because I was fascinated by Christopher Nolan's recent movie Memento. The following have some similarities; This movie was probably the blueprint for Memento. Even the music in some parts is very similar. <br /> <br /> Recording the movie in black and white gives it a mysterious feeling. The story and dialogue are really good. The performances of the actors are credible. <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan made this movie a very low budget. I'm looking forward to his next issue. Insomnia, a great budget movie with my favorite actor Al Pacino.
