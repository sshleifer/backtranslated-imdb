hello, are you looking for a movie for the family to watch on Friday night? Can't find what you're looking for? I thought it was a very nice movie. Good for the whole family. I found that it had a remarkably rare combination to address both adults and children. It was brilliant, to say the least. In addition, Bruce Willis's play was a lot of humor in it and overall, a good movie. In my opinion, this is a must-see movie. And I don't think there are many movies, believe me when I say it takes a lot for a movie to make me think. Obviously, a lot of work has been done by Bruce Willis and throw to get this movie. Excellent story, good acting, and again, an enjoyable movie overall.
