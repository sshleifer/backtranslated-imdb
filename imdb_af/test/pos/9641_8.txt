Robert Montgomery and Robert Young are outstanding as a duo of young submarine officers stationed in Italy during the First World War. The dialogue is highly entertaining, and Jimmy Durante is hilarious as the ship's cook, "Ptomaine". Walter Huston's character is inspiring as the submarine captain, a star example of an officer and a gentleman. One of the most interesting aspects of this movie was the level of technology displayed in the battlefield. I was amazed at how similar the technology of World War I to technology was in World War II 25 years later. The basic human nature is portrayed as very similar to modern times, and far from the conservatism I thought existed in the so-called "innocent" past. All in all, I felt that the movie, characters, action scenes and history depicted in this movie were first class.
