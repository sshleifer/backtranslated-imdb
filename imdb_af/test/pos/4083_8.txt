I caught it at Mexican television at 2pm, and I decided to give it a chance as it was based on a real-life case involving the murder of the typical All American family (a father, a mother and a young boy). <br /> <br /> Initially, tips point to Walker being the killer, as he had strong differences with his dad. Soon after, when Walker and Luke were taken to the sheriff's dept. To be investigated by the lie detection machine, things look very different. <br /> <br /> Also, when Walker and Luke attend an appointment with their father's lawyer, they learn that Luke will receive $ 200,000 and Walker is out of heresy. Luke immediately bought a convertible. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it's a great secret movie about betrayal, ambition, feelings and cold, very cold blood. <br /> <br /> I know the real names have changed, but still the experience is the same. Give this movie a try. I know there are HUNDREDS of "based on real murders" or events of such, but this one is truly worthy. Pure quality in acting, direction and plot.
