I recently rented this movie as part of a nostalgic phase I go through. I was born in 1980, and so from the mid-80s to mid-90s, film has become a very important place in my life. <br /> <br /> This particular movie was one of my favorites, and so I was excited. It became available in the UK. It didn't get worse over time, it's still a great pleasure movie, with lots of excitement in its own way. Certainly, it shines in the shade of bigger, bigger budget movies, but don't let that enjoy you. <br /> <br /> Value to find a rental, or even a purchase at discounted prices, is it. for.
