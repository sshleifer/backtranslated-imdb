Granny is the best movie ever Ganny is the best movie I've ever seen. the plot has never been seen or done before these people are really blessed with a talent that is not joke, i like this movie. I have to buy it, but I can't find anywhere. it is a dream for me to meet the actors and try to rent a grandmother 2.i GRANNY from Broadway video and keep it for a week longer than I should have and asked them if they could buy, they said. Not a huge disappointment and an even bigger one the week after I returned it, I wanted to rent it out again, but come out to find out that Broadway video was not out of pocket. If someone has the movie or knows where to buy it, please tell me at iloverot@aol.com
