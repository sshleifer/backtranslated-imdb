I think COMPLETING SAVAGES is a very good TV program and they have to make many more episodes. This is one of my favorites !! It is very funny and it is really good acting. I say you have to give them a chance to do more episodes. I know they can and they must !!!! They need more SAFAGES on NICKELODEON than they do! I'm sure many people will agree with me !!!!! I love the TV program because it's a great program for people of our age and it's very funny. I also like COMPLETED VISITORS because it's not always the same and things that happen can be real, unlike other YV programs. When they advertised it, I didn't have the sound of it, but I watched it for the first time and I loved it. COMPLETE SAVAGES is an excellent comedy and I miss it on TV !!!!!!!!!! I can't REALLY compare SAVAGES to any other TV show because it's different !!!!
