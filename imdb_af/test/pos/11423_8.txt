Stan as a bullfighter, and a good one, is quite a surprise. Normally overshadowed by Oliver Hardy, this quiet short allows him to take the lead and the spotlight. <br /> <br /> One can only conclude that his character "Rhubarb Vaselino" was a parody of the many Rudolph Valentino movies of this era. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to get rid of some of the dialogue and keep an eye on the special effects. <br /> <br /> I have it on DVD in a Vol. saw. 1 & 2 collection.
