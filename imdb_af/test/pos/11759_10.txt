Homegrown is one of those movies that fell through the cracks, but deserved better. When I first saw it, I had a luxury response. But over time it really grew me - no word is meant ;-). The more I see it, the more I appreciate it. In addition, the writing is like the play. Throw some surprising cameos and good direction, and you end up with a good movie. <br /> <br /> It is also nice to finally see Hank Azaria getting a chance to shine in a lead role. And Thornton delivers its usual quality performance. Even the relative newcomer, Ryan Phillippe, delivers a friendly, innocent and impeccable friend. <br /> <br /> On a synoot, Homegrown is simply a "must see" if you are a Billy Bob Thornton fan. It appears that Stephen Gyllenhaal has been influenced by earlier Thornton projects such as One False Move and Sling Blade (although Homegrown is certainly much more in the cheek than that). And Thornton's role as a character, both sophisticated and down-to-earth, is a perfect match for the actor.
