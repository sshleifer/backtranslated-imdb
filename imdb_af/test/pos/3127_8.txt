A few domes help a group of Mormons over a rough land on their way to a new settlement. This lower key Western is unusual for Ford because it has no big stars. Johnson gets top billing, but she's basically a supporting role, though he and Carey work well together. Dru is given little to do differently than to give love. The best performance is given by Ford's favorite Bond, who plays the Mormons leader. In fact, this role helped him to play a leading role in the long-term TV Western "Wagon Train" before he was 57 years old. With beautiful cinematography, Ford considered it to be one of his favorite films.
