The show is BIG. No words to describe it. Wonderful music. Incredible dance. The editors could not spoil it, not because they were * so bad * but because the show really * is * good *. <br /> <br /> The editors are compulsive cutters, you can't see a scene without a cut for more than 15 seconds. It's right to show different angles, but for the first time the guys have worked with multiple cameras in their lives. They will remind you of how many cameras they have on average every five seconds ... They manage to start a jump with one camera, then cut it in the middle and point the rest at a different angle. <br /> <br /> No matter how much they tried, they can't spoil that wonderful show. It is a must have for dance and music lovers.
