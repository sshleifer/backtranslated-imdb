I gave 9 out of 10 points. I almost put the whole movie in tears, because I had to laugh! <br /> <br /> Of course, the story wasn't great, but it wasn't boring either. Erkan & Stefan are assigned to become bodyguards for the beautiful Nina. While doing this job, they come between the front lines of BND and CIA. Of course, the two are not bodyguards or sir, so they run from one disaster to another; and they do it in such a funny way, that when you look at some scenes, you can't stop the tears! As actors, these two "dumbly grinning" characters do pretty well, better than some so-called professionals. <br /> <br /> You think the speech of the two heroes is curious or "pseudo-strange"? Well, if you hear a lot of Turkish-German people in Munich, they talk exactly like them, then you will remember Erkan & Stefan. And maybe, in 10 years, it might have become the common speech of the youth. (God forbid!) <br /> <br /> So, if you want to laugh, watch this movie!
