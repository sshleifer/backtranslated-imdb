The brightness of this story delivers at least one skillfully crafted message to every viewer in the audience. This story is about success, it's about failure. It's about the choices you make in life and the choices others make for you. The story deals with self-realization and determination on a scale that is so large that no camera angle can cover it. Within the grasp of each scene there is an element that is imagined in your imagination. Keep this in mind when you watch the movie; It's more than eye candy. The sexually suggestive, rarely explicit screens serve only to derive and entertain you during the boring process of character development.
