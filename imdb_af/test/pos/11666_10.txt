In a world in which debatable and wrong topics can be listed endlessly, this powerful 1995 movie is at the top of that list; In addition, it becomes objective and realistic and with a sensitivity and sensitivity that makes it a really good film by anyone's benchmark. And to add it ironically, even the subject of this film is widely misunderstood, as it is mistaken that it is a film about the pros and cons of the death penalty; it is not. In the heart of Dead Man Walking, led by Tim Robbins, is a subject that is possibly the most misunderstood of all, and with good reason, because it can only be the most difficult thing to actually be. . - and really - understand. And this is what this film is about: Forgiveness. True forgiveness; Don't apologize for an abominable crime or its culprit - not saying what happened, okay, but getting the power to go ahead and doing it by choosing life. <br /> <br /> Director / screenwriter Tim Robbins has made and faithfully adapted the novel by Sister Helen Prejean. She discusses her involvement with the deadly prisoners to whom they have served her faith in God over the years. As described in the film, which for her would become a lifelong pursuit of not just justice, but human dignity, began with a simple letter from a prisoner at the Louisiana State Prison in Angola. Mrs. Poncelet (Sean Penn), who was sentenced to death, came out to someone who would listen when his letter landed in the hands of Sister Prejean (Susan Sarandon), who soon found her in an area where she absolutely had had no knowledge or experience. And Robbins has successfully captured Sister Prejean's emotional and turbulent journey, while keeping it without any maudlin sentimentality that not only makes it truly, credibly, and credibly, but a gripping and thoroughly emotional audience experience make. Through the medium of the theater, which was once a personal, significant emotional experience for Sister Prejean, it also becomes for everyone who sees this movie. <br /> <br /> For her soul-loving, passionate depiction of Sister Prejean, Susan Sarandon, the Oscar for Best Actress earned. Sensitive and full of emotional depth, her performance is incredibly touching and real, especially in the way she transmits Sister Prejean's underlying natural fragility and vulnerability. She was patiently tempered with the toughness she needed to continue her efforts on behalf of Poncelet (and in fact, a total of five since she started). Regarding your point of view on the issues being investigated in this film, Sister Prejean is undoubtedly an individual of heroic relationships, which Sarandon beautifully embodies here. and she does this without using unnecessary melodramatic, but rather by keeping it right by subtly and humbly investigating the humanity of the person in a very credible expression of characterization. It's an extraordinary show, probably the best of Sarandon's brilliant career. <br /> <br /> To achieve a career-best performance, Sean Penn, who was named best actor for his Poncelet painting. He has Nicolas Cage, who is for his performance in 'Leave' Las Vegas. Perfect for the part in every way, Penn is simply never better, before or since. He offers Poncelet effective as a real person, rather than a remaining caricature of a monster who can commit the crimes depicted here. Not that it makes Poncelet any less despicable; just the opposite, in fact. It really upsets to be confronted with the fact that someone who looks like a man who can live alongside you will be able to do such things. And this is the power of Penn's performance - it is so disturbingly real, presented with depth and nuance; you have to look in his eyes to find the imperfections of a troubled soul. An excellent show, and - as good as Cage was in Vegas - Penn had to receive the Oscar for it. <br /> <br /> In another outing, Raymond J. Barry is memorable in a supporting role as Earl Delacroix, the father of one of Poncelet's victims. With limited screen time, however, he develops his character in such a way that you can experience with him, as well as with Sister Prejean, as it is through him that we gain insight into how complicated and seemingly her position is. , at least on the surface. Barry offers Delacroix in such a way that it gives the necessary balance and perspective to the story, which is ultimately extremely effective and helps to emphasize the message of the movie. <br /> <br /> The supporting film includes R. Lee Emery Clyde Percy, Celia Weston (Mary Beth Percy), Lois Smith (Helen's Mother), Scott Wilson (Chaplin Farley), Roberta Maxwell (Lucille Poncelet) , Margo Martindale (Sister Colleen) and Jack Black (Craig Poncelet). It is doubtful that this film will change anyone's thoughts somehow about the death penalty, but that was never the intention; What was meant was to make a thought-provoking, emotional movie, exactly what Robbins did with Dead Man Walking. Regardless of your personal point of view, this film will have an impact, and hopefully it will open up the true nature of forgiveness. Because as we see through the character of Earl Delacroix, true forgiveness is not something that one simply decides to do, but is a life-time task. And this is probably one of the most difficult things in life to achieve effectively; and you get away from this film with an appreciation for individuals like Sister Prejean, who has dedicated her life to help people in need, and to filmmakers like Robbins and Sarandon to bring her to life for millions of people who would never otherwise did not know. her. I rate this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
