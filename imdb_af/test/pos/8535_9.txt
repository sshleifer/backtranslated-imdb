I honestly didn't think at the beginning that this movie would make me like hell and admire the big gore effects, boy was I wrong! From the beginning to the end, the film had some great gore effects, accompanied by spoofs from other titles such as "Evil Dead" and "Gremlins". This movie can be compared to Peter Jackson's artworks, although this movie is not as good as Braindead, but I'm sure these guys will make another flattering movie.
