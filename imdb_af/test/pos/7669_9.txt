I had the great pleasure of recently including this beautifully filmed wide screen adjustment of the 1943 revival (unlike the original 1935 production), which includes extensive conversations. It was fashionable then, so blaming the film for a 16-year-old tradition. The film should be seen as it is only crawled into Sammy Davis Jr's brilliant cat-like performance as Sportin 'Life in and out of shade. His seduction of Dorothy Dadridge's BESS "There is a boat's turn-off" is one of the many highlights. Almost all the main music is intact and sung well. It's definitely never boring what recent PBS and MET versions did. It was nice to see that the time did not diminish the movie and hopefully it will be made available to the generations who did not have the opportunity to experience it in the near future.
