For the second time I only saw this movie with my 8-year-old daughter and I remembered why we had it for the first time. All these people who say it's bad are too thick and critical! It's just an entertaining little movie, it's not supposed to change the world. I thought all the actors did a good job with their characters. (Apart from Jeremy Jordan as Guy - he was a serious girl in need of soap and shampoo. If HE is supposed to be the hot guy in their school, then they have slender pickins.) But I split- -Drew Barrymore was lovely, as usual, and David Arquette was even pleasant, and I can't usually stomach him, even if it's just because of those STUPID AT & T commercials! Molly Shannon is always entertaining, and Leelee Sobieski did a good job as a tortured brain. Some parts were actually painful to look at, and reminded me of high school. Although I have not been fortunate enough, it hurt my heart for those who do. Movies like this are really good for kids to watch - my daughter made several observations about the cruelty of some students and how wrong it was. This movie is suitable for anyone and a great way to take 2 hours away. If there is ever a time to see a light movie with a happy ending where you don't have to think much, then this is definitely a consideration.
