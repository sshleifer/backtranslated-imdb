This movie is a fascinating example of Luis Bunuel's storytelling capabilities. It is a comedy that is not a comedy and a social drama that is not a social drama. Although I didn't think it was really funny, it made me laugh. Also, despite the fact that you can never take Bunuel too seriously, the film has thought about religion and its importance in some people's lives. Bunuel tells the story of a Catholic priest dedicated to his faith as no one else and the viewer testifies to what happens when the priest's immortal commitment to serve others is tested. As usual, Bunuel's target is Catholicism, but I don't think he was trying to mock the church as he often does. At least I didn't take the film as a mockery of the institution. I think he is trying to make an interesting point about how religion can be a nuisance in today's modern society. Not because faith in itself is bad, but because people always bastard the concept. Message aside, I think this is one of Bunuel's most clever works. Francisco Rabal is wonderful as the priest. Definitely one of the movie's best movies.
