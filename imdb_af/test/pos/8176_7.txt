The story of pre-united China must be a popular one. Jet Li's hero made the King's murder popular. <br /> <br /> This is another story made a few years earlier. This is the amazingly beautiful Li Gon (Memoirs of a Geisha, 2046, Miami Vice) as the king's lover, who was sent to recruit a killer so the king could defeat him. She recruits Fengyi Zhang, but falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> Whether he can complete the mission anyway, as the king knew in advance. I suspect he also knew, but went anyway. <br /> <br /> It was a beautiful story with massive military operations and of course another chance to see Li Gong.
