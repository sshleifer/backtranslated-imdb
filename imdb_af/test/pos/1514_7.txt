Lucio Fulci's brain in the brain is an inventive and somewhat selfish story of a director's decent in madness. The director in question is Fulci himself, who dies in the film. Fulci became known everywhere as 'the godfather of gore', and for good reason, since he gave us some of the most beautiful and most horrific films ever to grace the silver screen. of the eyeball violence in films such as 'Zombi 2', killed a man with chains in 'The Beyond', entirely on the gore festival known as The New York Ripper. If you want (and let's see, who doesn't), Fulci is your husband. But all this catering to ghore like you and I took his toll on Fulci's mental state, and he is quickly seducing into madness caused by what he films. Fulci's problems also did not end with his mental state, as his psychiatrist he went to see about his problem, took it upon himself to commit murder as a hobby, with Fulci's films as blueprints for the murders. <br /> <br /> I have to say, the play in this movie is absolutely horrific. There is one play in particular that a hooker entails, and it is only suitable for laughter because it is acting and it's stupidity. Fulci takes the lead role of the film (of course). He's not an actor, and it shows, but his performance is actually the best in the movie. It's even safe to say that one, the play, is bad for an Italian horror movie. Of course, no-one goes into an Italian horror that performs well, so it's a little overdue, but I think Fulci could have hired some better people. Poor dubbing doesn't really help either. But something that helps is the fact that the terrible act is compensated by many gore, and it is extreme to say the least! People get their heads cut off, a woman is killed in the shower (and unlike Psycho, here we see it really), people are hacked, fed with pigs and there is a lot of cinema's best melee weapon - the chain saw on each other, who did not rejoice. The amount of gore is quite high, which gives the film something of a 'spoof' feel, but Cat in the Brain is a tongue in anyway. <br /> <br /> it would be difficult to make a movie about yourself and don't come across a bit of a big head, and Fulci does indeed come as a bit of a big head in this movie . His name is often called, and he is almost always on the screen; It's not too much different from 'New Nightmare' in the ego game, but it's clear he did it well, and I watched him enjoy it so we can forgive him a little selfishness. The end of the movie let it down - I saw it coming a mile away, but then it didn't seriously think the movie would take that route, but I was wrong. it did unfortunately. The end left me cold, and the movie is a better look if you turn it off just before the last two minutes. In spite of its finite and terrific action, Cat in the Brain is very happy and Fulci enthusiasts will not end, and it is recommended.
