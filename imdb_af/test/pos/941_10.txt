A great movie with great Aussie talent. Director Mark Lamprell addressed the possible sob-inducing topic in a way that was humorous and refreshing. Definitely the highlight of the 2000 Brisbane International Film Festival. Australian film veteran, Sam Neill, was as always fabulous in the role of Frank's uni-professor and new talent, Matt Newton, who delivered a show that people would say, "You know, Bert Newton, Matt's dad ! " Come out and see this movie !!!
