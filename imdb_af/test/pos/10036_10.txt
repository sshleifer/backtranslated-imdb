Now it's more like that! One of the best movies I've ever seen! Despite this, it was very good on all aspects. This movie is just down because it's not too historically accurate. Leave it alone! There are tons of historical movies out there It was forgiven not to be historically accurate, and many of them didn't even come close to how big, how entertaining and how fascinating this movie was! And that's what a movie ticket is about! You will know exactly what you want These genres and the grace of this movie are those with the anti-Flynn syndrome. This conservative root syndrome is closely related to the anti-Elvis, anti-Ali, anti-Clinton, Kennedy syndromes, usually caused by fear of charming individuals who have unconventional beliefs. If the viewer of this movie is open-minded and has the ability to separate politics from art, you will not only find this movie one of the best classics, but also one of the best movies of all time. the second best west ever, right b behind Wayne's The Cowboys ........
