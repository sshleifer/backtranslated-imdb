If you are a long-standing fan of the doctor and you have knotted when you hear they make another series, rest easy - it's more than the high expectations of the original. The pacing is much faster than the original shows, which occur more often in 50 minute episodes, rather than the average 90 minutes. The writing is excellent, the play is excellent. The hardest and best thing to get used to is the production values ​​of the new range. Compared to the original, it now has a few. (Although I will always have good memories of bubble wrap and hand puppet samples.) If you're not a fan, or if you've tried the original and can't get a handle, jump in both feet! Everything you really need to know about the doctor will tell you if they go. This series was written with little reference to the doctor's enormous story, specifically to encourage new viewers. Admittedly, I first see the first new series as it is shown on the Sci-Fi channel (in other words, probably cut it for ribbons for time constraints), but I'm looking forward to future episodes, either on broadcast TV or on DVD. (July 4 can't be fast enough!)
