I think the problem with this show doesn't get the respect it really deserves, it's coming to Seinfeld, to ELR and to friends. The three sitcoms were the stars of their time. <br /> <br /> At the end of this special time, KOQs came to TV. <br /> <br /> But don't let that stop you. <br /> <br /> King of Queens was named as good as no better than two of the three. <br /> <br /> Seinfeld started it all and was a timeless classic. I never laughed as hard as I did at Seinfeld. But KOQ's really come close. <br /> <br /> If it's going to laugh, I should rate KOQs' second only for Seinfeld. However, ELR must be second, as character creation and interaction are more encouraging. <br /> <br /> Anyway, KOQs are top ten of the past 20 years. <br /> <br /> The only other seating value to mention now is two and a half men who don't like a candle on the other four, but that's all we have left over.
