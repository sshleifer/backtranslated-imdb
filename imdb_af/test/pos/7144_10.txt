It was a very faithful representation of Lewis's mid-50s life. The dialogue on theology and the banter with his follow colleagues was exceptionally good. Michael White's book, "C.S. Lewis: Creator of Narnia" deals with this timeframe in a very parallel way. Joss Ackland's play was excellent for catching the unemotional Lewis. The movie had great pain in being presented in an accurate English environment. The development of a strong bond between "Jack" (his preferred name) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, Joy's son of her previous marriage, was nice to watch. The movie avoided the confusing element of Warnie Lewis's (Jack's older brother) drinking problem, but it wouldn't have set the story up, so it's best left out.
