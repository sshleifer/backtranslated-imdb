The only complaint I heard from this movie was that it was slow. Although, perhaps this is the point. The two characters clash unexpectedly and the slow build up of tension between them is anxiety. The intricate and subtle gestures and minimal dialogue take the tension to a point where another normal argument shocks the audience. Istanbul and the outskirts are dreamy, the landscape is fascinating and the plot is exciting - not in that look, the hero has blown up another car and he is now flying his motorcycle. I had cold chills under my spine as the characters moved in and out of each other's spheres and watch the fog fail Istanbul.
