This is a cherished movie from my childhood !! I can still print the theme song on the drop of a hat! I remember staying late to see this movie with my dad, usually two to three times a year. We always called it "Giant Robot". Although the effect in this movie is rough compared to today's standards, it was perfect for this movie's genre. I'm also a BIG fan of the Japanese "Monster" movies, so this movie has come to the other place. It's been years since I saw this movie and would like to get my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8 year old daughter.
