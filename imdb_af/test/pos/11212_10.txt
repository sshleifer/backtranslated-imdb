It took me about a year after I saw this movie. Lord I knew I wanted, after I saw it, I knew I saw something I hadn't seen before, but wasn't sure why. Having known for quite some time, it is these characters that I cannot stop thinking about now. <br /> <br /> Briefly explain and tell the story of a family member (Yusuf) living out of the rural areas briefly with a good deal of doing photographer (Mahmut) in the city in the hope of working get. However, it becomes clear that after Yusuf relieves the idea of ​​a sailor and his job prospects, he suspects that he is really looking for something else, somehow in his life. <br /> <br /> Through all these souls, we are being taken by seasonally filmed environment. The context in which they happen makes the scenes more powerful in 2 specifics when a girl follows Yusuf, suddenly meets with her significant other, and the look of Yusuf's face as he looks at a fish basket and the shot and light that reflects her tortured face. This scene in itself must be one of the most beautifully filmed pieces I have witnessed. I don't know how long. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mahmut also has its own demons, but eventually its family member is confronted. that he did not really try to find a job and forced him to leave, in a very simple scene, but with the feeling of real sadness. <br /> <br /> What the viewer is much to reflect and think about for these 2 people who can all see a piece of themselves. You should not be beaten by the speed of this movie. This is worth every second breathtaking. <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10.
