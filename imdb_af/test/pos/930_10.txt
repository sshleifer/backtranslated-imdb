Valentine, a model in France, is divorced from her overseas lover, planning to meet in England, but seems to be growing bigger as the film progresses. One night after taking a pass by her colleague, she hit a dog called Rita. The dog survives and she gives it back to her owner, a hostile retired judge who lives as a hermit and eavesdropper, and listens to the talks of all his neighbors. She is intrigued by the nature of this man and often visits him, and often becomes part of his eavesdropping games. One conversation in which the two listen is of the utmost importance, although the conversation between a young man who judges quickly and his wife, finds out about the life of the man tapping on them. As we find out more about the couple, the man reveals more of his story, then his story continues, and we find out if the two men will continue to the same fate. Little does Valentine know how her life, this encounter and the fate of the young judge will be together. Her day hit the dog, a divine sacrifice by the dog for her owner, so Valentine was the salvation of the young judge, traveling on the same path as her best friend, to prevent him from filling such a grim future. with loneliness and loneliness. The old man's dream seems to have come true, and he can sleep on his face with a smile for the rest of his days. <br /> <br /> An AMAZING finale for the best trilogy of all time! Kieslowski never stops me from surprised. He is one of my favorite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of the theater. His use of the colors of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art. Three of the most visually appealing movies I've ever seen. And its subtle connections between the three movies is wonderful. Usually indicated with a subtle pause or focus in a scene, see if you can see a few. I have to mention it and it's a great SPOILER, I loved the end, how all the characters of the three movies were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it to her TV, which relieves his happiness about the suffering he has been dealing with for many years. I couldn't think of a better way to end the movie, but a smile on my face, a great way to pack a wonderful movie and trilogy! I recommend it to anyone who loves movies, movies, anything ... A work of art! 10 out of 10 for both the movie and the trilogy.
