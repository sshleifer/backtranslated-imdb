It's a sad state of affairs in Hollywood when a movie surprises you by not taking routes you've seen in the movie house since the first day. I literally had no idea how this movie would end, because it was when I expected it to go right, face when I expected a saw. It could easily be unraveled in generic suspense thriller, or depressed white rubbish drama, but it ended up a job. However, this is a sad story. Not because of what happened to Alice, but because of the sad world that surrounds her and leads her on this path. <br /> <br /> The plot has a quiet dignity of form that is usually reserved for theater, but the pacing can be a bit more tight. Anyway, this is a very good movie, and for some reason I suspect sour grapes from those who recorded this one.
