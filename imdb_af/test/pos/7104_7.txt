The "House of Dracula" really has nothing new in the way of chills or excitement or new twists on an already tired story. This film was made as a quick successor to the reasonably well-made "House of Frankenstein" a year earlier. In "House of Dracula" you can see the factory as production values ​​of 1945 taking their toll on an otherwise frightening film. Images of previous movies in the series and then the end of "Ghost of Frankenstein" used as the end here just make an "el cheepo" flick. In doing so, the studio and producer scanned the fact that they have top talent and just wasted the time and effort of everybody on a quick money-generating scheme. But it seems as if the trend around the world was in Hollywood at the end of World War II. That's what brought on some of the 1950s scintillating sci-fi photos with all their approaches to harmless lizards to make them look like dinosaurs. The days of James Whale and Val Lewton to name two were beyond as far as creating true atmosphere and atmosphere in this genre. Also, keep in mind that the makeup genius, Jack Pierce, who actually did medical research to create all our favorites, was dismissed just after this particular movie was released. A less capable make-up man, named Bud Westmore, was then appointed as the head of this Universal Department, soon to be Universal-International. Not to Westmore's ability to deny, but horror movies were just not his forts. OK, to look or not to look. Look at this movie, but only as part of the Frankenstein series chronological order and you will see it all come as comical feed for Abbott & Costello.
