Despite some very picturesque places in the east and a sporadically energetic music by Franco Micalizzi, this film is not quite at the level of Joe D'Amato's similar efforts while remaining just as trashy. The author of the original book, Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman, Emmanuelle Arsan, played a small role in this film, which mostly shows pornographic a very young Annie Belle as she finds in a variety of strange sexual situations. Her boyfriend, played by ZOMBIE's Al Cliver, actually accepts her sleep and even convinces her to continue her practices, even after the two of them are married! Orso Maria Guerrini falls as a professor who is o, and usually married to two women, one of whom is played by Arsan himself. In spite of promising beginnings and with some hilarious dialogs like "can you see me with the naked eye?" ... "I can see you better naked!", Plunge the movie into the less than spectacular finale. Much like D'Amato's EMANUAL AND LAST CANNIBALS, the main characters are all looking for a lost tribe, but don't get your hopes, there is no violence in this movie, not much sex. Just a lot of nudity and stupid dialogue. I can't help but find some appreciation for this little movie, even if it's just for the whole cornball logic that the movie goes.
