Just exactly how director John Madden joins Nicolas Cage and Penelope Cruz to play the roles of an Italian officer and a Greek Villager in an honorable story: "Captain Correli's Mandolin", just escapes me! Witness: A Wobble, inconsistent accent by Cage amid terrible overworking, with Cruz - thrown more adequately than a spoiled Latino opposite Johnny Depp in "Blow" - basically a repeat performance under the guise of a Greek nurse. Yes, it was painful. But there were savings. <br /> <br /> The story itself is exciting to tragic, and Cage has a few (- redeeming, it's! -) musical ability. Next, an excellent performance by John Hurt (Cruz's father, the town doctor) of Oscar Callibre, as well as Irene Papas, each as town elders, as well as Christian Bale (Papas'son) among the village freedom fighters. , go against the balancing of uncomfortable performances (especially at the beginning) by Cruz and Cage. Beautiful, the last two seem to grow in their respective roles as the film progresses, but it is timely teeth. Eventually, the scenery itself and photography can be given a technical award, thus providing a pleasant distraction when needed. <br /> <br /> John Hurt already has two Oscar nominations and it will be a third; I hope he gets it as his show, as the doctor saw this movie. The real test of a supporting actor / actress is whether the movie will be the same without the person involved, and in this case it will certainly not be ... not even close. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value, but for the aforementioned plus factors that help increase the beam. Don't see it as you. Rating = 3.5 stars (out of five).
