My God, these are funny things. Yes, it is puerile in the extreme, but also crook ("Here is the page with all the wines on it." "It's a little early for us, I'm scared." "Well, what are you doing then?") And the battle order is unmatched. In spite of what you may have heard, the laugh * comes, and at a surprisingly generous price. The mere comic abilities of Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson help this mystery funny. remove every drop of comedy from the writing. I can only compare it to "Angs and Loathing in Las Vegas" - you also find the movie hysterical or not at all; The same applies here. This is probably the funniest British movie since "Withnail and I", but to say it is an acquired taste is something of a gross (sic) understatement.
