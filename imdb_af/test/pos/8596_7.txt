I've never read a Jacqueline Susann novel, but I've also seen Valley of the Dolls based on one of her books. On both occasions I thought the movie is probably better than the book and will improve further with age (certainly contrary to the books). The reason is that a movie focuses more on a particular style in fashion, design and behavioral patterns. And in this respect, The Love Machine offers a lot. The set design fits perfectly with the story. And all the characters also fit in. They're perfect in the way they complete a well-balanced overall picture. They are superficial and undeveloped, this is true, but in this movie I do not want it. <br /> <br /> David Hemmings raises the role he played in Antonioni's Blow Up. And it's more than a rip-off. He is a fashion photographer, looks visibly outdated and looks slightly seeded. Robert Ryan replays the role he played in Max Oph√ºl's Caught. He is Smith Ohlrig again, greedy, bored and boring, uninspired and uninspiring. It is possible that Ryan did not want to be in this picture and acted accordingly, but on the other hand he could have thought a lot about his part and then given a carefully studied performance. Whatever happens, fit it to the picture. Dyan Cannon is great (fantastic wardrobe!). She dominates every scene in which she is involved and is involved in the two highlights of the movie: burning a luxury bed and beating the Hemmings character with an Oscar statue. <Br /> <br /> Of course, the title, The Love Machine, is ironic. Robin Stone is a kind of a Barry Lyndon of the pop era (incidentally, the movie IS a little kubrickysh). That he was choosing a TV station to work his way up, was simply a coincidence. He regards love (meaningful sexual favors) as a means of personal promotion. There are some terrifying tips from a troubled sexuality that are not explored in the movie. Homosexuality is very casually treated, probably not the standard for mayor films of the period. The open cynicism of the TV executives does not have to compare with other good movies on the subject such as A Face in the Crowd of Network or Truman Show. They are making crap, they agree, it's shit and they know they'll make a lot of dough with it. <br /> <br /> I didn't regret spending the strange 108 minutes with this movie and won't be surprised if it followed a cult, provided it was given the chance (meaning a DVD release).
