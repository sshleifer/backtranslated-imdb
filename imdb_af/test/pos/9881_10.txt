A Hilarious Comedy by Best Director Ever, Oz Scott. The list of eighty TV icons goes on and off. Milan (Family), Stone (Mr. Belvedere), Robinson (Night Court), Jackee (227), D'abo (Wonder Years), Walston (Mr. Hand !!!). It's one of the funniest movies ever. Big lines, meaningless subplots, cheesy, bad acting. It's about a group of high school children who have to succeed. Night Court Mac needs them to pass their final exam, or he will be dismissed. Great show by Brian Bloom as the jerky child Riko Conner, but nothing compared to B.D. Wong's Kiki (pronounced kee-chee). A great movie for all ages, so bad it is good.
