Shohei Imamaura's Black Rain was released in 1989, just at the start of the AIDS epidemic, a fact that gives the film a slow attack on the slow decline of Hiroshima radiation victims. The black rain in the title refers to the combination of ash, radioactive fall and water that fell one or two hours after the explosion. There are other books and movies about the fall of the atomic bomb, but no one is as unique and powerful as this one. Based on a novel by Masuji Ibuse who obtained information from interviews and diaries of the victims of the actual victims, the film shows how an entire family is psychologically and physically affected by the bomb years after the original explosion. This is a frightening vision, but one that resonates with deep sympathy for humanity. <br /> <br /> The film starts in Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, as soldiers and civilians do their normal daily activities. Suddenly a blinding light flashes and a thunderous explosion is heard. Almost every building is destroyed or damaged. The first atomic bomb ever to hit a city is now part of history. Survivors must somehow recharge their lives, unaware of the devastating effects of the bomb. Filmed in black and white, the story is about Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka), a young woman caught in the radioactive rain, while her boat goes back to the city to look for friends and family. In Hiroshima, Imamura shows us indelible images that remain with us: a young boy with a skin hanging from his body pleads with his brother to recognize him. An older man is in tears about his inability to escape his son from rubble debris, a mother is tormented as she clears the darkened body of her child. <br /> <br /> When the family returns to their rural home, Yasuko's life is forever changing. She sees her friends dying for her and waits for the inevitable attacks of radiation sickness that her uncle Shigematsu Shimuza (Kazuo Kitamura) and aunt Shigeko Shimuza (Etsuko Ichihara) have already touched. As if there were only issues as usual, the family denied that the bomb had affected Yasuko. "She forgot how Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed. Everyone forgot about it. They forgot about hell and went to an annual festival. I'm sick of it," said a friend Katayama (Akiji Kobayashi). Yasuko internalises the tragedy, feels ashamed that she is different from others and is guilty of being infected. <br /> <br /> When her aunt and uncle tried to find her husband, the eligible men refused to marry her because of her health suspicions, even though Shigematsu copied her diary to prove she not directly exposed to the bomb. The only couple she feels comfortable is another damaged man, Yuichi (Keisuke Ishida), who hears a panic attack every time he hears the roar of an engine. Eventually, the beauty of life shows itself so briefly when Yasuko goes to the dam and sees a face she longs for throughout her life, the king carp jumps into the water, playfully as if it is still despair still joy. Unfortunately, we hear the radio declarations by politicians about using the bomb again in the Korean War. "People don't learn anything," Shigematsu says. "They strangle themselves. Unfair peace is better than a war of justice. Why can't they see it?" Hopefully, Immamura's Black Rain allowed everyone of us to see more clearly.
