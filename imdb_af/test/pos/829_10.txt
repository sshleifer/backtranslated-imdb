Well, it's time! Van Damme is back and kicking in this action thriller that has been his best film in the past year. The plot is not too inventive, but the whole border patrol theme is interesting and the old marines as drug traffickers are cool. But what makes this movie wonderful is that Van Damme is going to do martial arts again. His latest films are more acting-oriented, but in "The Shepard" JCVD ​​is back to dropping the bad guys and looks great. There are a few impressive combat scenes and Van Damme shows that he can still stretch out the old, well-known 360-turn head. To be a low-budget action movie, it has good sets and good stunts. Van Damme says some humorous lines and shows that he is improving as an actor. I'm glad he's back to complete Van Damage. I was dropped by the lack of fighting in his recent films. Scott Adkins is great in his role and Van Damme and he has a 1 in 1 action at the end. Overall, this is one of Van Damme's better movies and it will entertain you. Must rent for JCVD ​​fans. I just keep my fingers crossed for another martial artist such as "Bloodsport" or "Kickboxer". Enough Su Kow!
