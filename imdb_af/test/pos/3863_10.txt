The 20th animated Disney classic is often criticized by many as "mediocre" or poor in quality, but it is a good movie. <br /> <br /> Too bad that "The Aristocats" don't get the earnings credit. I personally see it as one of my favorite Disney classics. <br /> <br /> Despite being much understated, it is one of the funniest Disney classics. It's full of hilarious (some of them hysterical) moments. <br /> <br /> Edgar, the greedy butler, is the villain of the movie, but he is a perfect comic relief. He's one of my favorite Disney villains because he's so funny. <br /> <br /> Every scene with Edgar and dog dogs Napoleon and Lafayette pursuing him is one of the screams you'll ever see, especially when Edgar drives his motorcycle in the river and around the bridge, with the dogs that chase him. It's hysterical! <br /> <br /> But the classic humor comes not only from Edgar or the dog dogs. Other characters also have their moments. <br /> <br /> It's not perfect about the quality, but it stays high. Even after Walt Disney's death, these artists knew how to keep Walt's spirit faithful and "The Aristocats" is one of the examples. They don't make them like these nowadays! <br /> <br /> As usual, legendary Disney actors play the characters. In this case we have Phil Harris, Sterling Holloway, Paul Winchell, Eva Gabor and Pat Buttram. <br /> <br /> The characters are cool in general: Thomas O'Malley, Duchess and her 3 kittens, the Roquefort mouse, the stone cats, the English geese, the dog dogs and the horse. The human characters are also included: the eccentric and friendly, performed Opera singer Madame Adelaide Bonfamille, the comedian Madame's old lawyer Georges Hautecourt and Edgar himself! <br /> <br /> Over the soundtrack it has some good and catchy songs like Thomas O'Malley's theme (but I can't remember his name), for example, "Everyone wants to be a cat" and "The Aristocats" (sung by Maurice Chevalier). <br /> <br /> This movie takes place in Paris (France), in the year 1910. Above all, it is a joyous, enjoyable and very enjoyable movie. A timeless classic that is often underestimated and forgotten, but very worthy. <br /> <br /> It should definitely be on Top 250.
