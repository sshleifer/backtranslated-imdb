I had the pleasure of seeing Saltimbanco live before I saw the video version of the show. While nothing can be compared to actually being there, the people behind the video did a wonderful job of capturing the taste, feel, sensation and so much more. The wonderful performances of Saltimbanco's amazingly wonderful troops are constantly captivated. The video flows as smoothly and artfully as the production itself. A wonderful experience.
