First, this movie is a piece of reality that is very well realized artistic. A kind of combination between "American Beauty" and "So Good as it gets". And of course something specific to all Russian films (of course the valuable one, no dirty propaganda!): The problem of loneliness of man ... Especially recommended for people who really want to see above all vomitant propaganda about communism (both positive or negative) negative propaganda!). A movie about ordinary people, their problems, lack of satisfaction - especially for little ones, fear when the right and dirty face of society ... and about the false solutions: alcohol and violence ... and probably the only true solution : true love ... Of course it is very well located in the space and time of "Russian perestroika", but it is valid for the whole society (except a perfect one but don't worry - not possible to find it on our earth!). For the last time - definitely recommended ...
