The sad thing about Frontline is that once you look at three or four episodes of it, you really start to understand that it's not far away from what happens in real life. What is really sad is that it is also very funny. <br /> <br /> The Frontline team in Serie One consists of Brian Thompson (Bruno Lawrence) - a man who truly lives and dies just by the ratings he gets. Sometimes she stunts to reach these ratings, to get him into line with his line producer Emma Thompson (Alison Whyte); a woman who has not lost all her journalism integrity and is willing to defend moral rogue on occasion. The same cannot be said of reporter Brooke Vandenberg (Jane Kennedy) - a reporter who threw all the substance out of her - so much so that she should be instructed to laugh when talking to Ben Elton. Her reports usually consist of an interview with celebrities (with whom she has already had a crossroads or not) or scandalous unethical reports that usually fire back. Martin De Stasio (Tiriel Mora) is the reporter with whom the team relies on gravitas and dignity, as he has been the journalist of 21 years of journalism behind him. She doesn't have principles as much as a nos that makes a good journalism story, though he does make the opportunity. Mike Moore (Rob Sitch) is a selfish, naive reporter who can't see that he's just a pretty face for the rough journalism. He often finds his morality compromised simply because Brian appeals to his vanity and allows his stupidity to do the rest. <br /> <br /> Frontline is the kind of show that needs more, because it shows that while in modern times, happiness, security and deep political insight are interesting things; It's much easier to estimate with scandals, fear and tabloid celebrities.
