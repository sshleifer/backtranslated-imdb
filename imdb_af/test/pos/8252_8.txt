I remember seeing this movie in the mid 80's that it was a good and well-educated piece. I work regularly at Berkeley Square and had to get a copy of DVD to remind me how little the area has changed, although my office is new, just 30 seconds from the bank. Even Jack Barclays car dealership still sells Bentleys and Rolls Royces. <br /> <br /> It looks like the DVD will soon be a region 2 edition. The region 1 copy I am very poor quality. Let's hope they cleaned it. <br /> <br /> Only the slightly dodgy escape sequence of the court that would otherwise be a good movie, but I think it is in line with the caper tag the movie goes.
