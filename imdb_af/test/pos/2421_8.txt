As a kid of the movie, I become one of the trilogues I won't soon forget about Karate Kid's. You can put Ralph / Daniel what you want, but this is the message behind the movies that are important, that it is important to respect all big and small creatures, but stand up for yourself when the time comes. Going back to the movie at hand, it's pretty funny, because I've seen Boys Do not Cry and was really impressed with the performance of Hillary Swank. The other night I knocked the sea through channels of film and I didn't realize she was in the moment of my first performance of this movie. The story centers around July, just like Daniel, without knowing where to fit or even wants to fit in and the master teacher is brought in to help her out and lead her. I really like this addition to the series as it gave a good female side to the story and yes, even some outfits that Hillary held in me, we would say stimulated. <br /> <br /> Overall 3.5 out of 5
