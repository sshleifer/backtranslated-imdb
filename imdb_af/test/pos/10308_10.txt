Regardless of the accuracy of the facts, Bandit Queen is a true story, which is true because the themes that it handles deal with so much truth today as they returned in 1994. This movie is violent, powerful and mindful. The protagonist is a woman of flesh and blood, whose misfortune brought out the best (or worst) of her. To keep aside the subjectivity, there is no doubt that Phoolan's character of a young girl of 8, married to her father to clear a guilt (pun), to a gang leader who is a leader of the lower cabinets have developed into their own right into a champion. Her depiction is so powerful that the viewer is even willing to forgive her for a bloodbath. <br /> <br /> I can understand whether the western audience can't appreciate this masterpiece, Bandit Queen should be "studied" in the Indian context, and not just stereotyped. I can't sell it on his universal appeal, but it's definitely a must see for the Indian audience. It is a pity that the film has a delayed, openly sensitized release in India. <br /> <br /> Bandit Queen is the story of a woman who fought in two occasions in India, was a woman, and her lower caste, her rebellious nature and her inability to give her, causing the most terrible experiences in life. It just made her a self-proclaimed goddess. She responded to violence by force and dint wanted the submissive female society to be. Calling it a divine righteousness or judicial failure, if she had killed a single person, if she were hanged, she killed and respected 24, respected, and glorified. <br /> <br /> PS # Those who found her character "psychotic" needed to be syndicated 8 hours, walked with 10 men and characterized naked. Then they should be asked: How normal do they feel?
