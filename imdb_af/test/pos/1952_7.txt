Pot-seeking pre-teen Joshua Miller (like Tim) throws his sister's doll in the river while Daniel Roebuck (as Samson) cries and smokes a cigarette after killing Danyi Deats (like Jamie). The doll is washed away, but the naked young woman stays at the "River's Edge", for any passerby to see. The body of the dead body is a group of twenty-something teenagers, mostly classmates of the naked look. Stoners Keanu Reeves (as Matt) and Crispin Glover (like Layne) are most worthy of camera. The friends are wondering what to do about their guilty, ferocious killer friend. <br /> <br /> Veterans-in-the-throw Dennis Hopper (as Feck) keeps the young people's heads fed. Mr. Hopper once killed a woman. He lives with one of those life-size sex dolls, with a mouth apparently ready for action. Ione Skye Leitch (as Clarissa) is a more lively doll, and she is waiting for Reeves to kiss her. Their copulation is especially cut with a jump back to the opening string. A real teen, in her first feature role, me. Leitch is the daughter of sixty-singer Donovan. Also make other exciting connections on your own. <br /> <br /> You can read a lot in the movie or not, depending on your mood. Some of the characters' backgrounds may be a bit too subtle. Mostly the killer's teenager is bothered. note his weight, posture and "toilet" connecting nickname. Some of the characters' relationships and motivation are too vaguely defined, but the throw certainly holds the material interesting. and director Tim Hunter, photographer Frederick Elmes, and author Neal Jimenez is of course skilled. <br /> <br /> ******* River's Edge (8/27/86) Tim Hunter ~ Keanu Reeves, Crispin Glover, Dennis Hopper, Joshua Miller
