It was a fantastic written script when it comes to observing things from a different perspective. The comedy was timely and not overdoing, the acting was generally great, and the plot line created a greater purpose to create misconception when we think of people based solely on their outward appearance. The plot turns as Amanda Bynes' brother / sister character tries to play soccer on the boy team, and finds a new love interest on the way. Tatum Channing is where the real misconception lies and he does a good job of being actively involved, later to realize the most important thing in life, is friendship, not attitude.
