I see there are already good reviews of this movie, I have a few points to comment, reasons I thought there was something special about this movie ... <br /> <br /> First, the movie is realistic. It may not seem realistic for an adult who has forgotten what it was like to be a teenager, but it is actually the kind of super drama that is happening to teenagers all the time. Secondly, the good guy, the man who treats women with respect, doesn't get the girls. this is the way it is, in real life just like that! He is too good for his own good. people are just selfish. In the third place it was nice to see a fat man who had confidence. I mean, the role takes all the actor's confidence, I'm not just talking about the character. Overall, I thought the movie was a positive surprise that secretly hides between wacky, party's teen sex comedies at the rental shelter. Don't get me wrong, it's not a pity, it's also a good laugh.
