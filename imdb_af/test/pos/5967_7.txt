I missed the start of the movie. I came in when the party was in the farm. I can honestly say it was scary. The moral consequences are staggering. <br /> <br /> My fear of pain and torture does not allow me to see myself as cowardly. I see the Christ as ability portrayed by the brave patriot, and I can only pray that I could or would have the moral turpitude to follow his example. <br /> <br /> I see a major theme of the movie being the weakness / strength of the torture, but a dishonest decision. Even though the soul of man can be so distorted that pain and suffering are being dealt with on a fellow man, somehow it is satisfactory. Be spiritual or physical. <br /> <br /> I got a lot of thoughts about the movie.
