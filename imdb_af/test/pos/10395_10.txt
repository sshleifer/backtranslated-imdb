I was amazed by this movie. Then I didn't even see movies for a long time. Any other movie would be so unsatisfactory. <br /> <br /> For many, it may be the worst Antonie-very slow, without an engaging conventional story line, microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions - and the worst Wenders-verbose, confused transcendentalism. It consists of short separate episodes linked to Wender's typical winding hero's consciousness movement. This does not cause the temporary oblivion of the escapist theater. <br /> <br /> But for fans, the worst is the best and the Fit Storyline outlines a single poetic image stretching over the movie. Wenders and Antonioni create a discourse between their segments that work out the heart of things. <br /> <br />
