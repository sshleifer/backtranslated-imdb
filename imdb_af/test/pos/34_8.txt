Lackawanna Blues is a touch of Nanny, a woman who gives herself to help people in need. It is told from the point of view of a boy who is imported by Nanny if his own mother is not really the job. <br /> <br /> I respect this movie for three main reasons: 1) It touches but not juicy. It is being told in a very real way, without much of the worsening story telling tricks in Hollywood. And the end is pretty good (teary but not over). <br /> <br /> 2) While clearly an African American movie, in the post-segregation-black community of Lackawanna, New York, it does not carry its ethnicity. The story is about the strength of the characters and the dramas (and comedies) around their lives. It is not preaching, it is good. <br /> <br /> 3) It has a good soundtrack (can't beat old school R&B and Chicago blues). <br /> <br /> In general, the play is strong but not universal. Some of the performances simply don't stick to the characters the actors supposed to portray. But it was a TV movie that can be expected. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Imperfect but nice, good movie for a rainy day.
