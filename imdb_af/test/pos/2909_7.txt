One cannot help but be impressed with the intelligence and scale of this film, and at the same time disappointed by the lost opportunities. <br /> <br /> I found the writing excellent, and Edmund Purdom's vocal talent quite impressive. As an artefact of his time, however, the film has too many Hollywood isms, especially poor casts, too much laziness of sets, and too much pretentiousness. Edmund Purdom (who plays the title character) is so uncomfortable with physical acting. I suspect he was previously in the Shakespeare theater. <br /> <br /> So if the movie reads it, I propose it as an excellent candidate for a remake, especially if you throw genuine Egyptians as Egyptians!
