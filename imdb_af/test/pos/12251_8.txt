It's a love story set against the backdrop of television news. The three main stars, William Hurt, Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle while working at the Washington desk of a TV network. <br /> <br /> Tom Grunick (Hurt) is the handsome reporter who cares for being a star. Jane (Hunter) is the producer who admits that Tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a true journalist, but falls for him anyway. Alon Altman (Brooks) is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards, also the man who really loves her. <br /> <br /> Holly Hunter was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award, but lost to Cher (Moonstruck!). She was robbed! This is Hunter's movie. Her character Jane is smart, relentless and completely driven. She is also hilariously neurotic. Her performance is perfect. Just look at her face as she looks at Tom's interview of a rape victim. The scales literally fall from her eyes. <br /> <br /> Wiliam Hurt's show is less showy. He plays a man who is well-aware that he is a gay and cheating, but is smart enough to know that she will be emerging. is facilitated by people like Jane. He gives little hints from a man who calculates extremely. <br /> <br /> The film's comment on celebrity, journalism, integrity, and commercial pressure on news in a medium on the bottom line. It predicted that the news would be obscured, that standards would slow slowly due to commercial pressure. <br /> <br /> Think about this: this movie was released before the end of the Cold War and before the rise of reality TV. However, the prediction of the news predicted. Paris Hilton's release from prison has been treated as a great news story! To see how prophetic this movie is, just look at your evening news and watch the set, the graphics and the presenters. Tom Grunick and his clones live well and truly!
