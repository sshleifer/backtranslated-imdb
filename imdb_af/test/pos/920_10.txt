The biggest movie ever. <br /> <br /> What kind of strife is this? However, if we only consider pure cinematic terms, it is clear that Three Colors Red is a masterpiece. It's not enough to just say it. Three colors of red are the masterpiece of world cinema. If you assume that Citizen Kane is not human enough, if you assume Star Wars is not really good, assuming Ozu and Mizoguchi both have to take a step back - then Three Colors Red is the leading masterpiece of all times. As a discussion in human morality, Three Colors Red works at an intense metaphysical level, with a depth that no one can match. Blue went almost as far into the human psyche, but stopped because it would pull the rabbit out of the hat. White forced us to reflect on the humanity of equality - it was even better in retrospect, but still not quite there. However, red is the right thing. What he expresses in this movie is an expression of what it is to be human. In fact, what he expresses is how it feels to be human. It forces us to examine the smallest details, the nature of our souls, of our ethical self. In Red one can find meaning at one of its different levels. On the first level, Red reaches a high level of veracity - we can't bother to call Red a particularly entertaining story. But the coincidences inherent in the film and its expectations force us to investigate the movie as a movie. It's like Kieslowski says, "Ceci n'est pas la regionalite". In fact, in pursuit of a humanistic goal, Kieslowski can also challenge reality. It's a trick that Kieslowski has been trying since Le Double Vie de Veronique, but not to his final film, eventually reaching this divine entanglement of fate, philosophy and circumstances. The actors and actresses also show grace of greater strength. Valentine (Irène Jacob) is appropriately named, as it seems to represent an almost pure love. Meanwhile, the idea of ​​first impressions is challenged by Jean-Louis Tritignant's Judge Kern, a cantanker who eventually becomes an almost all-knowing observer of events - a character that has the symbolic power to bring characters together - a force for people happy, a force he could only reach by Valentine. <br /> <br /> We have the ability to watch movies more than just a series of pictures. In fact, movies have the potential to have more meaning than literature. Of course, this will not happen, but at least we have the power to see this film because we know it gives us the power to achieve something that we cannot define, but all possess. An overview of this movie read: A movie about a woman walking over a dog. Well, this is. <br /> <br /> Isn't it? <br /> <br /> -Simon Huxtable <br /> <br />
