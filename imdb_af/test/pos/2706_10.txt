Being an avid Carpenter Fan, I really loved this movie (although the wigs leave much to be desired!) And agree with many of the comments that some parts of her life were absent or untouched. Whatever - this makes your curiosity good and really dissatisfied, so I discovered more. I must recommend a book by Ray Coleman - Carpenters - The Untold Story. The book is an intelligent read and unlike the movie, it is 'really' and on earth. I hope you enjoy it. I remember Cynthia Gibb from her days in Fame and Gypsy. She is a singer (as well as a dancer) in her own right and I think it was the edge that was needed to create the character. Some other actresses struggled with this. It is breathtaking, the film did not dig deeper into her story. After all this is the title of the movie, but I felt we had learned more about Richard, but I suppose everyone who deserves salt to them always wants them!
