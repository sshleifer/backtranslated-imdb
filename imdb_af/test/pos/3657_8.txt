Hari Om is about an impossible love between a French tourist and the car rickshaw driver who agrees to take her to a rendezvous with an indifferent boyfriend. A kind of third-world road movie, which cares about sumptuous reverie to madcap comedy, is characterized by the star performance of Vijay Raaz, who became one of India's busiest actors after his appearance as the event planner in Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding. <br /> <br /> In an interview, Raaz appears to be very unaffected by his success, and reacts carefully and painfully to questions. He discovered a love of acting and joined a large theater group while in college, but for one with so much formal training, he is surprisingly irrelevant about his craft. He speaks of honesty and purity as the source of his approach, and the seriousness of his desire to communicate something good to the audience is clear. On the screen, Raaz carries an emotional integrity and dramatic assurance that elevates his characterization to an extraordinary level, and director Bharatbala has thrown him perfectly. He has a wonderful expressive face with which the camera enters; close-ups of that face are as compelling as shots of Camille Natta, which is wonderful as the French woman Isa.
