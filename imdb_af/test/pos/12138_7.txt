To attract 2.6 million viewers, one has to wonder what everyone's views on the storyline / plot are. <br /> <br /> The end of the lifetime has led to the belief that it is an edge-of-the-seat thrill over a single mother who stalked and eventually confronted the stalker. Unfortunately I was wrong. While the main tomb is interesting enough - single mother, one night, running off the road, then he is knocked by the same man. The reasoning behind the stalking has left nothing but a very bad taste in my mouth. <br /> <br /> Laura Leighton is the victim and she is doing well. Whether it's been on Melrose Place for years or not, she's doing well in this movie, playing a mother doing anything to protect her son from harm, and she looks pretty good today. <br /> <br /> Leighton is really the only good thing about this movie. I think many people will identify with the main characters after they have discovered why the stalker is stalking, but it will be a once only view.
