This movie is just as nice. It's funny like hell and as old as the hills. The acting is wonderful and it is fascinating to see post-war Britain and how we wore in those days. It looks like it was a forerunner to the St Trinians movies (given the Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford connection - there is also a very young George Cole who appeared in many St Trinians movies), but I understand Not even the connection. It was recently shown on BBC4, after a biography of St Trine's creator Ronald Searle, but I missed the biography enough to miss the connection with this movie. Anyway a good movie in its own right and something that must be preserved forever!
