Thinking of 'Oliver Stone' will be the major films that will be his biggest and most controversial, such as Platoon, JFK, Born on the 4th of July, or Natural Born Killers. Talk Radio usually doesn't. It's actually a small movie. More than half of the film takes place with Barry Champlain at his radio station talking to him. But believe me, this is one of Oliver Stone's biggest movies and should NOT be missed. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a character study. Barry Champlain is a rude, self-destructive, radio station presenter who speaks too much and gets in trouble with his boss, his lover (s), his fans and even a few Nazis. He does not like his audience and callers, and many of them do not like him (it is or likes him, but has no idea why). But in the end he says on his performance: "I think we're stuck with each other." <br /> <br /> See Talk Radio, even if you don't like Oliver Stone movies. You may be surprised. I was sure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
