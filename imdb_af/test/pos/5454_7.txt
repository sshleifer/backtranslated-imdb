I read the book written by Bill Carter on which this movie was based many years ago. The book is definitely stronger than the movie. It offers more detail than a movie might offer, and the end result is that I thought the movie looked a bit sketchy on a handful of items. All the things considered, and the limitations of the medium, offer the movie a perfect and informative version of the battle between Jay Leno and David Letterman in the early 90's to host the Tonight Show after Johnny Carson retired. <br /> <br /> The highlight is clearly the performances. I can't think of an actor anymore, but to play a character that is still alive and well-known and on television regularly. John Michael Higgins left the part of Letterman perfectly. Looking at him was like watching Letterman. Daniel Roebuck bravely tried to be Jay Leno, but didn't pull it off so effectively. His whole "look" was like, and he just didn't look in the roll. In a less central role, Rich Little did not marvel at Carson's characters, although the appearance was slightly down. In the book, the most interesting of the central figures was probably Leno's agent, Helen Kushnick. In the film, Kathy Bates was perfectly in the role, though not completely out of control, like Carter's depiction of the woman in writing. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's light and entertaining. The subject is not very important in the overall scheme of things, but it's a pleasure behind the scenes, looking at an unforgettable time in the entertainment industry. 10/07
