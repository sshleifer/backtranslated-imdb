It's a jewel. As a Film Four production - the expected quality was indeed delivered. Great style shot that reminded me of Errol Morris movies, well arranged and just gripping. It's been frightening for a long time to the point that it's rude. We know something is going bad (one can guess due to lack of participation of a person in the interviews), but we are obliged to see it, like a car accident in slow motion. The story spans most conceivable aspects and, unlike some documentaries, they have not tried to withhold the gripping sides of the stories, but also to wonder about the guilt of the people he left behind. It took me a few hours to get out of the melancholy that grabbed me after I saw this very well-made documentary.
