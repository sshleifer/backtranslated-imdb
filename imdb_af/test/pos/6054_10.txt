I'll buy it and "Thirty Seconds About Toyko" if available. I also watched this movie after seeing Jack Webb in his Dress Blues on the highway at age 12. He admired Jack Weeb as a John Wayne type and American. Almost has become a marine just because of this movie, but has served 32 years in the Air Force, Air Force Reserve and Army Reserve. I didn't see this movie on TV at all and would like to own it on DVD. At least if it was on TV, I would copy it to VHS and use it until available on DVD. I also have a large collection of World War II and Korean War Movies and always look at new issues on DVD.
