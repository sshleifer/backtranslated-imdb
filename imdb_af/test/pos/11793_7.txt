ALICE is the kind of movie they made in the 30's and 40's. Never try to be an "event". Just want to entertain. And do it. I was surprised by Kiefer Sutherland. In a role that could be a cliche, he really made it. The plot speaks to ALICE IN WONDERLAND. A man dressed in white goes through a hole and Kiefer falls one. Like ALICE, the plot turns and turns, but with a freshness you don't see in small movies. I loved the direction, Sutherland, just a very fast and interesting movie.
