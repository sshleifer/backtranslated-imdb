"Out to Sea" is a fun movie with the wonderful duo of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. This movie is not quite as funny as their "Grumpy Old Men" comedies (which look very much), but there is a lot of laughter. Lemmon and Matthau play a couple of in-laws who go with each other. As soon as they arrive on the boat, the thing Lemmon doesn't know is that Matthau signed them as dance hosts, so they shouldn't pay for the cruise. It infuriates Lemmon who is not in the mood to dance. What's worse, Matthau doesn't even know how to dance. Nonetheless, they go along with it and this is the process of meeting their fellow passengers and crew members. Here are the crew members: there is the cross director Gil Godwyn, played by "Star Trek: The Next Generation" veteran Brent Spiner, acting like an evil dictator. There are two fellow dance hosts, starred by star Hal Linden and veteran movie star Donald O'Connor. There is the owner of the ship, Mrs. Carruthers, played by the "Golden Girl" Rue McClanahan. As for the passengers, there is Vivian, a widow played by Gloria De Haven, who falls in love with Lemmon. There is Liz, played by one of my all-time favorite actresses, Dyan Cannon, who falls in love with Matthau. There is Mavis, Liz's mother, played by veteran actor Elaine Stritch. And they also meet others. All these actors are a pleasure to watch as Lemmon and Matthau play from them. It's nice to see Cannon here, look beautiful as ever; Stritch is a hoot; Spiner is a funny comic villain who plays it deadly straight; The harbor is wonderful; Linden, O'Connor and McClanahan have a good moment or two; And finally, the two main stars, Lemmon and Matthau, are fine as usual. A fun jewel of a comedy. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
