It is a well-crafted piece of everyone's favorite master of tension. As usual, the technical elements such as camera work and lighting are outstanding (especially for the movie's time). I didn't find the first part of the movie very exciting, but the latter definitely made it to one another with one exciting scene. <br /> <br /> The only thing I didn't have about this movie was choosing Farley Granger for part of Guy Haines. Somehow I didn't find him very credible. On the other hand, Robert Walker, as a sinister, shines bad old Bruno Anthony. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would highly recommend it.
