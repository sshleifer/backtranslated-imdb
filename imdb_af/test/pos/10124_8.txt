Inspired by true events, Radio is one of the best activated, heart-like dramas I've ever seen in free time. It's definitely one of the year's best films of 2003. <br /> <br /> However, radio stars Ed Harris, who are worthy of Oscar, are in this movie, as soccer coach, Harold Jones. Coach Jones taught all his life about football and loves the game. However, Coach Jones doesn't spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew. One day Radio, played by Cuba Gooding Jr., in his best performance since Men of Honor, comes through the soccer field while the coach's team practices for the match. Some members of the team then connect the radio and throw it into a building. They then hit the building and eventually Coach Jones suspected something was wrong. He comes over and helps Radio, who is scared, and from then on, Coach Jones and Radio share a very special band. Radio becomes the highlight of every soccer match and really enjoys participating in soccer matches and at school events. He also became Coach Jones's greatest interest in life about football, which was initially his main priority for both his family and Radio. <br /> <br /> The film deals with all kinds of real-life problems, including your priorities, acceptance of people for whom they are, even if they are different, dead and family relationships. The movie touches all the issues and more and is very well done and director Michael Tollin must be very proud of this movie. The thing I liked most about Radio was how really it felt. The performances were like seeing something in real life before your eyes. Radio had a good combination of comedy and drama. Some parts were rather funny, but other parts were very serious and sad. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I feel that Radio has been overlooked by critics just to get an average review. They should have heads up there because it's amazing how this movie can only get 2 star reviews and like rock school can get 3 or 4 stars, it doesn't make sense to me. The representations I have mentioned before are also top not worthy. In my opinion, both Ed Harris, who I think is underestimated as an actor, and Cuba Gooding Jr. should be some sort of nomination for this movie. Radio is one of my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to see more of the big Hollywood movies. My final rating for Radio is a 9/10.
