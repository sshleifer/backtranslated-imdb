I am very surprised that so many people do not like this movie. I think it's much better than most of the recent teenage movies. - Ten things I hate about you (can our teenager movie say, and what was the principle of writing porn novels?), Cruel intentions (where a character expresses their virginity due to a fun car ride) , and she's all so (mediocre). If you're looking for something just fun - say I'm going to Never Kissed. My mom loved it and she hates movies (one of her favorites is BEACHES). This is a wonderful fantasy about what you would do differently if you could go back to high school. High school people are likely to find this movie better. It reminds me of 'Romy and Michele's High School Reunion'. And the end brings me into the best mood. Certainly, the plot was done, but how many recent movies can you honestly say is not done in one form or another. The cast is also charming. And for those who think Drew can't be geeky, she just pulls it off well. Another good teenage comedy I recently suggested is ELECTION, but it's more of a satire at school and politics.
