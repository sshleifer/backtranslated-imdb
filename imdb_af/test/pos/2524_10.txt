The story takes place on the streets of Sao Paoulo in Brazil, where a young boy named Pixote grows up alone without his parents. As if she were in the accident, Pixote fell into the street with other adolescents in a child's breath. Behind closed doors, terrible things occur within the staff and within the children's groups. And there is one last trigger that inflated the place, the last incident that made Pixote and his friends decide to break out and escape. From there, a journey begins to overwhelm with strong bound friendships, torn apart friendships, love and hatred, criminal activities, and just on the beach cold talking about things, something somebody like you and me sometimes do. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is in so many ways perfect because it touches so many levels, it did it anyway. The documentary style depicting Pixote and its surroundings looks more realistic, and the actors, who are really street children and have lived similar lives, help mankind in the more natural circumstances. It also has a social comment on child abuse, but I think what makes the movie so great is that the pressure is on the story and not on the political views. The last scene, which I get the best part of the movie, strikes me as something I haven't seen before. So full of emotions and yet so unimaginative, this film makes a true, credible, unbearable, memorable story. A real heartbreaking masterpiece that has been so understated! <br /> <br /> My voice: 10/10
