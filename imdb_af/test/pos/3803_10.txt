Although this film has never gained commercial fame, my experience has led me to conclude that many well-done pieces of artistic expression often do not receive mass appeal. The story line depicts a young boy stealing a car and starting on a surreal, dream-like adventure with very little foundation in our conceptualization of time and space. Therefore, anyone trying to see this film from the point of view of conformity with reality is likely to be disappointed; It is not meant to be "realistic". However, it is meant to be metaphorical with an extended symbolism that is evident to those with beautiful attention to detail. In addition, the symbolic representations are left open for interpretation, which can be said of very good works of art. Don't be fooled by the cover (if you rent or buy this movie) - the movie is not what it looks like on the surface.
