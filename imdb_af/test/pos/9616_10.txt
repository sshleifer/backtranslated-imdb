Well as a lifelong fan of Kung Fu movies, I have to say this is one of the best I've ever seen. Certainly there is nothing special about the plot, but man is entertaining it. Like most movies of the genre. This movie is full of action and doesn't like its viewers. It's so damn fun when I look, I've always had a smile on my face. It also has an impact on future movies like Kill Bill. (For example, many of Kill Bill's sound effects come from this movie.) It is essential to see everyone who knew Kung Fu viewers. Open form to close this movie is filled with battles that are really some of the better ones I've seen in the genre. There are a few Kung Fu movies out there that measure the sheer magic and entertainment of this movie. So if you're looking for a Big Kung Fu movie, it sure will.
