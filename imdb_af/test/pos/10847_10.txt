Both the book and the film are excellent in their own right. They differ slightly, but it increases and detracts from what is an excellent writing and acting. The historic atmosphere, the young girl looking for love, the wonderful backdrop to the music hall and the journey to the lesbian world of London in the early twentieth century, make it an exceptional movie. Andrew Davies as the screenwriter subscribes to himself writing this lesbian love story with such sensitivity. Rachael Sterling and Keeley Hawes are both excellent actresses and give them the best. The rest of the cast is very good. If there were more than 10 out of 10, I'd give it!
