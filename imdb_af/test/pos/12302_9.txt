John Huston, actor and director, better known for more robust rates like The Misfits and African Queen, directs his daughter, Angelica Huston, to be his last film. Indeed, the film was released after Huston's death. Based on James Joyce's novel of the same name, the "Dead" tells the quiet story of a New Year's party in 1904 Dublin. Huston, his film and his screenwriters, including his son Tony, created a jewel of a movie. The novella is one of Joyce's best works (and is the only one that is filmable). The film is a tribute to Huston's genius. He took a small, beautiful story and made a small, beautiful film. Donal McCann and Angelica Huston shine (though "shine" is too beautiful to flash a word to describe their silent, understated achievements). "The Dead" reflects the Huston family's love for Ireland and is, in its own quiet way, an appropriate final movie for a legend.
