If you like Madonna or not, this movie is hilarious !! I am a Madonna fan and have seen it in the theater at the time of his release. But over time it did not lose its folly and pure fun. Certainly there are some bad lines and cheese activities, but the whole movie is just a screw-ball comedy with Madonna that actually bears the whole movie with great bombing. She is cute, funny and is the only comical role of her film career. Madonna usually plays herself in roles, but looks at her as Nikki Finn in this movie. She really looks like somebody else for once. Of course, the film was directed by James Foley (who filmed the dramatic and haunting 'At Close Range' with Sean Penn and Christopher Walken) and co-star Griffin dunn ('After Hours') who also brilliantly threw and delighted with the material. . The story is not genius and does not expect the climate to end, but if you are ever in the mood to watch a pleasure, clean, 80-skirt or if you are a Madonna fan, you should see it. The Soundtrack is also very striking and contains 4 Madonna songs: the # 1 hit "Who's That Girl", the # 2 riot trigger and the beautiful and one of her best ballads "The Look of Love" 10 Hit in the UK) and the "Can Stop" a remaining pop of the True Blue sessions this year. It's just on VHS, but will soon be available on DVD.
