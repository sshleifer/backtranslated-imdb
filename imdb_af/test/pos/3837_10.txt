I really enjoyed this movie and I usually don't like animated photos. But I thought the cats were attractive and the story line was beautiful. There's a good song called "Everyone wants to be a cat," it's a lot of fun. It has some comic moments and is an interesting adventure. I think it helps to be an avid cat lover to enjoy this movie.
