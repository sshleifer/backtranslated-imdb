This review was written by someone who read it (several times) and knew what they were talking about. First, I commented on others and noted that some of the objections were really stupid. People who have read the book and other Jane Austens or any good book will know that it is important to trust a writer with what they do. If the viewer does not like it because it bumps the book well, it shows that they do not understand Jane Austen and is of course not a true fan. <br /> <br /> First, if the viewer really loved the book or Jane Austen general, watch it for four hours shouldn't be difficult. Secondly, their society has practiced a lot of looks and so big, fancy hairstyles will show how rich you were, which in their day was an important factor in joining the "good" society. I must confess that the female costumes were not brilliant, but there were only a few bad people and the men made it up. Also, this prejudice for the Navy who is not in their uniform is very stupid in beautiful words! Today people are not going out with their uniform away from school or work because they have comfortable clothes and it was just the same in the 19th century. Even as it goes, the play is very good, it's subtle, because that's how Jayne Austen writes! and the scene at the end is beautiful. You can't compare the filming to that of the 1995 version, as technology has improved so much since it's ridiculous to compare it to it. The actress Ann plays is too old, but her air of acting and how she does it right. <br /> <br /> People seem to prefer the 1995 version for some reason I can't understand! It doesn't quite keep up with the book and so is flat, the end is sentimental, they change big scenes, the only good actors are the lead and the ones I give have done a good job for what has been given to them. Obviously, the people who really like it are sorry because they don't understand persuasion and therefore have to overdo it. The 1971 version is beautiful, romantic, written by an excellent scriptwriter (the same Inspector Morse did), had many good actors and really it is a movie you can watch many times and during each of them you can look forward to it .
