I don't understand how people couldn't keep this movie. You've got Gossit Jr., the kid who starred in Stand By Me, Sean Astin, and many other great actors. Lots of action and fun you won't see in today's movies. It's really a shame. <br /> <br /> This is an underrated movie that is, among other things, a movie like Let's Get Harry. The 80's and early 90's created such a great movie that will never be filled by today's standards. <br /> <br /> Somehow they tried to recreate this movie in Masterminds, but came short with a very bad play. The only thing the movie was about was Patrick Stewart, but of course that wasn't enough.
