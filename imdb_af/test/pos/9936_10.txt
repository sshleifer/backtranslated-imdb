"Opera" is a wonderful movie with a wonderful, imaginative image. An opera singer (Cristina Marsillach) is bumped by a murderer forcing him to kill everyone who knows her by tying her tight and sewing needles under her eyes. The needles come from the fact that Argento does not like it when people cover their eyes while watching his movies. "For years I have been very annoyed by people covering their eyes during the greedy moments in my movies. I film these images because I want people to see them and not avoid the positive confrontation of their fears by looking away. So I thought to myself: "How would it be possible to achieve this and force someone to see the most horrific murder and make sure they can't prevent them from seeing eyes? "The answer I have gained is at the heart of what" Opera "is about." - Tell Argento. Lots of tension, wonderful cinematography and brutal, greedy murders. One man is thrown into the throat with a knife that causes a throat wound, Daria Nicolodi is shot in the eye while l is also pierced through the viewing hole. For anyone who hasn't caught this one, try it.
