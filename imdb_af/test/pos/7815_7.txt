A minute to pray, a second to die for is a quality spaghetti western with a solid saucepan and an interesting story. It's beautifully filmed, with a relatively high production value for a movie in this genre. <br /> <br /> Alex Cord is doing a tremendous job depicting Clay McCord, a ban on increasing attacks. He's looking for amnesty before his enemies are closer to him, but is too tough for his own good when he asks. Robert Ryan performs the best performance in the film as New Mexico's governor. Mario Brega and Arthur Kennedy are also wonderful here. <br /> <br /> This movie is very good, but it doesn't look like one of the best spaghetti westerns out there. It lacks too much in style to be in the same league as any of the big ones. It does have a bit of spaghetti earrings, but overall it's a little too much like an American western. This is especially evident in the music party, which is good for movies in general, but rather sowing by euro-western standards. The soundtrack kind of reminds me of the music of "The Unforgiven." Although there is an interesting story here, it is told in a way that is a little too conventional for my taste. If a spaghetti western fan and a Hollywood western fan had to watch a movie together, that would be the perfect compromise. <br /> <br /> All this is not to say anyone should avoid this movie. I enjoyed watching it a lot. As I said, this is a very good movie and I recommend it to anyone who likes western, spaghetti or other.
