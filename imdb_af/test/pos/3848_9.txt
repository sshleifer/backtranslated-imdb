The Aristocats are really very charming, and are much too low on IMDb. The songs are not as memorable as those in the Jungle Book, but they were not bad at all. The animation is really lovely, the best order is the landscape of Paris in general. It looks nice. This is probably Disney's most relaxing animation I think, and as another reviewer rightly said, who doesn't like cats? Another big piece of animation was O 'Malley looking in the eyes of Duchess's eyes, because their romance was so credible while it wasn't obvious. The plot (about a greedy butler and a fortune reminds me of Bailey's Billions) was a bit unpredictable, but worked very well, and the writing was very funny, especially the fighting between the kittens. They remind me of my brother and 3 sisters, always fighting. My favorite scene was the hunting of Edgar with the two dogs, who always fight over who was the leader. The voice talents were a joy, especially Phil Harris, whom I recognized from the Jungle Book, and Eva Gabor, from the Rescuers. The supporting characters, Scat Cat, were also well done. Finally, a very pleasant film, which is definitely underestimated. 8.5 / 10 Bethany Cox
