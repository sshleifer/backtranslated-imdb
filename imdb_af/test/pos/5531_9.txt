It is not always certain that you will laugh with the comedians together. The comic strips in question must actually hold or admire each other or be prepared to solve each other's illness. Go WES with Marx brothers, Buster Keaton, write the script as a gag-man. Groucho did not think too strongly about Keaton's ideas and embarrassed him on a mini-dissertation. And although some of Keaton's jewelery still appears in the final movie (like the gun that changes into a brush, it becomes a gun). The film was one of the worst Marx brothers ever made. <br /> <br /> A better movie, but also affected by the awarding of comic egos, was toilet Velden and Mae West in MY LITTLE CHICKADEE, which enlarged the script for a series of duels of one liners between the clues . But the one linen was equally funny, so the movie remains a success. <br /> <br /> But SIX OF A KIND is an example of six films that worked well together. The reason is simple: it's really three comic teams that work together: Charlie Ruggles and Mary Boland, George Burns and Gracie Allan, and W.C. Field and Alison Skipworth. Ruggles and Boland were combined in about half of a dozen comedies during the 1930s, usually with Boland as a bit of bossy woman, and Ruggles as a man's nerve wreck. Velds (usually a single act) were three times with Skipworth (TILLY AND GUS and IF I HAD A MILLION were the other two). Skippy always figured out how to control or counteract her husband's larcenous activities - it's the current movie she's in her own hands with the stolen money being sought (she knows that the local sheriff, Fields, doesn't one is not to trust it). As far as Burns and Allan are concerned, they manage to effortlessly engage themselves with the Ruggles and Boland at their intersection with the car. <br /> <br /> Ruggles soon realizes what is a mistake to travel with Gracie - at one stage she manages to fall off a cliff and hang from a branch. He is relatively helpless when she insists on 1) photographing him on his seat, and 2) correcting his grammar. The presence of George and Gracie's humongous dog ("Ran Tang Tang" is the name) doesn't make arrangements for Charlie and Mary easier. <br /> <br /> Fields have a few choices. If he insists on shouting at the quartet, he says he can do it - he's the sheriff! He also explains during a pool game the unlikely story of how he got his undeserved moniker "Honest John". You have to listen carefully to the story because it is interrupted with its attempts to play a pool a few times (once accidentally played by a billiard ball), but it does show that there were items that even Fields had no reason to had to steal. <br /> <br /> Oh, in the "Summary Line" I called a forgotten actor called Bradley Page - he was the man responsible for the problems Charley Ruggles suspects. Bradley must have a reason to leave town to catch up with indifferent Ruggles and Boland, so he calls his girlfriend friend. He tells her to call back his work and say he has to leave town because someone is dead. There is a break because he apparently hears a question shot by the girl. "ANYBODY!", He says - clearly irritated. Although most of the humor in the film is worn by the sextet artists, Mr.Page had the most surprising line in the movie.
