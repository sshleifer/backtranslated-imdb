Recently I watched this movie again (after 25 years). In the original there is a scene in the bathroom of an airplane during the landing between Jacqueline Bisset's character and Michael Brandon's character. The rented version did not have this scene in it. Did I introduce it? <br /> <br /> Is this part of movie cleaning where some are being changed to exclude portions that some people aren't "fit" for? <br /> <br /> I love this movie - it's exactly like the friendship between a friend and I have been friends for 25 years and saw it together. Her husband thought it was us too. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Joan
