I saw The Couch Trip (1988) last night on late night television and immediately fell in love. The funny thing is that I usually catch all the comedies, but have never heard of this one until I saw it. Dan Ackroyd is a simple and simple hillarious period. He made some good movies with Belushi and don't forget Saturday Night Live. But I think the Couch Trip is probably its best and funniest. With a good supporting film by Charles Grodin, David Clennon, and Walter Matthau, this piece of cinema shines with comic gold. Ackroyd's wife, Donna Dixxon, even does a good job here. My favorite moments of the film include Ackroyd and David Clennon's characters Lawrence Baird. These two played well together. So if you haven't seen a good comedy in disaster, take a trip back to 1988 and rent or buy The Couch Trip. I just did, Amazon 78 cents. What a bargain, bad, I hit with a 2.50 shipping fee. Oh, it's still worth it. Anybody will love this movie.
