One night, bartender Randy (Matt Dillon) saves Jewel (Liv Tyler) from her jealous boyfriend Utah (Andrew Dice Clay). He took Jewel to his house. But Utah comes back and wants Randy to open the safe at Mc Cool's. Suddenly a shot - Utah is dead. Then ... ... I'd better stop here to tell the plot. It's like explaining the story of "Wild Things". What I found so interesting was the fact that the plot (written by Stan Seidel, his first and last work - he died in July last year ...) is from 3 perspectives - the 3 men who fall for Jewel . All of them see her from different eyes - like John Goodman as the detective, who falls in love with her because she's remembered his dead wife. <br /> <br /> No wonder the guys fall for her! Liv Tyler - she's a real gem. She made the big screen shine! She played her role as if she were in a 40's noir thriller. Sweet - but at the same time she was the cool vampire walking over the dead and using the men for her needs. And of course, Michael Douglas. How could I forget him? Mr. Burmeister, the Bingo killer - he was cool! <br /> <br /> But in the last 10 minutes there was a little too much stick for my taste - it weakened the atmosphere. That part started when Paul Reiser (like Randy's cousin Carl) sat on his leather skirt for Jewel. The "YMCA" song didn't fit that much ... ... but altogether, "One night at Mc Cool's" is a nice COOL movie noir parody! <br /> <br />
