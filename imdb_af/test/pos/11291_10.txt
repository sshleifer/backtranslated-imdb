I first heard from Begotten when a girl picked me up in a "cult classic" section of my local video retailer. She knew I liked artsy movies, so I rented them and brought them home. It sat on my TV for a few days and then I just put it in the video recorder before going to sleep. I thought I might be seeing it for the first time and then spending more time next day. What followed was that it really woke me up. I sat through the whole movie and loved it. After I went through the final credits, I looked at it again. Only after seeing the final credits will you get an idea of ​​who's who. After you know you can see it again with new appreciation. Don't listen to the people tearing this movie apart. It's not for everyone. If you are someone who does not like to read captions, then this movie is not for you (not that there are captions, there is no dialogue at all). If you are someone who actually owns Rush Hour 2, this movie is not for you. <br /> <br /> This movie is truly original and inspirational. It does what other movies have never done. It doesn't look anything else and is brave than just about everything out there - from 1989 to the current date. You can say that everyone involved in making this movie really loves the art of what they do and understands what can be captured in film form. <br /> <br /> If you want to be "entertainment" then the movie is not for you. However, this is in extreme terms and in film form pure escapism. It's like someone who ties wires to my head and ties one of my worst nightmares. But this nightmare makes sense if you really sit and watch the images, analyze the action of the actors and do not watch your guitar passively, but look and shine. <br /> <br /> People compare it to Eraserhead but Begotten is so much more. I'm not joking when I say it's my favorite movie. It is an important film, visually stimulating, mechanically inspiring, and hypnotic. However, one review I read about this is very true, "no one will be born without being marked."
