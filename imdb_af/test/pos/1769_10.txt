Pavarotti and the entire film are excellent in this beautifully filmed opera by Giuseppe Verdi, the world's best composer of operas. The coloratura soprano is particularly spectacular with its perfect pitch. The title role is well enacted and sung. The whole production is as perfect as you can expect. <br /> <br /> A masterpiece of cinematography! <br /> <br />
