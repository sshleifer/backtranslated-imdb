One of my absolute favorite children's films. The Chipmunk Adventure packs amazing fun for young and old. The animation is vibrant and colorful and the movie itself boasts some of the best songs ever placed in an animated feature. Who can forget the dynamic "Boys / Girls of Rock n Roll", the exciting "Diamond Dolls" and the heartbreaking "My Mother"? <br /> <br /> It should be considered a nostalgic classic animated jewel of the eighties. It's too bad, they don't make them like this anymore. Most animation films today use violence, rough humor or sentimental mush ... except of course the people of Pixar. <br /> <br /> BOTTOM LINE: A wonderful and memorable adventure for all ages.
