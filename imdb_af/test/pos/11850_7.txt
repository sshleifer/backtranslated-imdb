Plot: Ed and Alice are engaged. They live together and live the dull life. He slept before he met Alice. She has much less experience. She decides that she should sleep before she marries. He is very reticent and agrees that they should both see others for a while. <br /> <br /> Initially he is not really about it. His wild days are behind him and he is simply content. Up until one day Alice comes back and tells him she was a random man; who of course starts her fall. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a BAD idea that puts extreme pressure on the relationship. <br /> <br /> Good movie. You can see the train wreck coming but still good. <br /> <br /> Worth renting.
