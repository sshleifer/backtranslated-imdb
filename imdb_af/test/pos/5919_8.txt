This film recreates Lindbergh's historic flight across the Atlantic while touching on episodes in his aviation career. Stewart was about 20 years old to play the young kite, but his good performance, especially in the solo flight, makes it a small problem. Waxman's exciting score is a big plus. In spite of the long run, Wilder manages it very exciting and he can sustain the drama, although the result is well known. What a year was 1957 for Wilder: next to that he also wrote and directed "Love in the afternoon" and "Witness for persecution." And his next two were "Some Like It Hot" and "The Apartment." What a run!
