It may interest people to know that this film was made without Phoolan Devi addressing herself. When she finally saw parts of it, it was so furious that she announced that the film should not be shown in India, or that she would cover herself in petrol and burn herself. I do not know if it was shown at all times, but if she is currently as a rising politician, I doubt it. Since then I have seen a report that she has been dismissed from the office and charged with further crimes of her Dacoit days, and has been concealed by this. <br /> <br /> Her own concern is aside, it is an excellent film, making it so much more with its refreshingly brutal approach; None of the rosy melodrama can be expected from a typical Indian movie. It should be emphasized that worrying about how feminist the messages of the film really are and the like is essentially irrelevant: it is a true story. Her thoughts do not seem to be portrayed, but with the way the film portrays her.
