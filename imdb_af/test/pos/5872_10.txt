I only saw this movie as a teenager (I'm in my 40's now), and have long regarded it as my favorite movie. The story is moving immensely, without being sentimental. The acting, especially by March and Loy, is dead. And the fact that Dana Andrews is too old for his role does not detract from the credibility of his romance with Theresa Wright (which I believe is the only great character in the film still living). It could have been another post-war melodrama, but the script and movie are just too good to make it happen.
