In 'Check Out' Peter Falk plays an elderly New Yorker calling his children home so they can be with him before committing suicide. As the movie progresses, we get everyone's mistakes and other problems. While some may interpret it as a "heart-warming" movie, I mostly enjoy Peter Falk's character, and nothing lets him down, and sometimes a little bit of malice. <br /> <br /> So, it might not be the best movie ever, but still worth seeing. For a long time I thought Peter Falk had the perfect view to play this kind of role, with his glass eye and everything. Also with Laura San Giacomo, David Paymer, Judge Reinhold and Shera Danese (Falk's real wife).
