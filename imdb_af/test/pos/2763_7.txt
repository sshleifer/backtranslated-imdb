Almost 20 years before Frank Marshall brought tears to your captivating epic "Alive", there was already the legendary Mexican exploitation director Ren√© Cardona who used the same drama as an overview of his ambitious film "Supervivientes de los Andes". The unforgettable fatal flight of Fairchild 571 crashing into the Argentine Andes on October 13, 1972. This terrible accident cost the lives of many passengers, most of them members of a professional rugby team. But 16 people were eventually rescued, thanks to their strong will to survive, and fed on the mortal remains of their unfortunate fellow passengers. Of course, you can't claim that this inexpensive and coarse edited movie is better than the famous 90's, but I appreciate this movie more and more. In fact, a mining film requires much more input from both role players and crew members, while the large-scale Marshall movie, although intense, feels more like routine money making. Of course, the sets and special effects can't compete with "Alive", but "Supervivines ..." deliver an equally impressive sentiment of hopelessness and create even more nightmarish hell snow. Cardona's film is ambitious, surprisingly compelling and easily one of the most remarkable Mexican productions ever. I am very surprised that Cardona's actions on this story are no longer exploitative and explicit. However, the scenes where the deceased passengers are cut open and digested are difficult to digest, but they only serve to increase the credibility of the disaster and to emphasize the inhuman conditions of the survivors. Rather laudable for a cruel director who has become known for his notorious bad films such as "Night of the Bloody Apes" and the Santo series. The unknown young Mexican actors do a good job and the musical score is endearing. The story is well known, of course, so the script doesn't offer unexpected shocks. Whether through history or before, "Alive", you know what kind of drama these people still have to endure before they are saved and you can just wait. Still, it's a good movie that shouldn't be bumpy, as is often the case.
