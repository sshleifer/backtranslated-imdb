Although it's not the masterpiece that "Le Samourai" was (I assumed Jean-Pierre Melville could never have been that classic), I find Le Cercle Rouge much better than Bob Le Flambeur. I felt that "Bob le flambeur" was an above average and influential b-movie, but still a b-movie. "Le Cercle Rouge" proves that if a movie maker has improved Melville if he continues. John Woo is a massive fan of Melville, even though their movie style differs. While Woo uses fast-paced shooting and an operational sense of violence, Melville has a minimalist style that suits him well. He was not interested in creating quick action movies but more meditative crime thrillers. In that department he was one of the best. <br /> <br /> "Le Samourai" is still its best work, mainly because it is more character development than this, but on a technical level it is probably equal. In addition, while "Le Samourai" achieved a good lead, it celebrated. Alain Delon is again an ultra-cool gangster on the prowl - this man's silence is fascinating. Bourvil is wonderful as the police inspector on the case of the elevator and escapes. He steals every scene he is in and proves he was a skilled dramatic actor (in France he is best known as a slapstick comedian in mode Buster Keaton). Yves Montand is also great as the shaky and paranoid rifle scooter. Gian Maria Volont√® (a regular spaghetti western) is overshadowed by his three fellow stars, but still does a good job. <br /> <br /> Again, Melville's direction is excellent. With equal influence of both American crime players and the French new wave, the man always looks the best shots and angles to choose. It's slower than most capers, but it really does end up. "Le Cercle Rouge" is a bit short of being an absolute classic, but is still one of the best movies ever made. Tarantino must have seen it before making "Reservoir Dogs". (8/10)
