I wasn't sure about this movie before he hired and so assured Hilary Swank always gave excellent performances in her movies. She seems self-reliant to get the emotional impact she does. And she didn't prove me wrong in this movie. <br /> <br /> But the movie also has fantastic performances by all other members of the film, both speaking and non-speaking. I have to add Jamie Bartlett and Chiwetel Ejiofor - the two main characters - to their excellent acting abilities and portrayal of true human feelings and failures. The whole movie runs almost like a documentary. <br /> <br /> I have to address Tom Hooper as the director and Avril Beukes as the editor for holding a multiple story that is revealed, while the dialogue and action move in an understandable direction. mode. The opening sequence of the South African landscape was striking and I had to press the pause button to enjoy the photography. <br /> <br /> Why a movie like this can ever be nominated for an International Award. I seem to be hitting the high-grade button at all points. It was not just a movie, it was a real life experience in a country that came from apartheid. A nature of poverty was everywhere, but it celebrated the dignity of the human spirit.
