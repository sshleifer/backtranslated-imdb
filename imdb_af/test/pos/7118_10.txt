I don't play video games at all, but do my kids. <br /> <br /> I got a big kick out of it. Want to see more of this type of movie. "very cool" as my youngest would say. <br /> <br /> Interesting characters and the overall story line were interesting. As I said, I don't play video games, but I think my kids will enjoy it. It wasn't full of bad language and it's a pleasant change. This visual concept was different from what my eye caught. Plus the soundtrack was pretty good. I can even try to see some of the games my boys play because of this movie. Who knows, maybe I'll be a gamer one day.
