"North and South Africa" ​​is the television mini-series up to the 80's that was "Rich Man, Poor Man" (the first TV series) until the 70's. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic adaptation of the first classic novel in the trilogy of author John Jakes. The story itself covers the two decades leading up to the years of President Abraham Lincoln's election and the impending proclamation of the Civil War North towards South. The intricate stories evolve around the families of the Dangers (the 'North' in the title) and the Mains and their two central figures of George and Orry forming a friendship as they began their West Point training in 1842. <br /> "North and South Africa" ​​is a wonderful historical timeline and if I get older (and wiser!), it is very important to me to learn about the contrasting attitude toward such controversial issues such as 'Slavery' and 'Abolitionists' These attitudes have arisen. <br /> <br /> The series also portrays some great character development as we learn about the friends and enemies in George and Orry's lives, as well as the women who stole their hearts as young men. This aspect of the story also reveals a romantic story that takes place on the turbulent background of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> "North and South", along with "Rich Man, Poor Man" is overshadowed by 1977 "Roots" as the biggest mini-series of all time. However, it comes closer second / third and also shares the same kind of timeline and themes as "Roots". But don't let this one get away, even if it's just to see the wonderful scenery, costumes and brilliant all-star cast, including Gene Kelly, Johnny Cash, Elizabeth Taylor, James Stewart, Olivia De Havilland, Lesley-Anne Down et al. <br /> <br /> The series is beautifully crafted and is firmly linked to real historical events and it is a pity that the Emmys and Golden Globes did not honor many of the actors and actresses for their depictions. Patrick Swayze and James Read, the two virtual unknown lead actors then, are named in compelling performances respectively as Orry Main and George Hazard. However, it is Kirstie Alley's sounding performance as George's 'Abolitionist' sister Virgilia steals the show many times. Plus, Terri Garber, David Carradine and Philip Casnoff as Elkanah Bent are the nice villains of the piece you just love to hate. <br /> <br /> "North and South" Books 1 and 2 are now available on two DVD sets.
