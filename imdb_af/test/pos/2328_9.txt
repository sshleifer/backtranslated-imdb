Not the best plot in the world, but the comedy in this movie rules. Kelsey Grammar is great in this movie. Another funny man is Rob Schneider who will make you segment with Ken Hudson Campbell playing Buckman. Lauren Holly probably plays the more serious character in the role as Lt. Lake. Bruce Dern is a good actor in this movie, probably playing the most serious character in the movie. The actor I enjoy most was Toby Huss as Nitro, all the electric shots his character in the movie is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Plot is a bit uneven, about Lt. Commander Tom Dodge, who wanted to command his own sub years. When he finally gets the chance, instead of a brand new sub, he gets a red WWII Diesel Sub, the Stingray. His crew is no better, misfits from the US fleet. He is then placed in a series of war games showing how an old diesel engine can handle itself against the current nuclear fleet. Things still don't get better if he finds out that his dive officer is actually a female officer to see how Women work on Real Subs. To get the commander he wants, he must win the War Games and inflate a Dummy Ship. <br /> <br /> The movie is pretty good, I actually laughed while I watched this movie. theaters. I loved being in silence and Buckman farts, and everyone's reaction to the smell is hilarious. Overall, 9 out of 10, this movie is just nice to watch, it's nice to have a movie. So, I hate movies that are 100% serious.
