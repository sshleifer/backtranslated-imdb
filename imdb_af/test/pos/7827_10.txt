When I first saw this ad appearing on Australian TV in the late 90's, I ignored it and thought it was just on the Kevin Costner movie "Bodyguard". But then I caught an episode and I wish I had seen it from the beginning. The partnership between Sean Pertwee and Louise Lombard was so well done and the structure of each episode was extremely entertaining. It was not a remaining TV show you could tell had spent most of his energy exploding things so they could put the stone in the commercial to attract audiences and then not deliver on any other level. The show went into the lives of the two main characters and it made it interesting. The stories for each episode were also well written with interesting guest stars. And of course, there was plenty of action and plot that was always good. But what was great was that there was humor, and that of course flowed from the characters, but it didn't confront. It was Britain but in a good way, and if this show was made in America, it would undoubtedly be on DVD. I don't know why British TV production companies aren't interested in announcing this show on DVD. It was a good performance and earned a DVD edition.
