Roy Andersson has succeeded in designing something that almost all conventions of what a film should be, an art piece that is beautiful, funny and attractive at the same time. The end result is a moving, somewhat broken story about mankind in its simplest and most honest forms. <br /> <br /> It is unlikely to appeal to everyone. In fact, the humor is so finely tuned that it is very unlikely to get at its wavelength. The almost absurd long tasks, uncomfortable silence and consistent medium shots will definitely even turn off the most willing of audiences. But it is within these unprecedented stories and unconventional thinking that Andersson forms a world in which each character, in their own absurd way, looks the middle stage. Each scene is absorbed by the deserted environments, with the characters apparently left alone in their own strangeness. It's a tough piece to watch at times, especially as it requires patience like many of its scenes. But while some can get it on an artistic throne, others will simply look confused. It is a movie that mixes up with humor with its own brand of heart
