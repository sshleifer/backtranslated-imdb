I saw this movie three times and every time I appreciate it more. I think Jordana Brewster had received an Emmy nomination for her rights and natural performance. Many of us who were Phoebe's age, at this point in time, will understand how real it is. Life for most of us is not soft or glowing romantic or heavy cynical pessimism. This is a faded balance, and this film captures this balance. It is also well built, with so much detail in its composition. Like the movie or not, due to the extremely high ratings it gets from the demographic of women under 18, we can know that this film reveals some important truths about how young women see themselves in the world.
