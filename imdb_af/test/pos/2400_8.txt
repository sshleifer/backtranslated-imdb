This movie is from start to finish with excellent performances, a good soundtrack with original music by Douglas Brown, and a healthy script full of surprises. It's full of new and not so new faces. film shows promising talent especially in the case of Craig Morris who plays main character Eddie Monroe. Morris, who also wrote the script, shows a silent power, combined with a strong emotional performance, as he creates a credible character on the screen. Also, a pleasant delivery by Paul Vario who plays Uncle Benny with true warmth was so convincing that he made me hungry when he lovingly prepared his Italian sauce. <br /> <br /> Great new faces, good new music and a wonderful new story - what more can you ask for. This film is highly recommended!
