This move is absolutely, certainly one of the greatest films of his or any other genre. Not only is Kubrick one of the greatest directors of all time, but his entire filmography has to be placed in a time capsule and can never be forgotten. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a journey, unlike anything I've ever seen on the screen. Kubrick is one of the few directors who can draw and keep you from start to finish, even with the absence of extensive dialogue or plot development. Just with footage together, 2001 can present a picture of the future that is both sublime and terrible. 10 out of 10, no doubt. For my money it doesn't get much better than 2001: A Space Oddysey .... now, the sequel, 2010 ... it's a different story.
