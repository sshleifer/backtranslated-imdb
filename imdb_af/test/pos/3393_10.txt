This movie is VERY LONG but is quite worth splitting over several nights. It has an all-star cast, and if you're a Patrick Swayze fan, it'll beat your heart! :-) My mom is a Civil War buff, and a history teacher, and every summer we'll see this movie (we recorded it from TV), over several, a few nights until we got through the whole thing . We memorized every line in the movie, lol. Pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the action and romance. It's a great movie for those who like action, war, blood and intestines, but also for those with a soft, romantic side. The clothes the women wore were AWESOME! Sometimes I think I'm born in the wrong era, lol.
