Just before Dawn is one of those really good slashers that send cold fever on your spine every time you see it! This movie has a great thrill, good acting, very well done camera work (good work Mr Lieberman!) Which makes a very well-made slasher! Although it's low for the 80's, it's still over you. Kill the opening (machete through the cross) looks so real! And the fist to the mouth death amazed me! Overall I give this lost 10-star classic 10 stars! If you're looking for a gore festival, don't look here. but if you want cold fever to lower your back, see this one. There are 6 deaths and one you don't see, but it lets you think "how was she killed?" The stranded theme reminded me of 1977's Hills Hills Eyes, which followed the same kind of concept, but in the desert with cans. But, still treasure fans, give this forgotten gem, I promise you, you'll be staid!
