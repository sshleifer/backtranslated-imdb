Come to see Monster Man yesterday. It was a long wait and after much anticipation and build-up, I was happy to say that it came through and met my expectations at every level. True, you can't really expect too much to hear the plot, but after reading some of the reviews for that, I was ecstatic. I mean, which trash fan doesn't want to see a gore flick about a hidden inhaled heel that people cut off with its sliding monster truck? I was expecting a cross between Road Trip and The Hills Have Eyes and so much more. It was a horror comedy that actually worked. The filmmakers did it right when it broke you and made you happy with laughter. Kudos to Michael Davis for everything with the gore and press the envelope with the sickass humor. Let me just mention a few reasons why I love this movie so much: First, the story is. It was killed in so many other movies. A college man gets wind that will fall in love with his childhood. He is the 25-year-old virgin he is in, bounces in his Vista Cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love, hoping his head will fall over the hills and all that good jief. Hidden in the back seat of his station wagon, is good friend Harley. Harley is the loudspeaker, former friend, who laughs and talks like Jack Black in High Fidelity. You can't help if the man, but if he was your partner in real life, you need to keep a whistle ball (laugh everything you want, but have you ever hit one?) To keep him in cheque. So he's a little on the stupid side, to say the least, but you can say he's a loyal friend deep inside. Anyway, they are on the road and when they stop in a bar, they aggravate the residents. Now they are trapped in a monster truck by a leather clone. That's it. Yes, along the way they pick up a beautiful hitchhiker, but I'm too lazy and hungry to go in now ... just look at the damn movie. <br /> <br /> The second thing I love was the humor. This one had some of the worst of any movie since Cabin Fever. Just how messy is it? Well, I'm not even in the whole cat scene and as for the "dead burrito" thing, I'll leave it to your virgin eyes as well. The bar full of amputees was somewhat disturbing and the guy who looked like John Turturro also bothered me. Harley, though a totally unpleasant child, can really drop one liners off. Loving the clogs, incidentally. I need a new couple. <br /> <br /> The GORE. This one throws it on heavy. While the first hour plays like a demented road comedy, the last third goes over blood and gut. If the movie didn't have such a light tone, it would have been a bit disturbing, but seeing how it all played, it's not possible that you will be affected by it. If you're still in your seat by the time it comes, you'll probably see the humor in it, but seriously, there were buckets and buckets of the red stuff. There was a big plot that I didn't see and when the credits rolled, I was completely satisfied. I got exactly what I came for and I'm really glad I bought it. Much like Cabin Fever, it's going to get a lot of repetition. <br /> <br /> Watching the movie was outstanding. There was this deliberately cheap look that made the whole thing shout in the late 80's and I loved the exaggerated colors. It is clear that Monster Man was done on a relatively low budget, but much like Cabin Fever (sorry I keep the two together), it actually works in the movie's favor. Cabin Fever was an ode for the 70s, it was the 80s answer to that. So take it for what it is worth. No CGI here. That's what we all need. I'm not quite sure why it didn't get a theatrical release, because that's all Jeepers Creepers should have been. Thank you for the Leeushek.
