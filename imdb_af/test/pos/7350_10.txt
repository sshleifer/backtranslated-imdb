I love love, love this show. Whether you say it is because I'm mad in the brain or not. I think this show is very funny and entertaining, though sometimes Bam's uncle Vito scares me. All in all, I give this show a perfect review. And so I really think if you are in the "omg. What an idiot" kind of humor, this show is for you. It's really funny to see the look of the prank's faces and there are many musical guests coming to Bam's house. Buy it because it's rocks! You have to buy it. Yes. And Bam's brother is in the group CKY and they are really good and sometimes come on the show. <br /> <br /> Bottom line is .. please look at the show.
