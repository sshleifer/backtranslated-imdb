All Fleischer / Famous Studios Superman cartoons are excellent, but Billion Dollar Limited, the third in the series, is probably the best of the lot in terms of overall animation, plot and pacing. Why is it not even for an Oscar as Best Animated Short for 1942 (Incredibly enough, just the first one) inexplicably named. <br /> <br /> Here, Lois Lane is dedicated to covering one billion dollars in gold in the US currency. Masked gangsters in their super-powered (for 1942) car descended to the train, determined to get that gold. Without giving away too much, which is a thrill for both the characters and the audience, with the truth, justice and Superman who are ultimately triumphant. <br /> <br /> Like them in all Fleischer / Famous Superman cartoons, Clayton "Bud" Collyer and Joan Alexander, who played Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane on the radio, have the voice work here, and Fleischer's perennial Jack Mercer also gets a bit to do as one of the bad guys.
