One of Alfred Hitchcock's three best films, along with "Psycho" and "The 39 Steps", "Strangers On A Train", is so brilliantly out of control as a cheerful round in Metcalf, and almost as deadly. It's the kind of movie you watch so much fun, you can't even feel guilty until you get the time to breathe. <br /> <br /> Top amateur tennis player Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets a strange, alien stranger named Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train. Thanks to the gossip pages, Bruno knows everything about Guy's problems with his non-good wife Miriam, and suggests that they favor one another: Bruno will kill Miriam and Guy will kill Bruno's father, Bruno in an institution want to kill. . Guy laughs, but Bruno doesn't joke, as Guy found out. <br /> <br /> This is a good starting point for a murder story, and Hitchcock gives a stranger a train run for everyone Worth, with the help of Walker, perhaps the biggest show in any Hitchcock movie, including Anthony Perkins in "Psycho". While Perkins punctually plays his mark against the grain, Walker as Anthony is one of the best at home, or decorated the old ladies at a swim-party party or strangled a young woman at an amusement park. <br /> <br /> What drives Bruno? Many commentators suggest that his apparent homosexuality finds a match in pretty Guy. Yes, Bruno lifts the old gay dar, but Guy looks happy enough about love's rebound with socialite Anne Morton (Rut Roman). Bruno's interest in Guy can just as easily be envious, because somebody makes a mark in the world while he is staying at home, so Mama leaves his nails. <br /> <br /> "Oh, I admire people who do things well," Bruno purrs, looks like a cat looking at a mouse. "You know, it must be very exciting to be so important." <br /> <br /> Later, Bruno calls himself a "bum", accurate enough, except for our angry interest in him, even if he destroys Guy's life with his murderous death. This is the ultimate perverse undercover story. There is a sense of integrity about Bruno, in his dedicated dedication, which commands our respect and what makes Hitchcock so brilliant. When Bruno moves away from the scene of his great crime, am I the only sick person in the world who is really happy for him? I don't think, but Hitchcock keeps the story on a fair path for us to realize how low we've fallen. We don't want Bruno to win exactly, but we enjoy his eleven while trying. <br /> <br /> Everything else is so perfect, or at least close enough, to make every shot memorable. Hitchcock always achieved at least 2-3 good series of pieces per film; here you get a score of them at the amusement park alone. ("20 Big Shows", the neon side at the entrance, and they don't make a joke.) Script, camera work, a gripping tennis competition, Ruth Roman's jaw, it's too much for one movie to contain. Even Granger does his bad youth here with more laughable credibility than Gregory Peck ever succeeded in. <br /> <br /> You can call it a clinic in movie-making, but "clinic" doesn't sound deaf. "Strangers on a train" are good nasty fun, all the time, with a sturdy tail on the tail, noticing you have been rooting for the wrong stranger all the time. Heck, I'll take that ride again in a second!
