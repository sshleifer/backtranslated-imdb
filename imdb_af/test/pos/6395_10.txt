This is one of my favorite TV shows. A wonderful movie, big screenplay and an outside plot. <br /> <br /> Looking at the routine of the Kyle family are beneficiaries of great moments of humor and great comedy artists. Let's see: - Damon Wayans: no comment. He is one of the best today. Se has a perfect timing and always gets the tip of the joke. <br /> <br /> - Tisha Campbell: Her paranoid and sentimental Jay is just wonderful to see. <br /> <br /> - George O. Gore II: perfect for the paper. It is impossible to introduce anyone other than the adorable (and stupid) Junior. <br /> <br /> - Jennifer Nicole Freeman: The self-centered Claire found the perfect actress. Beautiful & talented. <br /> <br /> - Parker McKeena Posey: impossible not to fall in love with her. <br /> <br /> - Noah Gray-Cabey: This boy has the future, I'm sure of it. <br /> <br /> I get very sad when it ends, but this show will be in my mind forever. Michael, Jay, Claire, Junior, Kadie ... we love you!
