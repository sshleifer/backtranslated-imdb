Palwol on Christmas is very Korean, if you were in Korea or had Korean friends, you need to know what I mean. Korean are very traditional people, they love much love very quietly. a kind of feeling that you do not find in today's world. I think that's why this movie is so special. It is wrong to compare this movie with "Love Letter" by Shunji Iwai, Japanese is very good, but can never make one like Palwol on Christmas. If you have a chance, please see this movie for yourself.
