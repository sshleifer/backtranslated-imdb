Before I saw this movie, I heard a lot of praise about it and many cries about how "terrible" it was. Not to take a credit from this movie, I don't think it was so terrible or even shocking. It's just a movie about people living in the dark side of the village. And a good one to portray the point. <br /> <br /> There are some good acting here and a good idea of ​​manuscript. Paavo Westerberg is a well-known writer in the Finnish film and he is the best in describing contemporary Finnish culture (although he is not the only writer for this movie, but I dare say he is the lead writer anyway. Correct me if I am wrong). <br /> <br /> The casting is excellent, except for Jasper Pääkkönen (the pseudo-main character, who in my opinion stayed in the soap opera scene), and the sets, cuts and sounds are also well done and give a good atmosphere to this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is a story about vicious sad destinations that, according to a well-known Finnish band's well-known song (Eppu Normaali's "Tuhansien Murheellist Laulujen Maa", which is very readily translated into "Paha Maa" ) Throughout Finnish society, a sad, dark end leads to drink, loneliness and bad choices. And this is the side of everyday Finnish life, about 80% of the population has no awareness of unless films like this are made.
