I looked at six of a kind for W.C. Velds - he is only 10 minutes long and has one long scene, the infamous pool order he announced in Vaudeville, and several other great moments. The reamaining 55 minutes is also beautiful, grateful, mostly due to the hilarious Charlie Ruggles as the clumsy banker J. Pinkham Whinney. He's everyone's foil. He stumbles and stumbles upon our pleasure. Also, his comedian, Mary Boland, plays his wife, Flora. Connections in the proceedings are George Burns and Gracie Allen. Boland is extremely funny near the beginning and near the end, but Gracie and Ruggles use most of the photos. Gracie is funny, but she can also get tired. And poor George Burns has absolutely nothing to do except Gracie repeats all the time. I don't even remember to laugh at him (though he has one big scene with Ruggles, where Ruggles desperately tries to get George to take Gracie and leave him and his wife for a while, and one with Fields, where he asks Fields, sells him a jersey, but the bit is exclusively Fields. The situation is constantly funny: the Whinneys are going to California, but to help them out, George and Gracie are recruited. 8/10.
