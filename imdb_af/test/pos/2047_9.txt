Rent it, I own the DVD, have it for $ 9.99. A steel is so underestimated. Sure, there are better movies. Movies with less or no holes in the plot or action. BUt I don't have the problem with this movie. For me, being a movie remains true, honest and operator of its defects (and virtues, of course!) In the name of entertainment, it has fulfilled its purpose. I care, because his makers care. The whole movie is unpredictable from start to finish, but the makers have taken the whole business seriously. And I didn't manipulate to take the movie seriously. And this is so true, because I want to take every movie seriously, but many, oh so many, allow me. For all his folly, this movie is almost perfect, and totally entertaining! What a funny script! It also became frankly relevant to the events on 9/11. In no way am I trying to reduce the loss. But this movie closes the WTC's collapse before it happened in ways we'll never see if the movie was made after the events. <br /> <br /> "It's either gone or stay here." "won't you agree?"
