I saw this movie more than 20 years ago and still remember how much I loved it. It really touched me, and I really enjoyed the work of noel coward. Highly recommended: atmospheric and touch. <br /> <br /> I think of this movie from time to time and am disappointed. It didn't enjoy so much of a revival as many classic movies. didn't realize that I was looking for it today because it won an academic award for the best original story for Ben Hecht and Charles Macarthur. <br /> <br /> It basically involves a nasty character that destroys and curses another's career because of It. He dies, but is allowed salvation if he can convince someone to throw a tear over him. Most of the movies show him the pursuit of this goal. well written and beautiful. I got him for his plays, so I was surprised to see him in New York once in this role on TV. a must see if you ever have the opportunity.
