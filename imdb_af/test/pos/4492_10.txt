During the investigation into Susan Harrison (The Ballerina) with reference to a Bonanza episode, I am reminded of this jewel. <br /> <br /> This episode is the inspiration for Dylan's "All along the Watch Tower" (Hendrix's cover is probably So, this episode is responsible for several bests - not bad for about 22 minutes of television) . <br /> <br /> But it's "The Twilight Zone." Further commentary of the series is unnecessary. <br /> <br /> '5 characters' are typically Serling. Intense, dramatic, barren after' an end that is inevitable in the background, as it surprises the first time you see it. <br /> <br /> This episode is spoiled in one sentence and is too good to spoil for anyone who hasn't seen <br /> <br /> But you'll be let down, and you'll never listen to Hendrix with the same ears again.
