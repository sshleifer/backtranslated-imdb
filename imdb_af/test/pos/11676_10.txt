<br /> <br /> In the first place, I reviewed this documentary because I was interested in the topic it portrayed, the LA punks. <br /> <br /> I listened to that music and I loved that music and I. read a lot of the little sentences made in the early 80's and it wasn't that easy in Finland. <br /> <br /> So if you don't like this kind of music, why write about it I like this kind of music, it speaks my soul, so I know punks from across Europe and America, so why, who finds this music "careless" care to comment? <br /> <br />
