Over the weekend I watched the movie Tipping the Velvet and if I had to get this movie out of 100, I would have asked 100 questions. I am a true believer in true love and this film has moved me in different ways and the actors fit the parts without a dozen. But I have to say that the end wasn't that good, because I didn't see that spark in Nancy's eyes when she had ever looked into Flo's eyes, since her eyes had to look Kitty every time she looked. the room or Nancy's thought and Nancy would just believe that spark glowed. Kitty told Nancy she couldn't find her and she was looking for her but couldn't find her. Kitty was ready to give it all to get Nancy back. In Kitty's eyes you can see Kitty's pain. I believe Nancy Kitty had to show that his love is true and strong and that she won't let her go so easily. You have to make a part two and the two make it together, but don't let anyone else play the roles that the real Kitty & Nancy should be, or it'll never work. My mom once told me that true love is just not real. I'm not a fool. I know we all have a true love, and just wait for each of us and I believe with my life that Nancy's true love is really just Kitty and Kitty's true love is just Nancy. Let's play the game the right way, the only way. Let Nancy's eyes shine again. Kitty lost her everything by losing Nancy. And Kitty is not the only one to blame. I'm gay myself and gay is not easy !! WAKE UP!!! in 1889 i don't want to be gay, kitty is deeply lost in herself and in 1889 it might be the right thing to be married to a man. Even if you like a woman. Kitty needed Nancy to come to her, Nancy needed to fight for her. I remember how deeply I loved this girl and I got her away because I thought I was doing something wrong and I returned to my ex-boyfriend. I thought I did the right thing, but I know I was wrong to leave her and I would pay for the rest of my days, because I didn't find her place like Kitty. I heard she was married to a man in the United States. I even heard he hit her. I think eventually we both lose. Give the two girls one more time. Life can be very lonely if you are not true with you and your loved one. <br /> <br /> Thank you, Kristen Ann
