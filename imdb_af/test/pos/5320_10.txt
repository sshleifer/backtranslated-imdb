Leland follows the story of Leland P. Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling), a disgruntled teenager who allegedly killed a heavily delayed counterpart, the brother of a girl he had. The problem is not whether he did it or not? Leland recognizes it right away? but rather, why. Interestingly, rather than a crime drama, does Leland become a character story, and investigate why people are doing what they do? not necessarily the easiest ground to enter. <br /> <br /> And Leland has the required indie group of screwed people. Apart from the title character, there is also Pearl (Don Cheadle), who is his teacher at the youth corrective facility and who sees straight that Leland is different. We meet Leland's distant and selfish father (Kevin Spacey in an expanded cameo), who never seems to be emotional in any way by his son. But the true scents come out when we immerse ourselves in the Pollards, the family of the delayed child. First, there is Leland's friend Becky (Jena Malone), a drug addict who can't keep her clean; her sister Julie (Michelle Williams), perhaps the most normal person in the film, just trying to get away from it all; and Allen Harris (Chris Klein), a young man who lives with the Pollards and is Julie's boyfriend. Lastly, there is Ryan (Michael Welch), who calls all the other goofball, who can't communicate and is barely aware of his environment. <br /> <br /> Leland focuses mainly on its eponymous protagonist, but the movie slowly? occasionally throwing in everyone's lives and asking the main question why do people do what they do? While Leland is openly discussing it in a journal, Pearl enables him to explore the good and bad and personal responsibility, all the characters at one time or another in the movie for a moment where they have the fundamental choice of their own happiness or someone else, perhaps the most basic choice anyone can make. And the movie looks closely at the choices and the consequences. <br /> <br /> In the beginning of the movie you are simply hit by the depth of the movie. Spacey. Cheadle. Gosling. Michelle Williams. Even Chris Klein ?? These are people who tend to elevate any movie they are in, and to make them all together, make a heavy brew. For a space in the middle, the film appears to be bumping, sputtering as it unfolds; It seems like it will be just a matter of asking questions and not providing answers. But when we arrive at the house stretch and the movie starts to hit and come together, Leland becomes a quiet, powerful piece of film. Leland's explanation of the world and its action ultimately brings every story into focus, paying all the investments you made in the movie. <br /> <br /> Say Ryan Gosling is great, like a sunny day is nice. At this stage in his career is it redundant ?? It is one of the most beautiful young actors who work today, and it is a pleasure to see him craft that could have been an unlikely character in a formidable protagonist. Gosling uses such subtlety here that it hardly looks like he's acting; he has to watch most of the film across from Don Cheadle, which we know he has the goods, and he doesn't just keep his own, he also elevates Cheadle's game. Cheadle is in the fast-paced form, who sees Pearl with a full-fledged humanity? for good and bad. Spacey is kind of one-note, but it's the character, and he handles it perfectly. I was surprised by Chris Klein; With this level of acting I thought he would be buried in the mix, but he probably gives the turn of his career so far. Wonderful work around the world. <br /> <br /> Leland is a bit of a downer, and again it's dull places. But it ends up strongly and leaves a lasting impact on the viewer (in this case anyway). There is also a subtle commentary on racism in the film (in Leland's first day in the youth hall class, he is the only white person in the room) who, like much of the movie, is handled very effectively. I will not go so far as to call this required viewing? some find it too slow or too strange ?? but I thought it was one of the better movies I've seen for a while, much stronger and more satisfying than most out there. I would recommend it ?? With the above reserved? than for no other reason than to look at Gosling, perfect his craft.
