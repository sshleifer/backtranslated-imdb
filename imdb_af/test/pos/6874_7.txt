Near-wonderful mix of comedy, romance and medical chaos has a 50-year-old swing-single doctor, tired of going to rock concerts with nubile airheads, who has dated a patient's own age he met at his laps . Julius Epstein's script shows a fair amount of sophistication, though he does not have enough material to fill in the final third, and one can almost feel the movie. The subplot over the hospital being investigated for its uncivilized business is not being worked out satisfactorily, and it feels very high anyway. Still, Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson are a great team, Richard Benjamin and Art Carney, very funny to support. Director Howard Zieff keeps it up and running, and even when Epstein's one-liners feel Neil Simon's rejection, Zieff zippers are happy to see them. The results are quite tempting and occasionally pretty sweet. Followed by a failed TV series. *** of ****
