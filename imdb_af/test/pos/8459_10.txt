I don't usually comment on movies on IMDB, but in this case I feel like I should. I love movies, and I want to make it, and this movie is a perfect example of fine movie. <br /> <br /> This is one of the few movies I've seen on the small screen (originally it sees air on AMC, I believe, and then on the DVD I just watched) that made me feel in the pit of my stomach. The little knee sensation that the director hopes you feel while looking at his excitement. <br /> <br /> Jack Lemmon's performance is fine and follows Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. I had so much empathy with Lemmon, whose character Jack Godell just wanted people to listen to his warning. <br /> <br /> But what impressed me most with this movie is the lack of a score, and that's also what makes it great for me. Apart from the opening titles, there is no background music to increase the tension, because there is nothing needed. And while the credits run, white on black, in silence, it drives the point home. <br /> <br /> I use the movie as an example for anyone who says music makes the movie. I think the movie has to make the movie and the music just needs to strengthen it. But for the China Syndrome music is not necessary to get over the realism and the urgency shown here. The characters make it all better than the music ever could. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, it's one of my favorites. If you like movies, you won't be disappointed. If you want more movie soundtracks, you may not want to give this one.
