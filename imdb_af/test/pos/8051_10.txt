The movie is a starter for what really happened in Phenix City. I am a grandchild of the people who really lived the story. The truth never came to my knowledge. I tried to figure out the whole story, but the people who lived it are still afraid to tell it. Phenix City is still being run by people. Albert Patterson wasn't quite the saint. The story wants you to believe. The story was filmed in Phenix City. It has some of the well-known places in the movie. The Colonial Funeral House still looks exactly the same. But if you want the true history of Sin City, you need to visit us and find people willing to tell you about Ma Beachies and her kindness. She didn't get the name mother for nothing.
