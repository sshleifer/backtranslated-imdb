I watched this movie when it was released 50 years ago to minor theaters in the UK; and the memory of a great musical score, and the tragedy of the storyline. I recently watched it on video. The soundtrack was poor and the picture grainy; but this is one of two movies I saw the next day, the other is Gladiator. The music theme is extremely tragic, and from the beginning one knows that it reflects the failure or death. Definitely one of George Sanders' best performances; as a man who works the black market to pay back for what he lost in the war, but nemesis waits; Patricia Roc is a desperate refugee from Eastern Europe. He is attracted to her, wants to help her selflessly, and falls in love with her, but she is too proud and painful to accept help. Their love destroys him, and inevitably the girl and the doctor (Herbert Marshall) who brought the nemesis. The storyline is of complex intertwining destinations, where additional characters are not what they seem to be. It's like a movie that critics diappointed and struggled with at the box office; But for the adolescent who saw it, and the retired man who saw it again, it is one of the greatest films (taking into account his age) whose story is more akin to an opera.
