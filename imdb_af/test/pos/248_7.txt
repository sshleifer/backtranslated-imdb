It is definitely an excellent 1944 musical with great young stars and well-known veteran actors led by Charles Vidor. Rita Hayworth (Rusty Parker), Charlie Chan in Egypt, sang and danced with Gene Kelly, (Danny McGuire), Anchors Away, Danny McGuire owns a nightclub in Brooklyn, NY and fell in love with Rusty Parker who was a dancer in his club with Phil Silvers, (Genius), "Coney Island", who was the comedian in this photo and also worked with Danny, Rusty. Otto Kruger, (John Coudair), "Duel in the Sun", played the role of promoter of a cover magazine and decided that Rusty Parker would be his top model. Jerome Kern's music is heard throughout the picture and the song, "Long Ago & Far Away", is the theme music for this music. This film was nominated for many awards and was a big hit at the box office during World War II. This deterred people's minds from the war that was going on at the time. Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly were direct hits and their career has been exploding on the silver screen for many years. Great Musical and a movie you don't want to miss, it's really a good Classic Film. enjoy
