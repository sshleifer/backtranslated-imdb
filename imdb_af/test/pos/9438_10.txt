I would like to begin by saying that I can only hope that the creators of this movie and his sister film The Intruder (directed by the great recurring stylist author Jopi Burnama) just know in their hearts how much fun they have brought to me and my friends in the sleepy north-eastern city of Jarrow. <br /> <br /> From the opening pre-credit sequence that ever managed to drag so slightly, despite the fact that a man crashed through a window onto a motorcycle, the indifferent destruction of a silence lab, the launch of one of the most simultaneously annoying and anemic bad guys in film history and costume design that Jean Paul Gautier ott and garish would find. Don't make a mistake; It is a unique experience. Early highlight - an explosion (accustomed to it, much more from where it came from!), Followed by a close-up of our chubby heroine and the most hilarious line reading of the word "dad" in memory. And then ... the theme song ... <br /> Yes, it deserves its own paragraph. Sung by AJ, written by people who really want to remain anonymous, makes the songs written for Rocky movies like Schubert sound. This is crap 80's hero motivation narcissism all the time high, with the choice of lyrics like "it is just me and you, it comes down to the thread" and many talk about the "crossing of the line" (it will mean make in time - our hero does little about the boundaries of bona fida police work). Not to mention the Indonesian Supremes who seduce the title of the movie. At this point, anyone who officially wants to turn off is no pulse. <br /> <br /> Our hero is Semitic policeman Peter Goldson (brilliant by Intruder star Peter O'Brien), the "stabilizer" of the title. The man's bull in a china store approach to crime fighting and especially its less than inconspicuous shelter, leaves much to be desired, but is undoubtedly an entertaining guide through the moderate streets of downtown Jakarta, with The local sleaze ball joints, Captain Johnny in tow, as well as Peter's own waste of space partner in fashion crime, Sylvia Nash, do little. So many highlights, so little time - the "please slip" arrogance of Peter's not too convincing case against Head Greg Gregmaker. (Intruder fans will know hirsute slimy bastard Craig Gavin as the monstrous John White Honey name eh? Good ...), the x marks the mock card card stupidity, our hero takes horrible advantage from heroine Tina Probost in a moment of weakness on behalf of her , the latter appears on a stabbing dress dressed as a member of a particularly flamboyant dance gang. And believe me that barely covers it. <br /> <br /> There wasn't even time in the plot to look for a drug tracing system and a kidnapped professor with a worrying but laudable amount of national pride. Whether our hero turns to a funeral dressed as an extra on Boogie Nights. Or the completely hysterical craic between Captain Johnny and Goldson - two guys have never made any more of a friend-friend again than those clowns. The trowel might be too subtle, I think. Oh, it's off people and you never thought of destructive destruction, and general chaos can be so incredibly boring, but the character interaction is wonderful, the dialogue really. invaluable and incompetent to show in some way or another. Oh, and the shoes people - watch out for the shoes!
