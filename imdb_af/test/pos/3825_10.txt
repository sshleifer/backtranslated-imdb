What can I say about the series, called the NEW OUTER LIMITS ... Hmm .... Only this was one of the best TV series ever made !! You have actors of all ages, The actors who are somewhat known and have forgotten the time. Everyone plays their part in exacting perfection! These shows always have a kind of moral story for those who are most of the time (if not all the time) very true! You can feel the man whose voice is called on the credits and in the beginning and believe what he says absolutely! Not only do these shows have good story lines, they also throw you in, get your mind, and pump your blood. The original outer borders were black and white in the 60's. These shows have made a triumphant return as I have never seen! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch, but the New OUTER limits are where it is! If you haven't seen: I urge you to watch these episodes, and you'll see exactly what I mean! LONG LIFE THE NEW OUTSIDE LIMITS !!!!!!!!!!!!
