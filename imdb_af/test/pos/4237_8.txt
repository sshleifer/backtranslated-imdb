The sexy killer Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) still longs for a life of beloved happiness with an ex-boyfriend, a crazy killer Charles 'Chucky' Lee Ray. After getting her hands on the mutilated Good Guy doll that hosted his spirit last week, and doing a place of repairs, she performs a satanic ritual that returns his life to the toys. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately for poor Tiff, the ruined maniac shows no interest in marriage, and so she falls into a loft, with a bridal doll for the company. Ultimately, a rather angry Chucky (pronounced by Brad Dourif) escapes his boundaries, electrolysis Tiffany in the bath, and falls into her "bride" as retribution. <br /> <br /> Realizing that they are both in the same trouble, the plastic couple set aside their differences and decide to go to Hackensack, New Jersey, where they can lay their hands on the magical amulet their spirits in human hosts. Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his nice girl, Jade (Katherine Heigl), pull their paths to their destination. The psycho-puppets start with a murderous rampage, with their unconscious companions guilty. <br /> <br /> Although the idea of ​​a child's doll was possessed by the spirit of a mass murderer, it was rather tough. It was not the fourth film in the Child's Play series that the makers fully embraced the secret of the premise. things are much more to laughter than to scarecrows (although there is still a lot of OTT splashing to enjoy). Talented Hong Kong director Ronny Yu oversees proceedings, and translates the spiritual tongue-in-cake cake into a smooth and thoroughly enjoyable movie ride. Similarly, the excellent throw handles the camp material perfectly, with Stabile and Heigl making a happy couple, but the warm Tilly steals the show as blonde, boxwood, pouting, Tiffany mini-skirted Tiffany. Kevin Yagher's impressive operator pop effects also go a long way to making the movie so successful. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is unlikely to find many fans under "serious" horror aficionados, but those who enjoy the odd place of ceaseless popcorn entertainment, twisted, black humor, crazy deadly scenes, and wonderful clues must have an explosion.
