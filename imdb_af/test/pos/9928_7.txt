Betty is in the production of Verdi's Macbeth, who is asked to continue when the diva is injured in a car accident. However, in the great tradition of "The Scottish Play" it seems that the production is cursed with problems, and not least, it is a little crazy what the crew is cutting. Unfortunately, it seems to Betty that the killer had special plans for her. <br /> <br /> This is one of the different Argento crazy grinders, in this case mainly for extraordinary photography by great British cameraman Ronnie Taylor. I didn't measure it, but I think about two-thirds of the shots in this movie include pans, pops, skirts or cranes. The sheer amount of camera movement is just amazing and makes the movie ten times more exciting than a standard thriller. The images are wild and dizzy. The closest to the heroine's eyes are nailed to nails, a sneaky slip around an opera house from a raven's point of view, shots of the killer's brain, a bullet fired by a pithole, a swallow chain dug . of a victim's trachea. Conceptually, it is just incredible and can only be realized by this director. However, the movie is not without shortcomings; The cast has changed at its best - Marsillach and Barberini are both slightly shaky (and his double in the English version is terrible, even according to Italian standards), although Argento regular Nicolodi is fun and Charleson gives a thoughtful performance in a role more than a small autobiographical (a horror director who is very malicious for his distant and dependent on technique). The material is a good three-way mix of The Phantom Of The Opera, Shakespeare and Slasher Flick, written by Argento and his regular fellow student, Franco Ferrini, with crook suspects in general and the usual contempt for boring exhibits to explain what actually going on. . Full of all sorts of music - Brian Eno, Claudio Simonetti, Bill Wyman, Puccini, and of course, Verdi. The scenes in the beautiful opera house were shot at the Teatro Region in Parma. For a bizarre reason, the British print of this movie has the alternative title Terror At The Opera.
