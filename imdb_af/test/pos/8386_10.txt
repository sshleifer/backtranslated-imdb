I had the PRIVILEGE to attend the British Prime Minister of Inglorious Basterds tonight! After seeing the trailers, I had great expectations, but I have doubts about a series of self-confident films (I can be honest, self-confidence is his tarantino name) <br /> <br /> I was surprised to find He pulled out the cat with this one. The film is rich in interesting dialogue, Completed comedy with a cruel assassination. <br /> <br /> However, the coronation color of this film lies with Christoph Waltz, who cannot be faulted or mistaken. He manages to create a true tension in the audience while remaining rather "theatrical" (can't think of a better word). He definitely earned his prize in Cannes and is without a doubt an Oscar! Hope to see him again soon!
