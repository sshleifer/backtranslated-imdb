My first review at IMDB, after several years of using this site constantly ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, it looked the other night on the tube, beloved. It is in the mind of a Dangerous Minds or a replacement, but much better. Was probably for a moment that Rex was Speedy Levitch, in Waking Life, but after the check it didn't look like that. <br /> <br /> I can see why many problems with this plot and its poems, but I also think these people are meticulous. Admittedly, the end wasn't exactly what I hoped for, but overall it was so unique and benevolent, I can't complain. I would not call this cute, as one reviewer did, the scene outperformed most films of the 80's. And they refused to play any really 80-year-old music. <br /> <br /> Remember everything that made me smile when I saw it, but basically it has basically many creative individuals surrounded by mediocrity, and whether I'm Rex's beliefs or not, I like original efforts for meaning to describe life. And his Mutant theory is, to my knowledge, original. He also suffered a lot, but they showed how confused he was and why he could have psychological problems. And then, in his moments, he was an extraordinary philosopher, a person who noticed the small details in life and tried to express them. <br /> <br /> I was also very impressed with John Savage as a teacher. Usually, actors fail that role. He pulled it brilliantly. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Waking Life, I say, watch this movie if you get a chance. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10 <br /> <br /> PK
