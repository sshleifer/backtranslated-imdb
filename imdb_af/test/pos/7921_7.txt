This is one of those movies where you have to put some of its obvious shortcomings (due to the date and location of the production) on the one hand and emphasize the positive. In many ways it is a wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Forgive the parody in the one-line summary, but the most serious shortcoming for an English speaker like me was the horrific captions. The pressure I saw, in 1982, saw Soviet Film Export Subtitles, which used consistent grammar, apparently the impression of the 13th century speech. The real impact of this nonsense is to make it harder to follow the captions, which means you spend less time watching the images. Since cinematographic imagery is very powerful, it's a real problem. <br /> <br /> Other IMDB nothing has written enough about the Stalinist propaganda elements of this movie (only if the viewer doesn't notice them to him / herself). They also wrote a lot about the battle on the ice scene, which I think is exceptional. <br /> <br /> The love interest is almost completely subtle and yet strange ..... almost completely lacking in charm too. But it is good to occasionally shrink. <br /> <br /> I have long been familiar with the Prokofiev music for this movie before I saw the movie. The images and music complement each other wonderfully. And these are the images that will keep in mind for a long time. Bergman has learned many of these images - the images of his medieval pieces (eg the Seventh Seal, the Virgin Spring) that build and strengthen Eisenstein's ideas. This film was made in the USSR in 1938. In that context, it is a masterpiece, even if it is a defective one. <br /> <br /> For the modern viewer, I suggest you go with the flow and enjoy the many delights on the show.
