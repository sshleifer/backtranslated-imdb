If there are people who don't like this movie, I don't think they are human. This film deploys all emotions and shows many sides of Judith Light's character. Made in 1997, this is one of the best movies I've seen and really the movie in which Judith Light went to make me a big fan of her. This movie, although you sometimes want to rattle the boy to trust her so, is incredibly moving. I cry at the end every time and it takes a lot to do it to me! The plot doesn't have much, but the play provided by Judith Light is incredible. She looks beautiful all the time and at the end you don't want the lot to be imposed by the courts. Overall, a movie that deserves my highest praise! Thank you for making it and redefining my opinion on the death penalty. I am eagerly awaiting this movie to come out on DVD or some other form of media, as Lifetime is launching movies to clients. Although I don't have a high expectation for this one, it happened almost 9 years ago, and it's still hard to believe, as this movie is still in my head.
