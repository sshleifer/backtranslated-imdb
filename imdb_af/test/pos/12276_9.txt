Big little short film that was broadcast on SMT here in Aus a while ago. Get a copy if you can - probably just fine for a few views, as you will eventually remember the script - and that is the twist that makes this movie so funny. Well done, and intriguingly written, it is an example of how good low-budget short films can be.
