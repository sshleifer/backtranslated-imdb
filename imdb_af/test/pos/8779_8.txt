I thoroughly enjoyed this film, which was a number of ways, as Hitchcock did several times, a first attempt at a plot he shot later in his career. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about it is how faceless the main characters are. After watching, you remember Murray Alper as the truck driver, Vaughan Glaser's touch as a blind "patriot", the unforgettable travel freak show and of course Otto Kruger as the sought after and sophisticated villain all of whom overshadow Bob Cummings completely as the rather wood refugee That bridge to Harrison Ford's similar stunt in Andrew Davis 'The Fugitive' and Priscilla Lane whose change of heart and subsequent love for Cummings is never reasonably credible. <br /> <br /> Of course, the other major support player is Hitchcock himself who books the movies with 2 extraordinary stunts. Many people criticize the older films for their lack of realistic special effects. My feelings are that with a lack of technology, even trying and carrying what the director wants to show, is an incredible achievement. <br /> <br /> Obviously, this film contains an anti-fascist message which, at the time of the Second World War, but to be a Hitchcock, is never the most important and emphasizes always on the action. Well worth checking out, especially for the support roles.
