If the end wasn't so unexpectedly, I don't think I can judge this movie so well. <br /> <br /> This movie has a very uncomfortable, disturbing, "marriage apart" character interaction. That kind of thing is not my kind of drama, so the pace seems to drag me. <br /> <br /> In addition, the main characters are difficult to relate to and so much caring - the man (Alan Rickman) is bitter and insane and the woman (Polly Walker) is down and a little haughty. The acting was just fine (Norman Reedus was very tempting), but the characters themselves were a little too realistic (for me). <br /> <br /> The environment was nice and well-insulated and a little haunting. The cinematography had something about it that was somehow old. <br /> <br /> But the last 5-15 minutes of this movie is so inventive that every uncomfortable scene, uncomfortable conversation and inexplicable character behavior is absolutely worth it. I guessed every typical plot shift except the one that occurred. <br /> <br /> The ending definitely makes this movie worth watching. The plot and the drama, not quite so much.
