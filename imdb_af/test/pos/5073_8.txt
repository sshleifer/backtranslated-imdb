The powerhouse throws the crowd into the theater, despite the ominous title. Jake Gyllenhaal went to Conan O'Brien to promote the movie and explained that "Episode" was a euphemism for obtaining information through torture. Since 9/11, an extraordinary performance has allowed the government's intelligence agency to undoubtedly eradicate people without proper process and use any means necessary in exchange for information. <br /> <br /> Gyllenhaal plays the CIA analyst, Douglas Freeman (noting the irony) being torn over for his mission as a mere observer to unorthodox interrogation proceedings at an underground detention facility outside the US. <br /> <br /> Omar Metwally plays the alleged terrorist Anwar El-Ibrahimi, the Egyptian national and green card-bearing man of the American Isabella fields El-Ibrahimi (Reese Witherspoon). Isabella and her son are waiting for Anwar to come home from a scientific conference when he suddenly disappears from the plane's passenger manifesto. She is looking for help from her colleague friend working in government and learning that the head of intelligence, Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) is behind it all. <br /> <br /> Revival is directed by the Hollywood-new Gavin Hood (who wants to do X-Men Origins: Wolverine), and asks if such "extraordinary performances" are exercised in real life. The film was released locally in the wake of the Glorietta explosion (bombing / accident?). A threatening scene in the movie is when a bomb explodes in a public plaza. To increase the impact of the scene's real coincidence, the explosive tabletop with a single sign Aajala (Ayala?) Has seen on the right top screen, plus the effect of silence and slow moving images. <br /> <br /> There are lessons to learn from this movie, and it all comes down to personal decisions that we make daily. We all have choices that we want to exercise, and we often do not always want to (see) touch others, which can end up as careless victims of circumstances. What is 'the greater good' should not be a forced choice that our leaders must take if we already correctly decide on the source. Now it's a utopian that is worth building.
