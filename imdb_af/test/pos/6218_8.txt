My favorite story of 'stories from the crib'. Brion Jones was born to play the part of the maniac lumberjack ax swinging Madman Steve Dixon. If he had previously seen him in Tango & Cash, I can say that this actor never has the right credit he earned. A jealous man takes offense in his wife who shows an interest in a young young worker. He is only employed. And you know when Dixon finds out there will be hell to pay! The young worker Ted (Billy Wirth) receives an almighty beat from Dixon who leaves him. blind. Now how does a blind log cabin work? A tribute to black humor when ever there was one! The co-stars do a good job of helping Ted when Dixon suspects his first wife wants another man. Dixon's actions make the bond closer to the colleagues. And even said he had become a changed man when he was married. Although Ted had to do the wise thing and when he could!
