"The Beguiled" is a strange work under Clint Eastwood's oeuvre. By 1971 he became known as the star of action films, not only the Western (the genre in which he first made his name), but also war films (such as "Where Eagles Dare") and cop-thrillers (such as "Coogan's Bluff" ). Although "The Beguiled" takes place during wartime (the American Civil War) and was made by Don Siegel, who had previously directed Eastwood to Coogan's Bluff and was later to direct him in "Dirty Harry", this is not an action movie in the traditional sense. In most of his previous films, Eastwood played an active role, but here his role is mainly passive. His character, Sergeant John McBurney, is a wounded refugee who is forced to rely on the love of women to survive. Even while at his unit, McBurney did not play an active role in the conflict; He is a Quaker, whose religious principles forbid him to carry arms, and was with the Union forces as a medical orderly ministry. <br /> <br /> The movie was launched in Louisiana by the end of the war and started with the injured McBurney discovered by a young girl named Amy and returned to her boarding school. The school is a small one, with only two teachers and a handful of girls. Although some of the girls are fierce supporters of the Confederate case and want to hand him over to the authorities, chieftain Martha Farnsworth decides to hide and refuse him, fearing that his injuries are likely to be fatal if after one of the Confederation's notorious hard prison camps. <br /> <br /> Although McBurney follows the teachings of his religion with regard to pacifism, he is not so diligent to follow his teachings about the sin of fornication, and if he begins to restore, he makes full use of it from his opportunity to exert his charm on both the staff and the older girls, and he wins the appeal of them, including me. Farnsworth, her assistant Edwina and Carol, one of the older girls. Even twelve years old Amy seems to have some kind of childlike loved one on him. In the sexually oppressed atmosphere of the entire female school, his presence leads to jealousy and hatred, and to me. Farnsworth, who is rejected for the finite Carol, is a terrible revenge. (Interestingly, the one woman resisting McBurney's blends, Hallie, Miss Farnsworth's black slave, even though he tries to win her by showing that he is fighting to free people like her). <br /> <br /> "The Beguiled" is described as an anti-war movie, but it seems to me a misconception. The film is not really about the rights and injustices of the Civil War or of war in general. The only acts of violence we see are committed by non-fighters, and they are motivated by a desire for personal revenge, not by zeal for the Confederate cause. It would be more accurate to see the movie as a drama about the psychological tension that can be caused by the strange circumstances of the war. <br /> <br /> At first, the school, in a beautiful old antebellum house, looks like an island of peace in the war. The building is in the classical style associated with order, harmony and restraint, but the story unfolding within its walls is one of disorder, passion and violence, attributes related to the Gothic school of school that in the 19th century often as the antithesis of classicism. The film can be seen as the "South Gothic" tradition in American film and literature. <br /> <br /> The movie wasn't a big hit at the box office, possibly because Eastwood was so much against the roll. It may not be his best movie, but it showed that he could expand his range and play something other than action heroes. (In "Play Misty for Me" his first film as director made the following year, he was once again a passive character in danger of an avenging woman). There are some very good performances by the female cast members, especially Geraldine Page as Martha Farnsworth, outwardly a respected middle-aged spider, but inwardly a woman with strong passions. (There are tips that she might have a relationship with a man she passed as her brother). There are also good contributions from Elizabeth Hartman as the shy, repressed Edwina, who falls in love with McBurney and rejects the idea of ​​revenge and of young Pamelyn Ferdin as Amy. (Amy is an animal lover - an important moment in the movie when McBurney kills her pet shield. It is interesting, therefore, that Ferdin later became an animal rights activist). The one character I was less interesting was Jo Ann Harris's Carol who was too modern, like a swaying seventies chick that was transported in time to the 1860s. The film is striking for the emotional intense "hothouse" atmosphere Siegel brings to it. It won't be a movie for everyone's taste; some find it overwhelmed and melodramatic, and some have found it to be misogynistic. (Judith Crist calls it a movie for "woman haters and sadists"). However, others may find it a compelling psychological drama. 10/07
