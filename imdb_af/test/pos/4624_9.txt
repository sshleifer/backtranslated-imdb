2:37 is an intense and fascinating drama that has some similarities in tone with films such as Bully, Elephant and Kids (though, in my view, 2:37 is a better movie for the three). film, my expectations were neutral, but I finally got a very good impression thanks to the intelligent script, Murali K. Thalluri's perfect direction and the excellent performances of a group of young actors. <br /> <br /> The sporadic cases of school violence around the world have inspired many movies, TV shows, and books pretending to find the external or internal reasons for the unbridled expressions of rebellion, dissatisfaction ... and special madness and suggest. Some may say that 2:37 arrives too late for that artistic movement; However, I don't think so because the delay allowed the movie to make a more artistic analysis, focusing on the situation with more subtle and intelligence rather than the obvious reaction of cruelty and anxiety that other films with similar stories impregnated. /> <br /> On the characters of 2:37 we find clips of the youth movie (from director and screenwriter John Hughes -RIP's films to teenage horror movies): the beautiful "princess", the clumsy "nerd" the antipathetic athletes, etc. It would have been very easy to make them into hollow caricatures that are determined by their feature in the screenplay; but it is something admirable that the script exceeds the stereotypes of making their real people with credible problems that can find any person on their way to adulthood to a lesser extent. <br /> <br /> 2:37 is an excellent movie whose end is only slightly affected, but which rewards it with many positive elements. It would be very interesting to see Thalluri's next projects as he had a good debut with this movie.
