Based on Stephen Hawking's "A Brief History of Time", this incredible film by Eroll Morris documents the life and work of one of the greatest thoughts in the history of astronomy. He contributed more to science, despite his debilitating illness, ALS, than a skilled scientist could only dream. <br /> <br /> The movie begins by telling about Hawking's childhood, and how he was a poor student who was clearly recognizable. He eased his way through college and university, where he was diagnosed with the disease that would take away normal body functions, but would allow him to continue living and thinking. <br /> <br /> Morris discusses how the brilliant Stephen's mind developed from childhood to the present. At one stage, his mother told her when she was pregnant - she bought an astronomical atlas prophecy to read in the hospital. Hawking himself tells the timeline of his discoveries, while Morris talks to good friends and colleagues who were fortunate enough to befriend the beautiful man. <br /> <br /> He tells how he was first exploring the universe's expansion, similar to how a star would expand. We also know that stars eventually die and become what is now known as "black holes". If so, will the universe not start contracting, to stop it until we reach the "big crisis"? like Hawking puts it. And when the universe begins to return, time will not "reverse"? When I asked this question, I started thinking that death could not be the end. Perhaps the day will deteriorate and our death will be our rebirth and our birth will be killed. The universe is one big cycle, just like everything else in life. <br /> <br /> That's what Hawking tells us, everything in the universe recovers itself. It is quite logical and can wonder your mind in a million ways it considers it. That's why I love this movie and why is it a MUST SEE !!! A 11 out of 10 ... Morris never stop toamaze!
