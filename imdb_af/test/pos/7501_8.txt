This movie has some of the best dialogue ever written. The really good lines are all given to George C. Scott, a man who knew what to do with a juicy piece of dialogue. I saw this movie again, for the first time in 20+ years, and the dialogue is as good as ever. The bizarre action at the hospital is so imaginative to blind you. They often involve such wonderful poetic justice to be close to genius strokes. I love this movie !!
