So, Madonna is not Meryl Streep. Yet it is one of her first films and a comedy with it. Give her a break! Certainly, the movie is mediocre and beating at its best compared to its former counterpart with Katherine Hepburn, Bringing Baby. For what it is, though (a piece of fluff), it's pretty nice to watch. I have heard someone else weakening Madonna's acting skills, in other words, 'terrible', 'bad' or other such vague descriptive words. If you want to see bad acting or justify the argument that singers should sing, how about Whitney Houston ?? She had the most undeserved commercial success of an actress in history and could not get out of a wardrobe. Of course, the American public cannot distinguish the difference between a credible performance in a movie and strength. I think Madonna has always been credible in her movies. Get real people. Madonna bashing is so 90's.
