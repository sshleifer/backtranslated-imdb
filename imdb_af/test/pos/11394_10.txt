What needs to change in today's attitude towards movies like Boogie Nights is the approach. The approach is terrible! Compare it to Pulp Fiction, just watch pornography and all its aspects. Come on people, there's more to this in this beautiful movie. And for all the skeptics, did Paul Thomas Anderson not prove himself worthy again? Magnolia is one of the main reasons why I watch American movies and still has confidence in this "production" that is filming today. And what about Blood? It's a movie that stays in movie history, whether you like it or not! Yes you! The so-called consumer .. you know something: F # * k you! you do not deserve it, you earn nothing. So many artists struggle to get recognition and it is becoming increasingly difficult to make serious movies, even mainstream, because people just want to see celebrities doing stupid things. Like that chosen Britney Spears. <br /> <br /> Anyway, it was very painful for me to say, because I don't want to see it, I don't want to believe that today everything that matters is picking up numbers. Sales revenue and sales back. I want to see magic, the magic that Fellini, Bergman and Kurosawa brought and created through the language of the theater. Because that's what PTA does .. he creates magic !!
