I was a little surprised to see all the hate comments here. Sure it's not the best children's show, but don't stop people from barney to the fifth class? <br /> <br /> Well, everyone hates Barney. All right, I think his voice and songs are annoying. Okay, he's a little funny and weird. I am fourteen years old, so I know well enough. But here's the thing. Children? They love this show. <br /> <br /> When I was a small two or three kiddie, my parents had more time to rush me home than they did otherwise. Nothing can keep my attention for more than ten minutes. Face it, that's how toddlers are. Even the most patient can not sit long enough to break their parents. There is too much to do and see and explore, too much trouble to come in. <br /> <br /> Then came Barney. I don't know exactly what it is about the purple dinosaur that is so wonderful for children, but they certainly love it. I know I did it. I was addicted to the show and wanted to see it over and over. Yes, the kind of songs drove my parents' nuts, but learning their children, and excited about something that can really keep their attention span, is worth it. I learned my ABCs and 123's, brushed the magic words and your teeth. Of course I grew up with five or six, but then I was at least a little more patient and gave my parents a break. <br /> <br /> My cousins ​​and cousins ​​all went through the Barney stage growing largely to their mother's delight. I know what keeps Barney up in the air. He entertained. Of course there are Big Bird, Ernie and Oscar, and they are also fantastic. But at the preschool stage, it seems that more children prefer the great singing dinosaur. And that's enough for me.
