I really enjoyed paying hell. I was a fan of the Western as long as I can remember and this one reminded me of many Westerners from the 1960s (though I was too young to see them in their first run). The one thing that bothered me about the movie was the constant music. It was sometimes distracting. One thing I noticed, and I wondered how many other Gunsmoke fans noticed, was the name of Buck Taylor's character. It was a play on Doc Adams' name of Gunsmoke. Instead of Gaylan Adams, Buck Taylor used Adam Galen. I wonder if it's his choice or Chris McIntyre? Anyway, I would recommend this movie to Western fans. Don't expect anything too deep. Just old entertainment.
