I have no idea why everyone hates this movie to call it, rubbish a travesty an unacceptable successor is just unfair, I mean what else they could make for a prosecution. Because I think it should have had a successor (Rodney Dangerfield): hey everyone is going to lay everyone down and then a little dancing guy and that's the end of Caddyshack, though the movie was on the first one (R). and the second one was (PG) it was a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> (7/10)
