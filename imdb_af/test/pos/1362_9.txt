I loved it very much, but I have friends who have hated it. There is no sex, but there is very little nudity in any of the episodes - this is a good thing. Also, Keitaro has a toilet fixation that is investigated in at least half of the episodes. (Toilets are much more advanced in Japan.) Hmm, I wonder why I rated it so high myself ...? It's definitely not that I like naked cartoon girls. In some ways, Keitaro Oe (the main character) is analogous to Johnny Bravo, except instead of an unpleasant, muscle-bound jock, Keitaro is a hyperactive nerd. Or you can think of him as Japan's answer to Leisure Suit Larry. He is easier to take if you see it subtitles rather than baptized, but he grows in one way or another if you give him a chance. He is the Goldenboy. <br /> <br /> The formula is the same for each episode. Boy meets girl, boy tries to win girl's heart, despite being a dry pervert. Son succeeds somehow at all odds. Usually, the girl doesn't realize that she likes Keitaro, after he beat a pulp and / or has scrapped a spectacular stunt like a modern operating system in one week or a race against a petrol-powered motorcycle with his Bicycle won. <br /> Episode # 1 features a rich software magnate. I think her boobs were animated, a big dive in the budget because she's the only woman to have this kind of animation. She is also totally unprofessional. Most people who judged it negatively probably never got past the first episode. <br /> <br /> Episode # 2 has the rich, young daughter who likes to plague. She's only 16, but it's legal age in Japan (and in some states in the US I can add). Her father is also a brutal yakuzza type who has a reputation for killing guys interested in his daughter. <br /> <br /> Girl # 3 is the lovely innocent daughter of a noodle shop owner mixed with a bad boyfriend. Apart from Keitaro facing the girl's interference and being kissed by a man, there is hardly any ecosystem of any kind in this episode - a sharp drop from the previous two. Yet, Keitaro and the evil boyfriend really pound each other. <br /> <br /> Episode # 4 tried Keitaro to impress a top swimming coach. Keitaro looks more "direct" about his intentions with this particular girl than any other ... and she is straight in return ... <br /> <br /> Girl # 5 is the biker babe. She is probably the heaviest of the 6 (though not super-lively like girl # 1) and "most racist" in terms of sexuality and vulgarity. This particular episode is easily the most over-the-top in terms of (lack of) realism. Keitaro had to break each leg twice in his body during the race against the biker babe, but I think the producers and writers said, "It's just a cartoon! We can do anything!" This decline in realism makes it a favorite favorite. <br /> <br /> Finally, episode # 6 presents a new girl (it is animated) and the previous 5 girls help Keitaro while trying to handle impossible time and resources. restrictions on getting an OAV out of the door by the deadline. In terms of ekchi, this is also very tame, but there is a lot of humor. The end has all the 5 very nice girls from the previous team to hunt Keitaro, which seems unseen, apparently for the purpose of rape him. Yes, this - GENERAL - happens in real life. Someone crossed Ukyo Tachibana (ala Samurai Shodown) with Steve Urkel (ala Family Matters) ... <br /> All in all, there's no middle ground for this. You will also hate or like it. If you're new to anime, you probably don't want to start with it. At the same time, if you can stand characters like Happosai (from Ranma 1/2) or Johnny Bravo ... or you like comedies that lean heavier on silliness, but have many sexual overtones, you should shoot it.
