Father Hood <br /> <br /> I can understand why many people hate this story of a father kidnapping his two children and transporting them to America, but I have seen much worse. And when I saw these years ago - I didn't think it was particularly awful. Patrick Swayze is the worried father who, for personal reasons, keeps children with his children, and Halle Berry is the police they are pursuing. <br /> <br /> Overall a decent way to spend a few hours of your life. You can definitely be worse - ever hear of the movie "Pod People"? <br /> <br /> ** 1/2 out of ***** <br /> <br /> Rated PG-13 for some traumatic scenes, content of adult content, violence and language.
