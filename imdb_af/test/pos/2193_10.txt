I watched my videotape last night, for the first time in at least ten years. I found the work itself and the performances as gripping as in my memory. George Hearn was, of course, the master of Sweeney's role; there is never a touch of gentleness in his determination to give revenge to those whom he believes have caused his wife's death and his daughter's disappearance; at least not to the end when he discovered that his thirst for revenge led him to murder his wife. Angela Lansbury, on the other hand, creates a more complex representation, such as Mrs. Lovett. She understood that Sondheim wanted to be something of a "comic" counterpart to Sweeney; and even a bit of softness in her Sweeney courtroom and her nurturing of Tobias. For those with long memories, this show takes back one after her debut performances in The Picture of Dorian Gray and Gaslight; long before murder, she wrote. Just a year ago I saw the musical at the Lyric Opera or Chicago. with current opera superstar Brynn Terfel as Sweeney. Others commented on the operational quality of the score. My conclusion is that Sweeney works better with actors who can at least handle the voting rights, than with opera performers who have limited acting skills. As a final note, I recommend the artist who portrayed Tobias. with his mixed loyalty and confusion about what is going on around him. It was fitting that he had almost the last word.
