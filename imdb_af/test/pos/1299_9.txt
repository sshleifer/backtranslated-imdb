I was aiming not to like this movie, and the first 10 minutes did nothing to ignore my fears. It starts with 2 high school gangs crawling against each other with bad kung fu. A scenario set in many other Korean movies. Ho-hum. Add the fact that the story was written by the same man who wrote "He Was Cool" (which was barely negotiable) and, I thought I was in an indescribable 2 hours. <br /> <br /> But don't be so quick! "A Romance of Their Own" was directed by Tae-gyun Kim, who was also "Volcano High" (which I thought was fun). Anyway, "Romance of their own" soon takes a turn for the better. A high school girl, who just moved to Seoul, finds herself in the center of two prospective suitors. Every man has his own merit, and it is not clear which one will be the right choice. <br /> <br /> What follows is not your usual teen love triangle. The emotions are complex, and while you may disagree with certain choices or actions like the movie develops, you can definitely understand why the characters make them. <br /> <br /> The movie questions the characters and the audience. Who chooses one? At what point is one obliged to make a choice (and is it unfair for one if it seems to be strung alongside)? After you (or your heart) have made a choice, how do you react (and how * should you respond) when new information emerges that sheds new light on the situation? There is one scene, near the end, it is very subtle but perfectly captivating which I think would be a real reaction instead of the top "movie reaction." The subtlety is in a character in the background of the scene. Recent events and revelations overwhelmed and confused him. Basically he doesn't know what to do about things. Instead of challenging him or seeing everything in his mouth, he'll just be stuck at no point to respond or say anything. It's like someone who just pulled the plug on him. His response was true to me and I appreciated the scene. <br /> <br /> Like most Korean movies, there is a mix of action, bravado, slapstick and melodrama. Korean films often take sudden turns (see, "Sex Is Zero" for a good example), which can be a shock to the uninitiated. Go ahead and start yourself with this one. Like it, like or hate it, I think most viewers will be able to appreciate the characters' actions and responses.
