If someone was in a Pan-Hellenic tournament, I wasn't sure what to expect when I agreed to this show. Having seen so much about dramatization in "made for TV movies" and the madness of reality shows, I was curious to see if Greek could show the true college and Greek life experience. <br /> <br /> I was very pleasantly surprised at how the show could give the viewer the satisfaction of identifying the familiar techniques of this genre, but it could also give the characters depth. Greek life is not just about parties and small conflict. Although these things happen in Greek life, it also happens in any other social or professional circle through a person's life. Characterizing this as some exclusive experience for those in a Greek organization would be false. Most of the story lines and situations that occur in Greek can be found anywhere in every circle of friends on real-life sports teams. But I watched both episodes and my "little sister" whom I am very close to and I laughed at both episodes and reminded how they really caught the spirit of our colleagues and experiences. <Br /> <br /> I liked how the second episode showed how the characters are struggling with the other facets of their lives; school, relationships, goals, etc. Cappie tells Rusty that school comes first and goes to your brothers for help, it was very true for life. You can't stay in an organization if you have poor grades. The way Rusty gave his assignment to his professor was far-fetched, but it was entertaining. Even the dynamic between Casey and Rusty; It happens, you grow up and change your relationship with your brothers and sisters so you have to adjust. <br /> <br /> The bottom line: Greek is a good show, good entertainment and enough "real life" there to be credible and definitely worth the viewers' time.
