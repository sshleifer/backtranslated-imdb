When I first saw Farscape's Premiere Episode, I had no idea what to expect. I was very impressed and pleased with "Premiere". However, subsequent re-watches have proved to me many errors that I had initially missed. "Premiere" is not a good Farscape episode, but it earns credit for the successful and efficient setup of the plot and the basic storytelling to many of the common characters. <br /> <br /> The episode begins with John Crichton (Ben Browder), an astronaut and scientist, preparing to launch space in the Farscape Module, a small spacecraft powered by Crichton and his friend DK is perfect. Crichton has a revealing conversation with his father, Jack Crichton, and then begins his test flight in space. Of course everything goes wrong, and Crichton is shot by a wormhole and in a distant part of the galaxy "windy." <br /> <br /> After the wormhole has been kicked out, Crichton's module is pulled on board a living space. ship. From here on, the characters and story line for the Farscape series are launched in an entertaining but fast-paced way. <br /> <br /> The usual characters are properly introduced during the first half of the episode. Of course there is Crichton, which is well played by Ben Browder. He offers the audience a sympathetic character to identify. He is lost and has no idea how to do something. In "Premiere", Crichton must choose to join the prisoners or the peacekeepers. He knows nothing of either side, but to help Aeryn (a prisoner of peace) become clear that he intends helping the peacekeepers. He would probably not have been in prison if Crais, a chief of peace, was not. He declared that Crichton would be his brother's killer. This puts Crichton in an interesting situation: he is stuck with bizarre, violent prisoners in a distant galaxy over which he knows nothing. Crichton's total lack of knowledge of the Farsape world makes him a particularly interesting protagonist during Farsesape's first season. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is just as compelling. There is Zhaan, a blue Delvis and former prisoner. She is peaceful and reasonable, unlike fellow prisoner Ka D'Argo, a powerful and stubborn warrior. Virginia Hey is completely covered in blue makeup, which makes her look cool and convincing. D'Argo's mega-makeup, by contrast, is under-par. He looks kind of stupid with his giant tentacles and strange nose, and there is something strange about his eyes. They seem to have had some kind of allergic reaction to his makeup. Farscape will give improvements to its make-up in Season 1, but the overall costume will remain at least a problem for me until Season 2. <br /> <br /> The puppet / digital characters of Rygel and Pilot are, To put it simply, excellent. Rygel is a small Hynerian Dominar who floats on some sort of glider. In "Premiere" he is given good dialogue, but not much else. Pilot steals the show almost as the link between the living ship, Moya and Moya's passengers. Even in the first episode, Pilot gives the appearance of a true, living alien; He's never once seen in the show a huge, expensive machine. <br /> <br /> The Peacekeeper characters offered are also very interesting. The Peacekeepers consist of a race called Sebaceans, which looks just like humans. The main antagonist is known in "Premiere" as Captian Crais, who believes that Crichton killed his brother. In fact, Crais's brother's death was merely an accident due to an accidental collision with Crichton's ship. Aeryn Sun, a pilot who escapes Crichton, is trying to explain that death was an accident, but Crais only claims that she is "irreversibly infected" and refused to change his mind. Crais obsessed with revenge, fair or not (it must be clear to Crais that Crichton is not responsible), is mysterious in "Premiere", but will be explained later in the season. Aeryn itself offers a very interesting character. By being forced to leave the Peacekeepers, she changes her whole way of life and is in a similar (but less serious) situation like Crichton. <br /> <br /> The real episode, as mentioned earlier, feels somewhat rushed and clunky. So much happens that not enough time is spent on anything. Also, D'Argo (for now) seems kind of foolish to walk around in his mediocre costume trying to look threatening. Still, "Premiere" is solid entertainment. The special effects (as in the starburst sequences) are impressive. Most of the costumes and sets aboard Moya are original. Despite his flaws, "Premiere" is a must-see for Farscape fans. 3/4
