It's seriously one of the best low budget B movies I've ever seen. I'm not the one to stand up and cheer for in a movie, but this one was definitely worth it. Clearly, the premise is that there is a bed that people eat. Well, food is a subjective term I think. It really removes acid bubbles to suck the victims into itself and solve it in the acidic goodness. The best part of this movie is that William Russ is one of the main characters. The typical family man actually started his career with this movie ... and an afro. There is a lot of nudity in this movie, of course not for the kids, but no one should see this movie. I believe everybody needs a bit of deathbed in their lives at some point, it's better to get it sooner than later.
