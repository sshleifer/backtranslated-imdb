Great just fantastic! The West Coast has "Dirty" Harry Callahan, Sharky's East Coast. Burt Reynolds plays Sharky in "Sharky's Machine" and I enjoy it every minute. GO A maverick drug policeman in Atlanta, GA is just what everyone wants. Instead of being suspended, he is sent to the Vice Group. As in the Dirty Harry movies or any other police film, the captain is always jerking. When I was a kid, I was curious what the movie meant "Sharky's Machine". Well, I knew who played Sharky, I wonder what his machine was. It was his GROUP co-policemen. After uncovering the murder, he went out to find the horse. When it seems to be a big time mob boss, Sharky doesn't play around. When he gets the other prostitute in safety, Sharky fights back and forth, despite losing a finger to the thief. And I also like the part where the bad is blown out of the building by a glass plate. It was the BOMB! Randy Crawford's "Street Life" really put the movie in the right mood, and the movie itself is ALWAYS a big hit for me! Rating 4 out of 5 stars.
