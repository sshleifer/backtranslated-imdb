Like most people, I was only interested in "More" just because of the Pink Floyd soundtrack, which is apparently the only Pink Floyd album I've been listening to over the years. It was quite a surprise to walk across the movie in a local video store, in a digital remastered version. It was another great surprise to find that it was a good movie. <br /> <br /> Visually, it's pretty pretty, especially if the two main characters on the rocks on the Spanish island of Ibiza cavorting. And using the soundtrack music, which I can only say, is exclusively by Pink Floyd, is excellent. It was a joy to watch with me the movie with my copy of the album, which mentally disapproves each track as it used to be in the movie. Dave Gilmour's mission "A Spanish Piece" was the only one I didn't hear and several tracks were used very prominently, especially "Cymbaline", "Main Theme" and "Quicksilver." The latter tracks are boring on the soundtrack album, but work very well during the title sequence of the movie, which is rebuilt at least once. Maybe I can appreciate it now on the album, now I have some visual stuff to make it easier in my mind. <br /> <br /> The plot of "More" is a bit difficult to reverse, especially in the early days, as the movie just seems to be a vehicle to make the hype of those involved in the making. demonstrate it. But ultimately, the film proves that it offers far more than that, as the plot is more focused. Why does Stefan take heroin? Why does anyone take any heroin, which knows the possible effects? The film doesn't try to answer the question directly, but Stefan's heroic use seems to be a logical extension of his stubborn pursuit of pure pleasure. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to any Pink Floyd fan who appreciates the highly understated "More" soundtrack. I also recommend it to anyone who is interested in 1960s anti-culture and how it is portrayed in the media. I have no idea how realistic this movie is, as I am too young to experience first-hand the sixties, but it seems as if the spirit of the times is somehow caught up that no other movie does.
