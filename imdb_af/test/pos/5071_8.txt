CIA analyst Douglas Freeman (Gyllenhaal) gets his first secret spot inquiry when Anwar (Metwally) is accused of having contact with a famous terrorist bomber. Anwar's wife (Witherspoon) is furious about her husband's whereabouts. <br /> <br /> Don't just hate if the title of a movie sends you to a dictionary? I need to have an old edition as this version is not a musical piece. No, it's the government's way of legalizing a resident or citizen to question him and possibly use torture to get the required information. <br /> <br /> While watching this movie, I am reminded of a similar story line in the Crossing Jordan TV show (now out of the air), and I expect we will get even more from this story line see. It is inevitable. The events of 911 are the catalysts. <br /> <br /> It's a tough one to watch because we don't like torture and our government doesn't tell the truth about things. We like the idea that whatever happens or happened, we can go somewhere to find answers, but if the door is closed to us, we are truly lost and without hope like Anwar's wife. <br /> <br /> Performances by everyone were first class and it is possible that we can see more of Igai Naor (I have no idea how to explain it) because he looks and can act like Telly Savalas. Seriously. <br /> <br /> Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: Yes
