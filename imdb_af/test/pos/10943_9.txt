I think there was too much action in the end? Don't you think so? There was romance, adventure that just like I said to post 9 to this movie, but the action was too long. I had Reeve a little. I didn't understand why he had to die. I thought one of the girls was going to die, but my luck! No one else I loved didn't die! What about you? What did you like? I actually saw the movie. And then I also bought it. It was worth it! Who liked you best (person)? The book was really cool. And the actresses and actors too. Everything was perfect ....... What was the song in the end? Will anyone also answer my questions ... PLEASE please please?
