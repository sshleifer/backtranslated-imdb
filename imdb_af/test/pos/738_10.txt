Back in the 70's, a small Texas filmmaker named S.F. Brownrigg has applied a handful of surprisingly decent low-budget-in-the-turn movies that are expected to have developed a small cult over the years. Before I watched his first movie, don't look in the basement, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was sure it wasn't the only Texas horror I thought was better than the Chainsaw slaughter. I don't know, it can actually be my all-time favorite horror movie. <br /> <br /> We are starting in an isolated insane asylum. Initially, it seems to be a nice place to be mentally healthy, as all the patients move around freely and what not, as if it were their home (it is advisable). Neither of them looks anything dangerous, just delusion. The residents include a love nimho, a 700-year-old woman, a male child, a spaz, a man who thinks he's in a war, a woman who thinks she has a baby and a man who He thinks he's a judge. One day, the death of the judge, the doctor killed with an ax, shortly afterwards, the wanna-baby mum killed the nurse. Ten minutes in the movie, and things really look ugly. Perhaps the new nurse will know what to do, then again, maybe. To give away more would do more harm than good. It is best to first throw the first head in this one, as little as possible. If you can honestly appreciate God, unmotivated with horror, then you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> If you like Scream, if you take the wrong turn, if you're going for that original, over-crafted, over-successful digital Hollywood rubbish, then chances are you're just the beauty in this one will see. . Don't look in the basement, as a first attempt, make the quality increasingly shocking. The atmosphere and cereal fit in place and the score like a glove. Unfortunately, good o. has used most of his good ideas on his first movie, although the next entry in his Texas-sized quadrilateral is somewhat of a masterpiece, that is, if you're in an extra messy, temperate, Hixploitation like someone I know . If you fall in love with Brownrigg's first two, and must definitely find out what he still has to offer, watch out. Don't open the door, and the house where hell will freeze. Don't Look In The Cellar has everything that needs abomination, no stars, no budget, no digital effects, just an original story brought into a crazy asylum, with a dozen members and a bleak, subtle count. of course, the turn. It's a real horror for the real horror fan. 10/10
