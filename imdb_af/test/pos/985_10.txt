For a TV movie it was definitely worth seeing. All the plays were very well done and the story itself had a very universal theme. I didn't read / see the original and as a rule I can't stand Shakespeare, but I enjoyed this movie (the civil war institution was also well done). Don't expect to see an epic, but you'll have to find it enough to enjoy. By the way (on a synoot) it doesn't compare (or any other movie for the case) to the original work. Movies are not supposed to convey a book on the screen, but rather take the general idea of ​​it and then apply a story to it. When people say, "The book was so much better" (they are usually wrong anyway) they really try to say, the book is so different.
