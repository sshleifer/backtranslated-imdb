Every man, Liv Tyler, meets her head over her, and of course, without a little encouragement from Liv. Liv is at her finest, with Matt Dillon tops among the paramours. Interesting initial point of departure, to tell story from every dup's perspective, degenerates into a sitcom style final (unlike Blame It On Rio, which has more than a few similarities). It's worth looking at.
