I love everything the end of Al Adamson had in his long and varied career, but "The Possession of Nurse Sherri" is on the head and shoulders above the fun, but Grade Z sklock feasts like "Horror of the Blood Monsters "and" Dracula Vs. Frankenstein ". This movie is really scary! Do I tell you to jump out of your chair when you look at "Nurse Sherri"? No, of course not. But this pastiche of elements of "The Exorcist", "Ruby", and "Carrie" is one of those nice, horrible little horror movies that appeared in the 1970s. You can't put your finger on what is so spooky about it, but the film drops with atmosphere. (And what an end! Don't worry, I won't spoil it for you.) Adamson and producer Sam Sherman really got it nailed to this one, and whether "Nurse Sherri" is a calculated success or a happy accident. Jill Jacobson is nice but not outstanding as the careless nurse owned by the spirit of a recent deceased cult leader (Bill Roy, who shines in his short role). Geoffrey Land is okay as her culprit's doctor. There are some blaxploitative elements here (profit was the forefront of these cheap plug-ins), but they actually add to the plot rather than just window decoration. "Nurse Sherri" was a poverty drive production, and it sometimes shows (sets, special effects, etc.). Yet the film has a heart, mostly decent acting and direction, and some real chills. Sam Sherman also saw Harry Lubin's theme music for the late 50's / early 60's television series One Step Beyond used in this movie, which definitely adds to the spectacular atmosphere. The DVD contains two significantly different clips of the movie (the early version features a lot of T & A wound up on the cutter floor to make room for more horrific stuff), as well as the theater trailer, TV spot and good comments by sherman. Does anyone know what happened to Bill Roy? Along John Carradine, he is the best actor I've ever seen in an Al Adamson movie, and he plays the cult leader as he intended.
