I was also lucky to see "Check Out" with Peter Falk at the Phoenix Film Festival. This is a very sweet character-driven movie that swaps the audience into the Applebaum's fate in life. More than jokes, every character in the family carries priceless comic relief that not only laughs but also inspires some joyful tears. Peter Falk was born to play this role. He plays a 90-year-old "young" father of three who brings his adult children into what may be one of the most important times in his and their lives. The 2-day trip taken by the Applebaum family is the wonderful backdrop of New York (with carefully selected characters). It not only makes the audience more, but also feeds its own family mind. "Check Out" is a movie to watch, not just for everyone who cherishes the family, but everyone who doesn't! Thanks to the director who had the opportunity to bring this GIFT to his audience.
