I remember seeing this movie for the first time with a friend while on vacation in Anaheim, California in October 1976. While driving the tourist-managed city streets, we had a movie exhibition "ALICE IN WONDERLAND XXX." Saw. So before we left Disneyland's version of the Lewis Carroll classic half a mile, we won curiosity and we risked this movie threshold. I remember even before the movie began, how surprised I was to see this kind of movie that appears in the ultra-conservative Orange County. <br /> <br /> Thirty-two years later, I found ALICE IN WONDERLAND at a local video store. I wondered if it was the same movie until I looked at the back of the jacket and stared a picture of beautiful Kristine DeBell and decided to recover some good memories. Subversive Video, according to their credit, released two versions, X and XXX in the same package. As it turns out, the version my friend and I saw in Anaheim was rated X despite the original XXX ads there. To see it the second time, I realize what a beautiful body-director Bud Townsend has brought to the screen. As an example of the man's size behind the camera, he directed two episodes of TV's DEAD VALLEY DAYS in his launch days. <br /> <br /> Miss. DeBell, which appears in Playboy's April 1976 cover, is ideal as Alice. She brings a fresh American innocence to the role of library in her early twenties, longing for a better life. When her boyfriend is held back from their relationship to the next level, Alice reaches her turning point. This is a "musical comedy", but the melodies are quite catchy with appropriate strings and brass to account for the generally suggestive lyrics. Miss. DeBell has a pleasant singing voice while fearing to be free. This is when the magic begins. The performance of this movie is surprisingly humid, given the genre and supporting role of Wonderland, there to enable Alice to flourish in women. Special mention goes to TV veteran Larry Gelman as the White Rabbit who seems to be the only character who is not obsessive with sex as he is always late for an appointment ?? or something. <br /> <br /> Special features include comments from listed feminist lawyer Lena Ramone, who influenced her the way she watched this film in choosing a career as an adult movie actress after graduation . <br /> <br /> What makes ALICE IN WONDERLAND such a wonderful yacht is its garden as an institution. Partially filmed in the lush, natural splendor of Vancouver B.C. 's Stanley Park, the film is his pornographic roots. You don't get away as if you've seen a messy skin spot. At this writing I did not look at the triple XXX version. The extra sex material that is then tackled will likely disrupt the overall flow and clear the light, breezy atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Of course, the Lewis Carroll version is the best way to curl up and explore. Alice's adventures in Wonderland. However, for a time capsule that represents the adult movie archives of the 1970s, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is worth following the white rabbit for a fiery ride full of cheerful chaos.
