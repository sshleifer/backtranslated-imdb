"Sharky's Machine" is clearly a Burt Reynolds vehicle designed to relieve the harshest of his talents and spray the machine, the film, with colors from other films and styles, and provide a variety of moods in a nutrition story. . . <br /> <br /> Made in 1981 at 119 minutes (long before the era), the movie performed well, with box office grosses at $ 37.8 million. It did a lot: Burt Reynolds actor and director, a solid one-two punch; A William Diel novel adaptation, and the southern part of Atlanta Georgia, at this time an opportunity for film production from Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Reynolds's Tom Sharky falls in love with Rachel Ward's Dominoe, the hooker With a heart of gold played here as it was in "Hustle" when he played to Catherine Deneuve, and the movie also has had a corrupt politician in the core, but with a wretched end the Hollywood happiness did not come in Sharky's Machine ". <br /> <br /> The story is purely detective / action. Sharky a narcotic detective malpractice. bust of a drug dealer, causing the death of some innocent bystanders, and being demoted, literally shifted down to deal with perverts, and other murderers that "upright" police are considering latrine duty. To meet equally uplifting officers doing the dirty work that no one else wants, if some pay attention to a certain pimp, Sharky looks at some evidence and discovers that one particular prostitute is Dominoe (Rachel Ward) - Dominoe protected by police and political forces and Sharky puts herself on a 24-hour surveillance corps to see her. While he was watching, he learned that the current Governor-elected Hotchkins (Earl Holliman) were visiting Dominoes, like a slender Italian gangster Victor (Vittorio Gassman). Before police can build a case with the evidence, Billy, Victor's brother, shoots a coke-snorting armed man (Henry Silva) through the door of Dominoe's apartment that kills the beautiful Dominoes, but if Sharky discovers that the murdered victim was actually a roommate. Tiffany (Aarika Wells) Sharky confronts Victor and tells him he will arrest him. Sharky is captured by a few Ninja killers led by Smiley (Darryl Hickman) and tortured to lead information to Domino, but Sharky overwhelms them and holds the governor in arrest and, in a hardened chase, Billy dies after Victor murdered. <br /> <Reynolds wants to fall in love with the inner workings of hardened policemen, but the police story plot, fragrant with noir element, and Reynolds' ability to develop movies tends to move about the dynamics of relationships . <br /> <br /> We learn something from some of the men and this leads us to argue why they are going to work their pensions in injustice, instead of fighting real crime. This element of the film looks sketchy under Reynolds' rounded direction and performance. <br /> <br /> A Reynolds movie is always unique. He likes to rent stars, character characters or others, and allows them to improvise, sometimes with varying results. <br /> <br /> With his crew at Sharky's Machine, he gets some fine moments, and sometimes some remaining grandstanding but always a sense of ensemble and kindness. With Reynolds as author, it works. <br /> <br /> Reynolds, the actor / author always looks like he's with himself and the viewer as if it's all wrong, but nice. <br /> <br /> Big line: In the scene with Victor when Sharky throws the gauntlet. "You walk everywhere in people like your own, and you want to know the worst part? You're from outside the state." It seems to be the biggest insult the officer can throw at a criminal. <br /> <br /> Reynolds shot the film in Atlanta at his career point, wrote the phonebook and would certainly be targeted and demographic. /> <br /> The film featured the appearance of Rachel Ward, which was named New Star of the Year in 1981. <br /> <br /> Reynolds always had presence and star force and chose to make movies near the home, Georgia. <br /> <br /> I got my half.com DVD for $ 7.99 and unfortunately it doesn't comment or make any features, it's a pity. Maybe the next generation will have them. <br /> <br /> The movie is still much fun and both Reynolds and Ward are striking actors in their forefront.
