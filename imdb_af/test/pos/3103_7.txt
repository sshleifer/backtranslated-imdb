The film starts with a fiery, old Broadway producer (played exceptionally well by veteran character actor Richard Carle). He is named by a man who hopes to sell a story for an upcoming play. However, there is a bad storm and their car gets stuck in the mud and therefore they are forced to look for the night. Fortunately, there is a house nearby, but it seems pretty strange that people know the author and he says he didn't realize it was the home of a man he knew (and despised). Although it seems to be bad and confrontational writing, it is not ... as it is all part of an author's extensive rapture to have a group of actors perform in the house. On the way through the rush, however, the producer and his forehead assistant are of the opinion that the murder mystery is happening in the house, and the whole thing is pretty funny. However, what no one realizes is that an escaped maniac is loose and he will soon enter this intricate little plot for some wonderful twists and turns. So when there seems to be a real murder, the actors are really scared while Carle and his sidekick are convinced it's all a hoax. As I explained about the plot, there are many more aspects of the movie that you just have to find out - and it's sure to entertain and guess. <br /> <br /> Since it's a B-movie in the public domain, I certainly didn't have very high expectations for this small movie. However, I was excited when the movie was a lot better than average movie - with a very interesting and new twist on the old clique over a dark and stormy night in a house. Plus, while the movie's plot was very good, the dialogue was even better - with very sparkling white and a nice light fit. Full of nice surprises and worth it.
