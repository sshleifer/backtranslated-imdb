With World War II, the movie studios rushed to focus on veterinarians returning home. "The best years of our lives" were probably the best example. It shows different people returning home and how they should not only review their pre-war lives, but also the overall changing world. Probably the most interesting cast member is non-actor Harold Russell. After losing his hands in the war, he plays a man with hooks where his hands were before and reminds people to be treated just like everyone else. He also won the best supporting actor and a special Oscar for the role, making him the only person to win two Oscars for the same role. There will probably always be a debate about whether this merit Best Picture more than "It's a Wonderful Life," but I definitely think they did it well. Well done.
