Before I saw the sneak preview of Angels & Demons today, I did away with my thoughts of any uncertainty that could hold me back to enjoy it. the huge amount of hate towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all the posters. I went in with an open mind and expected the worse, but what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that's anyway good entertainment. <br /> <br /> The film hangs loosely on the actual novel itself. Harvard Symbol Robert Langdon (Hanks) pushes to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and the re-election by Papal Conclave. Arrange all these things is the Carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learns of a new threat, one of a secret fraternity that reveals his presence, an anti-matter time bomb, after which Vatican City is being targeted and kidnapping four cardinals. Langdon, using his intellectuals (and trusting me, many will be heard) gets the job of finding and saving them using the mysterious Path of Enlightenment. To help him out, CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer) is also the co-creator of the anti-matter. <br /> <br /> The movie itself runs at an odd pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss guard speed to save a branded cardinal, the next moment he leads you with useless information about every random object he passes, which slows down the book's expected action / thriller series. It allows for an interesting reading on paper, but on the screen it can go somehow. <br /> <br /> The character is recorded on the big screen. Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna, acclaimed accent. Tom Hanks has been slightly more agile, intellectual and physical, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci code. Posing Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the straight guard of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, his and Ayelet Zurer's performance is not worth it, and instead of playing a role in the story, they are only kicked as assets. <br /> <br /> But reaching Angels & Demons that DVC never could; An exciting fast-paced movie filled with satisfying explosions, beautiful recreation of St Peter's Square and Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsating midnight hour bomb. Ron Howard does a decent job of guiding this second Langdon adventure, this time taking a lot of criticism and almost completely swapping the tedious dialogue for teams. <br /> <br /> While newcomers may call it a "National Treasure 3", with a much larger threat, there is still enough contagious excitement / excitement from candy and brilliant even shots of Rome to breathe. Fans of the book may feel different from the drastic changes in the movies, but due to the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it causes, A&D is particularly good at keeping the viewer on the screen, rather than sleeping shoulder. <br /> <br /> A good book-to-movie adaptation that will both dress and entertain. <br /> <br /> 7.4 / 10
