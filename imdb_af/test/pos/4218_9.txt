The movie was amazingly amazing, especially since the last successor. The third was dark, and semi-interesting, but it wasn't nearly as nice or nice as it was. It's filled with comic lines about Martha Stuart, pop anatomy, masturbation, and it's actually done effectively during horrific and disturbing images. The movie wasn't terrifying or tense and I'm sure it wasn't the director's intention. It was nice because of the cowardice, Jennifer Tilly's top and sexy show. The puppetry of the dolls was handled so well, the movement of the mouth, lips, tears in the eyes, the knife in the chest and the costumes. The dolls were just wonderful and it made the gruesome deaths more zealous with the fact that they were done by wonderful dolls. The new chucky look was great and Tiffany was very cute. A few scenes with Chucky hugging the human Tiffany even made my dad smile. Jesse and Jade were surprisingly good-looking and the special effects were cool. The end was so unaware and the fact that they can make another so good is unlikely. It may not be as exciting as movies like Halloween H2O or Urban Legend, but it's definitely better!
