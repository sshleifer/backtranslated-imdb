Night of the Demons (1988) was another long series of "teen" horror movies released on video and pay-tsv. during that mecca of film that made the eighties. But unlike most of the crap turned around, this one was actually a decent watch. A group of bored "teenagers" decide to go Halloween night away with some bizarre sisters (Mimi Kinkade and Linnea Quigley) at the infamous Hull House. Your regular broadcasting of stereotypical teenagers is invited to the party. But an average teen bash takes place in a night of terror as they try to survive Halloween night when they decide to cripple Hull House's uncivilized residents. Who will survive this night of bloodshed and horror? <br /> <br /> A fun horror movie best viewed in the unprecedented version. If you watch the R-Rated track, you'll miss all the splatter effects and nudity. Stay quiet for the amusing epilogue! A gore movie followed by an equally entertaining sequel. Only for horror fans! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
