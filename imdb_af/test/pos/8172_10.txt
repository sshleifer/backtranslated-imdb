After I grew up a Mormon and grabbed the church's greatness toward blacks (they were not allowed to hold the church's priesthood when I was a member) - I was not aware of the organizational policies of the exploding gay men and women until after I left the church in 1966 - (I was 20.) I was surprised when I learned that gay friends were excluded even after serving missions. LATTER DAYS exposes Mormon's prosecution of gay members. The film has long been in arrears. It is an excellent task to show how the two chiefs meet, while successfully growing and developing individually. LATTER DAYS has good heart, wonderful original music and an extra touch of Jacqueline Bisset's class. The film brilliantly tells the story of an individual who leaves the secret of organized religion and regains his own soul.
