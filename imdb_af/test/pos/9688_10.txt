These movies had to be the funniest movie I've ever seen in my life. I laughed so hard that I was almost puked. After the movie was finished, I laughed for about an hour and just thought about the last thing seen in the movie. It's definitely 100 times better than the first Jackass movie. I loved seeing them all together again. If you are discouraged or don't like racial childish humor, you won't like this movie. If you can go in with an open mind and not take it so seriously, then you will lay down your ass. His incredible nobody was murdered in this movie. Each seen in this movie is so original and so different from the following, you will not know what to expect. <br /> <br /> Mike Webber
