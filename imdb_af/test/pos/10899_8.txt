"Lonely among us" is definitely one of the best first season episodes. The storyline, though somewhat confusing, creates a lot of tension, supported by the creepy synthesizer-driven soundtrack. This is a typical "alien body invasion" scenario, but ultimately it doesn't turn into an evil goal (the death of assistant chief engineer Singh for me was an accident). The two delegated species deliver an entertaining frame (best makeup so far) and eventually add a bit of black humor to the series (the final scene). Of course, Patrick Stewart enjoys a bit of his Picard character and explores some new sites, such as setting Data as Sherlock Holmes (once again classic). The special effects are also convincing and director Cliff Bole did his job well. He is the first to try to compensate Trois's lack of acting ability by improving her appearance. She looks pretty in some scenes and the neck of her dress greatly enhances her appearance. Picard's "lightning scene" on the bridge gives him a slight air of the Emperor of Star Wars "Return of the Jedi" (which is a personal impression, but I laughed). <br /> <br /> There are also some games with the relief of the corridors (simulation night on board) and the first moving camera, coming back from Picard when he enters the transport room to push into the cloud .. Nice work. The clever cut, creating a continuous dialogue through different scenes (Troi's hypnosis report) impresses with a very well-crafted TNG episode. The first one, where even Wesley Crusher was almost tolerant ... <br /> <br /> However, the end is a bit confusing, as if the producers are running out of time. "P for Picard" is a bit far-fetched and his return is too easy, but it can be set aside for the very strong moments this episode offers ...
