are you crazy or what? This movie has the talent to criticize a movie made by well-known directors and producers. I mean you should look at a crappy version, because if you had a proper version, you wouldn't think she was a low-resolution game graphics. <br /> <br /> This movie is for people who enjoy the hongkong theater, the other way around what the Asian people enjoy watching .. you are such a sale. hongkong theater is quite different from Hollywood, hk cinema is in a class of its own ... <br /> <br /> so if you don't enjoy watching movies from hong kong producers, don't go walking around how it is a waste of time to look. Just let other people enjoy the movie. <br /> <br /> Personally, I saw this movie and I love the story and the way it was made.
