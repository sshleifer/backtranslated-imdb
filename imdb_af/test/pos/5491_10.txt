I've seen quite a few action thrillers in my life and this is clearly one of the best ever! There are very few movies that I even consider watching several times and that is one of them. Everything in this movie is just right: Clint as the leading leading actor, Rene Russo as his non-stupid wife partner (it's a very rare combination - sad, but true!). Of course, John Malkowich deserves much praise for his excellent villain, but let's not stay overnight at Eastwood's original friend, played by Dylan Mcdermott, who seems to fit in perfectly with me. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic - but unfortunately it never solved an original soundtrack CD (shame for the producers!). The plot makes sense and there is no speed loss, the audience is constantly excited about the outcome of the duel between Eastwood and Malkowich. I give this one 10 stars!
