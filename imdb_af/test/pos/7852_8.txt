This is a good movie, I do not enter any details as the other user's comments do good work to care for it. However, I do not agree with the statement that it is Eastwood's best work. It's just not a very defensible position based on the volume of strong films in which he is directed. I would like to note that I find it interesting that two of the actors who played in this movie Pattye Mattick and Peggy Drier never appeared in another movie or television program, despite good performances. My curiosity wondered what happened to these two actresses?
