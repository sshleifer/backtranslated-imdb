Victor Sjöström was quite the master of this film, played it, directed it and even wrote the script! It's pretty amazing. While few people have been Sjöström today, he can be known to Ingmar Bergman fans as the star of Bergman's best-known films, WILD STRAWBERRIES. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, it's a very mixed bag. On the one hand, you have to respect it because it is a very good movie for 1921. The idea of ​​the Grim Reaper, along with a dead man to discuss his wasted life, is pretty imaginative. Plus, the special effect of the Phantom Carriage is quite convincing and technically speaking, it is a well-crafted film. On the other hand, it's an incredibly dated and beautiful movie - more than you'd expect to be shown in Sunday School instead of being honest. Plus, some of the story elements just don't make sense. Instead of getting so dedicated or good, the dying Salvation Army worker looks like a juice - a very sad and confusing juice. Why is she "in love" with this man? Am I missing something? <br /> <br /> So, my recommendation is that if you fall in love with the silence (like me), look in all respects. But if you're not a silent fan, this movie can't do anything to convince you that this style movie is brilliant, because the story is so melodramatic and dated.
