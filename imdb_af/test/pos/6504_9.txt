Wonderfully funny, awesome feature on the pioneers of gymnastics. DJ Shadow and Q-Bert are incredible in this awesome documentary. Just look at every big DJ they enroll, thanks to Herbie Hancock's post-bop classic Rockit, and an archive of some of the most complex and sensible all-time turntable routines.
