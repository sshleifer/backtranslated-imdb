Directed by Michael Curtiz, Four Daughters, about four musical talented sisters, their suitors, and their father, are a minor conductor. With sardonic, quick talk Mickey Borden is John Garfield in the role that made him an instant star. The movie also starred Claude Rains as Adam Lemp and Lane sisters, Lola, Rosemary, Priscilla and Gale Page as his daughters. His definite scene takes place in the Lemps lounge. Cigarette hangs from his lips, Borden plays one of his own compositions. Priscilla Lane's Ann Lemp tells him the piece is beautiful. But he said, "It stins." He continues: "It doesn't have a beginning or an end, just a means." Ann encourages him to start and end. Borden replied, "What? The lot is against me. They throw a coin - heads, I'm poor, tails, I'm rich. But they have tossed a two-headed coin." Audiences loved how Garfield said in his tough city voice that it was stinking. This scene created Garfield's fianc√© as the eternal outsider. Four Daughters is part of Americana with Garfield, in a compelling show, providing more than a hint of darkness. <br /> <br />
