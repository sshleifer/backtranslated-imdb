It's not quite the best Canadian movie ever, IMO. I won't get a job and call 3 or 4 better. Just a few nights before I saw the "The Bicycle Thief", the Italian classic highly rated, and there are some parallels. Both filmmakers shot their film at a specific time and place, with minimal resources in terms of sets and cast. And the result in both cases is fascinating and a joy to watch for the realistic environment and characters alone. The dipping shots over faces and landscapes make it almost worth watching. It is said, this one is not quite in the same league as the Italian classics. The movie is shot in a cute, bare Quebec asbestos mine town. That freedom is in contrast to the warmth of the people and the eye of the filmmaker Claude Jutra. Basically, what you get is a series of vignettes that are probably nostalgic memories of Jutra. Not sorry, but funny, and probably sometimes difficult, but now hot with the patina of nostalgia. The movie mundane; there is little tension. Somewhere around half to two-thirds start the story. Everyone you met to this point is involved, and you got to know these characters well. So have a little patience at the beginning. The story is a good one; It will make you think, and it involves sex, love and death, all the basic elements. If you like Bergman, Godard, Truffaut, all those kinds of things, you won't be disappointed by this.
