I really enjoyed it both times I watched it. And both times I've done away with and thought about it, and the "morale of the story". I agree with another reviewer in that the movie is not centered on the scientific aspects that you would expect from an alien-on-earth movie, but rather about the human condition. The characters in the psychiatric hospital provide a good insight into it and how they go from hopelessness to hope. This movie is sad for humor to sympathize with the final "he or she is not". The final question is well treated and although some may argue that you do not know what ultimately happens and the question is not answered, I feel it is done much more than something that is frightening, Ronin (with Robert De Niro) where you never find out what is in the box and feel very frustrated by it. I recommend K-PAX. 8/10
