I always believed that a movie that is a plot centered on a virtual reality video game never sounds like it would be something special, but eXistenZ proved I could not have been wrong anymore. This movie is incredible and, while very entertaining, offers much more than that. From start to finish, this movie has your conceptualization to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can't make a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a talent for this because he does so many things. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; The way it is written and the way it is directed is very unique to its style and it can only be a good thing. Cronenberg made himself a clear target with this movie and it was guessing the audience what he did with apparent ease. His love for the grotesque is not as dominant in this movie as it is in The Fly or Naked Lunch, but there are a few more elements such as the game pods and how they are made that can make the audience falter. With regard to its previous work, eXistenZ is more of a combination of Video Dreams and a less violent Scanners, a nice combination. Setting the film in the not-too-distant future was a very good decision, as Cronenberg was extremely imaginative with the film environment and also enabled him to visualize more concepts, making less written writing possible. It was important that the film did not get past and Cronenberg avoided it very well by keeping things relatively simple. In addition, if he wanted to make an unwavering movie, he knew how to do it much better. <br /> <br /> eXistenZ boasts an extremely talented role-players and everyone plays very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives the striking performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than he has on it. Leigh is sexy and recommends in her role as Allegra and she really gets her teeth rolling. The emotional series she shows in the film is particularly impressive, and makes her totally credible (if you can believe something). Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in his character's fear of implantation. The chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra flavor. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two of the great actors in support who add even more depth to the film, with many colorful performances. The movie is not big, but eXistenZ certainly has the 'quality is better than quantity' ethics that works very well. <br /> <br /> In addition to being entertaining and thoughtful, eXistenZ affects social issues such as self-control and loss. It also shows the film as an intellectual vessel and can also explain why it was not a great Hollywood hit. eXistenZ has so much to offer and although it is not for everyone's taste, those who love Cronenberg's work or who love science fiction will almost certainly be holding this movie. This is one of those films to be watched with an open mind, but it's really something special.
