It's probably in my Top 5 list of the funniest movies I've ever seen! I wasn't a big fan of Robin Hood, or Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, but this movie was very different! It made fun of Robin Hood, and was HILARIEUS! I was very pleased with how well it was composed and how well it was! Except for Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire and Houseguest, this was the funniest move I've ever seen! I especially love the song; "We are men in tights!" If you have a good sense of humor, you will love this movie!
