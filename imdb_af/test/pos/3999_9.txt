What a movie! I've always loved the Asian style of shooting, and this movie doesn't disappoint at all! Photography is breathtaking, ranging from wonderful landscapes to swirls of colors. The main actor is really realistic to represent the painter (whose paintings are amazing). The end is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only remark is that they might have seen the connection between his inspiration and his abuse of alcohol and women deeper. But this is an excellent movie!
