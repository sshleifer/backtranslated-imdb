A powerful debut film by Murali K. Thalluri investigating events in the life of a group of high school students, each in some way in crisis. The film begins by discovering the body of one of the students and traces the group's lives over the previous hours, leaving the audience in tense until the last minute about the identity of the deceased. Each of the main characters is faced with huge stressors that we can see as a suicide may be putting down. The role-players of unknowns offer actions full of power and emotion. Amazingly done, especially seen the youth of the author / director who was 19 years old when he wrote the script.
