This film is a study piece for my English class, but it's depth and meaning surprised me. As we carefully look at all the facts and characters in this film, its and interesting story of love, hate, war and prejudice. Well advised! <br /> <br /> Story: A girl named well-born Jewish Patty Bergen meets an escaped prisoner of war, then hides him in her playhouse in her large gardens and as they get to know each other, they begin to see the other traits, and they deserve each other's love. Patty's father despises her and treats her like dirt. Anton (the prisoner of the war) almost hit his lid to protect her, but patty drives him to stop before being seen by anyone.
