Not all movies are worthy of Oscar, but let's face it. Sometimes these types of movies are more fun to watch and leave a longer and lasting impression. This one laughed and left me happy and I couldn't wait to hug my own son. Anyone who has a pet (whatever type) knows how to lose one. I believe most people will identify with Buddy, and almost lose his best friend he raised from birth. Bruce Willis was great if the tycoon became a good guy and Joey Lauren Adams was convincing as a good mother. The little boy who played Buddy had a cherub face and his sister and friend Edgar played great backup roles. Has the movie very popular and it was something the whole family could enjoy. Thank you!
