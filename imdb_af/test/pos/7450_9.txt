Yes, I'm a FF7 fan, but how many people watching this movie are NOT going? And so, I see this movie from a FF7 fan perspective, and with no regrets. (I won't know how to review the movie enough for someone who didn't play the FF7 game.) Visuals - 10/10 I loved Advent Children. It's a sensory pleasure - a complete audio video overload. The visuals were breathtaking: a few feats were reached that I simply couldn't imagine with an animated feature. When the action originated scenes, they were, because of a more accurate word, a roller coaster. With a dramatic camera movement moving across the range, seamless integrated bullet-time effects at critical moments, to the level of detail - it's hard to make mistakes. The animation looks great budget, the style and images are great, and the effects have prevented me from forgetting that I watched animation rather than live action recordings. I can overpower for hours for the fantastic quality of the visuals, but it simply won't be fair. <br /> <br /> Sound - 10/10 The sound was fantastic. The voices for all the characters did not disappoint (no one sounded) and the sound effects were bold and sharp. The music - of the game that (in my opinion) had the best soundtrack ever, was beautifully transmitted to the movie. Most of the unforgettable themes in the game are present in the movie, although they are often used with different instruments to better suit what is going on. There have been some rocky rocks and some thirsty metal metal from time to time on the very intensive action scenes, but it all fits in well with the movie's situation at the same time. <br /> <br /> Story - 7/10 The story and characters will be the main mistakes of the movie. Both aspects were simply not the same as the game - but then the game could spend 40+ hours developing these points - the movie only lasts about 90 minutes. As far as the story goes, the plot wasn't bad or anything, but not as ambitious as someone who had played the game. In effect, the plot was fairly poor in comparison. The game was so outrageous with the complicated plot and story progression / development that the movie never really had a chance to compete in the same league. Instead, the film adopted the more meaningful approach - expanding the action and placing so many jokes and themes into itself instead of impossible to restore the massive story factor that was originally such a driving force . The lack of Materia use also caused me a controversy - the story of the movie chose to use little (though not NERO) Materia, and rather many supernatural fighting skills and skills. I hope that as a successor, Materia will be much more exorbitant and more important in the film. There were also lots of plot holes in the movie - all that can be forgiven if you think of Advent Children as a random anime, but look ridiculous when you realize how it is based on a game that has performed very well. <br /> Characters - 7/10 The characters, while all in one form or another, do not necessarily shine their true potential. There simply isn't enough movie time to spend with them. And so all their background stories and abilities are not quite displayed, and in some cases, almost not at all (Red and Cait Sith leave absolutely no real lasting impressions). Even Cloud, which is the focal point of the movie, I do not feel enough of its familiar abilities from the game. The Materia problem is a strong reason for this. Having said that, it is a joy to see the setback in action, even if it is in such a role that they do not fully exploit. The new characters, however, were the one who caused me the most of the strife - the Bad Guy Trio and the child Duzel - there was a huge lack of explanation about any of them. Anyone who is willing to use their imagination can probably fill the spaces with something more reasonable and done with it, but objectively the problem is still there to comment and is therefore a little disappointing. <br /> <br /> Value - 10/10 The repetition value for this movie is excellent. I want to see it personally in a bigger and bigger way - bigger screen, higher volume. Enjoy - 10/10 Whatever the movie's mistakes, they simply weren't big enough to stop my enjoyment from it, and I honestly think it would be the same for most people. I enjoyed Advent Children immensely, and encouraged fellow FF7 fans to see it.
