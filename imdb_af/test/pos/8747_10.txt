I was disappointed with the recent (2000) American remake of this English mini-series. Although it followed the plot line very carefully, it left the heart and soul of the original. Not to mention the addition of level precise heavy-handed 'messages' ... So my advice is to skip the modern remake and stick to the original. It is much longer, but gripping and well done. Interesting, complex and textured, without the beautiful self-righteousness ... and it's also beautifully shot. <br /> <br /> I find it mysterious that this heartless remake of great overseas films gets so much Hollywood fanfare at the Oscars. (Although I liked Benicio Del Torro, I received a deserving praise ...)
