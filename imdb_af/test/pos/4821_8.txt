There is seldom seen a film successor who exceeds or even looked the greatness of his original predecessor. Such a movie is VIrtual Encounters 2. <br /> <br /> It's about a few guys in college selling virtual sex across the campus. If you want to see naked chicks, deliver this one. Six Foot Long Chrissy Styler is a wonderful monster and you will dream about her for days if you have ever been lucky enough to catch the unprecedented version. She only wears the right amount of body glitter in her multiple nude scenes and her huge cans really look. (= Giddyup !! <br /> <br /> With the exception of James Cameron's "Aliens" Francis for Coppola's "The Godfather Part II" and - of course - the Zuckers "Airplane 2", that's the only sequel in film history that takes a classic movie and improves it. <br /> <br /> It is criminal how this film has been ignored by the academy, Nikki Fritz and the broad who are tied up in the beginning (as well as the brunette who opposed the get a weakening) earn all the best supporting actress buttons. <br /> <br /> Shame on you, Hollywood !!!
