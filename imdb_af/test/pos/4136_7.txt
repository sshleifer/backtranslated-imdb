It would be unwise to consider that it is either narrative or documentary more authentic than the other. Both formats have an underlying form of fiction and are never a true reflection of reality as producers attempt to reconstruct and tell stories in their perspectives. As both formats usually interrupt some problems due to "subplots complexity" and screen time, it denies viewers the opportunity to open debates and further investigate and construct true truth. Adding to the viewer's inability to evaluate sources (eg, comparisons with written history) and the logic behind arguments, history can be open to distortion through narratives and documentaries. <br /> <br /> For most people, documentaries can be seen more truthfully as it usually involves the testimonies of actual participants and actual imagery. However, these visuals are selected and edited so that they can be arranged in a way that producers can present their version of realism to viewers. In the Real Buddy Holly Story, Paul McCartney tries to establish the Buddy Holly as remembered by family and friends and how Buddy influenced the rest of the music world. The testimonies may be distorted because memories may not be accurate and emotions have evolved to make a legend from Buddy. The documentary made corrections to the film version and dealt with other events, as there were 3 cricket people and that Buddy's music was actually heard outside the US (he had to start on a world tour!). However, it does not have in-depth discussion about what happened to Buddy's wife after his death. Criticism and / or negative talks can be left out of the documentary, as the producers are trying to present a buddy who had to remember the world. Ultimately, we fail to build the whole truth, as we confine ourselves to the past's realities that the documentary tells us. <br /> <br /> Personally, I prefer a narrative movie because it offers rich visual images that help us connect to the collective memory of that era. This gives the audiences a more constructive structure of the story, and this leads to better memory retention for audiences when they repeat the story. There is also an element of flexibility with which filmmakers can express their thoughts and views on certain issues. In the Buddy Holly Story, racial issues have been highlighted and viewers can certainly relate to current issues with these issues. <br /> <br /> Moviegoers consistently try to look at certain emotions when watching a movie and using these emotions, audiences can choose to make personal connections with the applied meanings that a filmmaker wants to deliver. In most stories, people are more inclined to selectively remember the struggle, the inspiration, and the way the story ends. Through the Buddy Holly Story we remember the struggle, Buddy and the Cricket, how Mary was a source of encouragement, and Buddy Holly was a good artist until the day he died.
