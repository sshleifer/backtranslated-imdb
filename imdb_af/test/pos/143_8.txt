I am the first to admit that Chan-wook Park's Thirst has been exceptionally good, but spending two hours with Tae-joo (OK-vin Kim) is enough for someone to tolerate so long. Sang-hyeon (Kang-ho Song) is a priest who wants to volunteer for experimental studies on those who are willing to subject themselves to severe injections of a particular virus that kills infections. Instead of legally dying, Hyeon becomes a vampire. He always longs for the maintenance that gives blood to him to fight a contagious disease, which causes the symptoms that have been fed flat. (.. bumps / sores, and the body bleeds blood). Sunlight, as known in the vampire genre, causes a painful death if exposed to Hyeon for a long time. Hyeon falls with Tae-joo, the wife of the sick childhood Kang-woo (Ha-kyun Shin), in the desire. Tae-joo was taken by Mrs. Ra (Hae-sook Kim), considered a puppy, is used almost as a pet to be ordered. Ta-joo is miserable in this situation and starts a cruel case she institutes with Hyeon, who quickly manipulates him to kill Kang woo by believing that she is a victim of abuse. Hyeon rejects his priesthood in the relationship with Tae-joo, who is soon prepared to kill Kang woo. This incident, which Tae-woo contributed to (using a boat, in the middle of a lake, burying both of them underwater, Tae-woo has entrusted him with Kang woo while trying to going back in) both ghosts as circumstances arise with Kang woo "missing" (Hyeon got rid of him, where the police would not get his body). Soon, Mrs Ra had a stroke (but one finger and the ability to pinch her eyes greatly contributed to the story, proving that she is more aware than they have led to believe) and Hyeon gives Tae-joo a special birthday gift .. vampirism. In doing so, Hyeon created a monster. Tae-joo acknowledges (though a tongue-gag) that Kang-woo never hurt her and if she gets thirsty for blood, it soon realizes that killing a supply doesn't bother her morally or psychologically. Tae-joo becomes such a hand, Hyeon must take desperate measures to stop such a threat to society itself. <br /> <br /> I would say that Dors is one of the best horror movies I take This is a methodical approach that Park takes and we are led by a dark road with Hyeon and Tae-joo as they are terrible acts with nothing positive from their unholy union. Innocent people die for Tae-joo because of Hyeon's love (which once was the end of an obsessive love), and it will stop ending if he doesn't make a painful choice. We see in their heads, their souls, and it is not always beautiful. 2 hours with them can be quite exhausting. But credit to the director not to push for devastating behavior and how the powers of vampirism can be given to the wrong people. Hyeon, who is regarded as a very pleasant soul at the opening, accepts hell for Tae-joo, so one can look at Dors as a unique love story, but not exactly a healthy one. <br /> <br /> Regarding The Violence, while Park has a tendency to move away from extremely graphic details, there is enough sadism involved in perhaps changing the stomach a bit. The way the violence is carried out can have at least a lasting impact. The sexual situations between Hyeon and Tae-joo can be reasonably hot and erotic, while also being sordid and morally reprehensible. The film, I think, is quite a complex investigation of the lengths that one will remain attached to an object of love (lust).
