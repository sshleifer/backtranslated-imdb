Mullholland Drive once again proves that David Lynch is the master of cinematic expression. At the show, I saw a brilliant addition to the history of the theater last night. The performances are amazing, the score captivated, and the photography fascinating. David's ability to weave the many elements of filmmaking into a unique and wonderful film experience is unmatched. Looking at Mullhollandry, I couldn't help but realize that with David Lynch in this world we are truly blessed. The cinema is also blessed, because David Lynch's films show that one-man vision can be realized with great results. We realize that blockbusters are not the only way. We realize that a true movie artist has a chance in this world and that we are indeed blessed.
