As someone who usually despises Ali G, Ali G Indahouse was absolutely brilliant. When I saw this, I was in a hysterical fit. Yes, it is sexist, rude and extremely rough, and I love it. Since some comedies only have one or two comic scenes, this movie was laugh-a-thon. I have never seen a comedy as originally like Ali G Indahouse. For a comedy with Ali G, it would probably be an 8 out of 10. Absolutely Brilliant.
