It was one of the best half-hour horror / suspense / fantasy shows of the eighties, no doubt. Admittedly, the show threw a scarce skill with every episode, and it stank as far as production values ​​(ie sets) went, but I have to give it a little credit to be gutsy with the plots. I mean the plot of every episode was edgy enough that even me, a hardened horror movie, shock movie, and 70's grind buffalo, got a bit sick and crawled. Great show, just fine, no matter what the other reviewers said. My favorite episode is called "Bug House", yes it was the title I think? Anyway, it still gives me the wills every time I think about it, almost 20 years after it was first proposed. Other ways like "Tales From The Darkside", "The Outer Limits" and (of course) "The Twilight Zone" were definitely better-value values, but I think it's not as far as plot lines go compared to this sick little one. show! It definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult-classic phenomenon that "Tales From The Crypt" was.
