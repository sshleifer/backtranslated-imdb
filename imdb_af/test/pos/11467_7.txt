Public enemies are a kind of setback for the early 1960s gangster biographies such as PORTRAIT OF A MOBSTER, MAD DOG COLL and KING OF ROARING TWENTIES. Although made cheap, the movie has a lot of energy and the play about everything, especially by Eric Roberts and Frank Stallone, is pretty good. Theresa Russell may look too glamorous like Mom, but she has some very good moments. There are two action scenes that are notable: a shooting in a hotel and a machine gun fighting in the middle of the street between the Barkers and the FBI. Both series are well done, and compared to other lower bidder bands like DILLINGER AND CAPONE, this film shines.
