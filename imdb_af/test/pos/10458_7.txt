The movie starts almost sadly, a "romance" (yawn) that goes without saying (all the part of the plan ...) Then about an hour in this solemn movie The Feast. It is worth paying attention to the first hour. The festival is still solemn but humorous. Suddenly the drawn and slightly grandchildren come to life, and everyone (you and the characters) enriches the feeling through the experience. <br /> <br /> Women will like it. Christians of all kinds will enjoy the profound faith shown by the characters. Not my favorite movie of all time - no dinosaurs or laser beams - but definitely a movie I liked. Not missed. <br /> <br /> Jim
