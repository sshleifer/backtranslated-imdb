The Pickle was the most underrated movie of the decade. Despite my best efforts at home, it's still considered a bad movie. I say to hell with everyone about this. Not everyone understands that it's part of a dramatic end-of-life comedy. Danny Aiello plays a burnt director with perfection and carries a sad depressive man. The scene when he tries to record a last message is pretty good. The interludes of Stones movie are absolutely funny. "It's Harry Stone and today I become a man!" In all a fine and sad film misunderstood. Plus a great came by Little Richard. Hilarious! I hope more people see this movie because 202 people aren't enough for a consensus. <br /> <br /> -Silence Dogood
