Patricia Arquette plays American doctor Laura Bowman, who takes a holiday to Burma in an attempt to heal her spirit after her husband and young son's murders. She is left in Rangoon during a military repression and leaves the city with an aging man working as a "tour guide". But he is not a simple tour guide; he is a professor who introduces her to life outside the tourist valley ... the two of them are caught up in the political upheaval and Laura sees with her own eyes the government betraying and suppressing his own people. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of my favorites because of its themes. First, it is informal (describe some of the injustices that occur in Burma). Secondly, it's about a woman's struggle to find meaning in life after an incredible loss. Thirdly, it is about compassion and sacrifice, and people come together - without knowing each other - to endure pain and fear. Just about every beautiful scene in this movie is important; nothing is wasted here. It's a serious and moving movie. There is also a very emotional score compiled by Hans Zimmer that complements beautiful screens. <br /> <br /> A specific recommendation, especially for people who have human rights ... and people who want to know, "What purpose can I serve?" <br /> <br />
