It's a great movie, about a soul of Ale. It's a journey to Ale's heart. I found it fascinating. The director did a good job. He speaks the scenes. Especially on quiet scenes. The window of Ale is a wonderful one. A screen when lying in bed is one of the best directed scenes I've seen. <br /> <br /> Apart from directing. It has been some time. I didn't watch a movie about a soul. As a philosopher I can say, this film proves that age doesn't matter about your soul. So like Ale's soul. <br /> <br /> If I live in Turkey, I don't care about the other side of NY. It's a universal scene that you can see all over the world. What my opinion is more universal than any other thing. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. Otherwise you will miss a good thing about a soul. If you have one. <br /> <br /> Baris
