In this early Fulci work, the director shows his most mainstream team, as well as a compelling storytelling talent and more than reasonable explanation for the genre. Personally, I think he's been unfairly hurt throughout his career as an esthete of gore. This is a proper process and has surprised me with its sub-textually rich narrative, showing its distrust of the cunning little-minded mentality and inefficiency of the police, as well as the distorted ideals of the Catholic Church, the last of which was cut. this film on its knees when it was first released and possibly the director could give another direction as early as possible. The comparative lack of gore in the film shows an urgent and psychological necessity for this film in its prevailing "mystery", but the gore and puppetry it uses is particularly well-used in the scene where a falsely accused murderer is senseless was launched by a multitude of men in a cemetery and set aside in a show of dirty and outdated vigilance, which was corrupted on the modern scene of a deadly radio. <br /> <br /> Another example was the final scene (which was indeed awesome) in which a strikingly attractive priest falls from a cliff and the puppet used is noticeable in a medium rise that emphasized his demonic appearance and clear ugliness. Curiously, taking into account his later works, Fulci also claims the notion of modernity that has taken on the hamlet of his anachronistic superstition and ignorance when the idea of ​​black magic is just like that, a beautiful idea of ​​supernatural evil that never really the voodoo dolls while his witch does nothing more than a disturbed woman. Another thing I liked was that he added these character files by making a bourgeois city girl in an ambiguous figure - is she the priest's fears for his wards and maybe better for himself? This giallo lends itself to one of Fulci's more personal and substantive films, because we actually get a fair influx of ideas from him.
