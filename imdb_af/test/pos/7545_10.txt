This bright, hilarious English comedy about schoolgirl antiques is a neglected gem. The important question is where the audience is? The movie is voted by most voters 10, but how many voters is it? They no longer make comedies like this, because the movies are not spreading or seen. I will never miss a chance to see this old art school again. But where are the art houses?
