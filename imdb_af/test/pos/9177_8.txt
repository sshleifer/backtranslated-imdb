It's hard to find in this fast food community that we live in such a man. Hitch has a duty to help men find love with women who have fallen in love with them. his rules are that he just helps you find love and not just a casual sex that looks like a big deal, but soon the word begins to spread and people start to get the wrong idea about what he is doing what the relationship with woman has just become so difficult that he falls in love with. <br /> <br /> I have to say it's really nice to see Smith in a movie that doesn't try to save the world of aliens or robots. There are no jaw effects, nor does he show his jaw. He's just a normal man in this movie that was really nice. He does not necessarily stretch his working muscles in this movie, but then the story doesn't ask that, but it was nice to see him relaxed and not pointing his torn body to make those of us without six packets of jealousy. . His character here, like all his characters, is nice, witty and lots of charm that looks like almost all the characters in this strange love story. The Kevin James character is just a regular guy who needs help with the girl of his dreams that really makes you feel the man and carries him every step of the way. The only character that hurt me was the Mendez character because she was so cold and calculated that it was hard to believe that Smith could fall for her. He must love a challenge I think. <br /> <br /> Now it's the part of the review that I will joke about how I never need Hitch, because I'm such a player, but I just got through the writing of about 16 reviews for another site plus I'm still working on a small project, so I'm a little jaded now. Even though the movie is full of charm and fun characters with funny lines, it slowly but surely falls into the sea of ​​formal romantic movies, which have been forgiven to the great scene where the terrible secret comes, and the relationship is even better than before. But hey there are like 4000 films about the underprivileged victory adversity, so I think one movie that has a predictable ending that is almost dead has not caused much damage. I also like the message of the movie, because in the end you don't need a formula to get the right girl, be yourself and everything will fall into the game that is the theme of the movie and why it good work. I'm sure it seems the James character gets the girl after he has followed everything that the Smith character said. It would be a pretty empty movie, but as it stands, it really works well. <br /> <br /> Although predictable, it's a PERFECT date movie. It's sweet, it's funny, and it's romantic, so somebody watching this movie on a date should get a little after it's over. and by some I mean sex
