Three words: Piece Art. This movie is not nice. It is beautiful, sad, frightening and exciting at the same time. The score is always in my head, the acting is wonderful, the landscape is scary and beautiful at the same time. <br /> <br /> It was more coincidental than intended to see this movie. When I decided to watch this movie, I was just bored and read lists of Asian movies, which might be good. Well, I saw the title "a story of two sisters" that sounded very interesting. Then I read the summary of the plot and decided, "Don't just watch this movie, you have to buy it." Said, done. I bought this movie and chopped off the first minute. <br /> <br /> From the beginning to the end, the plot interested me. the turn near the end of the movie made me shout. I really didn't see anything like this coming. And the final scene made me cry ... it just made me cry. It was so sad. <br /> <br /> Well, I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie combining an interesting plot, with scary scenes and atmosphere. Although you should be aware of the fact that the end, as I have mentioned, is a very sad one. But it just fits in the mood of the movie or not?
