In this peculiar movie, the themes of the end-days and Satan versus Jesus are treated in a new way. Jesus does not want to open the last two seals, and Satan is being thwarted in his attempt to find another soul in hell. Armageddon, Armageddon and Jehoshaphat seem to be a company! And the book of life is a little difficult to open. <br /> <br /> What is memorable about this movie is the oblique image, out of focus shots and light effects, which are effective but sometimes annoying. And of course, Donovan is wonderful as a disillusioned Jesus trying to agree with what the world and its people have become! So, see it if you get the opportunity!
