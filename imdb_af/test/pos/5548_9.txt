It was a very well written film, and the actors had a very beautiful way to portray the character. but if the movie came to an end, I felt like there was more, but they forgot to put it on the DVD. Maybe they plan to make a successor ... even if they aren't, it's a good movie and a good rental, but even a better purchase.
