Boogie Nights is full of surprises, nothing prepares one, it's his soul. Yes, it has soul, while the most touching of the subject is addressed, with both a cruel smile and respect. Spectacularly cast and wonderful character development, the performances somehow combine the best of the scene with improvisation in a cinema-style style. <br /> <br /> The plot has grown richer than I expected and the underlying themes are deeply drawn as every B-level person is brought into perspective by crisis. <br /> <br /> A sociologist's dream study, the film resonates the raw truth of what we all lack of self-esteem, parental love and lack of It, attention / love and its manifestation in adulthood, the desperate need to should. Something for everyone here .. almost camouflaged as issues of untouchables and their separate environment, but of course they are universal. <br /> <br /> The movie works on a number of levels. The ironic desire is that the environment is depicted only as a result of the voyeur, which sees the film ... <br /> <br /> Boogie Nights is not condemning his subject and characters, a rarity. It deserves every award it has made and more.
