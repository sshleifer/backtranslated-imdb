After seeing a Texas Languages ​​or Treason, Cox couldn't even afford the courageous correspondence efforts to get the massive collusion Stu up without any budget. It tells a story about devotion, sweat, whip, fire and punk rock. I love it! My favorite parts are the interviews with Marci (she is such a hot baby, and she digs me but she doesn't know yet). The Japanese clerk muffled his lines, which cracked me. The sex scene was really cool. I'm going to see if Stu comes somewhere and does the box light wave thing if I do it with my wife. The intro and of course my 5 seconds during closing credits. I know it's gonna get me chicks. I hope to see more of Antwerp because I know I can expect the unexpected.
