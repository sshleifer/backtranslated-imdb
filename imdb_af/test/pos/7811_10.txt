This movie is one of the best Hindi comedies ever made. Rajkumar Santoshi is well known for his eager, stubborn social dramas, but it's easily the effortless movie he made. <br /> <br /> The plot revolves around two small towns, Amar (Aamir Khan) and Prem (Salman Khan). They want to get rich quickly and so move to the big city. They hatch the same plan separately - to woo a rich heir to Raveena (Raveena Tandon) who is the daughter of a rich businessman Ramgopal Bajaj (Paresh Rawal). So, the one who marries Raveena gets his hands on all her wealth. But if they know each other's plan, there is an intense intercourse of one-man custody over who marries Raveena. Hilarious gags and situations follow when the battle rages. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Ramgopal wants to eliminate Bajaj's identical twin brother, Shyamgopal Bajaj, from his brother and cousin and take up the family's fortune. Add a variety of funny characters, including a Raveena's girlfriend Karishma (Karishma Kapoor), a flawless farmer named Robert (Vijoo Khote), a manager named Bhalla (Shehzad Khan), who is the former Ajeet's villain, Kapoor ) that looks more like a pirate and a rolling comedy, is waiting for you. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time searching LOGIC in the movie. Leave the family out of your brain and just enjoy it. The actors are so much in line with the writing that there is no room for error. Dialogue (Rajkumar Santoshi, Dilip Shukla) is greasy. Music (Tushar Bhatia) and lyrics (Majrooh Sultanpuri) are memorable. The picture and choreography (Saroj Khan) of "Yeh Raat Aur Yeh Doori", "Ae Lo Ji Sanam" and "Dil Karta Hai Tere Easter Aaoon" fit and will be etched forever in my mind. <br /> <br /> The movie played two superstars in the making, Aamir Khan and Salman Khan (they eventually became superstars). Aamir Khan is immaculate in his first all-out comedy role. I greet his sense of comic timing. Salman is light compared to Aamir, but is still nice. Among the supporting characters are Paresh Rawal in his double role of Ramgopal and Shyamgopal. <br /> <br /> The movie has surprisingly failed at the box office. I don't understand why. However, I recommend it to everyone.
