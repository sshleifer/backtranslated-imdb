This film tells the stories of several couples dealing with World War II. Through many moving accounts, the audience learns how the War has changed people while overcoming their human spirit. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is where a young servant, who has returned as a double tutor (losing both arms to the elbow) is sure he won't be his dearest, still with wants to get married. His girlfriend simply said she would help him with the things he couldn't do, but that they would be good together. The man embraced his fianc√© in tears. <br /> <br /> The scene of a bank loan servant is also a highlight. When initially denied a high risk, a higher-ranking bank official takes over and says, "You have fought for our country and kept us safe. It's good enough for me. Your loan has been approved!" "The best years of our lives" have won 6 Oscars, including a special statue for the disabled actor who has shown us everything about life and will still be worth living, even with a serious lack. This movie is a joy to watch over and over. A true classic! Highly recommended!
