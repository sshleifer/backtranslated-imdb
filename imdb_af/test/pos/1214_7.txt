It was a very good PPV, but like Wrestlemania XX about 14 years later, the WWE played so many games in it, some of the games were useless. I'm not going through every game on the card, because it will last forever. <br /> <br /> But great highlights include the BIG pop for the demolition that won the ties of Haku and Andr√© the Giant, The first mixed tag game with Randy Savage and Sensational Queen Sherri against Stom Rhodes and the late Sapphire and the first clash between Ultimate Warrior and Hulk Hogan. <br /> <br /> Some games were a total waste of time. As the Bolsheviks vs. The Hart Foundation were only about 40 seconds long, Koko B True vs Rick Martel was short and Big Bossman vs Akeem was too short. <br /> <br /> Mr. Perfect vs Brutus Beefcake and Ted DiBiase vs Jake 'the Snake' Roberts was indeed very good. <br /> <br /> Overall Grade - B
