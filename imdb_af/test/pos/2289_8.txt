Many believe this movie is a baseball movie. Such people are disappointed because it's about a baseball player, but the movie isn't about baseball. Some think this movie is a romantic comedy and is disappointed because the relationship is not really developed. This movie is not a romantic comedy. <br /> <br /> This movie is about culture. An arrogant American big-lease and a strictly traditional Japanese baseball driver can't succeed because they can't understand each other. This is after they succeed in breaking through the cultural barrier that they have success. The ballplayer becomes more Japanese in his team mentality and the manager more American to allow individual performance and meet in the middle. <br /> <br /> Baseball and romance are subordinate to this criticism of the two cultures. Many who have no understanding of the Japanese mindset miss it and think it is a movie on baseball or romance and sees the culture clash as a soft comedy relief. This is not - the culture clash is the spade of the movie. Based on my own experience and understanding of Japanese culture, I think this movie did pretty well because it did not exaggerately romanticize Japanese culture and did not exceed it in its portrayal. <br /> Overall, I believe it's a pleasant and relaxing movie if you understand what it's really about.
