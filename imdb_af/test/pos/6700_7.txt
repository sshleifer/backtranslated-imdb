Lifeforce is definitely one of Tobe Hooper's best films. It has some special special effects and lots of nudity, so it looks like a typical horror of its dream. However, the film is creative and I think it's because of Dan O'Bannon's and Don Jakoby's script. Beautiful cinematography and a good creepy atmosphere make it a solid film.
