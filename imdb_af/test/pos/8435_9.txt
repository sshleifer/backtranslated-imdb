The China Syndrome is a perfect pace and is not slow or boring, as some people tend to say. The transitions from one scene to another are wonderful and the tension that builds up in the film keeps the edge of your seat for two hours. Jack Lemmon is great, as always, if the somewhat nervous plant operator and Jane Fonda succeed in bringing true emotions into the story. You can see this movie as a political statement of the time, or just like an intelligently made thriller. Anyway, it's definitely worth watching.
