GZSZ is Germany's longest running daily soap and it is cult! I started watching it from the first day, and I tied it from the beginning. Over the years, so much has changed, the old characters like Heiko, Elke, Tina, Saskia etc. Remained and newcomers appear like Marie, Kai, Cora or John. I have to say that I kept GZSZ better in the years 1995-2000 because today the show focuses too much on the younger characters. My favorite character is Sonja Wiebe, as she is the twilight person ever on that soap and she is also one of the most interesting characters on the show. Tina Bordihn was wonderful as the first Sonja, but as Tokessa became Sonja's recycling, the character became even better.
