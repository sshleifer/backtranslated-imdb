Who said it had to be credible? Do yourself a favor and turn your ration off before you sit down to watch this movie. You will enjoy the experience much more. You will forgive yourself forgiving the movie's more outlandish plot set-ups, and just accepting it for what it is - a great family movie. I appreciated not having to worry about "dubious elements" in a children's movie for a while. This is worth the price of the ticket. And it manages to maintain its health without being over it - older chidlren will enjoy this movie. Enough good humor for adults interested. Very good movie.
