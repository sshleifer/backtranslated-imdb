I heard from John Garfield but didn't know him. I loved this movie. I've never heard of it. I picked it randomly. John Garfield is a boxer in the movie. He was also in real life, so he knew his part. He was a refugee in the movie. Someone else killed a man. He's character is blamed. He is a friend of a family who has questions and is not quite sure what to do about him. All kinds of small plots occur. My favorite was the scary swimming scene in a water tower where the water was deep and one Dead End Kid couldn't swim and no one could get out. John's character saves the day. The Dead End Kids were great like his friends and followers. One of them is right to the end. Ann Sheridan played the family's daughter and John's ultimate love interest. She was credible, but not in my opinion, the only weak link in the movie.
