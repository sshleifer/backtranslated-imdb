Actually unique and beautiful film by Jules Verne's "For the Flag" by Czech master director Karel Zeman. Although the story is set in a fairly understated Victorian style, the footage is a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader has associated with his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added. Written in beautiful black and white is the animation of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety. There are underwater ranges where the fish swim so accurately that they can be used in a field guide. There are images of ships, submarines, flying crafts, castles and machinery drawn so accurately that one has to freeze frame on his video recorder or DVD to break the scene and study the remarkable detail that has taken place in this production. The late Victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world that never satisfied us in the magic of science, which Verne's grandfather of the genre. If that is not enough, there is also the movie score that is probably one of the best ever created for a fantasy or sci-fi movie. It's a forgotten classic, this is worth hunting and buying. Always one of my favorite movies of all time, this is probably one of yours. And remember - it's been done decades before CGI or computer animation. Kudos for the great artists who make their hearts clear. It shows. Jules Verne himself will be proud of this movie. A movie that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it love it and treasure it. An excellent performance, this remarkable movie just gets better every time you see it. A true film work by a visionary director.
