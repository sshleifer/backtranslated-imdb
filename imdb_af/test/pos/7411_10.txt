"Pharaoh's army" denies the formula. Instead of selling out for clich√©s and big stars, it relies entirely on the excellent acting of a strong role, the strength of a well-written script and a fascinating and bitter story. The result is a raw and realistic fast moving film with a heavy emotional stream. One of the best I've ever seen about the Civil War, and I think it can be a pleasure to be an independent film (if you like this movie, try the similarly impressive Indian Civil War movie "Wicked Spring" as well). <br /> <br /> "Pharaoh" simply tells the true story of a small expedition / food team of union men riding in a Confederate farm to provide, but to get stuck there because of an accident from one of the men. Stress goggles and relationships are made and broken. Nothing happens as Hollywood would write it; This movie comes from the mind of someone who actually cares for quality film and the story of history. Excellent dialogue and plot layout moves along a movie that looks very professional, but often doesn't feel like watching a movie, more in the sense of the trial. <br /> <br /> The movie boasts an incredible performance by Chris Cooper, which shows a wonderful versatility in exploring his role. He transforms, but is always aware of credibility and is easy to relate emotionally. Patricia Clarkson is equally strong and realistic in a role that many actresses will crumble. She shares an interesting chemistry with Cooper's character and where she is the more serious of the characters, it's still so easy to identify. The rest of the roll is good and fulfills their roles well. <br /> <br /> The art design and set is wonderful and I personally like cinematography. It all has the feel of a photo of the Civil War era with the camera giving strong contrasting colors and shades and a tin-like metal color, but always keeping the naturalistic appearance of the rustic environment. They seem to have used natural lighting, but everything they used works beautifully. Everything seems to be where it is, it feels like time, something I hardly find in American movies. The actors act in the 19th century, not like the 20th century people in old clothes. <br /> <br /> Above all, this movie is very personal. I think it can afford an indie. The movie is almost flawless with an excellent script that effortlessly creates and explores the relationships and personalities of these characters and lets them grow in a situation as bad as it is. It does not fail to get the point over, and it touches the point without the usual and overused techniques used in all war films today. It is brave. It relies on its characters, a fantastic manuscript, human emotion and in the cold fact that the Civil War was not all CGI, big stars and hoop dresses.
