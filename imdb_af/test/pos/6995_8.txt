This movie is a variation of a theme we've all seen over and over - the Posiedan adventure in space. The characters are all stock characters - festive heroine, Judas, coward, etc. Etc. The only question really is who is sniffing. Sometimes these proven formulas - as in this case - but more often not - are like the really sensible "Red Planet". <br /> <br /> So why does this one work? Because it's stylish. The acting is above average. And above all, it's not predictable. The conclusion was not signed. I really had no idea how it would end and was amazed at how it ended. This alone earns top marks in my book. <br /> <br /> It's an interesting and entertaining movie. And although it never changes the face of the theater as we know it, it doesn't disappoint.
