I was really surprised when I got this movie on cable television a few years ago. The story is a wonderful example of how our country keeps changing and the battle to hang on it and use it according to need. Conflicting desires of "the people" and the government. The actors were fantastic in their portrayals and I absolutely fell in love with Tantoo Cardinal. She is so credible and was such a character in this movie, like Rip Torn. The story was also a love story about the country, the past and the two main characters. I tried to buy this movie and couldn't find it, but I'd love to have it.
