I just watched this movie, and I have to say it surprised me. It was done very well, with good acting and a deep look at high school students from Japan, in adolescent love. <br /> <br /> The look and feel is very different from many movies, and you can easily enter the movie. Much of the emphasis appears to be in the story itself, which is extremely subtle. The main theme and relationships with other characters is a bit complex. But the overall feeling of realism and dimensions still draws you. <br /> <br /> Of course, an important sign is those who want something simple. What is not here. You need to be open to many things, including a new culture, to get more into the movie. <br /> <br /> I've been enjoying this movie. It's worth watching.
