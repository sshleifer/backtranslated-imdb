Todd Sheets has ever created one of the biggest LOW BUDGET Zombie movies. The story is wonderful, the gore is great, the psychos is evil! Yet, the film is flawed by its small dialogue and slow image display. <br /> <br /> Despite this, ZB2 who has to do any Zombie movie is a good plot, a quick adventure in the Macarbe. If only MR sheets have given a 100k budget, this movie will ever run every Zombie movie even the almighty Dawn of the Dead. <br /> <br /> But as time goes by, he gets better and if he gets better money comes into his pocket. In this way, this man can improve Genius's vision better this modern day. <br /> <br /> Just remember that Zombie Bloodbath 2 was just one of his great stepping stones when he was on Gore Mountain.
