I watched this movie in Austin Texas at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival and it was my festival favorite. The gymnast is a movie that should not be missed. It's an honest story about relationships, self-discovery, aging and the courage to change and move forward. Not only is this a good story, but the glorious aerialist performances of Dreya Weber and Addie Yungmee will take your breath away! See this movie! It will be near you soon after a festival. This movie is instantly earned by a large network or studio. I'll definitely buy it when available on DVD.
