Jewel Thief is one of those tension teams in which the viewers keep thinking who the villain is. Suspensions build the very first scene when the jewel thief becomes a national problem and there are clever clues in the movie so you can guess who the jewel is. The story shows that Dev Anand (Vinay in the movie) and the jewel thief have identical faces. But you get a 1000 watt shock when you finally get to know the villain. There are many surprises and lots of fiber, but there is time for romance and six melodic, enduring songs sung by Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, Kishore Kumar and Mohmmad Rafi. <br /> <br /> This movie was also talking about his song's videos. Consider the pest and counter in Asman Ke Neeche. Or blocking the road by Dev Anand when Tanuja went out with her friends in Yeh Dil after Hota Bechara. Or the romantic Dil Pukare is in the beautiful Sikkim. Or the wonderful dance by Vyjantimala in Hotho Pe Aisi Baat. Add Rulake Gaya Sapna Mera and Raat Akeli Hain and you'll never forget the movie for any reason. <br /> <br /> Acting by Dev Anand, Ashok Kumar, Tanuja and Vyjantimala and leading Vijay Anand (Dev Anand's younger brother) make this one of the best-loved Hindi movies of all time, even today.
