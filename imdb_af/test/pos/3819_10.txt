I first started the Outer Limits back in 95 when I was 10, and it blew every episode every week. Every episode had a turn and every week I couldn't wait for the next. How the authors managed to do every episode so well and make it different from each one over a 7-season course is beyond me. This show controls us about life, robotics, alien and human encounters, and insight into more of the paranormal, and how it affects people. What makes it a great show is the characters in each episode, they really show emotion and are really good actors. What you will see every week is an actor / actress who will know you about a show that is pretty neat in its own way. <br /> <br /> If you want to relax and get back with a good back Sci-Fi show, then the Outer Limits are for you
