First of all, it is interesting to note that one of the users who responded to this film (at Belgium) had to add that Lumumba was "communist". When this user watched the movie, the message was that he was not communist, but that he was (like no one other than Belgium, the US, the UN, etc.) as a "communist" leader for other individuals, corporations and countries political and economic gains. Even if one decides to accept that the film participates in "revisionist history", it would be naive to assume that Lumumba was communist, especially from the country that granted the Congo independence, and since Lumumba preferred DEMOCRACY is at his seat as Prime Minister. <br /> <br /> On the film ... <br /> <br /> It's one of the most important and powerful movies I've seen for some time. Explain the struggle of the African freedom fighter, and the election of the Prime Minister's fight as his first leader, Peck, do a reasonably commendable job of putting together all the pieces in one work. And it should have been quite a task. Due to the fact that most people outside Congo and Belgium probably do not know the history of Lumumba and the Congo, beyond a light coverage of African imperialism (hopefully) in one of their high school / secondary school (or perhaps university / college level) history classes, he cut out his work for him. <br /> <br /> And to think that Oliver Stone's "JFK" lasts over 3 hours, "Lumumba" runs less than 2 hours. And a very pleasant 115 minutes was this because we found that his desire not to compromise with Western powers (who he holds responsible for the atrocities to his people, especially Belgium), while trying to power his own borders Look, apparently even with some of his friends, it's wonderful that the man lived so long. <br /> <br /> It's a MUST see for anyone interested in equality, justice, humanity, history, politics and true freedom. You won't be disappointed.
