It is always interesting to capture a line in a film that is a little prophetic for the future of an actor. In this case, I was inspired by Edward G. Robinson's statement to Barbara Stanwyck - "I promised you the valley", as he discussed the lonely blows in his attempt to control the entire country in Logasa. Ten years later, Stanwyck would die as the Barkley family's matriarch on "The Big Valley". Somehow I thought she might have been older in the previous picture; I think all the shiny gowns and fine outfits have a way to bring out your youthful side. <br /> <br /> As for my summary line above, it is Lee Wilkison's review of John Parrish (Glenn Ford), one of those shortly after Parrish used his knowledge of military tactics to release a number of Wilkison hands. after catching his farm and setting fire to his house. I like the way the movie explored its character, and started handling foreman Wade Matlock (Richard Jaeckel) in a calculated build. The ambush set-up was also a clever maneuver, unlike the strategy of hurrying the bad guys, with both sides on the side of the last man. For that, Parrish also had something to say: "Never meet the enemy on his terms." <br /> <br /> "The Violent Men" is a good title for this movie and was probably the head of the class. In the mid-1950s, however, the standards did not come close to the blood in a " Tombstone or "Open Range" is found where the bullets are a nasty wilderness. But it was formed by fine performances by the principals, with a subplot who explored infidelity that was almost ironic, as it was Stanwyck's character who was deceiving.
