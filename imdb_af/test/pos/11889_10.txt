El Padrino has just been released in Europe and really kicks ass. This movie featuring his big movie - Damian Chapa (Blood in Blood Out), Robert Wager, Jennifer Tilly, Robert Wagner and many more - is the best gangster movie since SCARFACE. A movie that everyone should see. 2 hours of action with fantastic incredible stunt !! <br /> <br /> GRACIAS JENNIFER !!!! We are eagerly awaiting part 2 !!!! Does anyone know if there will be one? Keep up the good work !!! I loved it !!
