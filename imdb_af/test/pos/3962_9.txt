It's a funny, smart movie and worth your time. In my opinion, it is much better than American Pie and other films of the same genre that seem to be knocked out all the time. I didn't hear from this movie, so I think it didn't get much pressure, what a pity. It does not take up too much, but at the same time gives a serious message to people about life and life experiences and what's important. Unlike a movie about a lot of desperate guys trying to lay down for the first time. and one man who puts her d ** k in a tart, but eventually everyone is laid and swayed ... One thing that impressed me was that the soundtrack was pretty awesome and not the usual American American punk ... They actually had real punk from the day like the Ramones. It made the movie in itself better! To be honest, I didn't expect much from this movie and I was pleasantly surprised at how good a comedy is.
