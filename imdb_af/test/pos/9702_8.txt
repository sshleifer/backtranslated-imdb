My sister, a friend and I went to see this movie for my birthday on September 24th. We've all seen the first Jackass movie for a while, and we all enjoyed it. We were really looking forward to number two. <br /> <br /> We were not disappointed. <br /> <br /> From start to finish I laughed hysterically. It's equally shocking and amusing, and certainly not for those with poor abdominal pain. It's obscene, but it's also a pioneering American movie theater. Well, it may be a bit too much praise for a movie where men are deliberately capturing their scrotum on ice images, but it is groundbreaking in that it shows our obsessions whether we want It or not, things that no other "decent" American movie that countrywide will dare to show us. <br /> <br /> There was only one scene in particular that I felt unnecessarily, and it was a horse - I wouldn't work out. <br /> <br /> I laughed, I almost gagged and I got close to crying (from a physical reaction to see a scene with a look and an eyeball, not sad) . In my humble opinion, "Jackass: Number Two" is the film of '06. <br /> <br /> Does it make me a jackass? Maybe. But if it does, I can really care less.
