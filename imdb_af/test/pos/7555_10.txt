A wonderful movie about people. For the first time I saw four friends when it was originally shown in the theaters and I have seen it many times. If I don't see it on TV, I'll come and rent it with friends. The people I watched this movie always find it nice. It deals with friends from childhood to adulthood, in the 50's and 60's. It is very funny and touching, which deals with the first love (and first sex), racism, war, politics - all 60s. It can also be quite dramatic. If you enjoy movies about people, this one is definitely worth it.
