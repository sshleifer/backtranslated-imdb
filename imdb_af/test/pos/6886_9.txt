I couldn't agree with those who say it's a bad movie. My friend and I saw it at the Stockholm Film Festival and it was one of my favorite movies during the festival. Dolls used in horror movies are not new, but I have not seen many movies, but it is as well executed as it is in this movie. The atmosphere, the environment, the actors, the camera work .. everything is just beautiful. And they really work well with each other. Now if you expect this movie to be another Grudge or Ring, you probably won't like it. But if you're out for a good, stylized scare then it's perfect. Although it is fairly predictable and sometimes ridiculous, I still recommend it to anyone who likes horror flashes. Go see it. Now.
