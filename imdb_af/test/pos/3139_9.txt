Wagon Master is a very unique film under John Ford's work. Mainly because it is the only one based on a story written by John Ford himself, the story worked out by Frank Nugent and the director's son ?? Patrick Ford and became a roadmap, and due to the personal opinion of the director, Wagon Master is the movie John Ford called the one that "came closest to what I wanted to achieve," not to say it, but as Ford once admitted to Lindsay Anderson, his favorite was still my Darling Clementine and not any other. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master has all the ingredients one can expect in a John Ford movie. Wonderful throws that deliver its best, you don't have big stars except the most 'fordian' of all actors ?? Ben Johnson. Very peculiar little characters, which offer compulsory comic relief, and Wagon Master have quite a few of them, such as horns that Sister Ledyard (Jane Darwell) blows in her lap, but many inspired performances. And last but not the least legendary Monument Valley with John Ford's fifth run there, Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, Fort Apache and She wore a Yellow Ribbon. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with two friends, cowboys Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and rented Sandy Owens (Harry Carey Jr.) to be Wagon Masters or guides for a Mormon settlers caravan going to Silver Valley go, a place that is like a promised land to them. Along the way, they are joined by a special Dr. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) with two beautiful women, who are supposedly his wife and daughter and call themselves actors. They are heading in the same direction, simply because they have recently been expelled from the nearest town and have no other place. Nothing particularly unpleasant happens until they bump into Cleggs, a dangerous family gang consisting of father and his three sons who left the town from the Marshal where they recently committed murder and bank robbery. <br /> <br /> Overall Wagon Master is no more or less than one more precious pearl in a necklace made by John Ford's wonderful Western. A must see. 9/10 <br /> <br />
