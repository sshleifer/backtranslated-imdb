I thought Rachel York was fantastic as "Lucy." I also saw her in "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Victor / Victoria", and in each of these performances she developed very different and very real character traits. She is a chameleon who can play and sing anything! <br /> <br /> I'm very surprised at how many negative reviews appear here on Rachel's performance in Lucy. Even some bona fide TV and entertainment critics missed the point of her portrayal. So many people have focused on the fact that Rachel doesn't really look like Lucy. My response to this is, "So what?" I wasn't looking for a superficial imitation of Lucy. I wanted to know more about the right woman behind the clown. And Rachel gave us this in depth. I also didn't want to see anyone doing simple Lucy routines simply. That's why I was very pleased with the producers' and director's decision that Rachel Lucy would portray rehearsal for the most memorable of these sketches - Vitameatavegamin and The Candy Factory. (It seems that some of the judges didn't realize that these two scenes were supposed to be rehearsals and not the actual sketches). This approach, I thought, gave an innovative twist to sketches that so many of us know very well. I also thought Rachel was wonderfully fresh and funny in these scenes. And she left behind the routines that were recreated - especially the Professor and the Grapefruit. There was one moment in the grape scene where the corner of Rachel's mouth had the exact slight upswing I remembered having Lucy. I couldn't believe she could catch it - and of course. <br /> <br /> I wonder if many of the people who criticized the show were expecting the Lucille Ball of "I Love Lucy" throughout the movie. One of us who just got to know her by TV, has no idea what Lucy really was in her early film years. I think Rachel showed a natural advance in the character that was brilliant. She planted all the right seeds to see that the clown was waiting to come forward, given the right circumstances. Lucy does not fit the shape of the old studio system. In her frustrated efforts to become the stereotypical filmmaker of that era, she suppressed what her ultimate gifts would be. <br /> <br /> I believe that Rachel has captured the comedy, drama, white, sadness, anger, passion, love, ambition, loyalty, sex, self-absorption, childhood and stoism all in one complex American icon. And she did it with the authenticity and freshness that was completely engaging. "Lucy" was a star for Rachel York. I hope this will bring a big ripple in the future. I also hope it brings her an Emmy.
