What I liked best about this feature-length animated movie from 1941 is the great feeling it gave for the early 1940s. These are the songs, the clothes, the cars, the buildings of the day, etc. You feel you have returned in time. <br /> <br /> From reading some of the reviews here, I see it was a hard-hit movie, released a few days before the Pearl Harbor attack. Wow, no one would be interested in going to the movies for a feature-length cartoon during those eventful and shocking days, I'm sure. Too bad, because people missed a nice animation, it would have been really impressed about 70 years ago. The colors are nice, drawings are good and the story entails us as the root of the mistakes made by "Hoppity" and its beautiful girl "Honey" to make it happy, ever and from the damage. It's also about them all finding a grassy spot that they can live and not worry about people trampling on them. <br /> <br /> There's a nasty villain, but - "Bagley Beetle" - and two of his henchmen. These helpers ("Swat, The Fly" and "Smack, the Mosquito") are comedians, complete with their Brooklyn accents! The story is a well-known one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and use unscrupulous means to force her. The good guy meanwhile stacked the stoep against him, but of course he rules. <br /> <br /> My favorite part - it'll look worse than it was - was when good-natured "Hoppity" exploded temporarily and danced in black-and-white. It was fantastic animation! <br /> <br /> It's a good thing I didn't see it as a very small child; I would have been scared to play outside and squash all the nice bug people! You never know what (or who) in that grass is under your feet!
