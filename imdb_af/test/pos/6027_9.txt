I was lucky to see The Last Stop live here at the Moving Pictures Film Festival (for those who don't know, the Moving Pictures Film Festival is a Canadian film tour in Canada). I told just before the movie started that it was the world premiere and that it was about to get an American distribution agreement that added to my excitement. <br /> <br /> I'm a big horror movie, and yes, I also love the Scream trilogy. When I found out that Rose McGowan did a Ten-Little Indian movie, I knew I was a surprise. Rose McGowan was the biggest name actor / actress at the entire festival. <br /> <br /> The best way I can describe it without giving away too much of the plot is that it's not quite like Scream. And it is definitely worth seeing. It is in the middle of a snowstorm (filmed in Vancouver, B.C., Canada) at a mountain top motel, which adds to the tension. Rose McGowan puts a good performance as the girl next door (?!) Along with the rest of the cast. And for what happens at the end, well, the only thing I will say is that you will never guess the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it will probably not be in the mainstream North American theaters. because the only decent cashier in it is Rose McGowan. But if you get the chance to see it, I'll recommend you. And if worse comes, there's always video. <br /> <br /> I gave it a 9 out of 10.
