The Hookers were a wonderful everyday story to me, like someone you might have known. Just trying to make it, my big shot is right around the corner. Then life's tiny temptations sneak in, the spoiler, again. How much, can your love take and give to the guy who isn't really that bad, just Human. I liked it, I was also a paid extra in the movie. The drums played in the shots, with the group, shooting several runs, my green 66 'corvettes were in the motel parties. Wonderful cast and crew, first class people, down to earth movie. I had lunch with James Coburn, on Mother's Day, a wonderful man, as I have known him for years, I'll never forget him. My dad spent the day with Slim Pickens, and moved horse stories, Slim was really on earth, loved the guys, we really missed them. True people make movies about real people, thanks Levy, Gardner and Laven.
