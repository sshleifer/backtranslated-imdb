This movie has become confusing and has grown into one of the best movies I've seen. The play was absolutely beautiful and when I didn't dry my tears, I enjoyed Meryl Streep, whose performance was exceptional. The film deals with the hardship of a distant family dealing with a mother who develops terminal cancer. The movie was very hard to watch and heartbreaking. The soundtrack fits this movie into a tea. Brava Bette Midler !! From 5 stars, I give this one 4 1/2.
