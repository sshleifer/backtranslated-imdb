This horror movie is definitely one of the best I've seen in my life and there are many reasons why. The storyline is really good, it has lots of action and huge horror ranges in it. The actors are not very good, but there is not that bad, but Kane is definitely the best actor in this, but he was always a good actor. The cast is very good. like Kane like Jacob Goodnight, Christina Vidal as Christine, Michael j. Pagan as Times, Samantha Noble like Kira etc. I just have to warn you that the murder scenes are very disturbing, but they're very creative, but it just makes it better and you can't have a horror movie without blood and gore. They also look very realistic. So I'm sure you won't be disappointed with no harm because it's a very good movie. So make sure you don't rent or buy, because it's just as good. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: ********** from ********* * <br /> <br /> ***** from **** *
