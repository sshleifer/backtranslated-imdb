I waited to watch this movie for centuries and I finally got it! Once I heard the title, I knew that this movie would ever be my favorite movie and when I saw it, I wasn't disappointed! <br /> <br /> This movie has everything dance, love and Patrick Swayze! There was so much in it and it dealt with important issues (it was 1960s), such as abortion. <br /> <br /> The dance in this movie was fantastic, just like the acting was! Swayze was brilliant, just like Gray too! <br /> <br /> Although this movie was absolutely fantastic, you can't say you saw it if you didn't see the last scene. It really takes your breath away, because the whole choreography of the last dance is brilliantly done, it danced to you at the end of the movie and it won't really surprise me if it influences people to play dance! <br /> <br /> Overall Dirty Dancing is a movie that should NOT be missed and even though half of the actors are in, "Where are they now?" time, the actors will always have this wonderful movie in their career!
