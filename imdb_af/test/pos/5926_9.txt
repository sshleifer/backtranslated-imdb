The word impossible has led many to choose a particular view on any amazing task. In 1927, no one was believed to be able to fly the Atlantic Ocean. Many have tried, but failed, and some even gave their lives to the effort. Nevertheless, this had to be done, as every challenge with equal determination must be met. So is the heart of this movie called "The Spirit of St. Louis." The actor selected for this historic film is none other than America's own James Stewart, who plays Charles Lindbergh convincingly. Although there are many facets of Lindbergh's life, the segment that appears here is his efforts to be the First Man to fly across the Atlantic. The story is an interesting one and for the fans' fans force to say the least. Looking for enough funds to build a special plane, after the fateful decision to start the journey on a gloomy day in May 1927, Luck Lindy, as he was baptized, is experiencing great risks in this beautiful film. Other notes that helped make this movie credible include Murray Hamilton, who is Bud Gurney, Bartlett Robinson, Ben Mahoney, Arthur Space and Charles Watts as well as O.W. play. Schultz. The sum total of this well-known movie is in spite of poor endorsement during its debut, it has since become a Classic in its own right. Well done! ****
