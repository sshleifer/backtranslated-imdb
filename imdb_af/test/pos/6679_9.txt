It's a movie that makes you think he's or isn't he? While many have complained about the ambiguous end, it leaves room for the audience to interpret it and interpret it from the signs. This is my interpretation and theory, and I believe it is very healthy. <br /> <br /> First, here's the plot. One day, Prot (Kevin Spacey) suddenly appears in the middle of a busy train station. After trying to help a woman of muggers, he was arrested and sent to Bellevue, and later transferred to Doctor Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) hospital. Prot speaks freely about how he came from the planet K-Pax and is here to do a report on Earth. Of course, he is classified as a looney and locked in a low security level. He befriends the other patients and quickly convinces them of his story. In fact, he says they can take one person back with him. Soon, Dr. To challenge Powell Prot's insanity and if the plot progresses, it is harder and harder to prove Prot wrong. <br /> <br /> In the end dr. Powell, Prot Robert Porter, a clever man working in a New Mexico butchery while murdering his wife and daughter. Prot claims he intends to leave K-Pax at the exact time on the fifth anniversary of the murders. The time comes and goes, and Powell finds Prot of Robert in a catatonic state. One of the patients is missing and is never found again. <br /> <br /> To my theory: Prot is not crazy. Prot is from the planet K-Pax. Robert Porter is a friend of Prot. On one of Prot's previous visits to the Earth, Robert was a child learning about the constellations of his father. Prot and Robert have become best friends. After the death of his family, and Robert decides to kill the murderer, Robert decides to commit suicide. Prot was at K-Pax then, but he gets back (in multiples of speed) to stop Robert. So Prot takes over the thoughts of Robert and takes his body over. Meanwhile, Prot (still in Robert's body) arrives in New York and is locked up. When he leaves for K-Pax on July 27, he takes Bess with him, but he must leave Robert's body behind. That's why we now have the catatonic Robert. <br /> <br /> Explanations or clues: <br /> <br /> PROT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANS AROUND LIBRA: As Prot says, any child knows their own system. Only a few people on Earth had an impression on the system, and Prot added their knowledge. Robert Porter, while smart and knowing his constellations, was not an astro physicist. <br /> <br /> DR POWELL FEEDS PROTECTED BY PROT: This is true. Prot could leave the institute at any time, but did not choose either. Prot's last words to Dr. Powell is, "Now that you've found Robert. Beware of him." Prot was probably there to secure a place for Robert when he left. <br /> <br /> SUPER HUMAN MOVEMENTS: It was a proven fact that Prot had a significantly higher sensitivity to sunlight and could even see UV rays. Prot offers his usual K-Pax reason, but there was no earthly reason given. It has also been mentioned that Prot has been given extremely high doses of medicine, with no effect. <br /> <br /> HELP HELP: Through the film you see Prot helping the other patients (or patients discussing Prot's suggestions) to a better healthy world. While the psychologist comes to Prot's help, dr. Powell at the end of the film about the new life the patients are leading. <br /> <br /> THE SPRINKLER SCENE: The sprinkler is associated with Porter's home in New Mexico (which is ironic where Roswell is). Does Porter share the sprinkler with the death of his family? Is she trying to protect Powell's daughter of that terrible fate? I have a different point of view. It is assumed that Porter committed suicide in a river. In fact, Prot (under hypnosis) is very concerned about Robert. I believe that Prot connects the danger with the water, not the sprinkler. He tried to protect the girl from the watery death, as he did Robert. <br /> <br /> Hypnosis: Dr. Powell feels that, under hypnosis, he can unveil Prot's true identity, but while Prot gives much information, he never gives up his Prot persona and claims homeland of K-Pax. <br /> <br /> THE SECURITY CAMERA: Why would the camera just give without apparent reason? <br /> <br /> MYSTERY DIFFERENCES: First, Prot disappeared for a few days after his trip to the north. Funny, the patients are not afraid at all. In fact, they are trying to reassure the doctor. Sometimes I think they understand better than the staff. Of course, the most forgetful disappearance of Bess is the winner of the essay match. Not only does she disappear at about the same time, but the only remaining idea is her win-win. <br /> <br /> This is just my humble theory. You can decide what you want. You can dr. Powell's theory uses that Prot was just a person who was taken up by Robert Porter to defend himself spiritually against reality, but it would give too many plots.
