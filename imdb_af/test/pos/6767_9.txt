OK, so I'm usually not one who runs out and rents foreign films ... especially foreign dark comedies. I think I can find on the one hand the number of movies that I have really hilarious from beginning to end. This movie is added to the shortlist. Even dark comedies straight to Hollywood sometimes turn me off because they need an incredibly dry sense of humor. But this one took care of my eyes with tears. My sides hurt. I didn't laugh so hard for a long time. This movie was recommended by my mom and I don't think I'd even dreamed to watch it if she didn't touch it. Don't be afraid to read during your movie - you'll miss a hilariously well acted flick.
