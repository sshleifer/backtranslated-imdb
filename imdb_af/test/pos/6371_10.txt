I loved Full Savages! Why did they cancel it anyway? They had to make a second season and so on ... God! They always cancel the good performances ... and leave all the boring stuff. Nothing interesting on TV since Complete Savages is gone. This show was a good idea. A single firefighter with five males and a lazy dog. Each of them has his own madness in that house. TJ is always the child ... always the smaller ... Kyle rocks! He breaks everything he touches! He is always on detention, he always does the wrong things ... But still, he is so funny with all the things he does. Sam is smart. He's always shy and stupid when it comes to girls ... Finally, he ends up meeting Angela. Chris is the sportsman who doesn't have much to do with school, studying and things like that. He's always funny. And finally ... Jack! The rock of the show. The oldest of all, the macho man, "the rock star" ... But still, as crazy as everyone. Nick is ... helpless with these guys. Oh! And I almost forgot! Uncle Jimmy ... He's the man! He is like a 30 year old child. He is like doing the same stupid things as the boys do. I always wondered how he eventually became a firefighter ... And the dog is the image of all the Savage family. The thing is ... this show needs everything to grow really big. It had everything, man! But of course ... they canceled it ...
