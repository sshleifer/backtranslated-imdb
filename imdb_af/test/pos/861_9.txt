See the film at the Hollywood Film Festival in October '04. Mark Robertson was given a great chance to write a very difficult part for his first film, and it grew big in his decisive Kelly Overton. I had a strong feeling that she was coming from the theater, and I looked at her and surprised her, I was right. More Hollywood actors need to take her lead, give the expensive theater classes and get back theater, because only with such training will you be prepared for such a ride. For all the big things I can say about the film and the director (and there are many), I can no longer stop talking to people about Kelly Overton's masterful performance. We will definitely not see her work anymore. <br /> <br /> Congratulations to Mark and Kelly on a brave movie. Get it out in the theaters, so I can bring all the people I made, want to see the movie as soon as possible!
