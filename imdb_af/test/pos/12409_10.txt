This picture has no major explosions or expensive pursuits. However, it has many wonderful performances and an exceptional script that puts it on top of my "indie-must-sea list". Taylor Nichols and James Remar are great together. The young cast surprised me with really consistent acting. Usually, some of the photos have some bad links, but here are no bad links. Impressive. Go get this one.
