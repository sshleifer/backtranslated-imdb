He tried to bring back a number one song at Christmas, and now the frightening Justin Lee Collins wanted to reunite the company and crew of one of his favorite TV shows as a child, The A-Team. The only member he could not find was the late great George Peppard who was the main character Kol. John "Hannibal" Smith played, but he got a kind of psychologist to help. He managed to reunite all members, including Dirk Benedict (Lt. Templeton "Faceman" Peck # 2), who went to Celebrity Big Brother in 2007, Dwight Schultz (Capt. HM "Hurling Mad" Murdock), Melinda Culea (Amy Amanda Allen), William Lucking (Col. Lynch) and Lance LeGault (Col. Roderick Decker, the only member of the team to die). In an expected interview with Mr. T (Sgt. Bosco "B.A." Baracus) spoke, but he was not available to attend the reunion. It was really fun trying to find them, talking to them, though they probably didn't want to, and the reunion of course was the big climax. Very good!
