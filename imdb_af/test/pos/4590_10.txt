We saw this movie in Austin Texas at the Alamo South Lamar on Wednesday afternoon. It laughed me very hard! The scene of Albert Einstein's thoughts on mankind hit me over and over and I couldn't stop laughing. It's too bad it's not in more theaters, I know many friends who die to see this movie! "Welcome to Costco, I love you." ... great work for everyone involved! Also, if you see it, make sure you stay up to the end of the credits too! I'm going to take my family to see it again for the weekend! If you are a fan of OFFICE SPACE and BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD, you should see this movie. It's a classic and no one knows it's out! So if you're in the mood to see something funny this weekend, it definitely goes out.
