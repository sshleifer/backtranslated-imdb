Past times are best at best as a topic. In this episode, a man who thinks about the possibility finds himself on the date and place of the murder of Abraham Lincoln. He tries everything he can think in the short time he has available with predictable results. Of course, he believes he is very angry. He is arrested and eventually sentenced to the man he is trying to stop. Serling was bright enough to make him return to the present, but is the gift the same? It's kind of a forerunner of "The Time Tunnel", where time travelers were given the same task on a weekly basis, to overcome what has already happened. Unfortunately, the implications of the distortion of time and the future always ignore the result. Unless you like Ray Bradbury's "The Sound of Thunder."
