See it at the Hong Kong International Film Festival, more than three years ago. I went with no expectations, since Christopher Nolan was a name at the time, but it sounded and was one of the best things I saw at the festival. It worked well on the big screen, with the technique of cutting out the screens, without tuning. Mr. Nolan gave a good performance at the end, enough to start someone off as a movie maker! I liked it better than Memento, though it was possible due to lower expectations. And the fact that it was more of an art house movie.
