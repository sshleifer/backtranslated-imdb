I watched this movie for the second time tonight after about three years and it was as wonderful as before. <br /> <br /> There are more than a dozen modern exquisite French films from and cousin to the three color trilogy and all are special. This movie is one of them. A real pleasure with so many great things going for it, from the tribute to Hitchcock to two beautiful ladies in Romans and Monica. While Monica is very beautiful, Romane is a very sexy lady and steals many of the scenes she occupies. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure why people think this movie is over, as the screens are such a perfect blend of the past and present as a counterpart to the characters' own remarkable journey that the movie simply flow and you hardly realize that 116 minutes of beauty and mystery left the enchanted and enchanted. <br /> <br /> Like most French and European films, this story will never be translated across the Atlantic, as no studio could capture the magic without increasing its life. The Hollywood bleach is common to most movies lost in translation. Americans make brilliant movies, but not of this kind. Maybe if they leave someone like a young Polanski job, they may not be able to beat an English version. <br /> <br /> For those who do not watch subtitled movies, you will spend a lifetime in ignorance. For those who can read, you spit yourself out to miss such films ... <br /> <br /> I will describe it as Neo-Franco-Noir, but only for the reviewer who called this film elitist. . I think I saw him making twenty-four paths. He thinks Romane Bohringer is a kind of French Mayonnaise. It is arty in the way Pulp Fiction arty is ... but with more Gallic savoir faire ... <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 with every look ... and have someone Romane's phone number ... she is the perfect French salad dressing ...
