I saw it last week and the sketch about the Korean towns was funny. A lot of tongue in the cheek and suitable for the political climate. Full marks for the authors and Spike for that. The part where he made the interpreter to draw a rickshaw and throw out Korean words could only be pulled by Spike. It's a brave attempt by Fox. This is a brilliant performance and I hope to pull it off. My wife and I have been experiencing it regularly and although it does clash with some other programs, we are now seeing it on MySpace. I hope Fox allocates full resources to the show and makes it daily. I can't wait to see Bobby Lee on his show. With people like Bernard Abedalla behind the show, this is on the right track. Also Maria Mae as his wife looks beautiful.
