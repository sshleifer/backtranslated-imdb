This film is a benchmark in non-mainstream theater history. The use of montage represents a quantum leap from the relatively simple juxtapositions of Strike (Eisenstein's 1st film). Take the scene on the stairs and watch the repeated shot of the soldiers descending to repeat the point of the horrors that actually happened! A highly intelligent monumental film, a must for all film students!
