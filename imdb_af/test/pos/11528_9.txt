Somehow, you can't get away from the basic message. The strong survival. Those who are psychologically or emotionally sensitive leave. They leave a hole in the lives of those who love them. A hole seen in it is finality than selfish. That's what Phoebe finally realized. Just before he heals Wolf, he's obvious. She can accept closure to the missing ... of her sister. Beautiful European scenery. Lots of truth in it about idealism and addiction to the next big moment. For a moment I thought of the Baader-Meinhoff gang that was around in the early 70's. I love this movie, as it has been a time I have matured myself.
