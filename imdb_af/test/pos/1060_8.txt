Personally, I don't like many b / w movies, but there is something magical about this movie. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with Elizabeth Lane (Barbara Stanwyck). "Liz" writes a magazine column on how she is Connecticut's "Martha Stewart". Of course she lies. This becomes a problem when her publisher, Mr. Yardley, asking her to offer a NAVY sailor on Christmas. In addition, Mr. Yardley, who will be alone for Christmas, invited to the farm for the Christmas party. From there, things just go crazy. <br /> <br /> As the movie takes place on a New England farm, the movie has a warm holiday. Plus, the characters are hilarious. Mr. Yardley always screams orders, and Liz's friend Felix always shouts 'Catastrophe!' When Things Go Wrong Finally, the movie ends the way a Christmas movie ends; A very fat man laughs and shouts: "What a Christmas!" <br /> <br /> In short, no matter what age you are, you will love this movie.
