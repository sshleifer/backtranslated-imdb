Very enjoyable 50's Western. I have it in my collection and recommend it to Western supporters. <br /> <br /> Mostly Victor Mature's movie and pretty well done in my estimation. <br /> <br /> He's a hiker joining a border post as an exploration. Red Cloud caught three of them on their land and took their possessions. They all joined as scouts after their loss. Victor put his eye on the colonel's wife and lived life on the post without much greeting to regulations. <br /> <br /> Action done fairly convincingly but no great depth or feeling for other characters. <br /> <br /> 50's Westerners are my favorites and it easily moves to a satisfaction. A western of this kind is in the pages of the past and perhaps it is never made much again. One to enjoy. Has given it a 7 rating. Probably 6.8 worthy, but movies like this become more precious over time. <br /> <br /> For film-noir fans ... "The Great Stall" "They Live Against Night" "Side Street" are the most wonderful movies to be. enjoy. Purchased and watched. Noir looks like the Westerners. Some long ago and never forever.
