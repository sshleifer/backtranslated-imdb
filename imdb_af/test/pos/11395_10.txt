I rented Boogie Nights last week and I could tell you when I watched the movie, I had an explosion. If you think that watching the movie, you will get sick with the porn. I mean yes, if you're not a porn person who can't bother it, then it's not the movie to watch. But the thing is, the whole movie isn't really about porn. Well halfway through the movie, it's about the porn industry, but the other half is about character development and the bad situations that these characters go through. The actors played perfect roles, especially Mark Wahlberg, John C. Reilly and William H. Macy. Of course, the sex scene is awesome, but focuses mainly on the character's hype in porn movies until it's struggling. Excellent movie, one of the best! <br /> <br /> Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10 **** A +
