Latcho Drom, or Safe Journey, is the second movie in Tony Gatlif's trilogy of Roman people. The film is a visual depiction and historical record of Roman life in the European and Middle Eastern countries. Although the scenes are mostly planned, rehearsed and performed, there is no conventional storyline and the dialogue does not explain activities from scene to scene. Instead, the viewer can sometimes take a look, sometimes more in the depths of these people during different times and in different countries, ranging from India, Egypt, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, France and Spain. /> <br /> The importance of music in Roman culture is clearly expressed by the film. This is an important part of every event and an important means of communication. Everything they do is expressed with music. Dance is another important activity. Like Romany music, it is specialized and deeply personal, something they only know how to do right. We get an overview of their everyday activities, but the film is not a detailed study of their lives. On the contrary, it is a testament to their culture, with the emphasis on the music and dance they created and what made them unique. <br /> <br /> Mr. Gatlif depicts the nomadic groups positively. However, we also see the rejection, distrust and alienation they receive from the non-Roman population. It seems that the culture they have developed over many generations, inspired by different countries, fades into oblivion because conventional society has no place for nomadic ways. <br /> <br /> The other films in the trilogy are Les Princes (1983) and Gadjo Dilo (1998).
