This is an adaptation of a Dirk Wittenborn book, which I have not read. young Finn Earl lives with his mother Liz (Diane Lane) in a concise Lower East Side New York apartment. he dreams to teach his anthropologist father a fiery tribe in South America. Liz has boyfriends and cooks. when he gets her a kiss, one of her clients (Liz is a legal masseuse) is a rich mr. Osborne, who earns a little money, is in his big estate in New Jersey. They are driven there in a limo, squeezed out, in the back seat, with her dress up and underpants. (This and some low clothing screens are the only exploitation of Ms Lane. Some may be disappointed, but I'm sorry she had to do all the things in "Ontrou" to make the A list. Talent in her little finger as Stripe) , Roberts and Sally Field do in their whole body and his time she owes her.) When they arrive, Finn makes friends with Osborn's grandson Bryce and has his age with his new girlfriend, granddaughter Maya. Meanwhile, Liz joins AA and dates an AA doctor. She miraculously cleans up. However, Finn does a lot of drugs with sex with his new friends. Bryce looks like an old guy, but gets jealous when Osborne Finn takes a hot air balloon instead of him. This leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> The genius of the story (and film) is that they cut the violent acts of the Fiery, dirty, rich Blysdale tribe to the Yanomano warriors. It is a bit unquestionable, though Liz finds out what is happening to her son, she only claims Osborne's profession and does not engage with the authorities or establish Thelma and Louise style. There are elements of a Gothic novels with a revelation by the village idiot. They also do almost no plot or character development before moving to Blysdale. Liz, for example, like Lane's Pearl Kantrowitz in "Walk on the Moon", had an unwanted pregnancy with Finn at 18 and was trapped. It's in the book, but not the movie. Yet these are minor shortcomings. The film will be in full release on 12/31/05 over a year after the original release, and I just couldn't wait. <br /> <br /> There were many Red Carpet moments in the theater I saw movie with, almost the entire cast ... except Diane Lane !! $ #% # Q $ Director Dunne said she was filming a movie. I know she didn't promise to be there, but I came out of town and it would have been such a thrill to see her personally. The movie is a definite Best Picture expert, like for acting? Sutherland was pretty good, and so was the boy Finn played. Lane was wonderful as always, but I just remember one or two emotional scenes, if she gets Finn with catch drugs, we can get with your son and son with Osborne "your twisted grandson ...". She would nod better with a supporting actress, but it doesn't work that way. unless they give it to her for a "body of work."
