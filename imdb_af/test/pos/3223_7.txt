Every time I view this show, I just want to turn it off and curse the makers for wasting my time week after week. The dialogues, or monologues rather, because everybody just walks endlessly over nothing, becomes just as annoying. For example, the episode I watched yesterday started with a seemingly endless pile of how a particular dish (I forgot what it was, pasta with meatballs maybe) always managed to get the Gilmore family dinner in the all change out of war. And it was just a few seconds or so. <br /> <br /> It looks like every time, many lines, with absolutely zero content. The scripts they use must be huge. <br /> <br /> But then something happens every time. The chatter stops and suddenly there are these wonderful quiet, emotional moments. For example, this week it was Lorelai's outline at the estate agent. I just thought it was the best piece of TV I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Almost everything is worth it.
