I, like many IMDB patrons, seem to have stumbled upon this little movie when it appeared on the Canadian Showcase Network. Like many of you, I was sucked in and watched the whole movie. I was initially addicted to the literary dialogue and the horrible sense of humor with which the film is rich. I was comfortably messed up with some sort of "Kevin Smith meets Killer Movies" wave halfway through when the movie really sucked and the themes explored in more detail ... with a darker and more gripping edge. Far from the experience, I was brought in further. This is not the best film of its kind and will certainly not have universal appeal ... so I understand some of the more negative reactions to it. But I bought ... and enjoyed it very much. The flash back type movement in the chronology was effective, the characters were well aware and the issues raised were human, accessible (at least my experience) and interesting. I was quite impressed with the film's ability to stay sweet, funny and entertaining while not hiding from controversial subject matter and raw emotional language, dynamics and situations. This movie is a great antidote to much of the shock that has penetrated the witty / clever romantic genre. A kind of male Brigitte Jones for the literate sect. Take 2 hours out of your busy schedule and jump into Wirey's world ... or you can rent "You've Got Mail" because if it does, you won't like it! Those of us who like it will be good without you on our side.
