This Blake Edwards movie isn't sure it's a comedy, drama or piece of music. No matter, the mere presence of Julie Andrews is reason enough to see this comedy-drama musical espionage. July is beautiful and uses her many talents throughout the film. Rock Hudson looks tired, but he's more than fine, like Julie's romantic interest. Authentic world war cars and airplanes add to the appeal. Overall, the movie is very entertaining. The DVD version is an edited (by Blake Edwards) version of the original version. This is probably the only version that Edwards would allow; but Turner Classic Movies recently showed the complete (theatrical version) version. Recommended.
