Ingrid Bergman (Cleo Dulaine) has never been so beautiful. Gary Cooper as "Cleent" so perfectly cast as a laconic Texan who knows this gall is nothing good. When the two lock eyes at the French market, we know this game will be full of sparks. As they walk into her garden in her restored French Quarter house and play the love theme, it is a dream for all our romantics. <br /> <br /> The costumes are lovely; The decorated decoration allows the "quarter" to be the same. And that Saratoga still had the hotel with the wide veranda with all the old biddies gossiping. <br /> <br /> Van Edna Ferbers' novel is the story of revenge for old injustices and the battles over who the railways in the early days of that industry. <br /> <br /> In the saratoga scenes, Florence Bates steals every scene as a big lady. <br /> <br /> But it is Cleo's scene that the small lawyer adopts. New Orleans family has sent to buy what is a Magic Movie Moment. After Cleo spent himself in the negotiations, he looked at her longing and said, "May I say you're pretty." And Cleo with a happy, ugly smile says, "Yes, it's not happy." You want to yell "YES"! <br /> <br /> One of my favorite romantic movies.
