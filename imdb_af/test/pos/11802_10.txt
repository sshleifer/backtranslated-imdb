The Cure is one of the few movies I reviewed 10 out of 10. I mean, everything is flawless for me in this movie. I saw it almost a year ago, and yet I remember a lot of the screens, especially the final touch that comes to the credits. <br /> <br /> The two boy actors have given everything that they can and it carries the great storyline that makes the movie perfect. <br /> <br /> The message is clear - friendship, and it is displayed throughout the whole thing. <br /> <br /> I have nothing more to say here. Simplicity is one of the things I love so much about this movie. And of course, it's fun and moving at the same time, which suits people of any age. <br /> <br /> 10/10, beautifully done!
