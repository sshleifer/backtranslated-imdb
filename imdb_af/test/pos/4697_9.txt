Fantastic series, one of my favorites (Miami Vice and Tour of Duty are the other two, and this series is right up there with them.) <br /> <br /> These guys are not wearing dark stockings. more like woodworkers. Everything about this series breathes an aire of realism, artistic license or not. <br /> <br /> It paints a picture of a Europe just a little from the grip of paganism, because most villagers still have their local gods, and there is Satan worshiping nuns, and magic, witches and wizards that spells out. <br /> <br /> But what is most is that it's a series of time. Rather than the version of the fifties, which was a lament against the centralized government and the prosecution of the McCarthy era, this series was well founded in the 1980s, Thatcherist-bleakness, and has a strong environmental awareness. Robin's protector is a natural supporter called Hern The Hunter, who is often the head of a deer, and is a personalization (like this Robin) of The Green Man, an alternative version of Osiris (the Egyptian God of vegetation and resurrection - It is interesting to note that Robin In The Hood is not a person in this series but a concept, when the old one is killed, Herne is called telepathy - the person can die, but Robin In The Hood will live forever, so the concept of resurrection. <br /> <br /> The music and score is really outstanding, and performed by the Irish formation, Clannad. If I see it, I can't help but think how _boring_ would have been authentic medieval Anglosaxon folk music. :-) <br /> <br /> All this is beautifully shot in the lush forests of Wales, which goes for The New Forrest. <br /> <br /> The only side is in the initial episodes of both series, the actors must overcome their own skepticism and convince them that this is really a serious work. Then they get in there and the acting is great! Michael Praed as the first Robin (second to be played by Sean Connery's son, Jason), Judi Trott makes a beautiful and fragile redhead Marion, Phil Rose as the portly and really loving Friar Tuck, Ray Winstone as the fleeting and loving Scarlet Clive Mantle as the giant in-law Little John, Peter Llewellyn Williams as Little John's bumpkin friend and fellow shepard, and Mark Ryan as the former Hashashin / Assassin Nazir - all performing well. Also great are the steady Bad Churches, Nicholas Grace as the naked eye, Sheriff or Nottingham, and his aristocratic, shaky wink (and Robin's half-brother, as it turns out) Robert Addie as Sir Guy or Gisburne. Also really cool is fashion designer Richard O'Brien, as the cute Lord Owen of Clun's (Olliver Cotton) wizard Gulnar (he appears near the end of the first series and later in the second). <br /> <br /> The Tithe Barn in Bradford on Avon stands for the Sheriff's Castle. (Look at bradfordonavon.co.uk under "places of interest.") <br /> <br /> So, if you're not at all in mythology, the Middle Ages, romance, your time doesn't waste on Xena or Hercules - this is the right thing, so go out and see it! <br /> <br /> Alex
