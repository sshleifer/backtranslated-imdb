Shame if you give this movie a low rating. How can you not like a movie that has Doug McClure, Peter Cushing, stupid rubber samples, battles? (And for the guys, the woman who was the bathing handwoman in The Spy Who Loved Me and one of the seventy Sinbad movies Many of whom my mother said, "She's not chosen for the color of her eyes") , lava, stupid wigs and a brave Victorian drilling machine, much like those used in the old Thunderbirds range? Whoever watched this movie and declined it, looked it for the wrong reasons. It can be crazy, but is definitely good crap. They don't make them as they used to, sighs ......
