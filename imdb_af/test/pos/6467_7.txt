"Edge of the City" is another movie that is much to blame for "On the Waterfront". From the NYC locations, to his appreciation, to the belief that any problems you may be, you can somehow correct your injustice. <br /> <br /> "Edge" also deals with ideas such as loyalty and racism. In my opinion, this is where the movie does not sound like "waterfront". At 85 minutes, the movie runs through the establishment of relationships, and binds everything so fast that many of them are forced and unbelievable. <br /> <br /> Possible Spoilers **** <br /> <br /> The relationship between Sidney Poitier and John Cassavettes could be further developed at the beginning. I do not believe these two characters could build such a strong relationship so fast from two very different places. <br /> <br /> I think the whole love subplot with Cassavettes could be eliminated. He is so uncomfortable with a woman that it becomes painful to watch. The only reason it is in the movie is that she can motivate him to do the right thing at the end. There are other ways they could have shown it. I would also like to see some scenes from Axel in the army to illustrate why he is the way he is. <br /> <br /> The acting is excellent. Poitier is wonderful in a beautiful written role. His role as Tyler is interesting and multi-layered, and (especially for 1957), a man who is confident, respected and intelligent. Cassavettes, like Axel North, look very good for the part. Warden is great as the boss who knows Axel's secret (though his battlefield with Cassavettes is terrible at the end. Too many crushing boxes). I thought Ruby Dee was wonderful in the role of Poitier's wife. <br /> <br /> Generally, Edge of the City is a clever movie with a very good role trying too hard to be an interesting noir style. photo, without taking the time to build the drama. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10
