Believe me if I say this show is just hilaries. The basic story is about Kintaro Oe traveling from town to town, part-time work, chasing women and learning everything he can about life. Kintaro should be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever created. He takes everything to the limit, and it laughs hard and funny every time. From his constant, never-ending quest to life, to small things, he immediately blows into life or death. One of the funniest things about this show is simply Kintaro's constantly overpowering expressions and reactions. . He spends a lot of time in various super-distorted modes such as Dragon Half or Trigun. Other times in less than 0.1 seconds, his face will not only be serious, but also life or death expressions like a weightlighter trying to test a new record. It's hilarious. <br /> <br /> If that wasn't enough, the writing is great and the English voice might not be better. Kintaro's English VA is just perfect and will roll you around when he doesn't even say something. The one thing to mention is this is without a doubt an Ecchi series. It defines the word practically. If you're an adult anime fan who can get a laugh out of movies like American Pie, you'll love it. <br /> <br /> - Rirath_com
