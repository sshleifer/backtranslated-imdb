First of all, I come from Munich, where this film takes place, and believe it or not, there are guys like Erkan and Stefan, including the silly dialect! I know from the start their comedy show and my biggest fear was that the movie is just a compilation of their already known jokes, but it is not! The jokes are developed by the story, and make their own special way. But if you don't really like Erkan und Stefan, hands of this movie. Everyone else - it's worth watching!
