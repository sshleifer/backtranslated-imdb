The Kid is a very good family movie about a stuffy image consultant, Russ Duritz, who has a lot of money, a good job, a nice home, etc. The only problem is that he doesn't have much of a social life like no one seems to be. like him, because he is not always very nice. However, one day things will change when an eight-year-old version of himself appears magical. This gives Russ a second chance to get things right. Bruce Willis plays the lead here and he gives a very good performance. The Kid is a nice heart-warming movie for everyone.
