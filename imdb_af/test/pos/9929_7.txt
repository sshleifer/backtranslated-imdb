Often as Argento's last "big" movie, this entry into the Giallo can undoubtedly outperform any Argento film that followed it (although I still have to see "Mother of Tears"), but its the last "big" movie to name. <br /> <br /> The direct and stylistic flourish - the hallmark of all Argento films - is present, with some of its sequencing tensions arranged with its best (the "peephole" sequence is unforgettable), and the Ronnie Taylor's movie is excellent (the fluorescent lighting is beautiful). <br /> <br /> The narrative story - hit and missed in Argento's films - is missing here. There is indeed a powerful sense of mystery and plot, but the plot persuades what is essentially a string of murder sequences, with the one following the other and leaving no real time to solve a real, focused puzzle that solved should not be. All of these results lead to a climax that is ... well ... anti-climate, as the film hasn't invested enough interest to really care about us. <br /> <br /> However, it is recommended simply because of the masterful direction and beautiful images that Argento exclaims. However, I would not recommend it as a starting point for Argento's films, as I would also recommend "Deep Red" or "Suspiria". But if you enjoy it, or even a giallo, then it's a very good addition to your watch repertoire.
