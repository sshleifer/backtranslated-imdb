"Children of Wax" which is also referred to as "Killing grounds" is an interesting mix of genres. Some may think the purity of the genre can only be good, but for me the eclectic symbiosis is very entertaining. It is also the story of the mix of thriller and popular action, as well as the combination of the historical masterpiece and the ethnic plea for tolerance. This film was built with the star's presence of my favorite actor the perfect Armand Assante, but it is also characterized by the scene of a shooting star? Hal Ozan. We recently saw him in the HBO TV series called "Sex". "Children of Wax" are entertained by the audience, but at the same time it has an eternal morality for ethnic tolerance. This is a wise way to determine well-being. Discussions on the contemporary problems of our days can be made with attractive means. This is a very positive side of the film "Children of Wax".
