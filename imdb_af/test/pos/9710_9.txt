Yes. Bam called out several times, and so did Englund. And most likely you will too. The whole cast is back in action and Knoxville has risen to become the true leader of this gang of devastated delays (I mean in the best possible way). At first I thought, maybe Bam or Steve-O were the chiefs. No, the chief is now Johnny. Don't get me wrong, everyone, and I think everyone is great in this movie! From the beginning you laugh and believe you, don't plan to rest that smile of yours. Personally, I think the movie definitely has better moments than the first. You know when you're in a theater and your kind doesn't want high expectations for it. Well, this movie blows away all expectations. If you like Jackass, you can enter it with great expectations. No matter what you're laughing at your ass. If you're not laughing, the reason is probably someone with a gun in your face to tell you if you're laughing, or you're ashamed of the sound of your laugh or the likelihood is that you're Jack Sh! T eat. for breakfast and Jack left town. All I have to say is prepare yourself to have a sore face to the movie. :)
