Challen Cates does a wonderful job depicting a clashing bride, between the challenges of her professional anticipation, the memories of the freedom she thought she would have in college (inspired by a well-known writer) and safety of her hanging marriage to a man she really does not love. This movie is definitely worth seeing --- as predictable as it may be, the play is inspiring and there is real chemistry between Challen Cates and Malcolm Jamaal Warner.
