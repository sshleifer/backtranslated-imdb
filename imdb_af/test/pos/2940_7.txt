This show is my guilty fun all the way !! When I first voted in America's Next Top Model, I got bored and got very stupid. I didn't. This show is really fun. I read on one of the other reviews that made you wonder if you needed to be America's next top model. And it does! Who doesn't like the brilliance and excitement that comes with a model? On ANTM you get to see how it really is. And who doesn't love the girls to hear the bitch about each other and get into battles? Or enjoy throwing something at the Janice lady? <br /> <br /> Give it a chance. Don't expect something intelligent or a show that you can look at a life lesson. Just enjoy it for what it is. Serious fun!
