An example of brilliant film. The epic story of three major phases of life for a young boy told with eloquence and raw fearlessness. Rarely does a movie come together that tells me aloud during most of the look, "it's a very good movie ...." time and time again. This is exactly what happened when I watched this movie. I really don't understand how anyone can't find it. I found myself laughing and laughing at the same moment, unable to control how I felt about the scene. The acting is outstanding. Eric Mabius - why is he not quite about film screens? He was really extraordinary. His seemingly effortless on-screen effort affected me deeply viscerally. I thank him. In my opinion, Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmmakers and I hope he continues to rise to the challenges he faces while trying to give us the art of horrible commercial filming. <br /> <br />
