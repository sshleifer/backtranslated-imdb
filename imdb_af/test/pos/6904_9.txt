If you want to see a big little horror comedy, with an ominous feeling, this is the one. If you are expecting a blood and at least it will scare your pants - this is not the one for you. <br /> <br /> For the budget this movie was recorded, the music was amazing! Although the film was filmed on a bargain budget, music and sound were definitely better than most big-budget movies! <br /> <br /> The story was really well done and the director should be praised. There is an almost perfect combination of comedy to horror in this movie! In addition, the acting is room to make a sequel for which I definitely look! I have no doubt that this movie becomes a cult classic. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, this movie twists the life story of a boy entering the career of becoming a tomb robber. It tells the story in the back of each of the more fantastic experiences the robber duo meets. Vampires to Zombies and even aliens! Our stars start stealing as a simple grave robber for jewelry, but quickly become a crazy doctor (Angus Scrim) who needs bodies for his medical practice. When the duo finds a way to get a vampire delivery, their tombs find a cruel worker discovering that the cruel body trade is much more profitable than simply stealing ordinary bodies. The only problem is that there is another gang called Murphy's house competing for the same unprecedented bodies - and that's where both tombs clash with headaches. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the most refreshing and exciting horror comedies I've seen in years and remind me of evil death. Don't miss this one, you'll regret it!
