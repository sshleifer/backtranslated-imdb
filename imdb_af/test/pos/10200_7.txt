This Western was founded in 1861 and deals with the creation of the first wireless line laid by Western Union. While good old Dean Jagger (sports many hairs) did his best to do so, there was a bad guy just waiting to withdraw it for his own selfish reasons. So it's either Randolph Scott or Robert Young to save the day. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of the better 1940s Westerns I've seen and it guaranteed almost 8 - it was so good. For my life, however, I have no idea why Fritz Lang was dedicated to directing this film - after all, he knew nothing of the Western. His forts were drama - and I think this movie is a kind of drama - just in the old west. Strange, yes, but it seems to work well, although I wonder how this great German director felt about this work. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the movie, it's exceptional - with bright color, excellent shooting location and very good acting. As usual, Randolph Scott added another relaxed and realistic performance. However, I was surprised when Robert Young was also thrown into the movie, but it was a good decision - he had to be a Harvard Oer over. When I saw that Barton MacLane was also in the movie, I pretty much assumed he would be the "bath" and my mind was well founded, because he made a career in playing jerks! Regarding the screenplay, it was pretty common to most, but the final confrontation between Scott and Barton MacLane was much better than I had hoped. This movie ends on a very high note.
