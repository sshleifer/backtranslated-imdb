It's an impressive woman's drama that men can enjoy. The plot follows a young woman (Hope Lange) who goes to college after work for a publisher. We can jump her in the position of forgiving secretary (hey, it's Hollywood) and some other mistakes. Here is one of the few films that once featured the great time producer Robert Evans (here a woman with attractive looks). It also features an adult Joan Crawford and a tremendous support role. Look at that.
