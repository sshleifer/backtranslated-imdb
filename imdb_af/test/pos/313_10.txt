Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now" is not a Vietnam War movie. Don't confuse it with one. It is set on the relapse of the war, but it is a metaphorical outline of the weakening effects of war on the human psyche. It is also one of the most thrilled movies ever made, manufactured or even invented (second for the Lord of the Rings trilogy.) To call it a masterpiece, will be an understatement of proportions so ambitious than the film's production levels. <br /> <br /> Run without credit and follow an unforgettable first scene playing on the side of the doors "The End" like Martin Sheen's captain, Benjamin L. Willard, hallucinating after images of helicopters and napalm. The plot is explained in the first place. 15 minutes. Willard's mission is to "end with extreme prejudice". Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), who has always disappeared AWOL in the enchantments of the Cambodian jungle, and as said by his general, "out there proper functioning restraint, completely out of the pale of any acceptable human behavior. And he is still in the field commanding troops. "Kurtz is a fraudulent colonel who is now worshiped by a large group of followers who called him a god. operati A little more manageable than the actual battle, but the journey he is going to take will be a personal quest that will challenge the boundaries of his human behavior. <br /> <br /> Team up with a small crew, starting off in the expansive waters of a river. Along the way, Willard teaches himself all things, Kurtz. During Sheen's bold voice, he describes his thoughts on the abundance of material he reads. Kurtz was a highly decorated and respected Green Beret. He was an ordinary man with a family, part of him conceded to the horrors of human cruelty and he led himself to the path that Willard led. The descent into the jungle is characterized by an enchanting aura that fought the battles not to fight far away. Eventually, the power of experience on the group as drugs and a kind of separate delivery fell on their senses. But Willard seems indifferent and desensitizes in his quest to find Kurtz. As he reads about this mythical figure, he was drawn to the man's power and why he became what he had become. We know Willard's slow decline will be parallel to Kurtz's. <br /> <br /> For decades, Marlon Brando has been honored. His presence: unmistakable. His genius: unmistakable. But for those who are unaware of his actions and not accustomed to his physical nuances, Brando may be seen as a hack in the eyes of a compromising filmmaker. He's definitely not. Brando was hard to work with, difficult to interpret and impossible to understand, but his talent for incomprehensible ridges and unparalleled monologues is irrefutable. Of course, the man knew what he was doing, even if we didn't. His colonel Kurtz is a creature of unlimited delusion and constant well-being. <br /> <br /> If the movie is any indication of traveling in hell as Francis Ford Coppola's real experience of making this masterpiece is a real life account of one man's fanatic struggle to produce a movie . Coppola is reported to have considered suicide during the film's 200-day principle photo schedule. The film was not just an unmistakable battle to make; It's a disturbing movie to watch. Coppola's sweat and blood sip through the pores of the steaming residents and his dedication filters through the openings of Martin Sheen's ghost soldier Willard. <br /> <br /> I can't help but feel a warm feeling of nostalgia for this type of movie. At the start of everything that was original and unprecedented, both challenged and stimulated films were commonplace. Audacity aside, Apocalypse Now is pure film-making. My respect and admiration for Mr. Coppola is of the highest order. But I shake the return to what became the norm for today's standards of film: a lack of innovation. It is not just the unoriginal of the world of theater today; It is the fact that no one seems to care about telling a story or telling one with heart. But we still have the biggest like Coppola's masterpiece, a film that has prayed in its ability to give us something deeper than we could understand. <br /> <br /> The depth of the Apocalypse Now is the step in madness. The murder can disturb. The loss of innocence can be unholy. But this is the damage from within; the innumerable obstacles of images that distress, evade and detach from our everyday world and the memories that plague our deepest thoughts, which ultimately separate us from mankind and bring us into the kingdom of instinct, the wild and the animal-like. If the thought of murder does not make provision, the deadly act provides man with his fundamental catharsis.
