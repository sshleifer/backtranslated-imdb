In a Morocco completely invaded by Europeans and Americans in the early twentieth century, Moroccan leader Mulay Achmed deprives Mohammed el-Raisuli of the Magnificent (Sean Connery) the American Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen), her son and her daughter. His intention is to get money and guns as ransom for them, to fight against the corrupt Sultan or Moroco (Marc Zuber). In times of election, US President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) agrees with the proposal. However, Raisuli is betrayed and Eden helps him to be released from prison with American soldiers. I don't like movies about explicit colonialism and lack of respect for the sovereignty of other countries, but "The Lion and the Wind" is indeed a great adventure. The action scenes are very realistic. Candice Bergen, the most beautiful American actress in the 70's, is wonderful, with a kidnapped woman as in the remarkable movie `Soldier Blue '. Sean Connery is perfect, as usual, as an honest and nationalist religious leader. Brian Keith is great like the American president. I don't know much about Morocco's history to analyze whether there is any truth in this story, but this movie is a valuable entertainment. In Brazil, it is only available on VHS. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Vento e o Le√£o" ("The Lion and the Wind") <br /> <br />
