When the Chinese syndrome was released, many right-wing critics and pro-nuke supporters blew this film, especially since its three leading stars were all known for their liberal politics and their open mistrust of nuclear power. But it only took two weeks and a near-accident at Three Mile Island to stop the critics. <br /> <br /> Fonda and Douglas are the LA news staff who see a potentially nasty accident at the Ventana nuclear power plant. Douglas rolls the event through the plant's soundproof glass; but the TV station will not air the footage, and fear a massive lawsuit. So it is up to Fonda and Douglas, despite a massive effort by the plant's owners to cover the accident. <br /> <br /> But a conscientious shift supervisor (Jack Lemmon) has some flaws in the plant's pump support structure. He believes that these deviations were the cause of the accident and that, although it would be very expensive and long, if repairs were not made, the next accident could be apocalyptic. But he can't find someone who works with him to believe his story. The result is a nightmare climax that brings together different political, technological and human interest stories in a disturbing package. <br /> <br /> While obviously fairly politically liberal, the CHINA SYNDROME is well-directed and co-written by James Bridges (THE QUESTION PAPER), is basically a message movie about the inherent dangers of technology and nuclear power . Basically, nuclear power can NEVER be made safe because people can never be perfect. This is what the film says; And in a very entertaining and exciting way, it says brilliantly.
