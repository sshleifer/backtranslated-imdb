When I saw it on TV, I was nervous. What is it that they wasted it? Millions of families like mine who live with a brain-damaged man, in my case, my father, will drop. I watched it with my mother and we both ceased crying, it was so accurate and trapped how the family felt as well as the person who had the brain injury. The actors were all wonderful and I had no complaints, my mothers told me she couldn't stop thinking. I hope this program has made many people aware of how it is to live with brain damage and how it is for families. More programs like this should be made, I was amazed at how good it was and it shook me emotionally.
