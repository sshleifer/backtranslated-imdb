But George and Gracie's are not among them. The movie is nice and the pool table scene with WC Fields should be one of the funniest I have ever seen, but Gracie and George are more annoying than comics in their roles, partly from the lack of texts and partly from their interpretation. I made it a 7 out of 10 for the rest of the cast, WC is a treasure of comic timing and energy in this one.
