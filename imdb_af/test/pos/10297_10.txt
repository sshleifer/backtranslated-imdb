It's a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> The plot is a good yarn, and is imaginatively told in a series of flashbacks and alternative views. What was deliberate and what happened? Who's in love with who? <br /> <br /> You get the opportunity to put each of the characters (sometimes literally) in the shoes, and it helps to define each character to a satisfactory depth. /> <br /> With a little effort following the turns, you can understand each of the characters; and key events in the film are returned from the point of view of different people. <br /> <br /> Use the opportunity when it comes back to your arthouse theater; It looks good on the big screen. <br /> <br /> More than guessing, turn the plot so far that you just sit and watch what unfolds. I confront someone to predict! <br /> <br /> But more likely you'll need more than one viewing. I saw it three times on the original release, and it got better every time. <br /> <br /> The play was very good, with a striking performance by Romane Bohringer as Alice tore in three directions by the three other characters in the ensemble. <br /> <br /> A classic. The second best film of the 1990s.
