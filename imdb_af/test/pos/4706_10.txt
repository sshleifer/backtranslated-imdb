I was first made aware of this movie when I saw a preview in front of another movie. I was intrigued, but it didn't see it before being in the theaters for a short while. <br /> <br /> It's not an easy movie to watch several times. There is much violence to unarmed citizens. There are lessons to be learned here. One of Patricia Arquette's lines picks up. "For Americans if it didn't happen on TV, it just didn't happen." There is a lot of truth about it. <br /> <br /> One more at one point, she thinks just because she announces she is an American citizen who will share soldiers and let her succeed. It does not work like that. <br /> <br /> The scenery is beautiful. The play is all decent. The PROFESSOR is especially good. Mainly though I care about these characters. Francis McDormand and Spaulding Gray are good, but their appearance is short, so they don't matter. Patricia has guts. In the hands of a smaller actor, it could have been very difficult. Since it is the love or hate of the movie, you still have to get away with the idea that military dictatorship still exists in this century, and until one of our own is hurt, we ignore their oppression. <br /> <br /> Aung San Suu Kyi is the female political leader in the movie. In real life she won the Nobel Peace Prize. She was only released from house arrest recently. The W. Bush administration, from the time I write it, attempts to push the military government to talk to her and reform the government. The Burmize government was under such investigations that changed the name of the country to the Maynamar Republic. The US government has yet to recognize the new name. <br /> <br /> If you don't want a message in your movie, don't watch this one. If you don't care about a little education with your entertainment then this is a good one.
