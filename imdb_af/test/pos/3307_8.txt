You can't take this movie seriously. The plot is predictable and thin, the play is often at the top, the dialogue is ridiculous; but all this adds to fun! Three "careers" in the late 1950s found their way to the BIG city and all the evils and temptations their mothers probably warned them: married men, alcohol, premarital sex, abortion, etc. <br /> <br /> Then there is Amanda Farrell (Joan Crawford) who has been professionally successful but whose personal life was offered to an office with her name on the door. <br /> <br /> This movie may have been credible 50 years ago, but now it's just a great camping fun! Hire / buy and enjoy.
