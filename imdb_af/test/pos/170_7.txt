Sorry about the "extremely clever" summary phrase. I don't know what I think, but I really couldn't help. <br /> <br /> I meant to see a long time Bloody Birthday and I must say it was a pleasant surprise to accidentally find a copy of this movie. And believe me, I live in a small South American town and these things are very unlikely to happen. It is a pity that some of these "jewels" from the 80's are now almost completely forgotten. 'Bloody Birthday' is one of those movies that is surprisingly enough to stay alert today. Not a masterpiece for sure, but still entertaining and guessing what? ... it doesn't really have unintentional funny scenes. I know it's a shocker if we keep in mind that it's a low budget of the early 80's over a group of evil children who kill people. But trust me, the movie ready to stay for the most part. <br /> <br /> In 'Blood Birthday', the story revolves around three children born during a total eclipse. According to astrology, during eclipses, the sun and the moon block Saturn, which control emotions. As a result, the three children born that day eventually become rude and angry. As they have no sense of remorse at all, these 10-year-olds are basically gangbearing, including their own parents and brothers and sisters ... and killing them! The body number rises day by day and the police authorities believe there is a psychopath around the place. Meanwhile, Debbie, Curtis and Steven should not hesitate to kill people, as none of such lovely English faces suspected (?) <br /> <br /> As I said before, "Bloody Birthday" is surprisingly funny no. I know I said before, but I'm really surprised. I expected some hilariously bathing scenes, but the movie proved wrong to me. True, this is not exactly what most people will consider a 'serious' horror movie, but if I have to be fair, I will say that the story is done properly. One of the main reasons one usually expects ridiculous situations (as I did) is because the young actors in this kind of movies where the biggest villains are, tend to be terrible and make the whole thing laughable. Let's say: children tend to be horrible actors, who are understandable and we can't blame them. But to my surprise, the three young actors who played the ruthless killers in this role seem very disturbing and not at all funny. The rest of the actors are also good and if you are a George Clooney fan, you can see his uncle playing a doctor in this movie. Yes, I know right? ... who cares? Also, Julie Brown, the great actress, singer, comedienne and gay icon, gives a solid performance as the naughty older sister and if anyone is interested in nudity: his stripe is also in one of the screens and she looks very naked. She didn't have more time on the screen! Julie is 'absolutely fantastic': P <br /> <br /> So basically this movie is good if you're in the mood for a modest horror from the 80's. My only objection to "Bloody Birthday" is the way to justify the children's motives. It may be one of the lowest points of the movie. Let's see: if children born during an eclipse end up with heartless murderers, how come these three only people who actually killed people? I'm sure there were other children born the same day ... and also during other days of total embezzlement, oh well! Overall, no big problem, it's just a simple observation, that's all. I saw worse, trust me. Take, for example, 'The Children' (1980), in which the preliminary killer gets their anger after they have turned into zombies by toxic cloud. No, believe me, 'Bloody Birthday' is much more decent and if you enjoy simple slashers, you will enjoy this one very much. <br /> <br /> So, now you know: you're invited to the children's birthday party ... and the host will serve a nice poisoned cake for you and the rest of the guests. Come on, you can't miss it;)
