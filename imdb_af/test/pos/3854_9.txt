This movie is great, I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a cat mother named Dutchess and her 3 kittens. T Dutchess and the kittens love music. They need to practice the piano every day. But the butler named Edgar tries to kidnap Dutchess and her kittens, which he tries to get them to sleep. But he failed. They Dutchess meets a cat named Thomas O Maily. Thomas falls in love with Dutchess. The cats break into the song. With the song everyone wants to be a cat. Thomas loves music like the other cats. Thomas and Dutchess really like each other. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and I love the cats!
