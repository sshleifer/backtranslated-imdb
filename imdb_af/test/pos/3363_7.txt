Overall, the Dad's Army movie is very funny, although the humor is not quite as catchy and sparkling as in the TV and radio series. So where does it leave us, the viewers? If you've never seen the dad's army, then the movie is a great way to speed up and tie yourself to the mad world of Walmington o / S. The downside is that you might not be able to get it, because as I said, the humor in the movie is a bit on the fixed side. <br /> <br /> For Dad's Army buffs, the movie does not hold anything new than the story. is more or less a cut from the TV series, but it is a unique opportunity to see your favorites in "high def" compared to the brilliant quality of BBC video recordings. <br /> <br /> The movie also contains what should be the lamest holdup in the history of the universe. I can't think whether it's a positive or a negative.
