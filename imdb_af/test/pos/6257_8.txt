* Minor Spoiler * <br /> <br /> Resident is not scary, but it is creepy. It's an interesting 'little' story with good acting and good special effects makeup. <br /> <br /> Basic plot: A little girl blames the strange things happening to her family's new home and accompanying playhouse on her fairy friends. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't waste time moving, though the end could have been more involved. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie to those who expect their hardcore horror to be, but I recommend it to those who want a chiller and not necessarily a thrill.
