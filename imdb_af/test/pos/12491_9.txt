It's an exceptional picture with so much to recommend. The acting and writing are great and there are many big twists in the plot. As a French "Noir" film, his language is definitely much nicer than his American counterparts, but for me it has only added to realism. In addition, I liked how non-glamorous everyone was - especially the man and the lieutenant. Over the only negative, and why the movie gets a 9 and not a 10, is because there was a spectacular plot hole. Like another famous French film, Dr√¥le de Drame, the confusion between the police and the accused could have been easy in the beginning, but the characters made quite stupid decisions. For this you do not have to suspend unbelief and keep looking - it is worth waiting. <br /> <br /> It's just one of the best French movies I've seen. Period.
