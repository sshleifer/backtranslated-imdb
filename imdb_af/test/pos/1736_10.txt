I enjoy dr. Who enjoys being serious. <br /> <br /> Seriously, don't just reject me as a "sci-fi person" because I'm not normal. I caught because a friend was sleeping when they started watching it. It's actually very funny, and more often than not, it's faster. All my family look closely and it is a miracle. <br /> <br /> Christopher Ecclestion is pretty good, but David Tennant is brilliant. I think it's because he made the doctor so manic and it's just nice to have that little bit of eccentricity back in a TV character. <br /> <br /> I don't know what it's all about, but everything runs like clockwork. <br /> <br /> All I'm going to say is just trying it out. One episode (probably the best if you don't choose the second half of a two-party).
