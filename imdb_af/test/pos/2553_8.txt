This almost documentary looking at an enterprising boy living in the store outside New York is really the whole way. True relief. Real sound. Less editing throughout the movie than in 1 minute of most movies. And while there is very little writing, there's a story. Shot in primary colors, almost everything red, white, blue and yellow, we get a real sense of the life of a boy making something of nothing. He has a place to live that he makes his own, has a good job, and tries to bring his sister into his small universe. The people in the cafe shopping area also give us a look at this culture that I didn't know. They usually look decent and pay Ale what looks daily, and really looks worried about his well-being. The actor (I think) plays Ale says more with one facial expression than one can imagine. It reminded me what a real little movie can achieve. It shows what children are capable of, even without much support and love. Definitely recommended.
