I've seen this movie more than 50 times in my life, and every time I see it, the movie is just as entertaining as it was the first time! George Berger (played by Treat Williams) leads a small group of the 1960s anti-war "hippies" who generally live in New York City. This small group happens on a young man, Claude Bukowski (played by John Savage) who was acting in the US Army for service in Vietnam. In spite of their best efforts to discourage him, Claude finally reports on basic military training. Still worried about leaving them, the hippie group steals a car and travels across the US to visit Claude "... for a few hours," in the words of George Berger (at a MPs stationed at the gateway of the Army base Claude is temporarily stationed in Nevada). The outcome really comes, so I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen this fantastic movie yet. The musical score is just as fantastic! Don Dacus (of rock group Chicago), who plays the part of "Woof" - one of the hippies, is not a key character, but the movie would not have been the same without him. Beverly D'Angelo (who plays Sheila Franklin, a uptown girl befriended by the hippie group) is sensational in her role! A MAG SE movie!
