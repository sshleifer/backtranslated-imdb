The above rule makes it pretty good. The best assets of the comics are visual gags and word jokes (the latter is almost impossible to translate, so the cartoons are at their best in their original language). <br /> <br /> Both are very difficult to capture in film, so it will never be as good as the comics. Movies are just another medium than comics. With this in mind, this movie is surprisingly good at capturing the pleasure of the cartoon. <br /> <br /> The word gags is portable, and sometimes even funny (Debouze does an Amelie reference!). I must mention that I watched the French version. If you don't watch the French version or your lack of understanding of the French language limits you to the captions, the word jokes will probably suck. <br /> <br /> The slapstick is also good; It's a very simple form of humor, and not really funny when you are older than twelve, but it captures the spirit of the comics. The other visual jokes were heard by the film's saving grace for the parent, as they are often very funny. <br /> <br /> The acting is quite upside down, but again it is not annoying, as it is the spirit of the comics. Just Depardieu and Clavier aren't really surprised, which is why some people think they didn't enjoy their roles (I didn't see anything). On the other hand, Jamel Debouze and especially Claude Rich change in an art form. It's actually fun to watch. Again I fear it will not be as funny as the voices are being baptized. <br /> <br /> Overall, not a bad movie, much better than the previous one. It's not a classic and it's not the Twelve Tasks of Asterix as my favorite Asterix movie, but it's still worth seeing. The French version, that is. 10/07
