This movie is like "The Breakfast Club" meets "Mad City." It has one plot to the other with Justin Walker, Corey Feldman, and James Remar who really deliver good performances. However, this movie is not for everyone. If you don't like movies that are "completely gone" with violence, don't watch the last twenty minutes. My wife had to leave the room. Of course I can't take my eyes off the screen. It is a very keen, realistic teenage drama. I can't believe it comes from B-Movie King Roger Corman. This movie is a must-see for those who are not tired of heart. Highly recommended.
