I first saw this movie as a younger child. My sister told me about it and I thought it would be more of a child's movie. However, it also remains an incredible movie. It is true that the subject behind the movie is ruff, but also, this movie will never stop touching your heart. <br /> <br /> I was only 6 when I first saw it and just yesterday, 7 years later, I saw it again. For the first time in a long time. Even after I knew how it ended, I knew I saw it a billion, bizillium times I cried like a teenage baby. When I saw it a few years back, I finally got the idea and the seriousness of the movie. So I stopped watching it for a while. But yesterday I didn't change the channel, I watched it. By the end I was amazed at how much it still made me laugh, cry, think and, above all, believe in mercury. I haven't lived long ago and this movie got me out of my shell and opened my heart. This movie didn't only have an impact. I was so impressed with the actors. Especially Bobby. So if you want to watch this movie for the first time, I suggest you see it alone. With tissues. And be ready to discover your young, sweet, innocent side and the hope that still has hope. This movie touched my soul when I was only 6. And even in this time trying to find out who I am this movie, I helped to realize what I didn't and still want to be alive.
