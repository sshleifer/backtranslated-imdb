This movie was wonderful, didn't understand the disrespect it got. I only saw it in 87-88 and it was scary. If you are an 80-year-old horror fan, you shouldn't have a problem with this movie, it has everything that makes 80's horror great. I met some of the actors and they were cool. What is not nice about a creepy old house, demons, crazy parties and horny nice young people. The dialogue and the special fx made this movie a classic. This film also provided one of those classic rumors about the horror. The black man who should not always die must eventually die. Although this movie was great, there is one thing that remains unspoiled for me, which was really with the old couple at the end it deliberately or not that little side story thing that has already surprised me.
