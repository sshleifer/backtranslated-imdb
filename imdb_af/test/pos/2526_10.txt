Pixote is targeted with scarce sentimentality. And yet I imagine more than Hector Babenco, who owes his filmmakers with this film to Vittorio De Sica's neo-realistic style, especially Shoeshine (that movie, like Pixote, mostly takes place in a child's prison). And yet, while I still prefer the De Sica movie when it comes to deciding between the two, it is so close because it is not a pun intended to choose between two children. They are both wonderful works of raw drama, and with Pixote Babenco has an extra edge and terrifying quality to cope with the fact that it is not filmed in conditions that have been brought to a world war. So it was in Brazil. One would see it with a little more flair and awe in the city of God, perhaps in some places. And these kids were on the street before and after the movie. Some people still live 20+ years later, for everyone who knows. <br /> <br /> The "star", pre-teen street kid Fernando Ramos da Silva, plays the title character, a youth without dad or really a family who will look out for him and among dozens of other street children and criminals in a reformation for boys. The conditions can't be much worse, and even more intolerable because two children are killed one after another by the cause of the guard. There is a riot, and an escape, and halfway through the movie we find Pixote with some other youths, including Lilica, a practical transvestite, not even 18. They become bags, drug dealers, anything to come by. Neither of these, I have to be repeated, is shown with some kind of crushing seriousness - surely, you will never see in a million years that Ron Howard or Paul Haggis manage this kind of picture - and yet there is an emotional honesty For everything, exactly because nothing is trivialized. <br /> <br /> Almost every scene is important to show how fragile life is for Pixote, and how it can be killed in any way or somehow, and without reaching puberty, He is still at the level of those around him who are a little older (but not at all) and become things that this person will haunt forever. Despite Babenco's use of a soft and sad musical score and one or two scenes with people crying, nothing feels compelled. As with De Sica, perhaps more than the consistent conditions of San Paolo and Rio street children, he is a natural director of children, and co-operations from Ramos da Silva and Jorge Juli√£o and others are very good work that just provides the right touch. of "cinematic" drama (it's not so realistic that it becomes documentary, not bad) and even subtle in some scenes. <br /> <br /> Pixote may not be well known It's later the 21st century Brazilian movies that look back at the horrors of Rio, or even neo-realistic movies, but it should be. Anyone who wants a good, hard look at how it was, should look at a library or other and see what the best foreign movie of 1981 is.
