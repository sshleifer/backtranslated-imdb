Simply the best and most realistic movie about the Second World War I've ever seen. Not only because German soldiers speak German and Russian soldiers speak Russian (no English in a German or Russian dialect) also because of the realistic d√©cor in which the movie was shot. The acting is outstanding. No Hollywood sentiment at all, even no love story. Stalingrad was one of the terrifying battles during the war, and in such a context there is no place for sentiment or romantic scenes. What you get is a movie that excites you to the leg and has one of the best unlucky ends that a movie can have.
