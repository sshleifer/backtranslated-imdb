I'm not sure which version of the movie I saw, but it was very entertaining. <br /> <br /> I didn't know who the "Twins" (Gillian Chung and Charlene Choi) was before I saw this movie and I think the English translation of the title is somewhat misleading. <br /> <br /> The martial arts are very well done. I especially loved them because there was a lot of judo / joke that was filmed very nicely. Donnie Yen (see him in Hero, good performance) as a director is great because he knows how to shoot these scenes. <br /> <br /> Everything has flowed to me, except there is one scene where the girls are fighting the roof with bamboo poles. It really has nothing to do with the plot, but it is still entertaining. <br /> Overall, this is one of the better (modern) HK action movies I've seen for a while. Although in some respects it is bare, it still pulls off. <br /> <br /> Definitely a 9/10
