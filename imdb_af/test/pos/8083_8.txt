"The Vicious Circle" is a very unknown British mystery story. Like many Hitchcock movies, it's about a man accused of a crime he hasn't committed and does everything he can to prove it. This time it is a Dr Latimer (John Mills), who is a murdered German actress from his floor. As an honest man, the doctor calls Scotland Yard, which seems to be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> There is really nothing special in this little movie. Still, watching the movie is an entertaining way to pass time. I enjoyed following the plot development. Fine actors are a plus.
