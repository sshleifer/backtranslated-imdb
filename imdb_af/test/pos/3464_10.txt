If you want a movie with the full range of emotion, look no further; dramatic and funny, and scenes of twisting emotion; I can safely guarantee. Very little will be able to see this hot and VERY human film without shaking a tear. The actions of the two leads are hard to believe; you will swear the two young men who actually do not suffer from muscular dystrophy (Rory) and cerebral palsy (Michael); simple, two of the FINEST performances I've ever seen; It's also two very credible characters, and you never feel that things are just "thrown in" for dramatic purposes or sympathy. In the DVD edition as "extras", they have "deleted scenes" (including an alternate end) and an "extended party sequence"; why these cuts are not included in the final movie is difficult to understand as they fit perfectly into the rest of the film and are in no way superfluous. But without reservation I can highly recommend this movie to anyone; one of the best I've ever seen.
