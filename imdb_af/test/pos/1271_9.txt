Brit director Chrstopher Nolan now has a career in America and a reputation for making films both popular and critical. but this little movie was where he started. And it certainly showed its talent, with its striking black-and-white cinematography and achronological storytelling predicting its later 'Momento', albeit in a less extreme way. Themed and mechanic, the plot reminds me of David Mamet's "House of Games", but the film still feels fresh and sharp until the final twist of the end is expected, but whose pace is unexpectedly enjoyable. However, the play is not quite in the same class - the film has a stylized quality, and possibly to a greater extent than the director planned. But it's still a good debut, at the same time claustrophobic and deceptive.
