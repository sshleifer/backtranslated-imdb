I had to watch it on television when it was aired the first few decades ago. I thought it was brilliant then, and as I remember so much, I could have been right. While living in and around London, I can't call myself a London person and don't know it at all. Who does other than taxi drivers? Once the viewer understands the point of departure; that here is a group of men trying to learn the seemingly illegible and lead to the status of demigods, then the rest is pure joy. The characters are well confronted, their family relationships are equally diverse and so differently affected by the events of the film. Don't think it's a documentary - it's pure drama, and knowledge is one of the characters. I've never seen anything like this movie before or since. Beware!
