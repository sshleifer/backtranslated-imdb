I think this movie is the most misunderstood movie in Jerry Lewis's career. It's a bit slow, but after that, it's very funny and Jerry's irony is like never before in his previous movies. A mockery of the Dirty Dozen, instead of killing soldiers to do a suicide mission like the movie, you have 4, 4-f and 2-tagged. Including the former L.A. Dodgers all-star Centerfielder, Willie Davis as Linc! Hilarious! Love that movie!
