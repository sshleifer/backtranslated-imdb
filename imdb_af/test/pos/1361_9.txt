Golden Son, in my opinion, estimates the sleeping / lost treasures out there. A sexy comedy, about a young man's quest to find his neck alive and he blunders in all sorts of strange jobs that somehow have this sexy girl who eventually falls to him, but he didn't really realize it not! It's really something you can easily miss when you name it, but once you see it ... it will fall to the comedy / silliness that lies inside. Truly a crime made of just 6 OVA episodes and pilot film was made. However, it is unique as it is. I'm surprised it survived to produce so much. If you want a good laugh, with high quality anime (100% CGI free), watch this anime out. Son who can one day save the world .... or maybe not.
