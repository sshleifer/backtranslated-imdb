If anyone doubts the talent of Liev Schrieber, just look for his new movie, "Everything is Illuminated", which clearly shows a man who is not just one of America's best actors, but a new director whose first attempt some inspiration and a harbinger of what follows. Mr. Schreiber adapted the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer to a film that will live forever because of the way the director adapted the material. The film exceeded our expectations, as we had no preconceived ideas. <br /> <br /> For those who haven't watched the movie, you may have to stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Jonathan is a collector. His love for his grandparents is unlimited. He watched his grandfather die and as his grandmother was, it was her deathbed. At a clear moment, this dying woman gives Jonathan a picture and an amber decoration for his collection. Looking at the photo, long ago, a young couple was seen together. Jonathan thinks it's the grandfather and his girlfriend who are happier. Looking at the photo seems to be the motivation for this intense young man to seek his ancestors' past in Ukraine. <br /> <br /> Jonathan made arrangements with a travel agency, Heritage Tours, from Odessa for his journey to Trochenbrod, the mythical place his grandfather came from. The agency is handled by an older man who claims to be blind, and his grandson, Alex, a man who loves the pop-American culture that has captured his imagination, as well as his contemporaries in the country. Alex speaks some kind of english that nobody talks about and his conversation and translation, because Jonathan's benefit is hilarious to us for using sometimes unheard of English terms. The old man insists on taking his dog, Sammy Davis Jr., against Jonathan's wishes, who do not want to sit next to the mustache and barking animal during the trip. <br /> <br /> As they start looking for Trochenbrod, it's clear that his companions, especially the old man, have no idea where he is going. At this stage, the film becomes a road movie, as the three characters riding on the back roads of the country become more familiar with each other. As the trio arrives at the sunflower field at home, it indicates they have come to the right place. Some places are a clear reminder of past conflicts. <br /> <br /> The older woman who lives in the secluded place is the missing link of the story. She can put things in the right perspective. But here's where the story changes his emphasis from Jonathan, who clearly came to the land of his ancestors, to the old man. We look at how this older man begins to remember things about himself. This, in turn, changes the dynamics of the movie, as we discover how Jonathan and his guides are connected all the time. <br /> <br /> Some criticisms in these pages expressed opinions on the accuracy of the story, which, after all, is a work of fiction and freedom. It would have been impossible to make another movie, including so much in the book. The great way in which the movie is divided into different chapters is a clever way to let the viewer know what is about to see. <br /> <br /> Elijah Wood, a wonderful film actor, does a great job by underlining Jonathan. Mr. Wood makes one of his best appearances in any film with his main character interpretation. The unfortunate decision of Eugene Hutz as Alex, the Ucranian tour assistant and translator, seems to be an idea in heaven. Mr. Hutz is about the best thing in the film. His arcane use of English gives the film a funny angle that pleases the viewer. Boris Leskin as Alex's grandfather and driver of the tour car makes a valuable contribution to the film, as well as Laryssa Lauret, who is seen in the latter part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The excellent cinematography of Matthew Libatique brings the splendor of the Czech Republic's countryside into all its greatness. The musical score by Paul Cantelon is heard in the background of the film, and it gives the film a wealth. <br /> <br /> Above all, it's a triumph for Liev Schreiber, the first director who definitely goes a long way in whatever he decides to do next.
