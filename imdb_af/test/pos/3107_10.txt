The Ghost Walks are a fine little mystery with a big twist, funny dialogue, and the best of everything that played a pansy was played by character actor Johnny Arthur who never eludes or breaks his character. Mr. Arthur is wonderful in his role as Homer Erskine, who brings great comic relief as Broadway producer Herman Wood's secretary, played by another great character actor Richard Carle. <br /> <br /> They play excellently from each other. <br /> <br /> Although the acceptable words of time sissy and cream puff are used to describe the character of Homer, it never means enthusiastic or intended as disruption and is not spoken by the male men of the movie no. by his employer who ignites every other scene and shows an almost indignant love for his dedicated employee. <br /> <br /> There is a wonderful scene where Homer tells his boss that he is the best years of his life for him and is anything but a mother to him. <br /> <br /> The mystery corner of the movie is very entertaining, and the twist to the end can only let you down. <br /> <br /> For a low budget poverty drive photo, this movie has a beautiful set of decoration and great cost. <br /> <br /> Direc Tor Frank Strayer handles his roll of cast and this movie is much better than some of his other low budget mystery efforts, but he had a good script to work with and some great actors carry it through. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must see for dedications of poverty driving movies, old dark house mysteries (they actually managed to work in the lines "It was a dark and stormy night) and that has the added bonus of making an early representation of a gay character in the movie where nothing is finally bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is available for download in the public domain movie section of the Internet Archive at archive.org .
