So what is 'Batman Returns' anyway? <br /> <br /> It has been marketed as an action movie, and many people who have seen it seem to think they have watched an action movie - but really there is not so much action, and Tim Burton looks hardly about it. <br /> <br /> People often link it to the 'grittier' superhero comics of the late eighties, but frankly, if you're 'The Dark Knight Returns', it just looks a little absurd; Burton's excessive imagination has more in common with the day-to-day sixty-TV series (the Penguin rides in a giant plastic duck for the sake of goodness). <br /> <br /> Burton's style is often described as gothic, and it is a little closer to what we see on the screen; The Penguin - distorted, malignant, with an entangled history and an underground army - is a gothic threat attracted to more respected Dickensian clothes - Udolfo masquerading as Uriah Heep. <br /> <br /> But what about Catwoman? She can be raised from the dead, but the PVC cat box is definitely the twentieth century, and her alter ego Selina Kyle's world is all the management rooms and apartments - reminiscent of a romantic comedy of 1930. <br /> <br / > And then click it. The clever but disgruntled secretary computerized by a lonely millionaire? The resulting complications caused by deception and disguise? Batman Returns is definitely a romantic comedy in the old Hollywood style, filtered by Burton's S&M dungeon sensibilities. It has more in common with 'The Hudsucker Proxy' (including expressionist sets) than with other superhero movies. <br /> <br /> Like a romantic comedy, it is centered around the dominance of the heroine; not from ugly duckling to swan, but from doormat to dominatrix. Michelle Pfeiffer gives one of the ideas of her (often remarkable) career; She is symbolically sexy as Catwoman (poor Halle Berry never had prayer), playful and vengeful, unforgettable because she knows how to act with her whole body. In retrospect, however, it was her screens like Selina that impressed; almost every one of them is a small comic jewel, especially the shine we get from her lonely home life. It is a finely balanced tragicomic show, and it is in these scenes that the film really comes alive. Nothing really moves me like Selina and Bruce Wayne who under the mistletoe dance to Siouxsie and the Banshees dance, a gun held between them, simultaneously empowered and trapped by their alter egos, doomed to conflict. Forget the easy sentimentality of 'Big Fish' or the gossamer emotions of 'Edward Scissorhands' - this is the most sincere scene in all Burton's films. Love, revenge, fatalism, fetishism, insanity, self-rejection and not a little white, all in a few short lines and absolutely nailed by the actors - especially Pfeiffer. <br /> <br /> Elsewhere, Danny de Vito meets almost her and finds the wounded dignity buried beneath the really repulsive longhaired. The topscores of the comics are revealed to be nothing more than a sham; Burton's Penguin is a wild creature subject to his own Eliza Doolittle style makeover (almost literally an ugly duckling). It's Burton's most radical - and funniest - rediscovery. Christopher Walken's Max Schreck completes a perfect triptych villain who moves between comfortable charms and bright-eyed psychosis with unpleasant ease (and that's just me, or lets his company's logo Mickey Mouse? Maybe we should ask former Disney animator Burton) . <br /> <br /> Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins" - a real action movie - is highly regarded as the first movie to do right on Batman; I admire Nolan's movie, but it would be a shame if it allowed this idiosyncratic jewel to move over.
