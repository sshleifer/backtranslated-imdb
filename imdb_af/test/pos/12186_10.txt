I remember not seeing this movie for the first time, but it grew on me. I love the costumes and put the actors, the humor, the cinematography, the soundtrack. The screens are very rich, and they move very fast. Every time I see it, there's something new that catches my eye. Aaliyah as Akasha is probably the only thing that ruins it, but not enough. <br /> <br /> Also the Lestat in this movie is different, it's not the same character. You can see that the character Armand received Lestat-like attributes because I assumed Anne wanted it. But there's no reason to get rid of this movie, just because it's not like books, it's fascinating in itself.
