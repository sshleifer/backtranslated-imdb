I've already looked through the Grand Champion twice. I enjoyed the movie's story, the characters and the actors were not bad. It is refreshing to see a G data. It's a good movie. The story mostly comes from the face of the children. The interactions between the children and the adults make the story interesting. I recommend this movie if you are looking for a family movie. If you like the Little Rascals, you'll probably enjoy it. I watched this movie on the cable. Either on Encore or Showtime family. This is not a movie I would like to see at the theater. But I'm just going to the theater for the effects of the big screen, so most comedies, romantic movies or dramas, I'm not going for the big screen. I'm waiting for TV / cable edition. Get your kids together, button popcorn and enjoy!
