Hitchcock has made at least 11 films about the ordinary man who is mistakenly accused (sometimes sometimes not running) to prove his innocence in a situation beyond his control. The first one is the 39 steps that really made him. popular in Great Britain. It's really his signature theme. <br /> <br /> Other include "Young and Innocent", "Saboteur", "Spellbound", "Stage Fright", "Strangers on a Train", "I Confess", "Catching a Thief", "The Wrong Man", "North by Northwest", and finally "Frenzy". "Saboteur" starts Robert Cummings as war killer Barry Kane accused of killing his co-worker and best friend during a sabotage on the plant. He meets model Patricia Martin, who is played by actress Priscilla Lane during the course of the law, and later on, of course, the various Nazi / Fascist sympathizers. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is essentially like the 39 steps, including similar plot devices such as handcuffs, the blonde who doesn't trust the main character in the beginning, a race across the country (in one case London to Scotland and in the other California to New York) and meet the "colorful" residents along the way. And so, like "The Man Who Went Too Much", I believe it's an American remake of one of Hitchcock's previous works. <br /> <br /> I think Robert Cummings was chosen because he is generally a very ordinary American, an "allman" with whom the audience can identify. I love Priscilla Lane, because her character is more involved with the action than Madeline Carroll in "The 39 Steps" and Rut Roman in "Strangers on a Train". As mentioned elsewhere, Otto Kruger steals the show as the villain. I also liked Vaughan Glaser's actions as the blind uncle; its lines are large. There are some funny touches along the way for some comic relief, such as road signs featuring Priscilla Lane's character on them, and circus sideshow artists, and truck driver, Murray Alper. Unlike other opinions here, there are not too many characters who believe Barry Kane's innocence immediately. <br /> <br /> There are a few slow parts, especially when the action moves to New York, but it picks up fast when <br /> <br /> This is one of my favorite movies from Hitchcock ( I put it in my top 5), especially in these days of the new war on terrorism. I think it gets home. <br /> <br /> That makes you think, "Can my colleague be involved in something wrong?" In fact, one of the movie posters for "Saboteur" proclaimed "Watch Out for the Man behind your back!" Imagine how it played during the Second World War in the minds of adults.
