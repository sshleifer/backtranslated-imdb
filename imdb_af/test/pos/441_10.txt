"French Cancan" is one of my favorite all time movies. It's an excellent movie. There is color, there is humor, there is music. It is a very good portrait of the so-called Belle Ã‰poque, although Jean Renoir's priorities are always a creation, a fantasy. So the movie is not a historical movie. The final rows in which girls can dance are unforgettable images. It's a movie you shouldn't miss.
