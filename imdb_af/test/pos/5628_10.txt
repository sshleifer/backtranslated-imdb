Every time I don't give 150% of my dreams or goals, I think of Mark Borchardt, the real subject of "American Movie". Mark's persistent persistence in making and shooting his first feature film is so engaging that it will make you laugh, shake your head with grief and root him. <br /> <br /> I didn't see a documentary version, it's honest since the movie on R. Crumb. The supporting "cast" (Mark's real family and friends) are all good. Give this movie a chance and you will see a wonderful movie and a wonderful portrait of the things the American dream is made of.
