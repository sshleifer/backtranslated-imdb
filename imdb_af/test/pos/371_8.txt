I knew the idea of ​​this movie, and of course I can't miss a good sound film, especially from Mr Alfred Hitchcock, the Master of Suspense director. Basic tennis camp Guy Haines (Farley Granger) meets eccentric stranger, Bruno Anthony (Robert Walker) on a train traveling from Washington to New York. Bruno talks about a perfect murder, Guy hates his wife, and Bruno hates his father, so Bruno "suggests" to exchange murders. Guy obviously didn't take him seriously, of course, when Guy's wife, Miriam Joyce Haines (Kasey Rogers (or Laura Elliott)) was murdered in an amusement park. Guy, of course, is the main suspect, and Bruno clashes with him and reminds him of their "plan" and gives him more things to help him kill the father he wants to kill. This murder investigation and Bruno's stalking threaten his tennis career and his relationship with Sen's daughter. Morton (North North West's Leo G. Carroll), Anne (Rut Roman). Bruno realizes that Guy will not do his murder, so he decides to plant the testimony at the crime scene to make him guilty, Guy's monogrammed label in the amusement park. After his tennis game, Guy and Anne (who of course found out the murder plan) went to the amusement park to stop Bruno, and they fought on the speedy out-of-control carousel, Patricia Hitchcock (the director's daughter), such as Barbara Morton, Marion Lorne, like Anthony, Jonathan Hale as Anthony, Howard St John as Police Capt. Turley and John Brown as Prof Collins and Hitchcock's cameo, is the Man. Some interesting dialogue and character interactions, some good-tense moments, and of course the memorable carousel final, a good classic movie, nominated the Oscar for Best Cinematography, and Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 at The 100 Great Pop Pop Culture Icons, the movie was number 32 on 100 years, 100 Thrills.
