Monster of Mexico I agree is the worst of modern Scooby Doo movies, mainly due to the poor plot and how predictable it was. However, Loch Ness Monster is a significant improvement, with beautiful animation, honest Scotland looks pretty. The music is good, and the plot is well thought out. In addition, there is a great dialogue, and the voice show is fantastic, with Casey Kasem a consistent delight as Shaggy, and the beautiful Scottish singer Sheena Easten is a pleasant surprise in a guest starring role. In fact, my only complaints were a few strange accents in one or two members of the cast, with the exception of Easten, whose accent actually sounds, and somehow the Loch Ness Monster was not as well designed as it did. would be possible. Overall, a solid and enjoyable Scooby Doo movie. 8/10 Bethany Cox
