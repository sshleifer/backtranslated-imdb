Alfred Hitchcock's remake of "The Man Who Who Were Too Much" is usually not considered as good as the original, but for me it is one of the best movies ever. I prefer it to "Vertigo" and "Rear Window." <br /> <br /> Like "North At Northwest," it is the story of an average man who is reluctantly thrown into the world of international intrigue. James Stewart is the father of a kid being kidnapped because he is wrong with an international spy. He will do anything to make sure he gets his son back and protects his family. <br /> <br /> While the original was good for its time, it's hard to look at today's standards. The remake has excellent production quality, an engaging Doris day, and a very creepy villain. <br /> <br /> Don't worry about renting this one, because you'll want to see it over and over again.
