You are looking for a comic drama with excitement and an ensemble cast? Now find this little place to sleep. John Lithgow and Billy Bob Thorton are big in this little plot twister. Don't forget the cameo by Jamie Lee Curtis. A touch of the 60's, a touch of the "Prince and the Pauper", and a dash of that homemade gold, make for a little small story.
