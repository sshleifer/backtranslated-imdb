We have again given a top quality film. This director is incredible, and he has proven that he is equally talented and effective when crossing genres. <br /> <br /> The excellent character development of the film, through dialogue and personality issues, but also with more subtle details (Ramon's father's look), allows the audience to identify with the protagonists very carefully, the importance of make and emotional impact of events that are becoming increasingly deeper. The visuals are sometimes, simple, sometimes impressive (the dream to the beach), and I think Almen√°bar's films really benefit from the fact that he also composes the music - it fits seamlessly into the changing mood of the film. <br /> <br /> More than just a movie about euthanasia, which in itself is an important issue, this movie tackles the duality of a man who sometimes really enjoys life (though in a rather limited way) and another that is unshakable in its desire to die. The overwhelming sadness of the film is tracked by good timing of humor, which seems to be more funny because they give a welcome break from the melancholy that you will definitely feel. <br /> <br /> While clear in favor of euthanasia, this film does an excellent job representing the many views of Ramon's friends and family. The most poignant was Ramon's father, when he said, despondent: "There is only one thing worse than losing a child. The child wants to die." <br /> <br /> Excellent writing, acting, directing, cinematography, music - 10/10.
