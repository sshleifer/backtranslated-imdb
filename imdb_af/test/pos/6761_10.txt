This movie is the funniest Danish movie I've ever seen! <br /> <br /> The plot is funny, surprising and exceptional. Danish humor is different from any other, and it gets you every time. The whole audience laughed 90% of the time .... it was incredible. The characters played so well, and the two actors, Mads Mikkelsen and Nikolaj Lie Cheese, play their best ever! <br /> <br /> I would highly recommend seeing this movie, you won't regret it, believe me: -)
