Daffy Duck signs every inch of every available tree and announces that it is rabbit season. But you guessed it - it's actually duck season. Elmer Fudd appears: he is the only hunter who is stupid enough to fall. <br /> <br /> He is even thicker than this. When Bugs Bunny comes to him and asks how the rabbit hunt goes, Elmer admits he hasn't seen a rabbit yet. It's more than Daffy can stand. He comes from his hideout and immediately points to a rabbit: Bugs Bunny. "Shoot him now!" Daffy screams. "You're quiet," says Bugs. "He doesn't have to shoot you now." Daffy insists he does. <br /> <br /> After Daffy returned his blown mouth to his head, he was doomed to more arguments contaminated with "pronouns" problems that all had the same result. Later, Bugs dresses as a sexy woman and flirtingly asks Elmer for a duckling. Will Daffy get the last laugh? "Ha, ha, very funny! Ha, ha, ha!" <br /> <br /> What's funny about this classic cartoon? Bug recoils in fright as Daffy yells in his face. Bugs Bunny says "Yes?" while dripping with self-satisfaction. Daffy Duck is on tiptoes who demand to be shot. Elmer Fudd believes he "can't wait any longer." Daffy sees Bugs in women's clothes and makes that little noise with his tongue. Carl Stalling plays "You must have been a beautiful baby during Bugs' hit. Daffy demands" pure honesty "from Bugs. Stalling plays' Home Sweet Home 'at an inappropriate time. <br /> <br /> In five words: every detail of this movie. <br /> <br /> NOTE: These cards are available on "Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume One," Disk 1
