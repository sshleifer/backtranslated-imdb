I loved it. In fact, I watched it over and over, and I could see it again. This movie is not boring. <br /> <br /> The vampire concept is transformed into this movie. It is a good job, ideal for today's generation. <br /> <br /> Wesley Snipes was born for this role. Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire. Arly Jover, mmmm mmm, she can bite me when she wants and what a sexy accent she has. Donal Logue offers great comic relief. <br /> <br /> This vampire movie is like no other. I can't wait for Blade 2.
