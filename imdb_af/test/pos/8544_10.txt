the 25th hour was a movie I just dropped. I took it late at night. This movie kept my whole fascination with the whole movie. Tony quin is this poor, unsuspecting man who just wanted to fall in love with a woman and through simple jealousy, continue on this incredible journey - fantastic movie, and a hidden treasure.
