Usually movies come from the kingdom of "domestic drama" and for good reason: who wants to deliberately seek entertainment for a story about what they or they should be close to in real life? Divorce hurts an incredible percentage of American families of all classes and conservation camps are ugly and essential parts of it. It's not an escape - the number one reason why the average person turns to movies - it's unfortunate reality. <br /> <br /> Usually divorce or custody is simply part of a larger story and affects the way we understand it or relate to its characters. Kramer vs Kramer focuses on it and asks us to understand why we are doing it and why it is so disturbing. It is a challenge for both this film and its audience: change something so much into something that can catch our attention and let us not regret it, as the mirror is kept in our face. Author / director, Robert Benton, certainly achieved both and impressive in adapting this novel by Avery Corman. <br /> <br /> The story, as expected, is simple: Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) comes home to find his wife. Joanna (Meryl Streep) leaves him and their 7-year-old son, Billy (Justin Henry). Ted must then quickly learn to be an active father in the boys' lives and as soon as he does, Joanna puts on a watch suit. <br /> <br /> Making an Oscar-winning drama about something so generic and especially dialogue-heavy first takes tremendous scene talent. You don't get much better than Hoffman and Streep. Hoffman is primarily in his role: his first Oscar victory after three other notable nominations. He creates a thorough character, the one whose self-centered and fast-paced ways clearly change when he learns to be a better father and the only caregiver. Streep wins her first Oscar in only the second major role of her career as a woman who doesn't get much screen time, but has to communicate both inner torment with her decision to leave as well as an innovative identity identity when she returns to arrest. take. Stripe does so effortlessly. The young boy, Justin Henry, playing at the age of the youngest competitive category nominee in the Academy Awards History, plays the personalization of all 7-year-olds extremely well. <br /> <br /> Benton's writing and direction take these actions to the level where we experience deeper in this family's problems than ourselves and therefore reconsider our thoughts on love and the raising of a family. Benton's previous notable credits ("Bonnie & Clyde" and "Superman") will not indicate a strong command of family drama, but the man can write flat. Several scenes give us strong visuals that show us much more than the typical family scenarios they portray. The first morning that Joanna is gone and Ted makes the Billy French Toast is a classic that shows every talent in this movie in a scene that happens in the Americans' kitchen every morning. <br /> <br /> You will rarely see a story as simple as "Kramer vs Kramer" done better. There are no surprises at the end or turns and turns that will keep us glued to the screen desperately. The film should then rely on its talents and they are all certainly fire, and give a new understanding of a topic so familiar.
