Somewhere in the dark recesses of my brain cells, a song plays in my head. I can't forget it, no matter how hard I try. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS and it's coming for you! Wish I could find a copy of this at a 45rpm record. Five different teams walk out one night in L.A. for a scavenger hunt for clues instead of physical objects. An unapproached game master with two beautiful assistants is the head of all this insanity lacking in LA. All the teams are stereotypes (this film was from 1980, before political correctness resolved everything): the "good guys", the "nerds" led by Eddie Deezen, the dumb beer-loving "jocks", the "unnecessary- A-man-type ladies ", especially the redhead. The giggling twins are also a scream. And finally, the "bad guys" with Stephen Furst as the leader. Furst is hilarious as the overweight slam Harold, whose attempt to use a computer to decipher the various clues, results in a solid mess. Movies like this are no longer made. Nowadays, movies need an "edginess" for them with some dark characters and other nonsense. Return to the days when the "good guys" led by David Naughton were still good and not hopelessly inconsistent. So all serious pretensions collapse and go back to 1980. It's MIDNIGHT MADNESS. . .
