This is a Laurel & Hardy comedy short with some great and funny moments, but generally the movie relies a little on just one comic performance. <br /> <br /> The comical point of departure for this movie is very simple; Stan Laurel doesn't wear pants. Laurel plays a Scottish naive young man arriving in full kilt in America. For some reason he gets the attention of this and his uncle who is played by Oliver Hardy thinks this is because it's his time to put on a pants on Philip. <br /> <br /> The humor is well executed, but the main priority also gets a little tedious after a while. Although the movie still has its comical great moments, it is also far from the best of the many Laurel & Hardy comedy cards that are still around. The movie is simply too easy to see as one of the biggest, although it is most certainly performed well. For the most part. Great good clean fun, just nothing too remarkable or unforgettable. /> <br /> 7/10
