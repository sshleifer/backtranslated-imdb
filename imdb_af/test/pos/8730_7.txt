Much more bright and less stage-bound than the previous efforts of Gene Saks. Barefoot in the park (67) and The Odd Couple (68), Cactus Flower is not a work of art, but compares to most of the tired of the 60's like the apartment, how to kill your wife, goodbye Charlie, " a guide to the married man, divorce, American style, any Wednesday, kiss my stupid, Boys Night Out, it's a masterpiece. Director Saks and Author I.A.L. Diamond has effectively opened Abe Burrows' Broadway hit, and the film has largely benefited from New York City's location and excellent performances by Ingrid Bergman and Goldie Hawn. Bergman is beautiful, looks good and shows a flair for comedy. Hawn in her Oscar-winning role has never been better or more attractive. Matthau is good, but it's hard to believe that Hawn's character would be so surprised by him. And in retrospect, Hawn's attempt at suicide at the start of the film is of character and incredible. Nevertheless, the film has a likely imaginative set-up, and as soon as it goes, it is laughed. Rick Lenz, Jack Weston, Eve Bruce and Vito Scotti provide great support. The movie is fun and fun, and Hawn and Bergman care.
