What else can be said of any Wilder movie other than what they are the most human and real stories about people and what drives them, deceives them, their roosters. Billy made photographs like paintings that forever reflect the human condition. He paints the good and the bad in all of us. He also paints with love. I can't imagine anyone having a list of the best movies without a Wilder movie about it. They will be expensive because they are true. I only saw the movie in the 60's when I was a child and I had to leave the room because I felt tears in me and was embarrassed. Now I'm an old man and I still feel the tears, but don't leave the room. I knew these people and loved them and grew up around them. Billy kept them in this movie and not in a "greatest generation" way, but in a most realistic way that preserved the power of the human spirit.
