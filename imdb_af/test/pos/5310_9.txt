Maybe people like the devil to have more than God. Maybe we like the safety net of a reason; make a mistake just to blame the devil for the pain and suffering in the world. There is so much suffering, wasting in the masses, that it is difficult not to see the sadness on the faces of everything you succeed. Leland P. Fitzgerald understands all this; He knows everything might not be right, and maybe someone helps to leave this earth to avoid the pain their lives are waiting for them. This is a risk he must take for someone he loves. Credit goes to author / director Matthew Ryan Hoge for creating a lyrical prose on two suburban families who have crossed in good times and bad roads. Just watching the movie from almost all A and B list actors show that the material really resonates with his audience. Emotions do not have to be worn to exist. Sometimes everything we want to do is end the suffering. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling brings an understated performance to the table that includes the inwardness of his character Leland's emotions. He is a very passionate and intelligent young man who cut through the BS of life, to know what he sees and to accept the worse with the better. The film is a catholic for the souls of those affected by the terrible event of Leland killing his ex-girlfriend's mentally challenged brother. In the confused mind of this teenager he goes to the incident and knows well what he is going to do. He's going to see the pain he sees everywhere, but most of all stops on Ryan Ryan's face. Almost immediately he realized that he had made a mistake, that God might not be a job he had put on earth to do. Whether this is true, will soon be discussed, as the murder begins a chain of events, which ultimately gives meaning to many people's lives as they wake up to the tangential fragility of life. This boy opened their eyes to both sadness and rebirth. <br /> <br /> With exuberant ballads sung by former Sunny Day Real Estate Foreman Jeremy Enigk, the movie goes through a journey of small vignettes of two families' lives in the wake of the tragedy. The acting is wonderful throughout, with special mention for a few. For someone who plays the naive fly in most movies, Chris Klein does the same stuff here, but also with an evolution in a man with purpose. His isolation is effective when used in the right part, similar to his election success, and I'm interested to see if directors allow him to expand his talents and lower his teeth into something bigger. Jena Malone is also effective in much the same effect, playing the role of upset youth as she has in Donnie Darko and Life as a House; Don Cheadle is a stall black of professionalism that gives us the compassionate therapist differently from what he did in Maniese; and Martin Donovan is brilliant as the sadness that tries to keep his wit together and ultimately realizes that he must also separate his family. Also, it's great to see the beautiful Sherilyn Fenn in a small but important role. <br /> <br /> When the tragedy hits, people are joined together to get it all. As Leland suddenly points to one point, you see men and women helping and hugging others when they see the pain and suffering around them, but after a few days everything goes back to normal. Cheadle's character extrapolates the optimistic stance that we at least get a look at people's true nature to help each other and be good, just to get back with the retort, "well, at least we do during the tragedy." Perhaps we do not think we are benevolent, because it makes us feel that we should always be good, and that when it is bad, in turn, should be so. By being wrong, we leave ourselves and try again. Leland's mistake made him see the love he had for those close to him as well as opening the eyes of others to wake up and not let their loved ones drift away. One cannot focus on the grief of others when they first have to deal with their own. High produced a parable for this and a truly effective film making with hopefully much more to come.
