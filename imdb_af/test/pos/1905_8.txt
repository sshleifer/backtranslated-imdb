Certainly, this movie is not for everyone --- but for anyone with a sense of humor and love for the movie period √ê buy it right away! Where else can you get 70's fashion, a vocabulary primer, karate-trained hookers, crime, a rap over the Titanic's sinking, shooting outs and a co-star named Queen Bee (look at her moving scene early on In the ward's office!) With a filming style that is a cross between a porn movie / Dawn of The Dead / and Car Wash, you can't go wrong. It's one to look over and over. After you put the kids in bed.
