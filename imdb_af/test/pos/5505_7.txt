A sick man, Carleton Hendricks (Dee Snider), crosses the Teen Chat lines as Captain Howdy. He stands as a teenage boy and invites other teenagers over his house to party. He knocks them instead, strips them, sticks their mouths and tortures them (mostly with needles). He catches the daughter of policeman Mike Gage (Kevin Gage). He finds him, arrests him and he is institutionalized. Four years later he was released ... completely healed. But a lynchmop (led, amusingly by Robert Englund) attacked him and hung him. He does not die, but he snaps and Captain Howdy is back ... <br /> <br /> A very sick, disturbing, twisted horror movie. Captain Howdy enjoys pain and torture and tries to show the kids he kidnapped how to enjoy it too. The torture scenes are not explicit (you hear more than you see), but what you see is very sick. There is no humor and the (muted) scream of his victims sounds like working. I turned off most of the TV screens. <br /> <br /> The acting varies. Kevin Gage is not as good as the policeman - he is not terrible, but he could have been better. Dee Snider is very scary as Captain Howdy - his attacks are not good. <br /> <br /> All in all, not your typical horror movie. I will probably never see it again (this film really gets under your skin), but I recommend it to all horror fans - at least those with strong stomach ache. I give it a 7.
