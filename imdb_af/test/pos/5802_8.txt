I must admit that I saw Madonna on Top of the Pops for the first time, I told my wife years ago: another American hit wondering to make the whole thing wrong! "Well, she's worried and was terribly dressed. I have never grown to love her like my daughter, but I have to eat my words. I love her stuff and sometimes enjoy her filmed concerts. This Confession movie is great, even if the music is (and it is not). I was impressed with the essay and concepts. Madonna's own performance was enhanced by the incredible dancers she chose to support. My daughter was at London performances and loved it. The lady (Madge) proved my first assessment of her so much wrong !!
