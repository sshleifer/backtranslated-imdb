In France, Xavier (Romain Duris) is a young economist of twenty and a few years and tries to find a job in a state department by a friend of his father. He is advised to have a specialization in the Spanish economy and language to get a good position. He decides to apply for a European exchange program called "Erasmus" and move to Barcelona to improve his knowledge of Spanish culture and language. She leaves his girlfriend Martine (Audry Tautou), promising to have close contact with her. Once in Barcelona, ​​he is temporarily taken by a French doctor Jean-Michel (Xavier de Guillebon) and his young and lonely wife, Anne-Sophie Judith Godrèche, whom he met at the airport. Later he moves to an apartment with international students: English Wendy (Kelly Reilly), Spanish Soledad (Cristina Brondo), Italian Alessandro (Federico D'anna), Danish Lars (Christian Pagh) and German Tobias Metschurat). Then the Belgian Isabelle (Cecile de France) and Wendy's brother William (Kevin Bishop) joined the group. Xavier learns Spanish language and finds friendship and love in his experience abroad. "L 'Auberge Espagnole" is one of those movies that makes the viewer sad when it ends. The story is a wonderful and funny story of friendship and love, in a globalized world and a united Europe. This very charming film made me feel good and happy, although I have never experienced a student republic. The newcomer William evokes the funniest situations next to the story, with his big mouth and short brain. Furthermore, it is wonderful to see a fresh approach of students that is different from those stupid American brothers and their stereotypes, commonly found in American films. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Albergue Espanhol" (Spanish Auberge ")
