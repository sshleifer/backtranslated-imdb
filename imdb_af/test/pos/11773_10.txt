This is my favorite movie of all time. It's the best spoof of a science fiction movie ever; the fact that it was a record of Star Wars just made it better. <br /> <br /> I love slapstick. Think of it as the Marx brothers or the Three Stooges Star Wars meet. The writing is hilarious. The effects are a hoot. The free association that goes on guarantees all kinds of things coming from the left field. (I almost watered my pants when the Wookie Monster attacked the Princess.) <br /> <br /> Space balls were a much longer movie, but only had 15 minutes of good material in it, and I felt ripped off then, like buying a citizen who is apparently mostly filler. Hardware wars, though only about 15 minutes long, will be worth paying a price tag, IMO.
