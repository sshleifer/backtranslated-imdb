After reading all the comments on this movie, I'm still amazed at Fox's reluctance to release a full-screen recovery version in DVD. Yes, history can be a bit inaccurate and it is certainly not as powerful as the book, but it was the 2nd film by Fox made in Real Cinemascope and the production values ​​alone earned a recovery and distribution. I saw this film in the second grade and it caused my lifelong interest in everything in Egypt, which was busy in Egypt 4 years ago! Amazing the power of the movie on a child's imagination, eh? At high school I read the book and made a promise to one day to take that dream outing. Now this film is made in the "old school" style, which means that Egyptians are portrayed by pink-cut and blue-eyed British. But has anyone seen the current HBO series "ROME"? Everything old is again Olde. One can't imagine why we are still busy with actors who think of Mayfair aristocrats in Roman tractors today. Not one actor on Rome could succeed for an ancient Italian. It is said that the AMARNA era in Egypt is still one of the most fascinating events in human history. This movie is very attractive (to borrow a word from NEFER) for its historical information (BEER! BREINSURGERY! IRON!) And its beautiful cinematography and score. I have a terrible Taiwan DVD version that I watch over and over, and one day I pray that a true recovery widescreen version will be available. For anyone interested in this subject, I recommend the historical novel "A God Against The Gods" to the author of Advise and Consent. If anyone of your movie buffs out there knows how to contact Fox to encourage them, please let me know!
