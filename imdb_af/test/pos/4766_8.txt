One of my favorites. As a child, who grew up in the NY Metro area in the late 60's and early 70's, I often had the opportunity to visit NYC with my grandfather or dad while doing business there. The eager, vibrant, human, reality of the city, especially in winter, stayed with me. <br /> <br /> This film adapts to the strong, cold, real facts of the NYC's winter season, while exposing the bottom of the region's infamous underworld of crime and police. A good snapshot of a place and time and culture. <br /> <br /> And the car hunt is simply incredible. At least equivalent to the one in "Bullitt", and surpassed the chase in "The French Connection". I can watch again and again, as the suspension on the Plymouth Fury police cruiser emerging towards the GW bridge stumbles and bumps into the sharp right-hand curve. The stunt coordinator for this scene has "Bullitt" and "The French Connection", as well as many other nonatable movie chases. Good acting, too, and a decent plot line. The musical score is edgy and compelling, and the cinematography and direction are on top of that. A wonderful, drama drama as a subordinate 1970. An officer. Not yet on DVD. <br /> <br /> Compatible with style and content: The French Connection and Super Fly. The early 1970s cop dramas occurred in the dark NYC winter months.
