It must be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The idea of ​​a typical family leaving everything behind to stay in the desert. When mother and father both lose work, not to mention, they have green mucus in their bath. They decide it's best to move to Oregon in their families. Once there everything goes wrong. An interesting role-players compliment this movie. Including a young Molly Ringwald, this is a movie I will definitely recommend.
