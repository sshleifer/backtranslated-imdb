I really enjoyed this movie and I'm not a classic music fan. The story of the difficult street child who discovered classical music and changed his ways was great to watch without being sentimental or unbelievable, although some of my details scratched my head (Frankie and his dog could be in the basement of the school without any of the students or teachers found him? Where did he eat? Bat? Did he ever get a change of clothes? What did his dog feed? The owner of the school did not think it was important to inform the police of a missing boy, but leave him indefinitely in the basement? :-)). But we can slip such unrealistic details and just enjoy the touch, fun, and slightly tense (for me, anyway) story and wonderfully talented kids. <br /> <br /> I loved the scene with the mothers standing shoulder to shoulder. On the stairs that the policemen excluded from entering school: I doubt they will get away today. And I like the nice touch of the boy Frankie who stole to turn the tables on him (though it never really went), and finally Frankie's friends helped him. <br /> <br /> All in all, a great movie for everyone!
