Not everyone, but most of this story is that Buster is wrong for Dead Shot Dan, a notorious criminal. <br /> <br /> There is really no story, just a series of adventures to portray Buster's physical talents, which is great and his comic timing. The 27-minute movie is actually an adventure to the other that mostly involves someone with our hero. <br /> <br /> Earlier there were a few policemen on their beats played through the streets after Keaton and later it was "Big Joe" Roberts, a round cop - and dad a girl Buster is interested in who is pursuing him. The last scenes were the best I thought, with many smart gags that include the hotel elevator where Big Joe and his daughter live. It was Keaton at its best. <br /> <br /> It's just a crazy half hour that makes little sense but cares? It's best at Buster at his slapstick, or near it, and that's why it serves its purpose: to entertain us. Just think: 85 years after this movie is made, there are people (like me) still discovering and enjoying these quiet comedy clubs! Cool!
