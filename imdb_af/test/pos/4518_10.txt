The Kite Runner must win an Oscar! It's perfect in every way, the story, the script, the play, the cinematography ... One would never guess that it was filmed in China. The story of two childhoods and those in their adult lives will leave a lasting impression. The portrayal of life in Afghanistan under the Taliban is too bad and terrible. I didn't read the book, but I saw comments that put the movie down because "the book is always better". It does not matter. Nobody put down "Gone With the Wind" because it wasn't the book! In fact, it won the Oscar for the best photo and several other Oscars. I think this movie is brilliant - BRAVO to the author and director, and the actors!
