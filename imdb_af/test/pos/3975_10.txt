The best thing about the American Pie "bakery." I have found the humor and plot to be far more gripping than any of the American Pie films to date. Also about the relevance of the content I found that it is acceptable for a much larger audience than any of the previous American Pie movies. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie experience. When the movie came out for the first time, I read a number of negative reviews and eventually didn't see it while it was still in the theater. I'm sorry now. The movie far exceeded my expectations in terms of plot, dialogue / essay and overall quality. I give it two thumbs up!
