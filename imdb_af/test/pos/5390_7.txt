Gary Cooper is a cool headed man. Always keep its easy characters. As some others have commented, there are some peculiarities in the writing, such as an American Marshall who got his job and couldn't even hit a gun with a gun. A farmer with about thirty hands, but doesn't seem to run away. <br /> <br /> But there's lots of quick thinking, Cooper shoots straight to entertain you. <br /> This movie was made in 1950. People in their 20s and 30s have difficulty understanding those movies made for entertainment, not Oscars. <br /> <br /> To expect Oscar material, this film makes injustice. It's about the good guys who find a way to get the bad guys up. <br /> <br /> So rent, borrow or buy this movie, blow a maize and enjoy the Coop once more.
