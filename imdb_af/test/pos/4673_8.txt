I find it sad that just because Edward Norton doesn't want to be in the movie or have anything to do with it, people automatically think that the movie sucks without even watching or giving it a chance. I really hope Norton didn't. He is a good actor and everyone, but he frightened people of a decent movie. <br /> <br /> I found it entertaining. It didn't mind blowing or something with crazy special effects, but it wasn't bad. It was nice to watch. But yes, definitely not a bad / terrible movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
