Instead of watching the reclaimed history of Pearl Harbor, with nothing new to reveal, except for some real-life events that a few individuals are thrown into, the film's makers may say they have contributed to the spread of history, along with nothing but CGI explosions fill out for a juicy romantic triangle. One must see the Dark Blue World. <br /> <br /> This film takes place during the historic period of World War II. The Czech pilots left their homeland and went to fight for the RAF, instead of lying and giving their arms to the Nazis. It was part of the history that had to be told at least once in the world. A love triangle appears among the main characters, but one of them does not die comfortably as in Pearl Harbor, but by a sacrifice for true friendship. The movie is tragedy after tragedy, not even a bittersweet end, with our hero not enjoying the glory of taking his country back, the return of love through his current lover, the return of love through his reunited lover, or even the return of unconditional love throughout his life pet. He is completely sad and does not feel worse in the Russian labor camp. This kind of end is something that Hollywood would probably change if it were their writing. <br /> <br /> The movie sometimes plays on the sentimental, but it also shows the humanity of people. Overall, a worthwhile movie.
