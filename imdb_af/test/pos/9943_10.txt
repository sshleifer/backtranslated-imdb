Although many mixed feelings about this last day, a giant Argento thriller, it is still another exuberant will for the Argento movie painting. <br /> <br /> A young opera singer has her first exhaustion and suddenly finds himself the subject of obsession for a mad maniac. <br /> <br /> In a way, Opera is like a contemporary ally on the Phantom of the Opera, blended with all the glorious style and color one expects from Dario Argento to deliver. Argento makes tremendous use of inventive camera techniques, repetitive symbols (such as those ravens!), Gothic atmosphere, and truly horrific murder sequences. A special scene (which includes a grab hole and a gun) will knock viewers right out of their seats! Storywise also succeeds in grabbing the film with a few strong tensions and the atmosphere of Claudio Simonetti's beautiful music party gives a good atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The film performs some satisfactory performances. Cristina Marsillach is good as our leading lady. The late Ian Charleson does a good job as the director, as well as Urbano Barberini as an investigator, Daria Nicolodi as agent of Marsillach, and William McNamara as Marsillach's unloved lover. <br /> <br /> Opera is fantastic last night Argento, and perhaps the last of its great works. It's sure to please his fans and even create new ones. <br /> <br /> **** from ****
