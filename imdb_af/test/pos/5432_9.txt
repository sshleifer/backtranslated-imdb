This movie reminds me of movies that awaken me temporarily with the realization that the emperor is indeed naked. Our election process is unashamed and bleak. My awareness is increased and I want to see the world change. After a short while, I fall back to my little self-confidence and 'bubble life'. In the best role of the film, this work will go to me in an edible stove and in the "Network" I will be found guilty of saying: I AM SO MAD AS HELL AND I WON'T AGAIN THIS! But for whom? My powerful youthful idealism has been slowly reduced to the concerned parent with silent beliefs or rather "beliefs." "Man of the Year" reveals how much I long for honesty and sometimes humorously takes on our current political situation. Dobbs's line "I breathed in because I thought:" What the hell is light, it's in my hand, I'll breathe it. "" Refreshing or would have been when Clinton was president. Why can't politicians be honest and set the tone for debate? Our people need to realize how much veneer is being brought out? I'm already sick of this election process, somebody else? Drop the veils and set an agenda for our elected officials and take them to the task (not re-elected) as they proceed with evasion and non-representation of citizenship. This movie can inspire us to increase our expectations of politicians who spit rhetoric. Great movie!
