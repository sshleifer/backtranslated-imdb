I swore I would never allow myself to deviate in the bad sixties which told me things were better in the "good old days"? the current Australian prime minister is a bad example of such a mindset. <br /> <br /> But I switched to "a decade under the influence" because I found how the multipurpose "Sneakers" documentary on the other channel had such a relaxation experience. I found the values ​​of the "Sneakers" interviews too ugly to accept reasonably. So materialistic! So without any sense of indignation in a society that can challenge to kill someone to steal his very ugly shoes! So lacking in a valuable purpose that they can report without deviation by exploiting an audience by injuring them to keep the shoes above their heads to conclude a sponsorship agreement for themselves with a company of butterflies. much to keep looking. <Br /> <br /> a decade under the influence depicted a completely different response to the fruit of stupidity, corruption and concupiscence in high (and low) places. <br /> <br /> I noticed the change in film - this was accompanied by the exposure of America's disastrous foreign policy debacle in Vietnam and so many less reported sites in my www.peterhenderson.com.au website . "A decade under the influence" documents the exact moment that change took place. <br /> <br /> Before the 1970s, armed forces in American films were portrayed as an invincible fighting force consisting of decent people in authority over the victory of heroes on the battlefield. After the seventies, they are generally portrayed as a polluted mess that is being deceived by a bunch of bureaucrats in the Pentagon Before the 1970s, the FBI agent and the honest cop suggested a friend and protector. After the seventies, the FBI agents were all incapacitated and the best that a cop could pursue was to ignore their folly and its superiors' corruption and maintain justice in its own idiosyncratic manner. <br /> <br /> Before the 1970s, archetype American "little guy", the "average Joe", the Jimmy Stewart type will experience the problems and gain insight into the underlying wisdom of his elected leaders and justice of the "American Road". After the 1970s, Kevin Costner is playing the role, but now he is the voice of one crying in the desert, because evil is exposed, or he accepts his fate and makes the best he can. <br /> <br /> And now the "old-time" mindset of honesty and justice is deprived of and depicted with some justification as a holy evil and self-control hypocrisy. <br /> <br /> "a decade under the influence" tells it as if it was. "A decade under the influence" says it now. It illustrates the redemption of the American film industry from the hands of the artistic, moral and intellectual bankrupt studio. It shows the storm of the Hollywood Bastille by independent filmmakers who have promised to get a sobering and tired audience in the theater. The fact that their failures were numerous, and sometimes disastrous, merely highlights the greatness of their performance. A performance reflected in the adventurous and questionable attitudes of the big boxing stars such as Clooney, Daman, Affleck, etc. And the directors and producers who provide the vehicles for their talent.
