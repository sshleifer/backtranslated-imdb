spoiler - <br /> <br /> In 1993, African American director / actor Mario Van Peebles followed the incredibly popular urban action movie "New Jack City" with "Posse". The film was co-written and directed by Van Peebles, who also dies the main character, Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Plot: The movie started at the turn of the 20th century, when the United States was broken. in the Spanish-American War. Apparently, a time when the US legal system can send its convictions into military service, Jessie Lee finds himself a reluctant second man serving in a black black cavalry gang in Cuba. Some of his compatriots include Little J (Stephen Baldwin), Quick Talk Weezie (Charles Lane) and the tower-but-simple Obobo (Tiny Lister). They find a hidden coffin of gold on a reconnaissance trail and decide to keep it. However, the ambitious colonel Graham (Zane) finds out about the gold and is apparently prepared to kill Jessie Lee and the company for it. A shooting between Graham's forces and Jessie Lee's blind the colonel in one eye, and his forces are retreating. Jessie Lee's ragtag team markets themselves (and the gold) back to New Orleans, but it seems that Graham is not far behind. Jessie Lee and his allies are forced to go west, to a town called Freemanville. Apparently, Freemanville was founded by blacks in the years following the Civil War. Jessie Lee's father, "King David", was the charismatic preacher who co-founded the town. But, as shown by intermittent flashbacks, King David was soon brutally murdered by a white crowd, in parallel with the Ku Klux Klan terrorist campaigns that began about the same time. Jessie Lee and his company eventually find their way to Freemanville, just to find out that the townspeople are not exactly seeing him, especially when Sheriff Bates (Richard Jordan) of a nearby white town makes it clear to Jessie Lee and his partners ?? dead or alive. Carver (Blair Underwood) is the sheriff and de facto mayor of Freemanville ?? and his own agenda may not be square with Jessie Lee. <br /> <br /> Analysis The action series are all very credible, and Mario Van Peebles turns in a good performance as the brilliant hero. In the wake of New Jack City's success, it was almost expected that Van Peebles would be prosecuting, or at least a similar prosecution of urban action. Instead, Van Peebles watched for 100 years in the past and created a mostly black western (effective 'black-themed' update of the Western theme of the 1970s) and the legacy of largely forgotten black-themed cowboy films of the early 20th century. . Unlike New Jack City, the film was independently funded, and was originally released by Gramercy / Polygram Entertainment. It is alleged that the big studios came out when Van Peebles placed 'Posse' for them. Some of the more "inquisitive" castings were involved with rappers Big Daddy Kane and Tone Loc at that time as Father Time and Angel respectively. In some interviews, Mario Van Peebles said he was often of similar interest. In the years since, the tendency of decisive rappers in non-musical films would be almost commonplace. Watchers will see several comedies by various entertainment staff: Black action film veterans such as Isaac Hayes ("Truck Turner"), Pam Grier ("Foxy Brown") and Larry Cook ("The Spook Who Sat by the Door") appear, like the Uprising legend Nipsey Russell, not to mention TV producer Stephen J. Cannell (who rented the Van Peebles junior annually in the Sonny Spoon star). The film is played by Woody Strode ("Spartacus") in a key role.
