When I watched this movie in my adolescence, I tried to make the soundtrack. Some of the soundtrack I didn't know yet. However, during the film I noticed her quality. U2, Blondie, Police. , Quincy Jones, Commodores. Sensational soundtrack. <br /> <br /> In Brazil there has not been a movie in TV long ago. Today he passed in cable TV and I remember getting access to the site to comment. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie surprised me a lot, but that's what happens in real life. Not always, who thought to be the ideal, that's what happens. <br /> <br /> Life brings us many surprises.
