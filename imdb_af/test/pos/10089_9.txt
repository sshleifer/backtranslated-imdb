Disgused as an Asian Horror, a story of two sisters' is actually a complex character-driven psychological drama that captivates the viewer in the problems of a seemingly normal family. I was really surprised at the depth of this movie. Director Ji-living Kim's decision to focus more on telling a story rather than being cheap scarce has a real one. Creating one of the most curious new horror movies. <br /> <br /> "Two Sisters' languages ​​count the story, as it suggests the names of two sisters, Su-mi and the younger Su-yeon, who eventually spent in a spiritual setting back to their father and apparently abusive stepmother. From then on, we see how the sisters handle their stepmother's gradual aggression and volatile behavior. To say what would happen next would be to spoil the whole experience. So I'll just leave it over. <br /> <br /> The plot is written very tightly. With the characters fleshed beautifully. Ji-living Kim's focus on a small role-play offers a much more detailed view of them and their relationships with each other. Furthermore, each of the four main throws has a very different role and type of character. Of the Su-mi, the weaker Su-yeon, the visibly uninteresting father of the stepmother's furious and later deadly behavior. There is a great sense of mystery, with lots of plot not being created and even after that the movie leaves a good room for departure. Even after watching it, the viewer will have to see it at least once so he understands it better. <br /> <br /> The actors fit their roles perfectly. It is especially difficult to create strong, emotional scenes in psychological movies, but it is a great joy when you succeed in creating it, and this is an excellent example of such an achievement. Ji-living Kim's direction is slow and gripping, building up tension for the movie's horror screens. While few in number, these moments are strong and fairly primitive. The cinematography and the score are also better at creating an atmosphere that fits a psychological movie. <br /> <br /> A Two Sisters' language is a demonstration of how the horror genre is indeed as much as a simple thrill ride. With its strong focus on character and mystery, it's a complex movie that can easily seduce you to watch it again and again, just so you can understand it better.
