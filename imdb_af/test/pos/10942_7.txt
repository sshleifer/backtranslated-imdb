Fun mix of vampires and martial arts is a bit of a mess and the acting of those who called the voices is almost universally bad, but the point of departure is tempting. The battle scenes are fast and flashy and the movie is often amusing. It's a pity the story is such a wreck. There were a few places I didn't know what had just happened, it was almost as if five minutes had just been cut out and you were suddenly on the next scene without knowing how you got there. The movie is poor to explain things and some things don't make much sense, but the movie is moving bitterly, so it's hardly registering mistakes. Not a good movie, but definitely a fun one.
