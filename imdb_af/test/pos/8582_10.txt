A fine movie I've been watching several times since purchasing the video just four days ago. Yes, I'm a Colin Firth Fan and Colin was his usual talented, natural beautiful self. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matthew Field) and Fissy (Sammy, Nimi's 7-year-old son) was very special and so natural to look. They were hilariously funny together and also touched my heart strings. The screens I loved most were Sammy and Matt, who sat on the wall and chatted and Matt fell off the wall in a hilarious way. I won't reveal the content of their discussion to spoil the plot. Also hilarious was Sammy who sought Matt for sex. Colin and Fissy were perfect in this scene and could make an awkward topic between adults and children. Colin's words and face at the end of that scene were so nice and said it all! not brilliant. Of course credit must also go to Fissy Roberts for his beautiful portrayal of Sammy. He played such a lovely and turbulent child character. The two actors were just perfect together. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Colin (Matt) and Nia (Nimi) was perfectly balanced and I couldn't agree that the chemistry between them was wonderful to watch, love to show, stress and of course passion. It was exciting to see how their delicate flowering romance unfolded gradually, as well as how their cultural and social divisions influenced their relationship and were good at seeing Colin and Nia sensitively depicting Matt and Nimi to discover and overcome these differences . It held me on the TV and guessed it to the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Colin's depiction of Matt's vulnerable and youthful side is also perfectly portrayed, so much so that I found it difficult to see when Matt was so mean and childish to Sammy because he (Matt) felt said that Sammy was in the way of his romance / relationship with Sam's mother Nimi. One could not feel very disappointed, angry and frustrated with Matt to treat Sammy this way and in turn threatened to spoil Matt's special relationship with Sammy and Nimi. Colin's special talent to get into a character's head and show the different sides of a character to the audience was very much in evidence and pure magic to watch. I must also mention that Colin also has such a good report with young actors (see also 'My life so far a wonderful movie not to be missed). <br /> <br /> Also, the relationship between Matthew and his wife, Jenny, was excellent in showing the dark side and tension in their marriage to the audience and they did not seem to be "happy marriages" what they look outside. <br /> <br /> I must not forget to mention the minister I thought was very funny, serious! Nimi's Mother and Family were also hilarious as well as the importance of Nimi's culture and her situation. <br /> <br /> The downside, I really can't find a disadvantage, but being objective about the movie and giving me credibility to my review. The only negative comment I would make is that the writers did not explain enough details why Matt fell into the car. There was just a vague suggestion from Nimi that something was wrong with his heart. However, it did not detract from my enjoyment of the film, far from it. I just had to rewind the tape a little for a 2nd task. <br /> <br /> I felt this movie had everything, entertaining, uplifting and I loved the rich colors and sunny scenery. The movie warmed up a cold winter day and made me smile :-)) All the essential elements were there, laughter, love, excitement, sadness, anger, drama and a warm feeling good factor, with, yes, much of that delicious Colin Firth moments, including a much soaked Colin in a 'Wet Shirt scene', not missed by any fan, the more a girl can have ;-)) <br /> <br /> highly recommended, especially for any Colin Firth fans ;-)
