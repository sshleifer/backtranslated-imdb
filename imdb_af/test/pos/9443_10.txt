Even an old cynical doctor who blows like me can be left breathless by watching an episode of my favorite show. This has happened before at Eccleston's finals and it has happened to watch this episode. This doesn't happen often, but The Impossible Planet is an example of both the show and television on its very best. It's a beautiful television. <br /> <br /> The doctor and his companion land in a mysterious place where they see strange writing on the wall and the audience (many of whom are moving behind the bench) are immediately transferred. A door opens and terrible monsters start the time travelers bump. It might have recorded an entire 25 minute episode in the original show, but all this takes place in its pre-title sequence. You may miss out on the longer stretched format of the original show, but at least this new series is stiff and if we are treated to a disappointing story, it's usually only for one week. <br /> <br /> There is nothing to disappoint a viewer here. It is doctor who is at his most traditional best. Author Matt Jones and director James Strong went out of their way to make a story to be considered for years. They do this by building a doomed laden story. The doctor and rose are losing the Tardis and they are stuck with the lead players in the distant future. It is interesting how many stories never contain this kind of plot point, where the doctor and his companions no longer have access to the Tardis, which allows for a more intriguing type of story. Without a doubt, the highlight is the scene where Scooti Toby is looking for, just to find him on the surface of the planet where he turns her outside. Everything about acting, makeup and Murray Gold's music makes it a scene that really shocks its audience. <br /> <br /> I can immediately imagine this episode, the BBC switchboards received a tsunami of complaints for distressed parents who said their children had been traumatized. That it took them a few hours to get them off the family bench and they didn't want to sleep with the lights. To do this, it would be to renounce the magic of the doctor. Yes, it can fear and yes, such images will burn themselves in the minds of a child, something they will never forget, even if he lives a hundred. But I'll bet my life that these same "traumatized" children would have prayed this week to beg them not to see the next episode
