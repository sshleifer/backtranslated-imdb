This is one of the best movies I've seen for years. I took myself to a new time and place. It was as if I was right with Ray through his many trials and triumphs. Jamie Foxx changed himself in Ray. During the movie he was Ray. Also, Kerry Washington, Sharon Robinson and Regina King were excellent. The movie was well thrown and directed, the music was fantastic. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie four (4) times with different people and the last time was just as enjoyable as the first time. I will buy the DVD as soon as it is released. This is a movie that is watched over and over for the coming year. <br /> <br /> Thanks for a great experience.
