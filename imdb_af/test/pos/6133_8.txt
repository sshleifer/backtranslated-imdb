I stumbled across this movie by chance. I was back a few years ago and this movie was on some channel on the cable at the hotel late one night. Not much else and I watched it for about 20 to 30 minutes until I decided to go to bed. Needless to say, I got up and looked at the full movie. The plot was very interesting and makes you wonder if there was no SS who did or at least thought to do it. I've been watching this movie. I even sent and e-mailed to the production company, but it wasn't sure it would ever happen on DVD, but said there was always hope. If someone finds this movie, leave a note here where you found it, because I would like a copy of the day.
