Blue ribbon banners, stars and stripes forever, decorating generals and unconditional surrender of the enemies that needed tons and tons of radiation, that was the summons of the United States victory in World War II !! The celebration on Times Square as well as across the United States suggests a national idea! America is top right !! one thing, a malicious and painfully perverse thing. The adjustment period! .. The real celebration ended when the bottle of champagne was finished. Now everyone has to continue with their lives ... just one problem. . They need to get new lives. The old lives are gone forever. Polite and pleasant smiles had a fragile facade with a long life of ice cubes in boiling water! All of the characters in the film are paradoxically paradoxical, and cannot make a case of how badly anything was wrong, for the simple reason it wasn't true !!! When Sergeant and Generals and their wives and daughters and boys and almost all the other Americans who were touched by World War II were exposed to disabilities, nightmares and World War II accusations, and what it really did and denied, nobody was the same !! For now, social and moral issues have had an important interest ... Frederick March and Myrna Loy had to start again !! Dana Andrews realized he should never be married to Virginia Mayo in the first place !!! Theresa Wright has become painfully aware of the fact that she is constructive selfish! Loose, but not least, the character, Homer, is about to marry and he thinks that everyone around him is so devastated by his injury as he is, basically in the sense that they can't or don't want to deal with. <br /> <br /> The reason why this movie is so fabulous is because a happy ending has been reached in the difficult way, once everyone has recognized the new beginnings of the new United States and generally acknowledges the new world , the Second World War tragedy was acknowledged and things that were torn apart were violated and dealt with! Frederick March and Myrna Loy have to go back to chapter one in their marriage. Homer addressed his new bride about what it took to be married to him (ie half the time, she would feel like a nurse) and Thresa Wright's involvement with Dana Andrews meant that her access to maturity was partial responsibility for the lifting of a marriage ... It is similar to how to drive a car to get your driver's license at the Indianapolis 500. The characters in the movie are the typical post WWII Americans by being amazed by the rude awakening of coercion changes in their lives ... Happiness is no longer awarded the luxury of the adjective cop aesthetic ... it's now about formidable conditions and good win over evil because of the less ugly choice !! ... World War II didn't just happen !! It will now dominate the social patterns of American life! <br /> <br /> The total catastrophe of World War II did not adequately reflect most Americans' feelings of personal humanity. I loved this movie and so AFI, probably for the reason that it has caused problems that were wrongfully taboo! Bottom line, see this movie !! Nightmares about battles, dilemmas about marital unhappiness and / or adaptation, dealing with your life when affected by disability and just basically acting people are being introduced to movies and television today. this is 1946 !! New to Americans then .... REMEMBER !! Director William Wyler illustrated how Americans feel about the aftermath of World War II in the days when the film industry tied him with one hand behind his back !!! Take this into account and you'll probably realize how sensational this movie really was !!
