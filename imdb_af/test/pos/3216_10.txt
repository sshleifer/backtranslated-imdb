honest .. this show warms my heart, one day I look at the jackal family and now that the new season has started, I'm even more addicted than before. The characters are so well developed and their relationships are so real. would recommend this show to any woman or mother and daughter. The Loreleis are a quick, fast, feminine girl who will inspire you and the show is sometimes hysterical and never too serious, but serious enough to make it completely addictive. It's an hour that is a big PLUS because you can never get enough Gilmore! even in one hour. Emily and Richard Gilmore are KICKS (Loryie's parents, Rory's grandparents). They are your average rich parents. Emily president of the DAR and Richard a well-known lawyer and Yale alumni st. Rory follows in the footsteps of her grandparents and it can't make them happier. Of course Rory's mother is so proud of her, but her whole life has worked to eventually defend her parents and Rory who goes to Yale didn't help her on that trip, but believe me, every episode she's approaching;)
