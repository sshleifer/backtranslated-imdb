It was a brave movie to hit Indian theaters when it was released. The first film to openly portray lesbian trends among Indian women. The leading actress of Indian theater Shabana Azmi added dust to the film with her warm, passionate scenes with Nandita Das. <br /> <br /> The movie fueled sexuality and the director used the best sex. The sex was not for erotic purposes but was in the context of the movie. The scene where Nandita Das lost her virginity to her husband was definitely the first of its kind in Indian theaters. <br /> <br /> Good acting by all the actors, especially Nandita Das, amid criticism from the Indian public
