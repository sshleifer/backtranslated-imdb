Well where to start? I stumbled upon this one in 1993 and just hit "record" on the VCR out of habit, more than anything else. "Citizen Kane" this is for sure ... but if you had a bad day and were in the mood for scratching something that is not too intellectually stimulating, then I suggest it might just be you " thing "is. . <br /> <br /> We've got the lot here - big title track, more stereotypes than you can shake a stick on, unconscious comedy, the fitting battlefield of all time and more, more, more! David Hemmings plays the diametrically opposite of his role in the 60-year-old classic "Blow Up" - still a hormone-stimulated photographer, but not quite the same. <br /> <br /> John Philip Law is easy to grind as an actor who makes a log, appears onwood, but it won't be fair as he had about 5 minutes notice before he took on the role no. <br /> <br /> Wexler as "Amanda"? Just enough to say it was her only role in the movie! The real star of this movie is Ethel Evans who plays a game, our secretary (?) Says, with the moral of a cat and an ambition to fit. The way she manages to reconcile her current life with that of a future with her comedian spouse is actually touching an earthly, eager way. <br /> <br /> I'm really fond of this movie when I'm in the mood ....... and won't touch the proverbial bar police when I'm not. <br /> <br /> Kudos plays the role play for maintaining a (relatively) straight face during filming. <br /> <br /> A "classic" in the Edward D Wood school of cinematic efforts!
