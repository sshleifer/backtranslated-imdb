Three kinds of couples, all SIX OF A CHILD, are entangled in a crazy search for a stolen bank lock. <br /> <br /> It's a lively, hilarious comedy featuring the six stars - Charlie Ruggles & Mary Boland, WC Fields & Alison Skipworth, George Burns & Gracie Allen - all warmly doing what they do best has: to laugh. <br /> <br /> Ruggles & Boland is one of their film acts as husband and wife - this time, rather amorous than usual. They were a perfect team - she's the lioness, he's the nerve-rabbit - and they dominate most of the screen time here. From start to finish, they are a pleasure. Burns & Allen continues with the patter they created in Vaudeville perfectly on the radio and will eventually go to television, with George the eternal straight man and Gracie the eternal fool. Sometimes in the film she tends to go over the top, but it's hard to miss her. Her heart is apparently made of solid gold. <br /> <br /> While Skipworth is briefly written, only fragments of her formidable personality flash. Fields is in his element as the indifferent sheriff of Nuggetville, Nevada. Whether he explains how he got the nickname, honestly John, or at night looking for the missing moola, is never less than wonderful. Best of all, he gets his whole classic pool routine, to keep it forever for a grateful offspring. Finally, he performs the near miracle. He gets Gracie to quit. <br /> <br /> Paramount was so pleased with the success of SIX OF A KIND that they wanted to hurry the main players in another comedy. Only fields destroyed. He felt he had arrived at the point where he no longer needed to share a movie with other celebrity comics. The studio finally agreed and started preparing Fields' first solo main feature, you tell me (1934).
