Like an earlier commentator, I saw it in 1980 and I could never find the memory of the gripping story, wonderful acting and dramatic music games. It definitely contains some of Sam Waterston's best work. He and the authors do not merely propose Oppenheimer as an unfair victim of the hero, but also naively, love alcohol and snobbish, a rounded portrait rather than a stereotype.
