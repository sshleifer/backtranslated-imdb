It's time for the show to start! Showtime is simply a clash with Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiro's careers. It's an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure, but not quite the actors' standards, especially not Robert's. Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles of guys like William Shatner and Mos Def. <br /> <br /> Showtime is about two very different policemen, Mitch Preston (DeNiro) and Trey Sellars (Murphy). One works seriously in a low profile, quiet way, while others go easier and want more fun than criminals in his back seat. They both went to the same criminals behind a big bar of television, video recorders, etc. They then cross roads and a TV station wants a new reality TV show so they fight crime while on TV. Mitch hates the publicity while Trey loves it with his line, "It's Showtime!" Their TV antiques and methods are shown on TV and they are the new "Cops" program. The fun begins. <br /> Overall, Showtime is a fun action comedy. A good movie, but not quite the actors' expectations and standards. However, it rolls side by side, as it triggers and parodies reality TV shows. A good break out of programs like Cops. Actually at the end, just a guilty pleasure. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> Eliason A.
