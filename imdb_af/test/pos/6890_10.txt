All I can say is I really miss this show !! My wife and I just got married with the time this show started !! Why did CBS take it out of the air ??? I think it was the best show for the whole family to enjoy !! It made me laugh !! It also made me cry. But when CBS took it out of the air, my wife and I thought CBS made a big mistake. You know what will be so good? Have a reunion show! It will be so cool !! Anyone know if it's still on DVD? On the last season of Promised Land, did CBS show the whole of the previous season? I think CBS took it off in the middle of the season. My wife and I will never forget it. The opening with that theme song was fantastic !!! This show comes just once in a lifetime! May we never forget promised land!
