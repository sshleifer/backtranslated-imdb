A British dispute on Harold and Maude, Driving Lessons features a bowels of Rupert Grint and an overwhelming Julie Walters. While this is true, Grint is firmly like a redhead Benjamin Braddock for the first half of the movie. It does not detract from the strange family movie. There are things going on out of his character's experience which is a shock-shocked reaction. The chemistry between Walters and Grint carries the film, but Laura Linney's hard work to make her written stereotype is also striking. These performances combined with a fun poppy soundtrack with artists such as Sufjan Stevens, John Renbourn and Salsa Celtica make these kids popcorn flick worth a Saturday afternoon.
