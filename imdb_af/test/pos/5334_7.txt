The first full-length movie featuring the Aardman characters Wallace and Gromit manages to bring in elements of all the previous half-hour show broadcast on television. <br /> <br /> Wallace manages a company to capture human villains of people's people. vegetable gardens, and have the bright idea to try his invention on the inexorable rabbits as soon as they are caught. Of course, like in other Wallace and Gromit films, things don't work as planned. <br /> <br /> Similar to a narrow shave, there is a love interest for Wallace, in this case the Lady Posh town, and a great average villain with a blue dog. Gromit is beautifully animated with a wide variety of expressions that make the character laugh out loud. And of course, Peter Sallis gives Wallace the voice and is perfect. <br /> <br /> And, as in a Grand Day Out, cheese has a very heavy effect on the big comic effect of the movie. <br /> <br /> On the downside, this movie is a bit on the long side. There are huge effects, and a few bits that make you look and feel, but maybe this story would have worked better than another short subject, rather than pushing it to feature length.
