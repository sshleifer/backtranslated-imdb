Not since Bette Davis's 1933 vehicle, "Ex-Lady", I saw a movie that was so much better than his star said! Most of the bum rap "Atoll K," et al. "Utopia," viz. "Robinson Crusoeland," et al. "Escapade" has come from the horror stories that Stan Laurel tells of his production over the years. As he suffered during the stroke of a stroke, it seemed that death was generally very hot (of the two shot of them together, you would never guess that Laurel Hardy survived in eight years) and later with Diabetes was diagnosed (once adjusted his diet accordingly he restored himself to health), one can understand why Laurel did not think this movie was the pleasant experience of his life. Yes, it's wrong: the cheapness of the production shows up, the dubbing is awful and Laurel and Hardy were too old to do the energetic slapstick of their best movies. But it's still really funny, and Leo Joannon's story introduces elements of political satire (sometimes libertarian, sometimes communist) that one would expect to see from more socially conscious comedians such as Chaplin or the Marx brothers, but never from Laurel and Hardy. The film deserves credit to be different (although its debt to the Ealing Studios' classic "Pimlico Passport", which was made only a year earlier, is quite obvious) and for the integration of the Laurel and Hardy comedy in a fairly edgy context completely different from anything they used before. It's not a good movie, but it's definitely better than the eight brave Fox and MGM they made in the early 1940s. I suspect that only the film's technical crisis has kept it from earning the cult that acquired the Marx Brothers "Duck Soup" in the late 1960s / early 1970s under the antitrust baby boomer youth.
