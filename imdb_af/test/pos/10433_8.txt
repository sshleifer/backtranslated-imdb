Many teen sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare, but every time a movie comes, it's honest, funny, entertaining and memorable. The Last American Virgin is a special movie that found its place and blended the test of time with all four ingredients. This movie follows three friends (Gary, Rick and David "The Big Apple") misadventures in the world of first time sex and true love. Along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship. We follow hopeless romantic Gary (the main character) on his quest to win the girl of his dreams leading him in an uncertain way with a surprise turn when it ends. If you're not yet fortunate enough to see this movie, look ... anyway with many memorable 80's songs throughout the movie to move things at an equally fast pace. L.A.V. really is an original movie, a rarity among movies of his genre.
