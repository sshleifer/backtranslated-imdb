I always loved this movie. The music, the story and the action. I especially love opening and closing the movie. The music stayed with me throughout the years. The WWI aircraft camps were huge and the comedy is typically Blake Edwards. Slaptick is his fort. Julie's song is wonderful and keeps me glued to the screen. The sets and screens are wonderful. The characters are attractive. I loved the scene with the wounded soldiers and Julie's song to them. I wish she had sung in Vietnam. I also enjoyed the old cars of the period and WWI music. I was happy when the DVD arrived. Now I can watch whistling in the dark and watch.
