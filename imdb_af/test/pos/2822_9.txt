I'm surprised by some of the comments made on this site, because I really liked this movie. If you're looking for something else, this movie is a good choice. Definitely not your typical mind-boggling story that is everywhere with Ben Idiot Affleck or another Hollywood loser. It's an intellectual movie, you really need to pay attention so some people can be turned off. However, if you're looking for something that keeps you on your toes, it's a good choice. Warning to Parents - It has some pretty graphic sex scenes, so watch it as soon as the kiddies are in bed. People who love Euro flicks will like this one. Adam Sandler fans should skip this because it will be over their heads and definitely NOT their style.
