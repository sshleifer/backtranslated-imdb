Since the plot like Vertigo or Brian DePalma's Obsession, until Peter Chase's score reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's sounds, this little pearl looks out of sight. Remarkable play by Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a Bohemian Paris portrayed from the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD is French and English. Directed by a controversial artist like Gilles Mimouni, it can be regarded as a small tribute to the Cinema masterpieces. It's a French movie, and like everyone else, not everyone, we can say a d'esai theater. Even if it is not made public, it can be remembered for several reasons.
