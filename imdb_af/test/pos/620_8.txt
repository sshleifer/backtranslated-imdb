Well, this movie came about 230 hours on a working day. The cute little actress Billy played initially caught my attention and after the first 15 minutes I was taken to the end. It puts you on the edge of your seat and then throws clever pieces of comedy into the most strained rows. <br /> <br /> The only sign is that the story wasn't big enough to fill half a film, causing some rows to slip a little. Nonetheless, it was still very entertaining, and I recommended to my co-workers the next day.
