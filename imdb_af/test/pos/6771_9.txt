Not quite sure how I stumbled on this movie, but I'm so glad I did. Initially we were put off by the fact that it was subtitled, but even my dyslexic brother who hates to read (especially at the weekend) enjoyed this movie. I found the writing fantastic and the way it was delivered in such a deadly way, I just added to the legs of shit on my couch. Not quite sure if it's so joking for the native Danish, as the comedy is enhanced by the toneless of the captions and the ambiguity of the translation. I did not watch many Danish films (or at all for the matter), but on the basis of this film, they suggest that they are not limited by the same political correctness as elsewhere (said blessing), which breathes the character of Eigel make fresh air, because let's face it, special needs are. There are so many fantastic one-liners in this movie, which pity American sitcoms.
