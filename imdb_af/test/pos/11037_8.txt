If you are very sensitive to extreme racial stereotypes, this cartoon is not for you. But if you are keen to see a scarce piece of war animation, come in! <br /> <br /> In this cartoon, Popeye patrols the sea and discovers what looks like a Japanese fishing boat. The two Japanese fishermen are trying to make Popeye think they want to sign a peace treaty. But looks may be deceived; the fishing boat seems to be a Japanese fleet! What follows is considered moral promotion of propaganda today. <br /> <br /> Be warned, the representations of the Japanese in the movie are done in a moderate way. However, keep in mind that there was a war at the time. But I strongly recommend this cartoon to those interested in World War II.
