Maybe it's just a personal love for this screen version of the Mika Waltari novel, or a love of things Egyptian (I grew up to visit the mummies in Boston's Fine Arts Museum), but I think Maltin is " a little tough on this pretty good movie. The production values ​​are great in terms of color and cinematography, and it seems that some attempts have gone into historical authenticity (much of it from the novel, I'm sure). Purdom is a bit stiff in the lead, but one can accept it as part of Sinuhe's character. Victor Adult is, well, Victor Adult. Peter Ustinov is a pleasure to watch in this type of role, which he has always done so well and so whitish. Bella Darvi's performance as Nefer is classic camp, and I even find Michael Wilding's fairly dry portrayal of Aachenaten his own appeal. <br /> <br /> The historical peculiarity of Akenat's monotheism, a short detour in ancient Egypt's theological history, is interesting, just like Akenaten itself, and is worth reading; An interesting footnote about Darvi, whose birth name was Bayla Wegier: she was a Polish emigre who made Darryl Zanuck and his wife Violet. I believe they even adopted her. Her screen name Darvi is formed from Zannuck and his wife's distinguished names. She continued her acting career in France, but never achieved a great success, and after a rather unfortunate life, he died in 1971 on his own. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's an interesting movie and enjoyable for visual values ​​alone. American Movie Classics occasionally shows this in mailbox, which is essential to capture the scope and whip of the story.
