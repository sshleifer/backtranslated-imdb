Robert Cummings, Laraine Day and Jean Muir star in "And One Was Beautiful", a 1940 movie that also starred Billie Burke. At one and fifteen minutes it looked like it was a B-movie. Cummings is a playboy, Ridley Crane, who desires many women, including two sisters, Katherine and Helen Latimer (Day and Muir). Katherine is the more earthly of the two who love cars, and Helen is the blonde social butterfly with the beautiful gown. Ridley returns to town, believing he won't be at a festival, Helen decides not to attend. Since the party was given by a family friend, their mother (Burke) sends Katherine in a stuffed dress. Ridley is there, connecting the two. But Ridley has more superficiality, and when he sees Helen at a dinner, the two arrive where they are away and go to a club. He gets very drunk and Helen refuses to drive into his car because he won't let her drive. After walking for a while and breaking the heel of her shoes, she arrived at Ridley's car when driving. He went out, and she took over the wheel and accidentally dropped a cyclist. <br /> <br /> Ridley can't remember anything, so Helen blames him for death. The heel of a woman's shoe is found in the car, and Katherine sees her sister burying her shoes - plus something in Helen's way makes her realize that Helen is not telling the truth. Ridley was found guilty and went to jail, and Helen married a man she didn't love and went to South America. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie, though it wasn't an A at the time. -list cast. Cummings plays a role that Robert Taylor would have played (it's an MGM movie). He is attractive and very friendly, even though he does not have the brilliant appearance of someone like Taylor. Laraine's Day is a favorite actress of mine, someone who lent MGM constantly because they didn't know what to do with her. Why am I wondering - a great actress with a big face and voice, she has raised a lot of film. This one is no different. Her Katherine is determined, sympathetic and absolutely beautiful. Jean Muir is a common actress. <br /> <br /> So who was the beautiful one? We all know even as MGM. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended jewelry.
