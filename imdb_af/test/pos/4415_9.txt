I was a high school junior when "Flesh" hit the big screens, but was fortunate enough to see NYC movie houses just two years later at midnight. <br /> <br /> Meat is the first part of a so-called "trilogy" of movies, with Joe Dallesandro as an object of desire. It has the name "Warhol", but is more of Paul Morissey's work. In essence, the story is busy with the exploitation that one day surrounds in the life of a street-wise male hustler (played by Joe Dallesandro). Joe is young, pretty and a little naive ... but he drives the bacon to his wife for reasons not to be fully appreciated to fully appreciate the movie. <br /> <br /> From special note to movie buffs, this movie (along with the remaining two of the trilogy) has no script. Warhol's superstars are merely a point of departure ... and the words and actions the viewer sees are quite natural (sometimes ridiculous or non-sensual). But all this works ... "Rolling Stone" noted in his review that the movie was better than "Midnight Cowboy", a movie of the same year, more polished by Hollywood (an Oscar winner for the best movie) . great name talent (I admire the movie too) ... but FLESH, improvised, was somehow more daunting and realistic, without the need for complex subtypes and any "reason for the celebration". not at all! <br /> <br /> The movie cost more than $ 3m and was an absolute sensation, especially in the German market (which ironically thought they had given a "censored version" of the movie due to the post-editing .... see note below). <br /> <br /> Curious, the movie is "cut and paste" with "pops". "push", "flash", and dialogue literally cut off mid-sense. It is almost as if Warhol / Morissey indicates a simple truth that it is a "day in the life" of a superstar, extracts of your voyeuristic tendencies. Much better than before. Warhol works 8 hours sleep, and the freedom position as a 20+ hour film. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, FLESH is the first of the Warhol movies that are actually digestible (<br /> <br /> As the first of a "trilogy", it depicts a young, desirable male icon, naive, coveted, responding to invitations to please his family Subsequent movies will show the "same character" with a different set of values ​​(See "Trash" and "Heat")
