Smaller Spoilers will follow. <br /> <br /> This movie is even more strange and unconventional than "second floor songs". There is no main character we follow. There is no "plot" in the conventional way. There is no emphasis on a happy ending. There is no crowdpleasing. In other words, Roy Andersson is back with a vengeance. Instead of falling back on convention and fixed formula, Roy Andersson concentrates his film around an idea. I'm not going into what the idea is, but even if you don't "get it", I promise you'll see the greatest visual depth ever made. The majestic scenes of "songs" pale in comparison here. A work of visual beauty. <br /> <br /> Be kind to your fellow man, because, after all, we are the living, and only you and I have the power to change our lives. That's at least what I thought when I saw the final scene in the movie, with the inhumane bombers flying over the city into the movie to take our lives away. <br /> <br /> And of course don't forget to see this movie if it gets a limited release near you. It's one of those movies that actually has the power to make you a better person, like the Sica's "Bicycle Thieves". A very warm and humanistic film.
