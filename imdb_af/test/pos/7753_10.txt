On the surface, TMHS seems to be another generic high school drama; But surprisingly hidden are large amounts of depth, originality and eccentricity that will not only make the viewer unforgettable, but also undoubtedly make it one of the best animations that the medium has produced over the past few years. <br /> <br /> We see the world through the eyes of Kyon, who on his first day of Haruhi High School meets Suzumiya, a girl who bravely claims the rest of the class, she has no interest in "normal" people 'and, moreover, stay out of all the strangers, time travelers, sliders or espers to meet her. Kyon stares in disbelief, wondering if his sheep or some screws loose. But he injured his gut instincts and started talking to her. It soon becomes clear that she is not an ordinary high school. Not long after, she created her own apt SOS Brigade school club, and attracted many other unfortunate people to Kyon. Nothing in this anime meets the usual standard conventions, Kyon the protagonist is an overly cynical pessimistic, and adds a meaningful narrative to the show. A predominance of the usual 2D male main characters who tend to populate the medium. The episodes themselves are not chronological, and force the viewer to think about the events that unfold and how they relate to previous cases. It is a stroke of genius; The effect is like a jigsaw puzzle, as a new piece is laid, we get more of a sense of the bigger picture. Previous scenes are now completely new meanings, and their realization is deeply satisfying. However, this makes it feel unsuitable (it is nothing else), a very cleverly written script circumvents this problem and ensures it runs smoothly from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The story itself is strikingly original, but I will not deepen further than the simple bones I gave earlier, for it will undoubtedly destroy it. But what I will mention is the plot contains a great variety of genres, ranging from comedy to sci-fi. How they achieved it in the place of fourteen episodes is beyond me and certainly a great achievement in itself. <br /> <br /> TMHS is a true gem that has so much diversity and depth that it will appeal to. pretty much someone with an interest in anime. Look, rather unusual, it's something that lives up to the enormous hype it has received - and even exceeds it.
