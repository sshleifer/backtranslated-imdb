Words alone cannot describe the beauty and power of this movie. <br /> <br /> Think "Toy Story". Now think of 'Toy Story', about 1934. Now think the animation looks as lively as liquid. Think of the movie, not as adults and children can enjoy, but suggest it as a film-noire. Imagine trying something back in 1934. Somehow, "The Mascot" delivers. In a story where toys come to life and one of them tries to give his sick owner an orange, Starewicz delivers a level of animation completely unexpectedly. It's so humid, you'll long wonder if it's really stop-motion animation. <br /> <br /> The comparison of Toy Story and The Mascot is a useless exercise, plot-wise: while "Toy Story" is a children's story that adults can enjoy, "The Mascot" is dark, chilling story directed at adults. Means NO, your kids won't like it. A little bit. <br /> <br /> Still, get it if you can. You can also find it in "Vampyr" in DVD and LaserDisc. And prepare to be amazed at what Starewicz could do back in 1934 with a few dolls.
