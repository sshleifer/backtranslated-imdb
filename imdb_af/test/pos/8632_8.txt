Abbott and Costello's talents shine in the happy childish version of "Jack and the Beanstalk". Using sepia tone and color, the music and choreography, song and dance, the transition from players to one role to another, plus several other aspects of this very fine movie make it clear that techniques and styles used for "The Wizard of Oz "is played here. And it works well for our fearless duo. There are some other things that make this movie a pleasure to me. Buddy Baer's, Max Baer Jr. of the Beverly Hillbillies uncle, appearance as the policeman and giant. Lou's brother, Pat Costello, was involved in writing the script. These things help to make this movie fun. However, it has a downward side. I think the choreography was poorly done. But the cute songs and accompanying choirs detract from the rather messy dance numbers. Some of the players, the couple in love (prince and princess) to be precise, are not very good at their dealings. But these things are a small price to pay for an otherwise enjoyable step in the yellow brick ... I mean ... climb the leg of the bone.
