I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but it looks like the reality of life in so many ways, and if you're really honest with yourself, you will resonate with at least some of the screens. <br /> <br /> The acting is not only credible but convincing in a way that gives one character. In addition, it is funny, without trying too hard. <br /> <br /> And yes, I really believe a sequel is justified here. See the movie, you will understand why. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, especially if you like movies that have the right message.
