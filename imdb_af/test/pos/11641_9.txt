One of the more vivid statements against the death penalty ever filmed is quite a pre-attack against the most disgusting way to do justice. The final order, with the parallel between the crimes committed by the convicted Poncelet and its own execution is just excellent. <br /> <br /> How about Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon? It leaves you breathless, they are two giants and their performances reach the highest levels of emotion. <br /> <br /> Tim Robbins makes it clear that he is not only a good actor, but also a good director. <Br /> <br /> * My rate: 9/10
