Well-documented documentary focuses on two Sudanese refugees resettled in the United States. It is your basic water-based fish with a non-fiction twist. I found it fascinating to see Peter and Santino live before they came to America and how they adapted when they arrived (in Houston, Texas.) They were expecting a kind of sky, but realized that is much harder than it looks good in the states. They go from hopeful idealists to somewhat more realistic skeptics. Everywhere they go, they meet bureaucrats with paper paths that most citizens take for granted. They are afraid they are blacker than African Americans here and do not feel accepted. One of the "Lost Boys" manages Houston to go to Olathe, Kansas, where he finds conditions slightly better, but still less than ideal. There are people who also try to help them and try to hurt them in this movie. Not shown, but talked about, are those who put a gun on their heads and robbed them, which led one Lost Boy to respond negatively that "all black people in America aren't good." I also find it interesting that they arrived in Houston in August 2001, a month before the World Trade Center was attacked by terrorists. I was hoping to see their response to this tragedy, but it is not mentioned at all. However, a very well done documentary with no narration. No one is really needed. The "Lost Boys" do a good job of keeping the events going, without any help, thank you.
