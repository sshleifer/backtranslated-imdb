Körkarlen (1921), a classic film with cult status under the silent movies, led by Victor Sjöstrøm, who also plays the male lead, is based on a story by Swedish novelist Selma Lagerlöf. The film tells the story of the brutal drinker, David Holm, who beat his wife, neglects his children, seduces his brother to drink and is blind to the love of nurse Edit (Astrid Holm). David sits with his boozing friends in the city park by the end of the year and tells the story of the Phantom Chariot (Körkarlen): Whoever dies in the New Year's Eve as the last one before dawn, must be one year's manager of death. and release the dying souls from their bodies. But David is in battle with his friends, suffers bleeding and sinks to the ground. Meanwhile, the Phantom Carriage is approaching. The manager is none other than David's friend Georges who has seduced him into alcohol and died one year ago. Since David refuses to get on the line, Georges forces him. Together they drive to the stations where people live that David suffered. They visit the nurse Edit whose love for David he couldn't recognize and who he infected with tuberculosis so she now dies. But her unconditional love for David will save his soul. Filled with her spirit, they come to David's wife and children. David can prevent his wife murdering her and her children because she does not see a way out of the misery in which David threw her. They also visit David's brother, who committed a murder after being drunk by David. David asks Georges to go back into his body because he finally sees his way wrong. As it was Georges who had seduced him once in the drinks, David's wish was granted, he was given a second chance and Georges had to be Phantom Carriage's manager for another year to pay his own sins. This movie is probably the strongest and most impressive movie ever made. Incredibly, it is not yet available on international DVD.
