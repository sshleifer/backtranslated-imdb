If you are interested in learning more about these kinds of events in modern civilization, there is an excellent book called "Outlaw Seas" or "The Outlaw Sea", and it tells story in story how these things happen. The lawlessness of the open sea is a reality for a number of reasons. One of the world's trucks is of dubious registry (nationality) and it is difficult to impose international laws when shipowners do not have an office in a real country. Two, many shipping lines use teams of dirty poor third-world countries. The teams are often (like illegal immigrant workers) threatened and interrupted to comply with dubious or illegal practices. Three, there is often a language barrier, not only between the officials and the crew, but also between the crew members themselves. The crew is rewarded for their compliance and their silence. Four, once an illegal act is committed, the ships can hide with little more than a new coat of paint. Anyway, it's fascinating reading. <br /> <br /> Horrible story, great movie. Does anyone else know how HBO looks the best and most important movies? Hollywood has trouble releasing Oscar-worthy movies in any given year, so several of the top 5 contenders usually come from Britain. Jerry Bruckheimer = the end of quality cinema. <br /> <br /> I loved Sean Pertwee's vicious performance. I also loved Omar Epps, as usual.
