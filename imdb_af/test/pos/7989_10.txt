Batman Returns It is my opinion that the first Batman of the Batman series was just half the movie that Batman Returns is. In the first Batman by Tim Burton, we just played Batman and The Joker both wonderfully by Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. <br /> <br /> In Batman Returns we have what I feel is the best Batman movie (yes even better than Dark Knight). Keaton returns as Batman and is perfect in the never-ending role, with the character of Batman, who is perfect in this movie when it comes to the two villains he is about to face. First, you have Danny DeVito who is beautifully insane than the Penguin. Then you have Michelle Pfeiffer as Cat-Woman, whom I dare to risk, one of the most interesting and complex villains in the Batman movies. In this way I feel about Pfeiffer because of the way she becomes the Catwoman, she begins as the rather pathetic mule Selena Kyle and then really dives into the dark side of her mind and what you get is a brilliant show of " a woman who is trying to be a hero to a villain and then I finally think back to a hero. Also in this incredible cast you played the evil businessman Max Schreck by the wonderful and legendary Christopher Walken. While it's in a supporting role, there's something about this role I love and maybe it's the appearance of Schreck in the movie that makes its performance even better than it already is. <br /> <br /> Stories show that I have to say Batman Returns is doing so much more, unlike the first Batman. Part of the reason I loved this story is the fact that Burton forced it into a much darker and twisted direction as opposed to Nicholson's top wars. You have the story of the Penguin and how he is trying to deceive the people of Gotham to make him the new hero and mayor of the city. Then you have Cat-Woman and her struggle to just decide who she really is and what she needs to do with her new persona. As for Batman, I feel that in this one he is the ringleader who holds the two stories together, but of course kicking ass at the same time. <br /> <br /> Combatography was the movie's dark and atmospheric like the story taking place in it. Gotham City has never looked as good as Blu-Ray and HD, so if you have the chance to see it that way, do it anyway because it really adds to the overall experience of Batman Returns. <br /> <br /> So, I really feel about all the Batman movies. Batman Returns doesn't believe me or the Dark Knight, because while I enjoy the movie for Heath Ledger's incredible performance, I felt the movie was missing something. Batman Returns is missing nothing, so if you want to see a wonderful movie with what I feel is a perfect role, then it's the Batman to light the Bat signal.
