Good footage of World War II ships and aircraft fills this excellent war drama in the Adriatic. Walter Huston is excellent as the commander who knows his place and his place has no place for personal feelings. The safety of the ship and the mission must always be first. Robert Montgomery is the lieutenant who has not yet mastered the role of a leader in battle. He made bad decisions that endangered the submarine and his crew, but eventually became a "real man" after being dismissed from the navy. Robert Young plays a lieutenant junior grade and Jimmy Durante as a cook. Parallel to the war drama is an equally important war-time triangle between Montgomery and Madge Evans playing Huston's daughter and the wife of a tragically injured pilot. Recommended.
