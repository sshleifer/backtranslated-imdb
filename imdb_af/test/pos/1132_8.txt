I'm not a big TV person ... but when I saw the leading episode of the Greek, I couldn't wait until next week! I don't miss the show for nothing! <br /> <br /> THANK YOU GOD FOR DVR! LOL I'm in love with Cappie ... he's like a bad boy, but he's so sweet ... Everyone has their own character, so we pretty much have all kinds of people. You can still throw a Spanish and a chubby person. <br /> <br /> I didn't go to school in the US, so I never had the idea of ​​frat homes and things like that, so when my husband told me about the show I didn't pay attention to didn't, until he asked me to see it and as I couldn't do better, I agreed. I laughed so hard for the first night that I just needed to watch it. <br /> <br /> So ... I'm with the other people who voted for this show to continue! I hope for a second, third and who knows how many episodes! It's a very good show, very funny and entertaining!
