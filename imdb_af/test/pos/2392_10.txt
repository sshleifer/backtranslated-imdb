I've been writing hardboiled crime fixes for a number of years. When a writer develops a story, he always has a character / actor in mind to bring the story to life. Last weekend I found a new one in Paul Vario playing Uncle Benny in Eddie Monroe. It was a smooth film highlighted by Vario's presence on and off the screen (as his voice-telling is also heard). I also especially liked the actress who played Benny's cousin and Eddie's former wife, but everyone in this exciting movie did a great job of playing bad guys and the double crossing that goes with it. A good job everywhere and mr. Vario shone the brightest. He must one day be my Tony Gangi ...
