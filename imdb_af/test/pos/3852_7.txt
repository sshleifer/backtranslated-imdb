Plot in a nutshell - Duchess (Eva Gabor's voice) is the well polished single-mother cat of three little kittens. When her owner, the rich older woman known as Madame Adelaide, realizes that her time runs out, she decides to write down her will, and everything she has to her cats will then go to her bowler Edgar when the cats pass . Edgar dominates it and is deeply insulted by the idea that the cats will find everything in front of him, and plans to destroy Duchess and her kittens; One night he sleeps sleeping pills in their dinner and is then stranded in the French countryside. Out of their element, duchess and her kittens befriend a street clever cat known as Thomas O'Malley (voice of Phil Harris who did the voice of the runaway Balloo in the Jungle Book); O'Malley decides to succeed with the Duchess, unaware that she is a loner. O'Malley decides to accompany them at home, with Duchess actually falling for O'Malley, as the ordinary dependent family bond is being developed; following chaos and chaos, culminating in a violent clash between O'Malley, his brother's cats from the streets and Edgar. There are also phenomena of British geese, American southern dog dogs (which they do in France is anyone's guess), a mouse that sounds much like Alice In Wonderland's rabbit (he's actually pronounced by the same man who pronounced Winnie the Pooh and a horse. <br /> <br /> Sometimes slow, but still enjoyable, Disney business. Features of the memorable "Everybody Wants To Be A Cat" music piece sung by the late Scatman Crothers (better known as 1980s fans as the voice of Jazz on Transformers). Of course, if that is done, it would probably be a dark social commentary on the class division represented by the division between well-bred and well-fed Duchess and O'Malley Street.
