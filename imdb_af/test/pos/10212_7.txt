"Western Union" is something of a forgotten classic western! Perhaps the reason for this lies in the fact that it's unavailable on DVD in the United States. However, everything is not lost, as it now appears in region 2 in England. It is a blessing in some ways. Not only is it uncomfortable, but completely ironic when one considers that a film depicting the establishment and establishment of such a unique American organization as The Western Union Telegraph Company is without a region 1 release. This begs faith! It just doesn't make sense! <br /> <br /> Produced by Fox in 1941, "Western Union" directed by Fritz Lang. It was only the second time that the great German director undertook to direct a Western! He did an excellent job last year with Fox's "The Return Of Frank James" and in 1952 will have only one western outing with the beautiful "Rancho Notorious". Long was no Ford or Hawks, but with "Western Union" he became a fine, solid western creature who likes very well. Beautifully photographed in the early three-stroke Technicolor by Edward Cronjager, it played a good role under the direction of Robert Young, Randolph Scott and Dean Jagger. The female lead is taken by Virginia Gilmore, who really has little to do with the picture. An actress who made nothing of her career. Her presence here is just cosmetic. <br /> <br /> It's curious that Robert Young has the best bill on Scott! This is obviously Scott's picture from the beginning when we first saw him rushing through the plains in the movie's huge opening scene. Young doesn't have much to do throughout the movie and looks in place in the west. He just seems foolish to fight against Barton McLane in a gun! An actor who never really distinguished himself - except perhaps with Crossfire (1947) - Young appears in a series of unforgettable romantic comedies in the forties and fifties that were outstanding with his greatest success when he spent the years "TV" Welby MD "was. the seventies. He died at 91 years. <br /> <br /> "Western Union" relates the telegraph wire of Omaha and Salt Lake City. Scott plays a reformed ban hired by West Union boss Dean Jagger to protect the line from abuse of Sioux and also to tackle McLane and his gang who are trying to destroy the line for their own devastating ends. Robert Young is the young engineer of the east who joins the company and is furious with Scott for the sadness of Miss. Gilmore. Some comic relief is provided by - and annoying - so some would say - by Slim Summerville and John Carradine in a slender role when the company comes out doctor. <br /> <br /> Although a thrilling western, albeit on Region 2, but in sparkling good quality, fans will be delighted. My only crib is that there are no extras, not even a trailer and that awful cover with the dull graphics. UGH! <br /> <br /> Footnote: Interestingly, the associated producer at Western Union was Harry Joe Brown who would later partner with Randolph Scott to produce Scott's best westerners in the fifties.
