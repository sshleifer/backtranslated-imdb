This is one of L & H's shorts most often referred to as the first "real" L&H teamwork and perhaps one of their best silent features. J. Piedmont Mumblethunder (Ollie) is a millionaire who came to the docks to greet his cousin Philip, whom he had never seen. At first, Ollie laughs at everyone when this strange little man uncovers and pays much attention to the way he behaves during his medical examination, but is reasonably humiliated when it appears to be the fellow he is supposed to greet. He is told that Philip is a good boy, but he has one weakness - women. Mumblethunder and Philip went home but their journey is constantly interrupted by Philip every time he sees a woman, in a little dance, and then pursues the woman. Large crowds gather every time this happens, not so much, because he is looking for skirts, but because Philip himself also wears a skirt (a kilt). Eventually, Mumblethunder manages to drag Philip into a locker room to become a proper pants, but Philip also escapes from chasing more skirts. There is a lot of laughter everywhere. It's also nice to see so short, because the boys are not exactly the characters we know and love. Ollie is actually his usual character, but it is such a joy to see that Stan is so different from his regular male-child character. It shows that he was not a once-off pony and excelled in other types of roles when he got the chance. With a run time of 19 minutes it is short and sweet, with classic one linen that still has me in stitches.
