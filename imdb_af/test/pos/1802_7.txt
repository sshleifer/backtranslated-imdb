I'm glad Cage changed his name from Coppolla and has this part on his own. Light-hearted, no deep-minded need, but a cute piece of opposition - although her parents are still hippies. Catch the voice of the early 80's - the fall of the valley and the funk of the other side. One can see the beginning of Cage's talent.
