Movies look in two categories: movies that reinforce existing community values ​​and beliefs, and those that challenge them. This film is a 180 degree shift from the idealistic rhetoric depicted in offers such as "The Longest Day" and "The Green Berets". It looks more like Disney fantasies. The "Apocalypse Now!" project, production and the resulting film is "Heart of Darkness" which is updated in a psychological horror story of the post-modern variety of the late 20th century. The casting and crew that worked on it can probably be related to the frightening places that human mind can reach. This is the fate of Joseph Conrad's original character, Kurtz, which came to be literary in 1901 and is referred to in TS Eliot's "The Hollow Men" (Mistah Kurtz, death of 1925). Although not a straight narrative of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness" (1901) or a first-hand version of the Vietnam experience, "Apocalypse Now!" stand as a masterpiece printed on the envelope of film potential. "Apocalypse" is not just about the "horrors" of the war, such as "Platoon" and "Deer Hunter", but the dark sensitivity of human nature as revealed by the mourning and humiliating confrontations of violent conflict on a mass scale. . Apocalypse Now! <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is the journey of a trained memory killer, Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen in a tournament) aboard an American army. boat crossing an nameless river in the heart of Vietnam and Cambodia where few Westerners will ever step down. His mission is to spot. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a special defense force defense force, ending the US military darling until he goes AWOL and expires in the deeply unprecedented jungles between Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The official classified report is that the colonel has become insane, but when events spell out, something else has happened to him that is far frightening than just madness. Sheen's mission is to end the colonel with the American public, not the wiser. <br /> <br /> The film is rather episodic. The journey along the river consists of several vignettes such as Sheen and his crew meet various independent "aspects" of war on the ground. American audiences from the 1970s probably never saw this kind of filmmaking, with the possible exception of "The Deer Hunter" released in the previous year. The first and one of the best known is a helicopter battalion led by Col Kilgore (Robert Duvall in an Oscar nominated show) which is a cross between gen. Robert E Lee and Richard Wagner. He likes to play Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries "The Ring" when bombarding helpless villages. His line "I love Napalm's smell in the morning" is one of the often cited lines of the annals of the theater. Other encounters include an amphitheater where mysterious people are entertained by Hugh Heffner and Playboy bunnies. <br /> <br /> In spite of all the production catastrophes that have hampered these footage, the remarkable aspect of this movie is its pacing. The original version (not the later Redux version) offers a fine job until the viewer is emotionally prepared to handle the climate confrontation between Willard and Kurtz. The strange discourse between Willard and Kurtz is the price of admission alone. And some of the shots of Both Sheen and Brando are in some places of the sharpest and frightening images ever made on movies. Not only do people like Clive Barker, Wes Craven or David Cronenberg have anything on Coppola in the case of horrific images. Brando's Kurtz in a particular scene is so scary. This makes most other horror movies look tame in comparison, which comes from the recognition that the horror is not from the inside but from inside. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much, Coppola's solution to the climactic moment stands as one of the most innovative of cinematic revelations. According to the documentary "Hearts of Darkness", Coppola feared that the inevitable final scene in the melodrama would lapse, and the atmosphere of the film's darker colors would be compromised. He wasn't sure how he could make it work until his wife encouraged the director to practice the ceremonial sacrifice of an ox practiced by the indigenous people with whom Coppola as an extras in the scenes with Kurtz at his "village" used. After the show, Coppola had its end, and it is one of the most disturbing and beautiful rows in the history of American movies. Love it or hate it. No western viewer will be the same after seeing this scene. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for all tastes, just as Conrad's original novel is not the kind of book that will be read on planes. . It's not just the violence and the futility of violence that is difficult for most American viewers to absorb. This is the bare revelation of aspects of the human condition that are apparently removed from suburban American life, making this movie difficult for the average filmmaker to handle, whatever it should be. Coppola didn't make a family photo. However, if the viewer can understand his bigger point, there is plenty of Apocalypse Now! If you are looking for a movie experience to confirm the existing attitudes about American sensitivity and heroism, John Wayne is better off. But if you are willing to rhetoric in places you've never been, even beyond the "evils of war", "Apocalypse Now" will take you into a world you thought you've never visited before and the disturbing part of that is that you can recognize it.
