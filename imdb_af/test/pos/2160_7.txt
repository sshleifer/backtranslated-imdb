Night Hunter began in 1968 when a young Jack Cutter (Chris Aguilar) unexpectedly handed the family tradition to become a Vampire hunter when a fellow Vampire hunter Sid O'Mack (Sid Haim) betrayed his family and surrendered them to the Vampire, to help Jack on his quest, he was given a book containing the name of every vampire alive, or dead, however you see it. Jump to 'June 1995' and Los Angeles where the now adult cutter (Don 'The Dragon', also co-producer) has only four names in the book, including Argento (Vince Murdocco) and Carmella (Sophia Crawford) , is the last of American Vampires. As they all eat in a restaurant, the party cuts off the party and kills them, does work right? Wrong as King of Vampires Bruno Fischer (Nicholas Guest) calls in the last four remaining vampires from around the world, French Tournier (Maria Ford), Asian Hashimoto (Ron Yuan), Ulmer (David 'Shark Fralick) and Sangster Vincent Clutter off Cutter and kill him. Meanwhile, Detective's Hooper (Marcus Aurelius) and Browning (Cash Casey) have no idea and a notion reporter named Raimy Baker (Melanie Smith) is involved in the battle between Cutter & the Vampire's on which the fate of the Earth rests! br /> <br /> Targeted by Rick Jacobson I thought Night Hunter was quite a fun way to pass 85 strange minutes. William C. Martell's script combines martial arts and horror with a high degree of success, moving at a good pace and at least never boring and apparently does not seem to take itself too seriously. However, the character names that refer to other horror movie directors / actors are a bit tough. Some may be surprised at how close Night Hunter looks like Blade (1998), but has been made a few years earlier. The one-time moody long dress wears Vampire hunter who is an expert in martial arts, the scene in a nightclub and the innocent woman in the world of Vampire's. Night Hunter doesn't really like the traditional Vampire movie law, for example, sunlight just irritates their eyes, they can only cover up on a solar eclipse (why?), Strikes through the heart and garlic are not good as the way to get a Vampire murdered In Night Hunter is breaking his neck. I could have done a little more horror and a little more blood, as it lends more to the martial arts side of things. The dialogue is pretty cheesy and the character is just as nice. <br /> <br /> Director Jacobson does his best to destroy the movie, the action scenes are OK, but a certain thing is missing and for some bizarre reason when an action series takes place, he shakes his camera constantly , it's as if the camera is being put on the full cycle of the washing machine! Hey, Rick, mate, it's not smart or stylish. This is irritating and irritating. The gore is disappointing with some greedy shooting wounds and a few splashes of blood. Vampire's neck unfortunately does not break much blood. <br /> <br /> With a budget that probably wasn't much of Night Hunter, it was skillfully crafted throughout. The play was bad most of the time and what about 'The Dragon' in Don 'The Dragon' s name? Did he change his name legally? Does he sign Don 'The Dragon' Wilson? Does he get email addressed to him in that name? I think I can do such a thing, from now on I want to be known as Paul 'The Killer Klown' Andrews ... Night Hunter is one of those crap films that surpasses its limitations and horror. to become pure gold entertainment. If you enjoy your movies, then Night Hunter can be for you, if you are looking for great tension in a similar vein (! Vampires, veins and blood get it?) Then Blade and his pursuers will probably have a better choice be. As for hell, I like to sue it.
