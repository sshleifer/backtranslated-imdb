Bill Paxton follows his promising debut, the Gothic horror "Frailty", with this family-friendly sports drama about the American Open in 1913, where a young American caddy rose from his humble background to play against his villain's idol. . as "the greatest game ever played." I'm not a fan of golf, and these scrappy underdog sports flicks are a dime a dozen (most recently done with a great effect with Miracle and Cinderella Man), but some how this movie was all in the let down. /> <br /> The movie starts with a few creative opening points (imagine a slatefree version of the animated opening credits of HBO's "Carnivale" and "Rome"), but lumbers are slow for its first by-the-clock hour. As soon as the action moves to the US, open up things very well. Paxton does a nice job and shows a talent for effective live thriving (I loved the rainfall of day two of the open) which drives the plot further or adds some unexpected psychological depth to the proceedings. There is a compelling character development when British Harry Vardon is pursued by images of the aristocrats in black suits and top hats that destroyed his family home as a child to make way for a golf course. He also does a good job of visualizing what is happening in the players' heads under pressure. Golf, a painful boring sport, is brought alive here alive. Credit should also be given to the set of designers and costume departments at the beginning of the twentieth century to create a pleasant atmosphere in London and Boston. <br /> <br /> You know how it won't end, because it's based on a real story, but also because movies in this genre follow the same pattern over and over, but Paxton is better than average display and may indicate more talent behind the camera than he ever had before. Despite its formal nature, it's a nice and easy movie to root because it deserves an audience.
