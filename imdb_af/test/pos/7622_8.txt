This movie is good. They seem to use the Tyrannosaurus Rex like an inflated balloon, just like Godzilla, perhaps back in those 60-70 days, scientists didn't have enough information. on all kinds of dinosaurs. Back in that time, scientist still made dinosaur, so I think this movie was basically a Tyrannosaurus Rex movement back in the 60s-70s. There is even a part where a giant rock, fired by the Tyrannosaurus Rex, damages the Tyrannosaurus Rex and it has been eliminated for a while. In the end, the Tyrannosaurus Rex returned to search for food. There's also something wrong in the movie, like a gun, how can a gun kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex if it can be 1000-1000 stronger than we are. If this movie wants to make a remake, I suggest it is more good and excited, because watching an old movie look like it's a memory, or happy.
