It is a television movie based on the murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich in the mid-1970s. Based on how much truth it is hard to tell. This lot is certain.it is based on the book written by Mark Fuhrman. the crime in flashback and its aftermath, including the arrest of a suspect, about 25 years later, which has never been regarded as a suspect. Of course, in the film, Fuhram is largely responsible for arresting and closing the case for Martha's surviving family, especially her mother. The story of the movie is by the ghost of Martha Moxley, who speaks in the first person. It is a very effective device in this movie. For me, it adds more impact to the movie and puts a human face on the murder victim (if only an actor plays the role) Maggie Grace plays Martha and I was very impressed with her. There is no way to know Mark Fuhrman's motive to investigate the crime. It could have been. of a sense of justice and maybe he really cares. Or maybe he's just s dollar bucks from a future bestselling book, but it makes for an interesting movie.it performed well and pretty fast. I don't think there were a lot of extra, unnecessary things in the movie, just what was needed to tell the story. One might argue that they left out things that would pour out a little more light on the proceedings, and one would be right. Also, one can argue that the end was sudden and again it would be right. But if I said, to me, I think they told the story with at least most of the essential things. anything else would probably need a miniseries. There is a miniseries titled "A Season in Purgatory" that came out. (1996), this movie has some parallels, even if it is just faint. But if you like this movie, then you may be interested in a season in purgatory. It is my belief that a season in purgatory is a fictional version of the same crime. In my case, Murder in Greenwich, is an 8/10
