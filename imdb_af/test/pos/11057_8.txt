This is the forty minute movie that introduces us to the character of the Butcher, which will be investigated more thoroughly later in the Seul Contre Tous feature. In this film, the early period of his life follows from 1965 to 1979, but focused on the late seventies. The first is the battle of a horse, then the birth of a baby, the Creator's daughter, which we see growing rapidly every year. The butcher (played by Philippe Nahon in both films) is a bitter man. He hates many things. His anger comes at a head when a man assaults his autistic daughter. The butcher then hits the wrong man and finds himself in jail. <br /> <br /> This movie follows the butcher's life just after his release from prison, and then Seul Contre Tous takes from there. I watched the movies in the wrong way, Seul Contre Tous first. Try to watch this little movie first if you can.
