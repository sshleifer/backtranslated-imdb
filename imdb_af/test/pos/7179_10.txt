The second film about the adventures of the Gaulois couple Asterix & Obelix is ​​10 times better than the first. The humor is great (and relentless) and the writing was well executed from the original 1965 book by Goscinny & Uderzo. I fell asleep with the first movie (although I'm a big fan of Asterix) and was reluctant to see this sequel, but I'm glad this movie proved wrong to me. Excellent comedy for everyone. Highly recommended!
