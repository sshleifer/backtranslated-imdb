The fact that this movie has slammed at the box office and still struggles for the recognition it deserves is a great pity - yet somehow, rather appropriate. The commercial suicide of the Monkeys who made this film is reflected by the metaphorical suicide they are doing on the screen. To be so brutally destroyed, their carefully constructed image as a healthy American alternative to the Beatles encourages the point of restlessness, just like being caught up in pawns in the entertainment industry (in the movie literally). The Monkees' television series was not as conventional, but HEAD is completely relentless ... although there is some form of circular eventually. Unobstructed by a true storyline, the surreal sequence of events is in turn hilarious and rather disturbing. The biggest irony is that the Monkeys signed their death warrant effectively as a commercial force when they reached their artistic peak. Their exploration into psychedelia reached its peak with the soundtrack to HEAD (all the songs are memorably woven into the film), which is one of the landmark albums of the sixties. The Monkeys began to disintegrate after the checkout failure of this movie, but HEAD serves as a noble legacy.
