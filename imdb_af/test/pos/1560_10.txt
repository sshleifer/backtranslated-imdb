This is probably the best picture that won't see much. It presented a culture in a truly un-crystallized manner. A must see for everyone who likes India and for those who don't. I think this movie will be more in the Indian scene. In addition, the acting was! Alice's character is so well-degraded. With perfect disgust. This movie must be brought to the mainstream! I think it will do phenominally! ALICE is the most real look at an element of our culture that I have seen. A look untouched by the Hollywood hand. Movies like this show young people that these things are not more glamorous, but that they are real and compelling. If you liked PIECES APRIL, you will love this one!
