Roy Separator stars in a poor man's French Connection who has a bit of the same gritty appeal. FC is a better movie, but I prefer to watch this one because 1) I think Scheider is great and it's his best movie, and 2) it has the best car hunt. FIRST, one that Bullitt looks like a cable production. to Bill Hickman, who actually plays the driver). It doesn't hurt that Tony LoBianco stops playing again. Please enjoy it.
