When I first saw the movie being advertised, I thought it was another Disney movie that went almost straight to the video. I finally got around and rented. I thought it would be bad, because I couldn't see Shia in any other role than his recently canceled show "Even Stevens". When I turned it on, I was ready to turn it off in about ten minutes of boredom. It started a bit slow and I couldn't understand the beginning because the years didn't make sense, and then they explained it was in the show later, so I got rid of it. All and all I thought it was a good movie and I would recommend it. The movie was, and although I am not a fan of golf, I kept my attention with a good plot.
