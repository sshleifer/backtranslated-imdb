For some reason, some shows just fail ... some deserving, some not ... Buddy Faro was a clever show with interesting characters and dark humor that was nice to watch ... Maybe it was never meant To be a big hit, but it had a "peculiarity" about it which made it enjoyable. It is said to be the only one watching ... Dennis Farina and Frank Whaley are perfectly cast in their respective roles ... production quality and writing were great and Vegas was the perfect backdrop ... hopefully released the first and only season on DVD, as I believe it deserves some notoriety ... maybe it at least on TV Land .... shit
