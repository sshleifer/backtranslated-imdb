It starts a bit slow but gives it a chance. In the spirit of the "Wackiest Ship in the Arm" and the "Pink Sub", this movie is about a non-orthodox group that does not use orthodox methods to persuade everyone. Rob Schneider is priceless as an LT who takes himself too seriously, leading to a failed muting attempt and a pirate team making it on the board. In contrast, Kelsey Grammar (similar to Cary Grant) takes nothing serious except the job. This movie is more about lines than plot. From the "handcuffed" fisherman in Charleston harbor to the "whale" lid, their surprises surprised me and I laughed aloud.
