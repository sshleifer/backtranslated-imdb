When I first saw, I was 9, and it caught my attention immediately when Stewie Lois called the hotel. I laughed and kept looking. When the episode was finished, I wrote the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. It separates itself from the Simpsons and other shows, Cartoon Network, because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but it's TV-14 for a reason. The quick movie cuts to every punch line and cute, funny movements and character behaviors make it special. Talented Seth Macfarlene is the creator and voice of many characters in the show. A good theme song, and a crazy family that is always funny, makes it my favorite cartoon along Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Check it out it's funny things.
