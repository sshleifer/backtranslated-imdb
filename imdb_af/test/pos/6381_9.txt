This movie is strange, but I really enjoyed it. It's about a good girl who loves her bad boy and got their honeymoon up. he does not love her back and he is an average boy of a bitch. he begins to love her after some things that happened on their honeymoon, I will not give it away. its odd yes! but unlike other movies in a good way I think. I don't know what to compare, but it's a love story. but also has very funny things. like seeing James Franco in a wig. I loved the notebook very much and it felt so nice because of the love story. but the rest is different. nothing like that. Sienna Miller is really good. I saw this movie at a screen because I love her and her fashion. I love her in the factory girl, but it's a better movie than that. her and james franco really fall in love with this movie and i hope they are in real life but don't know <br /> <br /> see it !!
