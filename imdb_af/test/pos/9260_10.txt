After roughly 7 years on NBC, it was decided to do just one last Super Paid. The series has been on the bubble several times, because they didn't have the numbers that would qualify as a blockbuster of a TV hour. It has always had a substantial, hard core of hard corps followers. <br /> <br /> It was almost as if the series, with the full title of "HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREET" (1993-99) was a sort of "Mr. In-Between" series. It was too big to just cancel, but too small to get a case of Rabid Ratings Ravings. <br /> <br /> During the particular Friday evening official, they hosted the finest and most daring Artistic of Hour dramas. There I said it Artistic, Artistic !! But remember, we mean Artistic, but not just Phony, Pretentious, Pedantic, Politically Correct preaching. <br /> <br /> When it was finally a sure thing, it was the end of the line for "HOMICIDE"; This super episode was prepared as this was made for 2 hours for TV Movie. <br /> <br /> Watch all the seasons' events and parade of regular characters, and the production team went out and we proved what was a super trip. <br /> <br /> OUR STORY? ?????. As we join the story, we find that the commander of the commander of the homony murderer, Mr. Al Giardello, the "pen drawn". Retired from work, that is. But 'G' is not right to retire. So, instead of a curtain chair like fish rod, we find that Al ran for Mayor of Charm City. <br /> <br /> While in town, make a few campaigns and speeches, the former detectives took an assassin's bullet. Alive, but in a comatose condition, he is taken to hospital. <br /> <br /> News spread fast and as if officially called in, we find all the detectives of the Baltimore unit we saw on the show and offered their services and help. There is a good encounter with all these former and current gum masks, as they fit in and follow every head and possibility of a lead. <br /> <br /> The producer found a way to deal with those who had previously died their memory in the story. They managed to answer some long-standing questions and even introduced a few here to unregulated people. The whole story turns the series into a satisfying and original way. But at least for now, we'll leave it as "classified". <br /> <br /> In the inclusion of everything in a neat, small package, this TV movie does get our endorsement. As for the rating "THE HOMICIDE MOVIE", we must give it an A or A +. But, regardless of the Grade here, it didn't go as high as a typical weekly episode.
