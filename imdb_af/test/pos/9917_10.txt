The murders in Opera are not real murders, as they are symbols of past events and parts of Betty's own broken personality. In fact, Betty is the same person (a male) who is Suzy Bannion in Suspiria, just a decade later in life. (Suzy was a ten-year-old boy who had a ten-year-old with a more light version of his own background.) <br /> <br /> It helps to think of Betty's luxury apartment as a military barracks -baai; She spends most of her time in her bedroom in bed next to her stereo, it looks and other parts of her apartment somehow seem strange to her, as if other people live in the other rooms. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento movies sync with a wide variety of Rock music as well as Funk (Dario starts synchronizing right at the start of his movies, the flash of the eye in Opera, and the beginning of a drum roll in Suspiria). There are also standard films with which Opera (and Suspiria) are synchronized. For example, Opera syncs with a record album of Judas Priest called Priest ... Live (like Suspiria), and Suspiria syncs very well with a Kiss recording album called Kiss Alive II. Movies like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, The Image and The Vampire Happening are sync movies. Argento uses the same subject as Argento's films. This sync, along with many others, reveals Betty as a man who has had sexual torture in his father's birth since birth (even in the womb according to a certain Anne Rice novel entitled Lasher). <br /> <br /> Anyway, big budget movies are occultic works that collect spying information through occultic meaning, all in synchronized symbolic / alchemical fashion. Usually, the sync point in a movie is the beginning of the sound, or it is the first image of the movie over any film company. Sometimes it is more creative. The heavy metal music used in Opera and Phenomena is simply music syncing that is decoded from other movies that synchronize Argento's movies, an intellectual play of all sorts among the elite in the industry. <br /> <br /> So, Betty doesn't normally respond to the murders she is witnessing, as she has never witnessed any murder of any right person. "His self" suffers from soul murder; she testifies of her own "murder"; this individual's father nearly dropped him in Arizon on an abandoned mining scale in Arizon nearly 4 years ago. He was about to fall off a wooden shelf, after which his father balanced him before Dad changed his mind and grabbed him and drove him back. the child did not feel conscious. Memories of sexual torture are lost to this individual through extreme sexual oppression. The vague memories remaining are from the large, square, deep hole in the desert and no meaning is placed on this memory due to the lack of conscious trauma (the "loss of trauma," also a "buried property", is portrayed in the 1975 film The Image. The sausages on the attic in Suspiria are every individual reminder of the first three or so years of a life. (Toys In The Attic). <br /> <br /> The reason why Betty (or Suzy) is a female character is because the individual Christina Marsillach's character mirrors are a man who has been trained since the birth to a feminine role of all kinds (though the DVDs of the Simpsons cartoon sync with Suspiria), with its nature formed alongside "queen" lines (The X-File episodes sync with Opera). It even changed its body to be "beautiful" in the way a woman is. Behavior changes genetics. A more recent movie entitled Death Proof deals with the same ideas and the same individual. <br /> <br /> Virtually the entire life of this person is reflected on major budget movies, record albums and books since 1966 and father before 1966 and beyond. The Scorpio album entitled Virgin Killer is a sync album by Suspiria, the original album cover acting as a symbolic mirror image of the fall by the skylight.
