Many times, Bollywood has been trying to recover Hollywood hits, just to produce total dudes. Blissfully, Yash Chopra's interpretation of "Sleeping with the Enemy" is an extremely stylish and well-made film. <br /> <br /> Shah Rukh Khan is obsessed with Juhi Chawla (who looks great in it!). When he realized Juhi had a fiance in Sunny Deol, he stopped nothing to make sure she became her. <br /> <br /> Every frame of this movie is a pleasure to watch. Whether it's Shah Rukh's trademark. "I love you, K ... k ... k ... kiran!" or the feel-good, soft scenes between Sunny and Juhi (making a perfect match), you will not like to leave your boredom in boredom. <br /> <br /> Every song on the soundtrack is overnight, especially Jaadu Teri Nazar and Tu Mere Samne. As I said, Juhi looks like a Goddess in this movie. Darr may not be SRK's best film (this honor goes to Baazigar), but it is definitely one of his most flawed appearances! Sunny is OK. He has previously done similar roles, but he is good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Darr is g ... g ... g ... great! ;)
