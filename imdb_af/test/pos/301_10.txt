Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece was a great end to a golden decade of American cinema. In the 1970s, there was an atmosphere of tolerance, openness and progressivity among the studios that allowed the creation of large films by some of the best directors the United States ever had. I am not a historian, but all the events that preceded the decade (some are the violent deaths of important figures of American political and cultural scenes, the racial struggle, the rise of the counter-culture of the 1960s, the increase in violence and death in the streets ...) influenced the vision of filmmakers who were willing to venture, create and create entertaining and intelligent films. Coppola's film is a strange combination of humanistic thought and skillful film design, following the parameters of war and adventure films, and at the same time their fluent reflection on the value of life, the reason of death or the ethics of war. It is also a passionate work, written against all chances, written in the 1991 documentary "Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse". A film that went beyond any previous reflection on the Vietnam War ever to reach the screen. This may not be the definitive Vietnam movie, but Coppola has discovered the classic melodrama formula found in two Vietnam movies simultaneously, "The Deer Hunter" and "Coming Home" or in the latter as "Platoon" and "Victims of War" "before Vietnam became the starting point to make products of any genre, as a horror in" Jacob's Ladder ", or comedies such as" Good Morning, Vietnam ", under the more respect. Coppola had the courage to take that economic and political conflict as the backdrop of a search for answers to questions faced by someone every day, without betraying the dramatic consequences of that war.
