Hmm, is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and Mark-Paul Gosselaar's post, Saved By The Bell? Of course it's not right, it's ridiculous. And is it right to give this movie a '10' rating? Hahahahahaha ... it's funny. However, this movie was not so terrible; better than I expected to be. Made for TV movies is often so similar. So many of them have the same feel for them. This one has the same feel, but it worked, even if it was another tortured woman who had to get the b * star in the final story. Before it started, I got it. Thiessen regarded as a vixen-type 90210 seductress, but here she was as innocent as Kelly Kapowski was refreshing. Eric Close surprised me by playing his part very well. With a decent writing, the director got a pretty good convincing performance without him being almost cheesy. All in all, it was somewhat interesting, certainly better than most TV movies. My grade: B-
