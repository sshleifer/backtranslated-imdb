It's an unusual movie, because though it's made by Twentieth-century Fox, it's one of the few cups of Barbara Stanwyck and her future husband, Robert Taylor. Barbara Stanwyck made films for many different studios (RKO, Paramount and Selznick) about the time she made it. This is my case, but Taylor was an MGM contract player so he first appeared in this movie because he was loaned to Fox - something studios sometimes did during this era. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting because many real people have roles in the movie, although the piece is otherwise pure fiction. You'll see actors playing William McKinley, Teddy Roosevelt and Admiral Dewey. I can't remember a movie with McKinley or Dewey in it as a character, although I remember Roosevelt from THE WIND AND THE LEE and some other movies. Three cheers for seeing a "lesser president" in a movie as an important character! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with McKinley who takes a young lieutenant (Robert Taylor) away and asks him to be a special agent for him - and not tell anyone - not even the Secret Service. This is because the president fears that someone within the agency is a gang that makes a long series of robberies - all based on inside information. So it is Taylor (who is NOT known for his male roles - especially at this stage of his career) to stand as a goddess and to find the gang responsible AND the inner man. <br /> <br /> However, there are two serious complications. First, while he can find gang members, one of the gangster's step-sister is Stanwyck. Taylor finds that he fell in love with her, but he also has to do his duty and change it to the authorities. Secondly, because McKinley is the only other person who knows the truth, serious problems are developing when McKinley is killed and Taylor is on the death penalty for the crimes !!! <br /> <br /> The film has done a good job of creating a story and placing it in a historical context. While most people don't remember or remember McKinley today, the movie is in this interesting period. The play is pretty decent, as the stars are supported by Victor McLaglen and Brian Donlevy, although I have to admit that Donlevy's role was fairly soft and ordinary compared to many of his other role-plays. Overall, it's very interesting, well written and not too juicy in the romance department. A good outing for everyone.
