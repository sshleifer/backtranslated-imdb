About 12 minutes in the song, in the scene embracing Daryl Hannah and JFK Jr. for the first time, there is a very nice song. What is that song? And, who's being sung? This is a song that sounds very romantic and is a female singer, piano player, etc. I tried everything in the world for the music on Google and on iTunes, etc. Looking up, but it just doesn't come up. even on Lyrics sites. So, if you hear that, I'll be sure to know enough about it so I can try to get the CD with that song, or find it in iTunes. I don't know if my email address will be, I'm new to this ... but I'll look back here.
