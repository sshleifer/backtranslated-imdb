I remember hearing about this movie and how it played almost every entry theater in Toronto. It's about a group of girls who are not accepted by the other girls at their college, so they start their own and of course call it H.O.T.S. It's a fun movie, it's just bursting with a drive-in nostalgia! Many full-bodied t-shirts, vans, fighters, and a soccer match like no other! This is compared to "Animal House", which is a good movie, but it does not compare to H.O.T.S. It has its own brand of fun and character. If you are looking for a classic T n'A movie, look no further, because the H.O.T.S. girls are rescued, buoyant pants and everything!
