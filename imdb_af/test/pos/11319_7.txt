I lived most of my adult life in London before moving to stateide. This movie missed it when it came out and just saw it on HBO. I don't agree with anyone who thinks it should have been a Hollywood production. The British team gave it a cool and prosperous atmosphere on the first day and I wondered for 30 minutes at the edge of my seat and wondered what would happen to my home. City. And of course, nine months after the movie comes out, happen 7/7. Yes, the truth is strange as fiction. After living in both countries, it is also clear that the probability that this event in the United Kingdom is much greater than in the US, that Muslims live in ghettos and isolate themselves in the United Kingdom, assimilates them much more in the US readily.
