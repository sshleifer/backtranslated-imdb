I think Never Been Kissed was a great movie. The casting was really good and they performed very well. I really like Drew Barrymore and of course it was excellent. I was scared first because it said it didn't come out on video. Boy, I'm glad it's because it's a stupid movie. Check it out if you don't have it yet!
