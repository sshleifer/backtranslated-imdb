It may be a piece that explains it as a stubborn Carlin fan, but the material, both written and executed, in It's Bad for Ya, is still the best later material. By 70, Carlin retreats from the level of despair (and some of the obstacles in the act itself) out of life is worth losing to a specially structured, but loose and playful special or the like f *** "can get - and is constantly, unceasingly, funny. And funny as in the memory of what some of us did when we first looked back into the city or looked "sick". The material, even though sometimes sounds a part of the formerly done (ie the whole bit on kids in the school and camp like the children's segment in the sick), is always fresh and with such a truth slip to everything in the mind stick while (here) tickle the funny leg. <br /> <br /> Going out of the subject of death (how long to wait to scratch a name from the book? six weeks, unless on the computer scheduler) facets of communication, views from the sky , places of God (of course), children, and just awkward gestures that include hats in religion, and if people really have 'rights' make it the bulk of the special, especially around the premise that what is bad for you, simple and simple, is BS. Altogether, complete BS, which as we also learn (or if you've really learned it, you're like a child waiting in the street corner for a week and the parent hasn't randomly held) holding the country together. However, Carlin is not necessarily angry, even if it looks like contempt for most turns, even to see how frightening kids' teeth come. This is skepticism tinted with the feeling that everything will NOT be 'fine'. <br /> <br /> What this brings is this: Carlin is dirty, witty, alert-up comedy that Yoda is for Jedi everywhere, which is a small twinkle of hope through crystal clear wisdom in a world where it pretty damn hard to get any. At least we get classic GC - scandalous lines and pieces from the 13th (or 14th) comedy species, including the eyebrow observation of people playing Mozart music at birth!
