I anoint for the persecutors. I need something to stop me from going with so much tension, anxiety (which if not so good!) And constant lack of information. I need something to calm me down, something to pass the time, except, of course, The Matrix. It was just the thing. <br /> <br /> I found it informative (like the part about Keanu's neck ...) and some were funny. I plundered so much from Carrie-Anne when she said there was only one bathroom and all the guys. I just found one problem with that. Since 95% of the people were actually male, they just let their mouths go wild, and there was language in it. It's not as bad as The Shawshank Redemption's cussing runs, but that one scene was Keanu describing a bad day, plugging your ears if you're small. > <br /> <br /> It was entertaining and just what I needed. That's what all Matrix fans who go nuts have to keep quiet. They call a little bit about the persecutors, and someone almost gives away something, but he gets himself in time (shoot!). It gives you almost no spoilers, but it's great if you're a Matrix head like me. <br /> <br /> There is no spoon.
