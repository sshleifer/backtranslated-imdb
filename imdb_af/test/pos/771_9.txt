I felt that Rupert Grint had a lot of promise about the role everyone knows him. Although I've never heard of this movie, I immediately transferred to that channel when it appeared in my cable TV listings. I'm so glad I did! <br /> <br /> I've read from other reviewers that they generally don't like age stories; However, I do. I am one of those who is always obsolete; I was since I was 12, I'm 52 now, and I'm likely to continue until I'm 92. To be old is nothing more than to suddenly realize the possibilities of another day. The confusion of the realization, its scope, sometimes throws us in disarray. If we try to protect our delicate self, then yes, I can see how the coming age can end. But if we just emit ourselves and in the new direction we have discovered, then we are suddenly on a new path, and we are just as lively as we were yesterday, just stronger, brighter and I am more interesting. <br /> <br /> That's what this movie is about. It was an upcoming life story throughout; Young Ben, his father, Father Robert, and certainly Lady Evie ... all went through a wonderful transformation. In fact, Mr Fincham didn't? Although I suspect, except for the mother, despite her great opportunity to do so, provided by the events of the end of the film. The one remained with the feeling that she would continue on exactly the same path, but perhaps with another supportive role. <br /> <br /> Such an excellent film, which could possibly not be made in America, which is totally depressed to think, but thank God, we have a steady supply of films made elsewhere, we sometimes see. I highly recommend this movie, as long as you don't care, by shrinking the parts of us that we already know and by grinning the rest of them.
