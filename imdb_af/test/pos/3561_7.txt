A train holding union soldiers is transporting $ 300,000 gold, along with a banker Clayton, who is there to see it reach its destination, but it is suddenly robbed by the bandit Monetero. However, Bahunda cuts off the gold and hides it, but if Monetero tries to get it out, he is killed by soldiers. The only idea is that of a medal, but Monetero is captured and will be executed soon. A stranger, dressed as a priest, comes through (which goes to the abundance of Monetero) and offers to save his life for half the gold. In return, Monetero gave him half of the medal, but Clayton noticed it and discovered something was up. Soon, all three are crossing each other for the gold, but also the bank's insurance company and Monetero's gang are watching and waiting for their chance to push. <br /> <br /> Just look at the opening order, you'll know. come back for a spaghetti western with a tongue-in-cheek style and appeal to the sprinkling of many references (some well-realized) of other films (mainly the Dollar trilogy) of its subgenre. Director Enzo Castellari's speedy direction is vast and mostly lightweight, but there is potential in many of his large, attractive frames and smooth rhythmic fit. Largely there are a lot of clashes, fist battles (and many acrobatic stunts) that occur in comparison to total evil shootings. However, most of these stunts are very well done, and very pleasant and when the guns burn, there is energy to burn. The traditional story stick close to conventional details, but as it is very tempting and outspoken, the spontaneous nature makes sure you're never quite sure how it will eventually play between the three. This results in very effective exciting moments, smart turns and a lot of wink, wink. The humor in the starch writing is pretty clever. Conveniently under the light and rigid style, Giovanni Bergamini's dynamically solid framework and Francesco De Masi's impulsive music play. The performances are extremely well adapted and form a striking report. George Hilton's furious and curved turn is solid as the ambiguous stranger. Gilbert Roland brings class and intelligence to his formidable Mexican bandit Monetero. Edd Byrnes gives a good performance as Clayton, it does. Kareen O'Hara doesn't get much to do, but is a worthy viewer. Gerard Herter, Pedro Sanchez and Ivano Staccioli offer support. <br /> <br /> A fun and worthy spaghetti parody / tribute that throws one curb ball to another and very fertile a dirty antique.
