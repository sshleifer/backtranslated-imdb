You can come to the fair of this movie and say how it could not happen, or how can the main character just walk into offices and start with computers, etc. Without anyone noticing and really choosing the movie ... or you can just sit back with a bucket of popcorn and enjoy the story and the play. Personally, I prefer the latter, I live real life and watch the news with all his dream and gloom, and so it will be much more entertained by my movies, and seeing the bad parents get their fair rewards. Don't take it too seriously, and you can thoroughly enjoy this movie.
