I noticed that many people are launching Opera for the way Betty responds to the murders. I think they base these complaints on how they think a "normal" person will respond. The thing is ... Betty is not a "normal" person because of traumatic events in her childhood. She had problems long before the movie ever started ... and at the end of Opera ... in my opinion ... she was completely undisturbed. <br /> <br /> ------- -------------- destroyers -------------------- --------------- ---- You should keep in mind that when she was a very small child, she saw that her mother's lover at least made a brutal murder while her sadomasochistic mother comes to look at it. <br /> <br /> She was educated by a woman who reached sexual release, tied up to see how girls were cut, cut and strangled to death. It doesn't make for a healthy home life. I think it's pretty easy to establish that her mother has used all kinds of emotional manipulation and negative reinforcement to ensure that her daughter has never clipped on her. It is also likely that Betty could have been deeply confused at what she had seen at her impressive age. Is it just something adults do, etc. <br /> <br /> Of course, Betty looks at her mother ... I mean ... she's an opera singer, just like her. If mum likes it, it can't be bad, can it ... mum can't be bad, can she? She could not tell the police to her mum, or this mysterious canopy she associates with mum. <br /> <br /> Betty has many emotional problems. Her thoughts for years have been trying to make the memory of what she saw her mother ... but it keeps on the surface, which manifests itself in the form of terrible nightmares, skull-throbbing migraines, reliance on relaxation techniques, and sexual freedom She associates brutal violence / bloody death with sex on a subconscious level. There is an inner struggle between the part of Betty who has confused the murder / sex and the part of her who believes these things are wrong. <br /> <br /> After killing her boyfriend by the canopy man ... she calls the police but is not willing to give her name. The part of her who thinks murder is wrong forces her to make the call, but the part that is ambivalent will not allow her to recognize personal involvement. The ambivalent part of her takes control before she can go completely. So she goes away from the phone in the rain ... and when picked up by the director, she plays surprisingly calm, not as upset as you would think a "normal" person would be ... because the part of her what was The things she blocked were because she was trying to condemn a child to close the horror of what she had just seen. <br /> <br /> The state of her life contributes to a deadlock within Betty's psyche. Her singing career starts to bear fruit ... she will be a great opera singer like her mother. But is she going to be like her mother in every way? In the dark ways? Or will she be able to make her own way? Add it to the resurgence of the captain who killed everyone around her. <br /> <br /> It's not until Captain Daria kills Nicolodi's character that Betty really plays an active role in defeating the killer. Here's someone who loves Betty, who wholeheartedly supports her in her upcoming career, which is actually a mother figure in Betty's life since the mum's death. Imagine how terrible it would be to lose your real mom and then the woman closest to you should have a mother shot by the eyeball. <br /> <br /> I can go on ... but I won't. The key to what I say is that Betty's character is much more complex if most of the judges were willing to do so. <br /> <br /> Opera is one of Argento's best ... and not just for the visual arts (though they are really great) and not just for the inventive murders (though they are). Here's a depth ... and attention needs to be paid.
