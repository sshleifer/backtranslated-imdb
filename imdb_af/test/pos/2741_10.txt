If there is one cartoon that helped to place UPA on the map more than any other, it is Gerald McBoing-Boing. This story of a little boy who only speaks in sound effects has retained his charm for the past 57 years. Besides the effects, the music, the abstract animation and backgrounds, the narrative by Marvin Miller, almost loves everything. And it won the Oscar for the best animated short of 1950. Stay on YouTube after seeing this dr. Seuss story read. And Rocky and Bullwinkle creator Bill Scott also contributed, how wonderful! Hope to see the following shorts in the series, if not on YouTube, then maybe in a DVD collection. Now I think I'll see another UPA there shortly.
