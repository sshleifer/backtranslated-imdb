"Idiocracy" is the latest movie coming from Mike's "Office Space" judge, and it certainly follows a similar theme from that movie in the fact that it is a perception of stupidity and how mediocrity can overcome the presence. relatively speaking. It's a story about Joe Bauer (Luke Wilson), who is literally the most average man. Joe, and a prostitute named Rita (Maya Rudolph), become the test subjects for a military project of an Hibernate. They will be suspended for just one year, but due to the lack of review, Joe and Rita are forgotten about and accidentally wake up 500 years in the future. <br /> <br /> Here's the scary part: This film explains, in a very realistic and credible way, how the entire population of 2505 is completely delayed. With no natural predators, the evolution of the human species is not necessarily the fastest, smartest and strongest for the progression of genes. Only the people who breed the most. Unfortunately, these people are prosperous, trailer idiots breeding like rabbits. This abundant reproduction of the stupid people has had a detrimental effect on community growth, and now Joe and Rita are the two smartest people on the planet. If that helps, suggest the whole population as just a hybrid of redheads, jocks, cholos and hooves. See this nightmare dystopia, and teach Joe to find a time machine to see if he and Rita can come back when they come from, and that's basically the whole plot. <br /> <br /> But despite how one-dimensional I can make it sound, this movie is higher in appearance than you can understand. Nuances are everywhere and anyone can see a smile (warning signs, if you like) of the contemporary dumb ciety that permeates the facets of everyday life and turns it into the train wreck on display in "Idiocracy". The movie has some great showcases of realistic delay placed on a pedestal. I don't want to give away anything and ruin jokes for you, but let's just say it's pretty thorough. I can see how some would say it's just a lot of toilet noise, but it's strange, as it seems, a purpose; to show how stupid and crack these people are. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this movie is destined to see the same fate as its predecessor, "Office Space"; No one will see it in theaters, but everyone will be thrilled with the discovery of this wonderful / funny movie when it comes to video. My only complaint to the movie would be that the flow of the narrative is sometimes broken so they can do a Hitchhiker Guide-to-the-Galaxy type outline of how things should be where they are, but this is a necessary evil and is better implemented here. Other than that, good characters, funny jokes and better than average social commentary wrapped in a funny bow. <br /> <br /> Final Note: If we become our youth, gang-frightened-be redneck / ghetto trash and be proud of ... if you are educated and grown anyway and see how our country is In an abyss of stupidity disappear, for gods, look at this movie.
