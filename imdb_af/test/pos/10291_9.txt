Apartmente'L is one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen. I experienced severe frustration while watching this movie, because I was searching for the two that lead to reunification. It never happened in the end that made me no end. But the end gives a more cynical touch to a generally cynical film. It's not a movie that people probably want to see again, but one look itself will have a profound impact on people. From now on I haven't seen the movie again and I don't think I will. <br /> <br /> The story follows the experiences of a man, Max, who is engaged to be married to Muriel. He remembers his old friend Lisa (he regards it as the love of his life), as he accidentally listens to Lisa talking on the phone. So he tries to find Lisa. Here she starts off with extremely frustrating quest for Lisa. There are many layers in this movie. There are undercurrents of jealousy, voucherism and so on. There is also another character called Alice who is involved in the whole confusion. The movie then moves through a whole series of coils and eventually leads to an end that can be interpreted in many ways. It's amazing how this movie has only four main characters, but the clever writing makes it interesting and unique. What I love about the fact is that a movie about obsession, jealousy is done in such a light way. It has a very fast pace, which is probably the reason why it can appeal to a large audience. The main character, Max, has gray shades and I felt the end was perfect. I don't think he should be a clean character, as he is looking for his lost love while he is engaged and he also has a flirt with Alice. <br /> <br /> The character of Alice is even worse. Her manipulation and her coercion can really irritate viewers (that's the point, I think). The scene where she breaks down Lucien, really shows another facet of her character. It shows a side of her that wants to be accepted and that she is tired of all the lies and games and she wants to live a normal life. Eventually she understood that she had to get away from everything. The end gives a cynical touch. Because it looks like Max's love for Alice is temporary and fake. It's as if to say that love is generally a temporary emotion and it's better to choose the safe option (ie, Muriel) than to do something so quick (ie Lisa or Alice). In many ways, it's not really a romantic movie, but a satire about romance (in a way). <br /> <br /> The performances deserve high praise. Vincent Cassel and Max give a good performance. He portrays the confusion of a man who is not really sure about his involvement. Its geeky look is an added benefit as it fits perfectly with the character. But the real star of the movie is Romane Bohringer as Alice. Her animated depiction of a woman who is jealous of Alice and in love with Max. The scene where she also screamed, "I'm also a wrench", really shows her despair and her desire to live a normal life with a man who loves her. <br /> <br /> VAT I also thought lesbianism is another interpretation that can be drawn from this movie. Alice's actions can be explained in many ways. And her unreasonable obsession with Lisa can also be explained as a manifestation of a lesbian desire. It may be far-fetched because she encouraged Lisa to forgive her current boyfriend. But I had the feeling that she had been lesbian for a long time. She also avoided Lisa's questions about a boyfriend. She spends a lot of time with Lisa and she is happy at that time. It can lead to questioning her sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> Overall, I'll give it a 9/10. I think it deserves it, but I pulled it off because of the revival factor. I think it's a perfect movie differently.
