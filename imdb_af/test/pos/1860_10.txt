I believe the reason why this movie didn't receive the recognition it deserves is because of the many misconceptions of Darwin, pro and con. I would say the true man is portrayed here without sterility. He is what he is. Although the movie is a snapshot of the man, the storytelling technique has expanded his life well beyond the years of the movie. It is a deep film, a consideration of modern life and the way we think and elaborate a study for the man whose thoughts (and others who used him) definitely influenced our lives. There are some movies that the historical context is so great that it is the actors' primary work to stay out of the way. History had the day and the actors did their job. Good work for them, I say.
