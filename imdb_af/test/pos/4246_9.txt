The movie starts with a board meeting at a major advertising agency. Putney Swope is on the board for no reason other than being black, and the agency needs a token on the board. Swops ignore the meeting, read the Jet magazine at the big table and all ignore Swope. Suddenly, the CEO is on the scene. No time was wasted. An attorney is requested to pick up the corpse, and the board immediately and uncertainly deals with the election of a new CEO. And since the voices are counted one by one, the tension is built up and then finally stripped into a hilariously ironic climax. This gives the viewer a nice dish with logical implications to enjoy the rest of the movie. If you've ever returned to some silly television commercial, you'll love to see this movie. Badly there is not a real Putney Swop in the world.
