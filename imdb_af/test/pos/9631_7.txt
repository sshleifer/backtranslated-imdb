It seems like all people didn't like Steven Seagal. Just look at his nomination list. There are only razzie awards (with one victory) for him, but I think he didn't deserve anything. I saw good movies with Steven Seagal, I saw bad movies with Steven Seagal. And THE PATRIOT (1998) is one of his best movies, almost as good as UNDER SIEGE (1992) or HARD TO KILL (1990). THE PATRIOT shows its activities to protect nature. Certainly, this movie is not a good one, and I have to say there is more violence than I want, and why should Seagal's best friend, L. Q. Jones, die the death of a victim? The role of dr. McClaren is one of Seagal's best achievements. He has, as always, a very good charisma. And in summary, the PATRIOT is good entertainment and with an average score of only 4 points the most underrated movie of all time. <br /> <br /> Greetings, Hans-Dieter
