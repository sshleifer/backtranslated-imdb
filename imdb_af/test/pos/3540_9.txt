I must say when it comes to Book to Movie Adaptations the BBC rarely let me down. Now about this mini series. I love the Starling Novel, it's by far the best murder / mystery I've ever read. The Mini series, it made my day challenging when I saw it. The primary story was kept almost intact. The characters fit one after the novel very well, the personalities and ways were up for Red and Jez. I thought Duncan was doing very well, like Kate, Eric came across as too much of a simplistic character, he had a little more depth in the book, but they also changed his sub-story, which might have to deal with it. Of course there are changes, but most are cosmetic, but some I found were the sub-story with Eric's murder order, and that changed the whole dynamic between Red and Eric for the movie and they did the Triathalon training Jez. . Some of the other events in the book are changing to be viewer-friendly. If you like the book, you will like it, if you like the mini-series, then you will like the book. I have to say, this is the most accurate book after movie adaptation I've seen.
