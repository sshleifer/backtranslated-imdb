Ann-Margret did the best work she ever did in her history of filmmaking. I felt like she was Mrs. Frey was. There may be one or two films by Ann-Margret that I haven't seen since 1961 since her movie debut in "Pocket full of Miracles" with Betty Davis. I feel she's totally underestimated in the industry. Although she was nominated for an Emmy award for this role in "Who will love my children," she was overlooked. Just as she was nominated for an Oscar for her roles in "Carnal Knowledge" and "Tommy", she was killed. All in all I think everyone has done a wonderful acting job, including all the kids in "Who will love my children." Yes, it's a sad movie (like real stories can be) but worth the time. Thank you.
