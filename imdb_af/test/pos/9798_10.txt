Young Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are outstanding in this excellent two-boy movie that has promised to care for their mother and how they cope when their new stepfather starts hitting the younger boy. The supporting role for the boys is also great. The scripture is really in the mind and heart of an imaginative child. It's hard to believe. Wood can grow up to watch anything like Tom Hanks, but it's nothing new in Hollywood. It is honestly my only criticism of the film.
