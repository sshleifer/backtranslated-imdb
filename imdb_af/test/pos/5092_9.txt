30 years after the original film, "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" was transmitted as a musical. Peter O'Toole and Petula Clarke die in this wonderful remake of the beloved schoolmaster, Chippington, who is called by his beloved wife Chips. <br /> <br /> O'Toole was excellent here and received another Oscar nomination. You have to wonder what Peter O'Toole must do to win an Oscar. He lost the coveted award 8 times. You also have to wonder that in 1969 he lost to John Wayne for "True Grit", which was actually proof of Mr Wayne's long career and popularity. This year was also marked by good performances by Richard Burton, "Anne of the Thousand Days", as well as Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight for "Midnight Cowboy." <br /> <br /> Surprised to see Petula Clarke as Mrs. Chippington. However, as it was a musical, a beautiful voice came in well and she also did a good piece of acting. <br /> <br /> Who can forget the scene when Chips is in class, despite the news that his loved ones have been killed in a bombing. He never told her the wonderful news of his pending promotion. <br /> <br /> The stunning cinematography and music has just made a memorable experience.
