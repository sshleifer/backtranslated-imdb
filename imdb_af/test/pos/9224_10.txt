People talk about how terrific the screenplay was and how horrible the animation was, but Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer are really a Japanese anime targeting kids. Looking at the anime today, it's done in the same style, and it's very popular. I don't think this movie was ever meant to be seen by adults. Just as I don't think it was ever meant to be serious. The things people hate about this movie are the things I love. Rainbow Brite is one of the best cartoon characters I've ever created. She's smart. She's funny. She cares about the improvement. She cares for her friends. This movie can teach so much to young children. My little brothers even love this movie. I must say this movie taught me a lot when I was a kid. When it came to DVD, I was first in line to buy it. It's a great children's movie. So, if it's not perfect, nothing really is perfect if you look good enough.
