The year 2004 was the year of the biopsy with no less than four photos that take true events, real people, with varying degrees of critical praise. Of the four photos to make the Oscars for the Oscars early in 2005 (KINSEY, THE AVIATOR, HOTEL RWANDA and RAY), RAY won the night. The acting award went to Jamie Foxx for his portrayal of R & B genius Ray Charles. <br /> <br /> And it was well deserved despite the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio came close and Liam Neeson was not even nominated. What made Foxx the winner was that the other two played relatively dark eccentrics. Ray Charles still made music until his death in 2004 and then there was no soul who knew at least one song that Charles wrote. It helped Jamie Foxx rise well above the movie - herself as a little bit weak and often looks like it's not a TV-biopic product - and his portrayal is detailed because it's cruel. He has the delicate command to embody a person for nuance. And as soon as the crisis of Ray's addiction to heroin hits a head, Foxx eats up and it's not hard to think that the real Ray is actually through such a painful trial. <br /> <br /> The low point of the film is how it spends a little too much time detailing Ray's relationship with women. Like the aviator, Taylor Hackford wants to find out that Ray has had this turbulent life, a product of his own demons, and his entry into success at a time when he was black and successful brought a large amount of luggage. Of the women, the only one who succeeds in succeeding, Sharen Warren is Ray's mother. Her is a difficult role as she is alone on the screen with the children's actor playing young Ray, but her face and body language is frightening, especially at the moment she has to give up her labor so that Ray can move around the house get. Such intensity of emotion, standing there and watching your blind son crawl over a room and forcing him to have this rude awakening in independence. A beautiful display and one to be recognized. <br /> <br /> A great counterpoint for RAY is the featured music. Anyone who knows R&B will enjoy the early recordings of Ray's radio hits as much as his later ones would bring him to the forefront of popular music, and Jamie Foxx puts the show up almost steeply while performing the songs as Ray. It alone will live, even when the movie itself is little more than a stiff biopsy. However, I would love it if they used his previous Adult Contemporary hit 1993, "Sing my Song for You" in the closing credits. After all, it is Ray Charles, an artist who had a keen commitment to his art.
