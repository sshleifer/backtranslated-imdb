In the tradition of "neo" film noir flicks such as "Chinatown", this film focuses on a crime mystery in a dark area with a little character insight mixed. The typical noir characters, including the cop, to prove himself, a girl in distress and a bad, bad guy. Sharky's Machine gets a 9 out of 10 for his cinematography first, plus his direction, story, strong character acting and excellent jazz score. Available on DVD, although the soundtrack itself is out of print (but available on some auction sites). On the spot in the beautiful downtown Atlanta (the novelist Diehl's hometown) and the unspoilt, about 1979 city view, an old Atlanta citizen or visitor would have long before the old days before 12-lane interstates overtake, a filmmaker's dream at that time. It was Rachel Ward's first US feature film.
