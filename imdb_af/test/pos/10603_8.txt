I didn't know what to expect from this. I always considered Bam Margera and the CKY team dedicated a team of heads to do stupid things for entertainment. I didn't know they could act. But everyone who performed in this movie had good performances. The hilarity of the 'aaaaagh!' scene blends with Ryan Dunn's depression and his revenge against his ex-girlfriend perfectly. Sometimes the scenes seem senseless, but at the same time it's funny. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good laugh, but this movie may not appeal to those who prefer the detailed story lines and a series of twists and turns.
