One day I caught it on television when I was young and loved it. In the 1970s, there were a lot of lame comedies trying too hard to be funny, so it was a nice surprise. This is one of the best comedies of the 1970s and the definite summer camp comedy thanks to Murrary's excellent comic performance, which is still one of his greatest. This is the movie that really saw Ivan Reitman as a director. Reitman shows with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time. While this movie is hilarious and MIRROR 2 are so bad that it is fun, MEAT BALLS 3 and MEAT BALLS 4 are absolutely horrible. Recommended for those who enjoyed STRIPES and GHOSTBUSTERS.
