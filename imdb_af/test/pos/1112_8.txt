We see a man moving from city to outside, and changing dramatically. His family asks questions, but he gets angry. <br /> <br /> Strange, brilliant movie for screening here in Israel. Wonderful places, big actors, a movie that is mutilated as a "thriller", but it is more a case study of madness in the chief. <br /> <br /> The film was far above the other movies that were part of the AICE festival here in Israel. Good luck to the team that came to this movie. It's a Grand Guignol, a small noir masterpiece. <br /> <br /> My only "10" criticism is that the sound and music are sometimes overwhelming. It tends to get away from the images that speak for themselves.
