Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) and dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) was hired by the British government for a Swiss scientist, dr. Protecting Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.). He has a bomb that the British want to win the war. Unfortunately, the evil dr. Moriarty (Lionel Atwill) with the Nazis. He won't stop getting the doctor - and his invention. <br /> <br /> The shift from Sherlock Holmes to the 1940s sounded like a stupid idea, but it works for one reason - Basil Rathbone. Probably he's the BEST Sherlock Holmes ever put on the screen. He plays the character so well (and accurately) that it doesn't matter what era he solves crimes. As for Nigel Bruce as Watson ... everyone has problems with that. He's playing Watson as an old guy ... it's NOT the Watson of the books. You seriously wonder why Holmes came up with him. Yet he grows in you (in a way). Then there is a Whale of Whale playing Moriarty. The conversations and struggles between him and Holmes are just fantastic! I never liked Dennis Hoey as inspector Lestrade - he is such an idiot. Let Watson look like a genius. And Post Jr. is pretty good like Tobel (though his accent remains amusing!). <br /> <br /> This movie is done thoroughly and runs just over an hour. Yet it does have slow patches and I never understand the secret code section. <br /> <br /> Still worth catching just for Rathbone and Atwill.
