Well, I expected, for all the hype and Oscar nominations, an epic Civil War drama (and something with the "size" of the "English Patient" who gave the same director). This movie is not of epic stature, but it seems I was relieved it wasn't. It is a love story in the midst of the horrors of the war where young men are sent out to fight. Deserters are traced and killed. The women and children at home are left to defend themselves while the men are gone. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I thought Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger were pretty decent and didn't know much about Jude Law. He was also right. It seems as if Rene Z had the best part of the 3 leaders and could play a lively, varied housewife with a big aplomb. It was also good for me to see actress Kathy Baker ... someone's talent needs to be recognized / recognized. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth seeing - I can't articulate why really, but maybe because it's a piece of Americana. <br /> <br />
