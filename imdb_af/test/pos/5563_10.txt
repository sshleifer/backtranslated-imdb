One of the biggest crimes against Sci-fi television was the cancellation of Farscape. One of the most well-written, well-intentioned and all-round shows to ever enjoy the airwaves, sets new standards for sci-fi television. Once the flagship, the highest rated show of the Sci-Fi channel has been criticized, it explains how performances such as Buffy, Tremors: The Series and even StarGate: SG-1 lasted as long as they did. Yes, even Buffy. But I'll save my Buffy bashing for another time. Farscape was poorly treated by the Sci-Fi channel, constantly swept around in scheduling, rarely shown and never really advertised. But while the show was canceled, everyone involved in the show's production wants to bring back the performance (even the CEO of Henson Company Brian Henson). There is also an extensive fan-based movement to bring the view back. Overall things look far from dark, and hopefully fans will get their season 5.
