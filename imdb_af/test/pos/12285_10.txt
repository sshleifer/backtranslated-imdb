Obviously, this movie's value goes far beyond the cost of the format (mini-dv). In fact, the filmmaker embraces the format and incorporates it so cleverly into the storyline that I forgot the fact that I didn't see the typical 35 millimeter film. It has the core appeal of indie movies like Clerks & the work of Robert Rodriguez combined with a fantastic "new take" on the romantic comedy genre. "It's not a movie" is an honest movie with honest portrayals and it's a fantastic story. There is not one point in this movie where I feel that a scene (or had to) was omitted. On the contrary, the director draws incredible performances from truly gifted actors and does so in extremely restrictive circumstances. From page to screen, this movie is a worthy and appropriate story that strikes on so many levels (creative, technical or otherwise). I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a cinema or those who are looking for a bit of charm in an otherwise non-charming setting.
