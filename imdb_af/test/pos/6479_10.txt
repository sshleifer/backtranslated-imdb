You don't have to be a Notre Dame football fan to enjoy it because I'm not .... but as a football winner in general it was nice to watch. It almost made me a fighting Irish. If you can't get into the emotion in this movie or not, you can better monitor your wrist as it is an emotional movie with some very pleasant scenes. <br /> <br /> As a sports lover, I loved the classic footage of early college games. They had some pretty wild plays, then with many lateral ones. They have mastered the footage with Pat O'Brien, such as Knute Rockne on the sidelines and some of the players, like George Gipp (Ronald Reagan). <br /> <br /> Reagan gets pretty good billing in this movie, but its part isn't really that big. O'Brien is the only actor with a big role in this. The rest - everyone plays beautiful characters - includes Gale Page as Rockne's wife "Bonnie;" Donald Crisp, as the Notre Dame's "Father John Callahan;" Albert Bassermann as chemistry professor "Father Nieuwland" and Reagan, as Gipp, perhaps Notre Dame's most talented and well-known player ever. <br /> <br /> What this movie is beautiful balances the personal story with the football. No corner is overdoing. The characters here in all the people you can root for, because there are no villains. On my last look it was interesting to discover Johnny Sheffield - Tarzan's son - Rockne at age seven and see George Reeves, TV's Superman, as one of the players. <br /> <br /> There were a lot of football movies made in Hollywood for some reason, and some precious things. This is one of them.
