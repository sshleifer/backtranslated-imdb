Good animation, nice character design and a light story make Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu enjoyable to watch. <br /> <br /> After my first look, I thought this anime was pretty good, but it was much better for a second watch. <br /> <br /> This is because it is done in chronological order, and once you see it in the correct order, you see connections that you haven't seen before. (OR it may be that you see a second meaning for some events you haven't seen before). Perhaps you want to see the original novels (not manga) by Tanigawa Nagaru before / after it. The anime is very good at visualizing every detail in the stories it shows. <br /> <br /> However, there are short stories from the book that are not animated, but are referred to. (Bamboo w / wishes shown attached In episode 14) Overall, this anime is actually very good once after brief analysis of the plot (read the book also improved). It's a nice break from the Shounen-Jump anime that apparently takes over.
