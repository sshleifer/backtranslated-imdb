The story told by The Cranes is Flying is not, yet, the original. Young lovers are separated by war; Bad things happen to both. We've seen it many times. <br /> <br /> However, we did not see it well, with brave shots taking liberties to emphasize separation, or destruction or hopelessness. More and more remarkable comes from the Soviet Union, and the reason for deciding that Tarkovsky is not the last word in modern Soviet theater. <br /> <br /> I was the Chekhov's "Three Sisters" the day and read what the meaning of the title of this movie might be. In Law 2, Masha says that we must live our lives without meaning or understanding: <br /> <br /> "MASHA: Surely man must believe in something or at least seek truth, otherwise life is merely emptiness, emptiness. To live and not to know why the taps are flying, why children are born, why there are stars in the air, or you need to know why it lives, or everything is trivial - just senseless nonsense. " <br /> Also, Veronika has a hard time believing that the war, and her and others' suffering, was useless. Better to give meaning, to live as if your life is significant, and not to despair. It may be this thought that asks her for her final act in the film. <br /> <br /> VAT as a small correction for another comment here - there may be a pattern of V's in the movie, although I didn't have it I didn't notice them myself. But the first letter of Veronika's name is not a further example of this; In the Cyrillic alphabet her name starts with a letter that looks like an English "B".
