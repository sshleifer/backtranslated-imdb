I don't really know why this movie received such hostile reception when it was first released. Certainly, it's about long and somewhat gratuitous in his portrayals of sexuality and violence, but so are very well-rated movies. I don't seriously think the people who hated "Hemelshek" really understood it. "Heaven's Gate" in its rough form, much like "The Deer Hunter", shows the gross differences of an insecure and dangerous life (such as the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming) and living in comfort and privilege (like the established Americans) Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue. Living a hard life is painful, but it can also be refreshing as opposed to the dull life that Averil is leading in the epilogue, as did Michael Cimino's great effort picture is fascinating as a document of (and perhaps accusing) American life in Old West Wyoming, the dialogue is often clever and emotional, combined with good music and cinematography, the movie works like a Real Poetic Artwork Admittedly, "Heaven's Gate", with the refusal to protect the viewer, is not for all tastes, but Hollywood shows so many commercial drinks every year, which is so much easier to dismiss as a scary cake (even ifan example being a blockbuster), that "Gate" and Cimino really deserve more respect. All people should see the one-time version at least once and then they should make up their own minds. <br /> <br />
