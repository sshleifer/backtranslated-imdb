One of the BEST movies I've seen for a long time. Bechard has a way of looking at things that are completely unique and this film does not disappoint. <br /> <br /> This movie takes you guessing and with the seemingly taboo topics being addressed, it keeps you stuck on the screen. There are no bad guys or good guys, Bechard sure. The characters are so completely complex, you feel for each one of them, you care about what they have gone through. <br /> <br /> Bechard's use to pay attention to detail is unparalleled in this world of "FAST FOOD MOVIES" and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable - you like the feeling it gives you. <br /> <br /> I heard it said too often that there are NO new stories to tell. Thank you, Gorman Bechard, for proving it false. <br /> <br /> Start, walk, watch this movie.
