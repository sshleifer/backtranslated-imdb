There are many factors involved in comedy to work: <br /> <br /> 1. Don't be afraid to take risks. 2. If someone or something deserves to be fun, do it and do it, <br /> <br /> ... but especially: <br /> <br /> 3. Be fine! <br /> <br /> "The Chaser's War on Everything" succeeds in all three things. In fact, the show was so popular and so funny that a DVD of the first season was released only months after it was the first episode. I picked it up within days after it was released and laughed and had so much fu. I have tears in my eyes. This is so good, good! <br /> <br /> In short and to save me Over the show, watch it, buy it, podcast it, which will make you look at the best show in the world !!!!! <br /> <br /> Go the CHASER !!!!
