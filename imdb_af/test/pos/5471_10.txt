I'm from Texas and my family flew to Sante Fe a few years ago with my brother. He suggested we see the church with the stairs. I was absolutely blown away by the miracles that took place there. The movie is wonderful - Barbara Hershey and William Petersen were perfect for the parts they played. It is wonderful, absolutely wonderful. If you haven't seen the stairs personally, it's worth the trip to see. The wood is beautiful and the architecture is amazing. Just being in the chapel gives me goose bumps! To read about the history of the chapel, and then to see its beauty is breathtaking. See the movie - this is GREAT! Then look the staircase personally!
