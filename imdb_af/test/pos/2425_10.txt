This movie requires a lot of patience. As it focuses on mood and character development, the plot is very simple and many of the scenes take place on the same set - in the Frances Austen apartment (the Sandy Dennis character). But the film builds to a disturbing climax. <br /> <br /> The characters create an atmosphere of sexual tension and psychological deception. It is very interesting that Robert Altman did it, taking into account the style and structure of his other films. Still, the brand Altman is clear-cut here and there. I think what really makes this movie work is the brilliant performance by Sandy Dennis. It's definitely one of her dark characters, but she plays it so perfectly and convincingly that it's scary. Michael Burns does a good job as the "dumb" young man. Regular Altman player Michael Murphy has a small role. The solemn, moody set fits the content of the story very well. In short, this film is a powerful study of loneliness, sexual oppression and despair. Be patient, enjoy the atmosphere and take note of the wonderful writing. <br /> <br /> I praise Robert Altman. This is one of his many films dealing with unconventional, engaging subject matter. This movie is disturbing, but it is sincere and it is sure to provoke a strong emotional response from the viewer. If you want to see an unusual movie, some may even say bizarre. It is worth the effort. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, finding video stores is very difficult. You may purchase it from the internet.
