If you believe a given war film can make you feel like you really feel the war, you should see "The Cranes Flying". It tells the story of Veronika (Tatiana Samoylova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov), who fall in love with the verge of World War II. They walk along the waterfront and watch the cranes fly when the war begins. Boris is immediately sent to the war. Veronika hides with a family and ends with the boy she doesn't love. Boris, meanwhile, continues through the countryside, fights the Nazis and experiences all the horrors of war until he runs out of energy. When Veronika - working in a military hospital - receives this news, she refuses to accept it until Boris's body arrives at one of the trains. At the same time, the radio announces that Germany has surrendered and the Allied forces won the war; The Soviet Union has lost 27 million citizens, but it is the beginning of a new era. <br /> <br /> This movie did a very good job not only showing the human impact of the war in the battlefield but also how it affected it. the civilian population. This is definitely a movie everyone should see.
