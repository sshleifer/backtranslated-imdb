I loved this movie completely, trying to buy it and couldn't find it. a must see, a movie you can watch again and again, funny but also a tear in one. very good album for the movie. It's a very good 80 movie, I wish I could get a copy to buy this movie, because I would have acted very well in this. There are many people out there who are probably related to this movie. That's what makes film so good. So go out and try to rent this one, you won't regret it. It's an older movie, but it's worth watching. I won't be surprised if they made a remake of this movie soon, but I'm sure it won't be the same. Anyone who has not seen it will rent it.
