Look at "Plots with a View" (called "Undertaking Betty" in the US), I have the feeling that more movies should be filmed in Wales. This one depicts a woman (Brenda Blethyn) in a small Welsh city to get away from her fake man. So, she and the funeral manager (Alfred Molina) come up with a plan ... but there are probably some glitches along the way. <br /> <br /> I would actually say that Christopher Walken's character is the nicest in the movie (how could he not be?). But overall, the whole idea is just a very neat one, stacked with a few "oh oh" moments ... especially the haunted house. This is the kind of movie I wish I could enter just to experience it. <br /> <br /> Also with Lee Evans, Naomi Watts and Miriam Margoyles.
