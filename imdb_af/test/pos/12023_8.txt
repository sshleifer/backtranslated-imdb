Note: I have tried not to give away any important plot twists (or the end), but if you are worried about it, please consider reading the movie before reading further. Thank you! <br /> <br /> Of course, this was a fairly high budget production, which Paramount issued. The story follows the (so-called real) exploitation of loudspeaker Jack Shepard in 1700's London. He was a locksmith who, in the life of crime, was deterred by the atrocious 'Thief-Taker' to save his brother's life. After cruising the Dove-Taker, we become a kind of Robin Hood-type figure and get the support of the ordinary people. He continues to get rid of several prisons (including the infamous Newgate), as well as the time to entertain many noble ladies. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie, although the plot was a bit predictable. The film was shot in Glencree and Wicklow Ireland and the sets were very well done and were realistic. I think Clavell took the lively atmosphere of London well in the 1700s and I enjoyed his creative use of camera angles. And unlike many films depicting this period, Clavell does not push us to live the deplorable conditions in which the poor live (in one scene several people are fighting over a meat pie thrown into the street by dirt). <br /> Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. I would admit that it lacks the wonderful scenery and underlying political comment that Clavell's next film The Last Valley (a parable for the Vietnam War) has, but it still deserves a show or two. It is a pity that it has never (on my knowledge) been released on video or DVD.
