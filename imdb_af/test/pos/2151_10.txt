I was fortunate to see this movie at the Seattle Film Fest show, and was blown away by how good it was. This is without a doubt one of the best music documentaries I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot!) It's a loving look at the life and times, music and relationships of one of the true legends of music. Harry Nilsson deserves to be there with Gershwin, Cole Porter, and all the other great songwriters of the 20th century standards. He was considered a counterpart to all four members of the Beatles, who all called him a 5th Beatle, and one the same wavelength as themselves. <br /> <br /> Harry refused to tour, so many today remember him, and those born after his boom are unaware of who he was. It's tragic. Everyone should have the opportunity to be exposed to this wonderful talent. This movie is a step in the right direction to finally pay the man. Unfortunately, the movie still has a wide spread, or even a DVD, so far, lucky to see it. <br /> <br /> If you are someone who has the power to put together a DVD distribution, please contact the movie makers. This movie should be available. Hey VH-1, how about the screen on the air, then it might be on DVD? Harry Nilsson deserves nothing less.
