Being too late and short on vocabulary, I will describe this film as "beautiful and heartbreaking" and beg for forgiveness from those who fall into such clich√©s. Robin Tunney is a wonderful work depicting a young woman in the clutches of tourette's syndrome. Her character was absolutely sincere and convincing, and I will follow her career wherever it goes because of this movie.
