After watching this movie, I experienced a new sensation. I watched a movie in which the main actor sat in a show that played almost against the legend Chevy Chase in 'Fletch'. This is not to say that the performances are comparable, but both provide virtually flawless delivery of their lines. That actor is Marc Singer! Singer is Jack Ford, the "Droid Gunner" of the title, which collects a life that collects the bounty on androids. There are a few mutants, topless pleasure dryers (!), A Scandinavian smuggler and possibly a half-hearted attempt to make a statement about the class or maybe even globalization or ......... well, it doesn't matter no. What is important to this movie is the dry way Singer delivers his lines, leading to clown humor! What is important to this film is that director, Fred Olen Ray, realizes that serious sci-fi rarely works, and if your budget is insane, it is better not to take yourself seriously. Olen Ray said everyone involved in this movie had a lot of fun and these transfers on the film. I dare criticize a movie that allows him to portray futuristic Earth as ever dark and neon light and then end up in a pipe and valves' warehouse. Self-parody is a very redeeming quality. To summarize, Fred Olen Ray is an independent film production ambassador and Marc Singer is the perfect B-movie. If only Olen Ray in Tim Thomerson were able to draw the comparison, we would have a movie on our hands.
