It was a random rental at the video store. But I was impressed from the beginning. Wooden camera is a jewel of a second feature by a director. The film captures very informative moments and several often temporary frustrating and complicated social interactions will experience young interracial friends in a modern post apartheid South Africa. The young actors are pretty good and well-oriented in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is, of course, interesting. The film is rich in visuals that provide a framework for deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clich√©s. The musical score to the film adds body to the film without being intrusive. After watching the second time, I found the DVD on Amazon and have been happy since.
