Another masterpiece that needs a DVD edition, but some libraries have the VHS and are worth looking out for. Just a brilliant game about many things, especially euthanasia, "respect", religion and fundamental human relationships. The writing effectively uses intelligent humor not only to deal with a problem such as a severely disabled child, but to bind the parents in their love for Jo and each other. If the couple, Alan Bates and Janet Suzman are perfectly matched to both acting virtuosity and bringing their deep, intelligent characters to life. <br /> <br /> I recently saw Bates's brilliant performance in Butley released as a movie a few years after "Joe Egg" and he plays a teacher in both cynical, intellectual and funny, though Butley has a lot of is darker than his character Bry here. If you throw such a good performance in "The Go-Between", "Women in Love", "Whistle Down the Wind", "The Caretaker" and "Georgy Girl", not the more obvious King of Hearts not to mention and "Zorba the Greek", and I want to say that Alan Bates had a career comparable to Peter O'Toole, Albert Finney and the other great British actors of his era. <br /> <br /> Director Peter Medak also released one of my all-time favorites "The ruling class" the same year (1972) as "Joe Egg", which contains a career year in someone's book. He had a spicy filmography ("The Krays" was another highlight), but these two jewels will mark him as a good director.
