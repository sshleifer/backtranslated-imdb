Harry Langdon's "Saturday afternoon" is often regarded as one of the biggest quiet comedies, at least where short subjects are busy, and so it can be a bit of a deviation. Unlike some of the other well-known classical artists such as Keaton's "Cops" or Chaplin's "The Immigrant", this film is in some ways a well-known, conventional situation-comedy and does not offer much in the way of stomach loss. One can even wonder if Langdon belongs to such a rare company. Yet, in my opinion, it's a very charming comedy on its small key, and Harry is fascinating to watch. <br /> <br /> For a modern viewer who is on television sitcoms, the plot of "Saturday afternoon" may suggest The Honeymooners or his many spin-offs: two-dimensional guys, one of whom is married and many among his wife thumb, try for a fun afternoon with some good-time girls sneak; But everything goes wrong, and they end up fighting the girls' tough old boyfriends. Does this sound familiar? And maybe a little sad? Well, the point of departure was already made when this film was made, but nothing about Langdon was typical about it. He was strange, starting with the fact that he looked like a middle-aged baby who was half asleep. Any Freudians who catch "Saturday afternoon" will have a field day with the scenes between this rogue, pudgy-faced baby man and his strict, gently dominating mum wife. If Harry tries to hide money underneath the mat, but takes action and forces him to surrender it. You will swear to see an interaction between a 6-year-old boy and his Mama. . . and maybe that's why Harry Langdon crawled the people and still does. <br /> <br /> But he's a compelling screen figure, and that's not what he does the way he does. For example, in that scene with the coins underneath the mat, Harry gets the coins to be placed one foot in front of the other, carefully, like a puller, counting down his paces until he gets the right place and his technique is hypnotic. Langdon does not move like anyone else. Whether he makes you laugh, the man is fascinating, apparently in his own world. Where the plot of his films is concerned, Harry is strangely passive and he never runs the story forward. In the final of Saturday afternoon, when the big fist fight takes place, Harry's co-star, Vernon Dent, is in the thick of the action, but Harry has long been confused and makes a kind of punch-drunk between two cars (sit on the running sign of one, but with its feet on the other side as they walk through the streets. This is a memorable image, and as critic Walter Kerr wrote, it perfectly captures Langdon's peculiar person: he is a passive figure that somehow finds himself in the middle of angry action, blinking while the world is passing by. It is also noteworthy that Langdon and Dent, who worked together on a regular basis, have a report in this movie indicating that Laurel & Hardy will be following a blueprint when they have joined together a year or so. Langdon's style was a likely influence on Stan Laurel, especially here. <br /> <br /> "Saturday Afternnon" and his star may not be for everyone, but the movie is a good idea and you might find that Langdon makes an impression that is hard to shake.
