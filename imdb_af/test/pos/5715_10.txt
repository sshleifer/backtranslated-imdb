This one man show can be the most amazing show I've ever seen. To name it simply is a sincere act to make it a great injustice. There is a definite reason that it was a Broadway show. John Leguizamo is a master to make people of every culture feel at home and listen to his story of growing up and dealing with his family and life in general. I would recommend this show to everyone, as long as they can handle the language.
