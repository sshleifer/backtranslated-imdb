Okay, so maybe the impersonations of Jay Leno and David Letterman are not up to date, but you still get a sense of who these people are and how they work behind the screen. Bob Balaban and Treat Williams are excellent as Warren Littlefield and Micheal Ovitz. <br /> <br /> The movie isn't for joke and punchline, but it's still funny. Kathy Bates in particular is wonderful as Leno's manager. <br /> <br /> Funny, wonderful, interesting, very viewable, it's a good TV movie.
