This movie is about entertainment. Suggest to your friends that you like to spend time, the one you know inside becomes a bit stupid and maybe a character or two. This is what this film is about. An inventive script and brilliantly executed. It's not about the pleasant masses with this one, it's about fun with a lot of brilliant talented people. What I am sure everyone thought of when they signed up for it. <br /> <br /> The above review sounds completely unfair and I think the person who wrote it was in the wrong mood when they watched the movie. In a sad moment there is great dignity in it if you care. <br /> <br /> A job well done, I thought it was a good movie. I will see it every day for the North American norm. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it has many moments. I didn't laugh so long.
