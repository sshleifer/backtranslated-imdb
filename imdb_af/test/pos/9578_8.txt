I will admit that I have never seen "Wait for Guffman", 1997's critically-known comedy cartoon about a small town performing a spectacle. When the advertisement for Best in Show the tagline "From the Team waiting for Guffman", a fair number of critics out there in their reviews have illustrated that only people familiar with the film or its filmmakers and role players are good time to watch this movie. For shame, critics, for shameful times! Any critic who implies such a thing to any movie probably doesn't want to share the riches of the movie with the rest of the world, but it's one movie I hope people will experience, now that she's video / DVD. "Best in Show" is without a doubt the best comedy of 2000. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a mock-documentary style, announcing the main competitions (especially the screw balls) of the annual Mayflower "Best In Show" "competition, where dogs of all races come to compete to see who is the best dog. We have the loving and happy Harry Pepper (guest) with his blood dog, the simple Gerry & Cookie Fleck (Levy & O'Hara) with their trio, nut-yuppies Hamilton & Meg Swan (Hitchcock & Posey) Scott Dolan and Stefan Vanderhoof ( Higgins & McKean, and Air Force killer Sheri Ann Ward Cabot (Coolidge) with her coach, Christy Cummings (Lynch). They all have their thoughts on one simple object: The Blue Ribbon, which will be awarded to the best dog. And ... should I tell you the rest? <br /> <br /> Director / writer / star Guests' sense of humor is one that assures me that there are comedies that are worth laughing at and that the idiot of movies like "American Pie" or other useless " teenage "flashes will not take over the world. His idea is simple: don't make your comedy funny, but SMART funny. Instead of following the brilliant footprints of films such as "Zero Effect" and "High Fidelity", he used a rather unusual approach (and, as I understand, he also used this "Guffman" approach). Whether you see or not, a great deal of the film is improvisation. In other words, what the actors say and do is probably not written in the screenplay, perhaps not even dreamed by Guest and co-author / star Levy. But with a gentle hand from Gaste, he and the actors conquered a hilarious play that would probably end up being handled by other less skilled actors. Now it's smart! <br /> <br /> Of course, the throw is what makes improvement work the most. All of them are a (comic) wonder to watch, especially Guest as Pepper. But the real point of view should be Fred Williard as Buck Laughlin, the clueless announcer at the competition who can turn out the most outrageous funny stories and comment that no announcer will ever dream ... this is if the announcer tries to be funny. Williard can talk to the dog suddenly about how much he can bank. There is even a part in which he gives an idea of ​​a new marketing strategy: sexy women sit in tight shirts and shorts at the dogs and imply something like a doggie style of a time. Its valuable, like its performance. <br /> <br /> I hope people get involved in this 90 minute "dogumentary". The film deserves so much recognition. It nominated for the Best Picture Comedy at the Golden Globes, but did not win. I can't see why. I mean, in the comedy section, it's the best in performance. <br /> <br /> GRADE: A
