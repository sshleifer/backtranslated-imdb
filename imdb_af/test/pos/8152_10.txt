For an independent film, it is good with reasonably high production values ​​and a good role. The acting is uneven, but the plot is compelling. We could have used a little more development of West Ramsey's character, but hey, the guy is nice not to watch! Mary Kay Place and Jacqueline Bisset are like icing sugar on the cake. <br /> <br /> It's not surprising that it was controversial at its release. It offers less than flattering representation of the Morman Church and its relationship with gays. While, like Brokeback Mountain, it's about tolerance and acceptance of one's life, I found it more successful in conveying a positive message. It was also more moving.
