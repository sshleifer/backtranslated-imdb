It is quite clear that many of your nights were spent alone. If you watched 5 minutes from the real show instead of the commercial, you would have seen one of the biggest television shows in Canadian history. Sorry, you would have seen it alone. Probably the reason why you hate it ... no game. Keys for the VIP are hilarious, light and funny. Boys are going to eat this show. My game is stiff and I can hardly wait to get to this show. The chicks were HOOOOOT and the clubs kicked ass. I'll watch every week. It makes me wonder why more great shows like this one are not made. Now it is clear that the talent in Canada has the ability to produce American quality television.
