"L'Auberge Espagnole" collected the audience wherever it was shown. It has heard awards at many film festivals around the world. And it's not strange. We have the ability to see a cheerful and astonishing artwork. And that's wise. "L'Auberge Espagnole" is a very funny comedy about the youth and growing up. But above all, it's about the lights and shadows of life in the European Union. <br /> <br /> The main character of the film is a French student of economics Xavier. For his future service provider he is sent to Barcelona for one year. In Spain it seems that the lectures are given in the Catalan language. This probably does not help increase knowledge. But it helps to strengthen relationships within the group of foreign exchange students. Especially if they rent a large apartment together. There are 3 girls: English, Belgian and Spanish, as well as three boys: German, Danish and Italian. Our French man will also come there. A year is very long. Long enough to get close and make friends. And get to know some European stereotypes while trying to disassemble them. <br /> <br /> Clapically, this special case deals with a process of unifying Europe with humor and without pecky didactics. He comes from the idea that young people are just the same everywhere. They like jokes. They like to make irresponsible relationships. But they neglect their aspirations. The most interesting is the sum of experience of this small community. They live together in the fire of everyday tasks that fight with the surrounding reality. They are full of unusual ideas for life. Young Europeans come back to their countries to take up an adult themselves. They are the hope of Europe to fight the many problems of the Union. For example, the frightening administration system. In the end, they prove that they can not only communicate and make friends despite the many differences. But now they are also how to fill their lives. And they won't let them take away their whole lives.
