As French, I found it very enjoyable to be able to laugh at the old stereotype that was made of such a French, at some standard Westerners, at Spy movies etc. And many other things, along the way ... I've seen it 3 times and every time I discovered new things and laughed for tears ... Jean Dujardin, Beerice BÃ©jo, Aure Atika, the director and all the role-players have the crew did a fantastic job. This movie is funny, but it is much more than that: it has many levels of it. You laugh because of simple gags, because of some critics made with white (the movie is tired enough to be critical), due to physical comedy, because you believe in the characters, etc. Aesthetic and musical is also a success. Check it out if you can.
