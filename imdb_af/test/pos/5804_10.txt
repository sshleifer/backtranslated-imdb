Madonna has been moving the boat for more than 20 years, and through that comes a lot of experience - of course - and lots of knowledge. She was never the one to think yesterday, she warned yesterday what would be popular. She bravely takes all the new trends, technologies, and incorporates them into her own deeds. Her world tours have never been "average". When Madonna acts, she gives 120% - everything is bigger, better, theatrical and meaningful. She takes inspiration from East, West, and then makes it unique. Everything is given a deeper meaning, and the Confessions Tour is no different. From the beginning you find yourself on the edge of the chair. She starts popping, then she does brave circus on a horse high up in the air, she does everything she can to entertain you. She recovers her own songs and gives them a modern feel. She sings at a disco cross, she is almost in the middle of the stage, and with her wonderful dance staff who know no dimensions of fear, the performance is absolutely more than what you have negotiated. It's a spectacle, an audiovisual orgasm that can't be put into words. Fortunately, those who have actually seen Madonna on stage are. She moved fifty, she was still in an incredible shape. Recent Sticky and Sweet Tour are even more pioneers, proving nothing else to be Madonna's, and ever the only, queen of pop.
