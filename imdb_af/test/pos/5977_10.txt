Even if Voskhozhdeniye was your favorite movie, it would only be possible to watch it for ten years. It's just too emotional punishment. The ASCENT is regarded as the best film by Shepitko as the story of parties working in the Byelorussian forest during winter's death in the German occupied Soviet Union. <br /> <br /> While hearing with the sheer physics of the war experience, especially the cold and snowfalls, the real struggle for survival against both nature and fascists, there is always a subtle, scarcely derived sub-text. of moral judgment and whether one can be moral or immoral in one context but otherwise in another. <br /> <br /> A German group hiding in the forest is being attacked by a German patrol and losing their food supplies. Two men, Rybak, who knows the area, and Sotnikov, a Jewish teacher, have the job of going to a small town for food. They find the town burnt to the ground with nothing edible and nothing more than charred wood and foundations in which one cubic hole is a child's mirror. The overwhelming feeling is that anyone who brings the brutality of the war to a country and a people is really cursed. I thought of the war that the Americans and British brought to Iraq and how to bring the horrors of war to people is the act of a degenerate people. <br /> <br /> The two move to a nearby larger village where they acquire a lamb from the co-worker chief. The Germans come and the two parties escape under fire. Sotnikov is hit in his foot and holds off the Germans as Rybak gets away with the lamb. Sotnikov becomes so desperate that he is prepared not to live, he removes his boot to put a bullet in his head. Just like that, Rybak is driving back and dragging Sotnikov out of the firing line. <br /> <br /> Cargo trains Sotnikov through the forest, meter for meter, all in one long row. Every meter is a grief and yet he still travels through deep snow, on reefs, on depressions, on black bush stumps that crack as they fall under the weight of the men. There are several similarities with the Tarkowsky kinematic vocabulary here - the long time to document a process, the effect of repetition and the resulting emotional stress that builds the longer the shot is underway. In the background, unnoticed because of the action, is there a question - did Rybak do an indecent act by going back to Sotnikov? Whether under the moral standards of Marxist-Leninism or simply the general necessity of the survival of the group, was it not his duty to get the food back to his hungry band and leave Sotnikov to cover his escape? To sacrifice one man so that the group can survive? What leads to the question - Can a man who is immoral under one philosophical system be morally under another moral system? The partisans come like another curse of war to a farmhouse with a woman with three small children. She is embarrassed by the bell and hardly holds her three children. They are scarcely rested when more Germans arrive. They make their way away and are directed to the cage to hide. <br /> <br /> Sotnikov's cough gives them away. When a German enters his head to look and no one responds, he threatens to burn over the cage and breaks Rybak's nerves and they are caught. Now who has the moral responsibility here? Sotnikov for cough or Rybek for cracks? The two parties and the mother are excavated and transferred to a nearby town, which is diligently passed under an iron arch at the entrance. They already find the chief and a little girl in custody. They are being interviewed by a Turncoat Byelorussian played by Tarkowsky's favorite Anatoly Solonitsyn. Sotnikov held his head during interrogation and torture and asked just what the interrogator's pre-war profession was? He does not answer, but from his comfort behind a desk, the likely answer is "teacher". <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Rybak asks for his life and even offers to join the police. The previously unnoticed character defects, which make a 'wrong' moral decision, disguised its ambiguity (sentimentality), and now becomes clear, disturbing and very ugly. <br /> <br /> The five are in a dark cell. They were all planning to die the next day. From here, the elements of a Christian parable become stronger. Genuine Rembrandt lighting and compositions are used to represent other Old Master's representations of Christ. He decides that he can save everyone if he blames everyone. He must be kept alive until the morning so he can save everyone. He asks the mother for forgiveness and the chief who knows what is happening does not feel so desperate to die uselessly as he did before. <br /> <br /> Morning comes. The Germans don't care if Sotnikov does not accept all the sins of his companions. They will all be hanged. They tread a steep trend street that is a virtual Via Dolorosa. A bank is taken to the place of execution which is the gateway to the village. Five ropes depend on it. The bench is just three, so Sotnikov stands on a tree trunk that Rybak comes out from under him. They all drive. <br /> <br /> If Rybak goes down the road with the Germans, someone in the crowd calls him a Judas, an unnecessary allusion, Shepitko's only slip. Rybak suggests that he be shot in the back several times to escape, kill an honorable death and try to keep himself in the shithouse, but leave with the Germans as the beaten dog he is. But if Rybak was morally right to go back and save Sotnikov's life, is he wrong to try to save his own life?
