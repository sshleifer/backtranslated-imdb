We went to the theater and expected a large-scale budget release and had an art house movie. The film is digitally projected at about two-thirds of the screen property with oblique classic digital projection, and has a limited stereo soundtrack that has been wasted on bio experience. <br /> <br /> The content of the film was the same old historical content we've all seen before, but heavily purified to prevent the audience from getting sick. Live action scenes that were few of them were constantly reused in classic documentary style, which became annoying after a while. <br /> <br /> I was somewhat surprised that only 4 people arrived to see it, guessing the rest knew what we didn't do. <br /> <br /> I suspect the producers made the film to recognize the nineteenth anniversary of Gallipoli. I have to ask if they should have bothered. <br /> <br /> Seven out of Ten to try, and out of respect for the ANZACs.
