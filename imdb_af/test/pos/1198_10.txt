When I was younger, I saw the end of HAIR on TV. I just watched the last 5 minutes of the movie. And I was really impressed. I had goose bumps and I told myself to watch this movie. <br /> <br /> And I have, and I must say, this movie is wonderful. The songs are great, the actors are very good and the message ... The message of this movie is one of the most important: "Make love, no war". This movie is a true masterpiece. Meanwhile, it's my favorite movie. <br /> <br /> The last song is one of the saddest and happiest ones I've ever listened to. I almost joined the crowd. All I have to say, "Let the sun shine, let the sun shine"
