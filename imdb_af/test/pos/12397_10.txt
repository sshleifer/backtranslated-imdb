As an adult, I am grateful that I caught this movie by chance when I was a teenager. During this time I experienced family problems. This particular movie has managed to determine what I have seen from a closed world. How much peer pressure is too much? I actually had to buy this movie because it reached me on a level, unlike most movies trying to reach an audience. How far can an individual go for social acceptance? Who is the "bad" crowd? Teens struggle to find out the answers to these questions, but ultimately ... who is the "pack leader" if there is to be one? Is it the strong one? The beautiful? Perhaps the person we all just look like is? Could it be the moral character? As far as the movie goes, the scroll worked together as if it were predestined. I just hope that more directors and producers are trying to create a piece of work that we all reach, as this film has reached me. I wish I could have more than ten votes because this title deserves much more.
