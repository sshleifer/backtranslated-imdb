THE RED CIRCLE (Jean-Pierre Melville - France / Italy 1970). <br /> <br /> It may be the coolest movie ever made, in the most literal sense of the term. The men never lose control and never - not once - show their emotions. No dramatic outbursts in this movie. Everyone is always cool. It is an abstract dream world where the men live according to their own code, a gangster code with the values ​​of the outside world which is remarkably absent. In this masterfully filmed elevator saga, Melville tackles the American crime thriller in his clear dark and desert style. However, he is currently making big budget with a $ 10 million budget and four of the biggest French stars. Alain Delon as the master thief, Yves Montand as an alcoholic ex-cop, Italian star Gian-Maria Volonté as an escaped criminal and André Bourvil in an atypical role as the cynical police chief. <br /> <br /> Melville describes LE CERCLE ROUGE as his penultimate film and is indeed a masterfully styled policeman. He also claimed to shoot a film noir in color and succeeded in many ways. The two primary influences for this film were John Huston's 1950s film THE ASPHALT JUNGLE and Jules Dassin's RIFIFI (1955). But unlike these films, where we learn a lot about the background of the individual gangsters with all their small needs and concerns that motivate them, it makes clear that they are not only ruthless underworld types, but ordinary individuals living in a world of Everyday concerns are involved and Human aspiration, Melville, tells us almost nothing about his criminals. Why was Corey (Alain Delon) in jail? Why was his colleague, Vogel (Jean-Marie Volonté) arrested in the first place? Or why did ex-policeman Jansen (Yves Montand) leave the force, was it his alcoholism? We never learn the motivation behind their actions and never find out what drives these men. Women are even more absent than in their previous films, with the "emotional" ties exclusively between men. They don't even have personal lives. A kind of an emotional twilight zone and although the environment is not as abstract as in its former LE SAMOURAI (1967), Melville still outlines a very ominous world. Melville's favorite actor, Alain Delon, is perfect and almost obnoxious if imaginable. <br /> <br /> Intentionally and over 140 minutes long, Melville takes his time to tell the story, but his slow pace and length prove to be a perfect way to make the wild world in which these men live , to show. Nothing is ever in Melville's movies and here it is no different. Every little detail seems to be of paramount importance to the story. Although LE SAMOURAI remains my favorite Melville movie, even with the biggest movies ever made, this one is also the best. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 10/10
