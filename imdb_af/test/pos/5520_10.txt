Look, this is a low budget horror movie that suffers from all the problems with low budget movies. But you just have to see it to see Lisa Erickson as Julie. She is SMOKIN hot and a great little actress to get started! These kinds of horror movies often reveal a rare jewel and The Power gave us Lisa Erickson! Nothing I enjoy more than sitting in my studio apartment with a Coke and putting this movie in. My friends Bob, Bill and Dennis agree. Lisa is not only brilliant, she is a hottie. The movie itself often picks up and the rest of the actors are not very helpful. But as soon as Lisa touches the screen, things really start to jump. The others are clearly not in her league. It's not the Eksorcist, but as I said, if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress, it's the one to see!
