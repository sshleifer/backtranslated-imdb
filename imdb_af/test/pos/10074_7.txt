I saw this movie the day it opened in NYC at the Ziegfield. By the time Madonna wasn't quite the cultural icon, she's now. She had a few hits, was very good at "Desperately Seeking Susan" and I had tickets to see her in concert at the Giants Stadium. <br /> <br /> "Who is that girl?" gives Madonna a real role to play, which is not just a variation of her own personality. She does the madcap / heroin routine better than you might think. Griffin Dunne was very well thrown as the man to see all the shenanigans. <br /> <br /> The story involves a big cat called Murray, a groom who slept with every cabbie in NYC, a common father-in-law, and a key. There are many car hunters and police who drag their way. All the elements of a screw comedy are intact. <br /> <br /> Sir John Mills is briefly seen. He shares a glass of champagne with the largest apartment on the Upper West Side, complete with rainforest and everything. <br /> <br /> Compared to most Madonna movies (the one I can tolerate anyway), it's great. It is not that bad on its own. 6/10. <br /> <br /> PS The concert was common.
