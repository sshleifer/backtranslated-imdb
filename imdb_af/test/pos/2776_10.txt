Susie Q. is one of those rare and lovely movies that gives you a warm feeling. It's bitter, but healthy, and its characters are fun and engaging. Initially I thought the movie would be the clich√© cuddly movie that would take me after five minutes, but I was wrong. It sometimes made me tear, and it seduced me, and rooted me for the good guys. I loved the movie and remember it today 9 years later !! I highly recommend it to anyone, and the movie is family oriented, so you don't have to worry about inappropriate content. Surely if Disney shows more movies so far like Susie Q, it would be the most popular family-oriented channel in the world. Now if only Disney would just show it again! ^ _ ^ Go Susie Q. !!
