I swear if I ever tried cocaine, I could perfectly relate to this movie. The pace, as well as the dialogue, knock out at the speed some viewers may have to stop relaxing their heads. <br /> <br /> There are many small elements that appear through the film, such as how Rob Lowe's Character always seems to lose a shoe, or how some characters run spirals around his face. The story is very well composed and the direction looks flawless. <br /> <br /> The movie series of clumsy and gift. This is one I think most can enjoy. A few laughter-hard-even-as-just-moments ensure I will look again.
