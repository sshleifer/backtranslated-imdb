But today quite dated. Otto Preminger made this movie without the approval certificate needed. It was very courageous and risky because he lost his investment and future. <br /> <br /> The movie is not true to the wonderful book and is unfortunately celebrated. <br /> <br /> Frank Sinatra (and I have never been a fan) playing Frankie Machine, is amazing in his performance. One forgets that it is Frank, and the level of realism he brings to the role of a junkie drug addict must be seen as believed. <br /> <br /> Forever beautiful and talented, Kim Novak does not disappoint. the role of the dedicated outsider, always there for Frankie. <br /> <br /> Supporting roles, especially a young, attractive and talented Darrin Mc Gavin, are flawless. <br /> <br /> Eleanor Parker plays Frankie's wife, is hopelessly incompetent. She swings from annoying to melodramatic and is far above the top. A forgetful performance. <br /> <br /> The elevated, inexpensive settings are frightening, as if a strong wind is going to blow the entire sticky cardboard stickers across the horizon. Almost ridiculous in their lethal cheapness. <br /> <br /> The music was annoying, poundingly so at times. As if every version of the script (for example: when Louie gets Frankie, she is right out of a drawer) underlined at a high decibel level. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10. Sinatra really deserves his Oscar. nomination. Worth to see.
