One of the two best films of the year. A well-filmed, well-written, well-composed film with an excellent role. Lau Ching Wan and his friends (Dayo Wong Chi Wa, Anthony Wong Chau Sun, Francis Ng Chun Yu, Jordan Chan Siu Chun, Cheung Man Tat) had good chemistry before the movie and showed their friendship in their performances. Theresa Lee plays her comedian role well (Although much like a female version of Michael Wong, her gag is the strange born Chinese surrounded by native speakers.) And I shouted for innovative explosive scenes, something I didn't do not since 1. fan boys took over alt.asian movies and 2. John Woo's Hardboiled. Surely the end is expected, but I feel better than a lot of young gangsters for the police. Very pleasant.
