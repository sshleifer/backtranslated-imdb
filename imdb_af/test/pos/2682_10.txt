I can't believe how many excellent actors can be on one show. It is the realism and fine acting that it really looks like. It must be the best comedy ever created to this day and I love Seinfeld and Everyone loves Ramond. It's just fantastic and everyone in my family seems to agree. It's not an isolated view of me. The whole world seems to be talking about different incidents and they are trying to give them back. My hat off to the crew. Some shows have an actor making the whole show. This plot comedy has a slew (8) of them. It makes it so wonderful. Some people pray for Health, Prosperity or Fame. I pray that the show never ends. Sicerely John. LKHUBBLE2@talkamerica.net
