This is definitely a must see movie. The excellent director Alain Chabat (who also acts as Ceasar) has succeeded in capturing the essence of the "Adventures of Astérix" (the French comic books on which it is based) and creating a fantastic modern and intelligent comedy. It is also a tribute to the world of animated films. This movie is so funny, so full of jokes (both visual and spoken) that it can take you two or three shows before you see them all, between your congratulations. The only downside is that a non-French audience (or at least a non-French-speaking audience) may not be able to get all the "private jokes". There are so many dialogues possible to translate, so many situations directly related to the comic books or the French way of life, that fun can be reduced. However, it is still worth seeing for the beautiful photo, the wonderful stunts, the music, the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting. All actors are great, but the movie won't be the same as Jamel Debouze, Gerard Darmon and Edouard Baer. And please don't compare this wonderful movie with the horrible previous one, based on the same cartoons: "Astérix et Obélix Contre Cesar" and directed by Claude Zidi.
