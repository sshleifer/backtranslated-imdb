Frank Sinatra took this role, chewed it with the rest of the landscape and rinsed it in HIS way. TMWTGA is stagey, the end is thin, some of the scenes need a bit more cuts, but that's all. It's a great start to end entertainment, and while you see it, you realize that Sinatra, the slow-hearted MOR crown, has junkies, gangster cards and all the American urban hustle and bustle in his blood - he doesn't have it an acting coach. There is a lot of direct touch to keep you entertained, and the (non-dated) soundtrack cooks all the way. The marathon card game has Goodfellas, Sopranos, etc. By forty years! So wasn't it true to the book? Which movie is? And I can't imagine it being remembered if Brando was let go of it; The cold turkey shades would be embarrassing, rather than edgy, convincing and moving with Sinatra. No one else called the seedy, lazy, cynical police - absolutely spot! And Eleanor Parker would have driven me to hit.
