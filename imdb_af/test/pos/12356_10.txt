Yes, I think this movie is a bit dull compared to some of Pam Grier's other movies. The plot is excessively known, the dialogue stilted, and some of the acting is not too good. But it's worth seeing for the long stretch near the end of the movie, where we see Ms Grier in a sexy blue wetsuit, unzipped with the zipper half. Yes, it seems to be a difficult point to discuss an actor of Pam Grier's talent, but she is also a very beautiful woman and in that day she had a body that would not stop. It is nice to see that it is shown in a tight law. Hire the DVD and tell me I'm wrong. Can't, can you? That's because you know I'm right! :-) And yes, I really gave a 10 just for the wetsuit scenes! ;-)
