Every time the alleged explorers and we, the audience, are placed to set one of his first tourist attractions one of the wonderful new worlds, the filmmakers have decided to divert for some or other divine reason with an emergency or a false alarm or a little artificial dramatic tension. <br /> <br /> Instead of calmly enjoying the surface of Io, or standing over the rings of Saturn or concentrating on the magic of flying through a comet or an asteroid, We are distracted from concern about the well-being and survival of the characters. Big Late !! <br /> <br /> The filmmakers seem unclear what they want. A documentary of the natural wonders in our solar system, or a tension player in which the viewer pays more attention to the characters than the subject. Come on. <br /> <br /> Hello. If I wanted tension and tension, I'd like to watch a real Narrative sci-fi movie. <br /> <br /> Sure it's a docus frame. But the characters and their survival here (the risks of such a mission - must be secondary to the subject). Wait. Yes, the risks of such a mission are an important part of the subject - as it is essentially a film about a space mission, not just about the solar system. But it was too strong and derived from the discovery of new worlds we were supposed to enjoy. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, the film was remarkable to give a very realistic feel to the human elements of a space mission, taps, tensions, weight of responsibility, deadly mistakes, sacrifices, and so on. . It will also fit very well into the sub-sci-fi subgenre. It will actually be one of the best, because science is meticulously met. <br /> <br /> But the distraction was terrible. <br /> <br /> Otherwise, I missed showing the effects of a few years in space on the astronauts AFTER landing on Earth.
