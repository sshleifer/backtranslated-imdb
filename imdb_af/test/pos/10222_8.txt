For a movie like this, there is always something to follow in the coming year. Clive Barker, the man who brought "Hellraiser", made a horror movie part-Goth, part-mythology, and all horror in between. "Nightbreed" is a bunch of mutants that only come out at night and move around the place called Midian. Now a man's name Boone (Craig Sheffer) is claiming hallucinations. He goes to this shrinkage, dr. Decker (David Croneberg) who "helps" Boone with his problems. Unknown to this situation, Decker claims he is a purist who has only disguised himself as a hate-maker. However, Boone goes to Midian and claims to be one of the mutants. But a mutant called Peloquin (Oliver Parker) sees Boone as meat! But she bites spare Boone so after being killed by a firearm, he is now one of them. After deceiving Decker, Boone does everything in his power to protect Lori (Anne Bobby) from him. Lori saves a mutant from the sun, and also helps the others. I love the lady mutants who give a smoky "kiss of death" and the Porcupine Woman who dreamed Boone shows her power so seductive and deadly. I enjoyed this horror movie all the way, and its rule has never been trusted! Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars!
