Aaron Sorking asked the same questions as Shakespeare did or did. How can they know so much about the inner workings of the palace. Here, like in the West Wing, Sorkin opens surprising doors that look scarce, but seem to confirm our worst fears. Everything is so comfortable and at the same time as directly responsible for so many people's lives. A Puffy Tom Hanks tells us somehow that things can be manipulated with semi-pure intentions, but without weighing the consequences and Julia Roberts in a blonde southern hairstyle reminds us of the forces being sidelined. The subject is serious, but the treatment is light, intelligent but light. Philip Seymour Hoffman, as invisible middleman, steals every scene he's in, just like Charles Laughton did in every movie he was. The dialogue is fast but not fast enough so we cannot catch up and discover that it is not an ordinary comedy. The seemingly casual fit filled with the pursuit of intelligence and provocation adds another honor to the Mike Nichol collection.
