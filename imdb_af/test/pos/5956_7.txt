I recently saw it at the 2007 Palm Springs International Film Festival, where it eventually became one of the audience favorites. It is a spoof on the French home industry of OSS 117 films of the 50's and 60's. The first OSS 117 film based on the novel by Jean Bruce was screened in 1956, long before the first James Bond movie, with Ivan Desny as Hubert Bonisseur De La Bath, and six subsequent action adventure spy films were made until 1970 . Luc Merenda, Frederick Stafford, Kerwin Matthews and John Gaven all take turns as Oss 117. Jean Dujardin is in the title role in this comic series. As the film began in 1945, he had a French mustache and resembled Desny, but as the film began, it looked like 1955, he really looked like Sean Connery. Jean Fran√ßois Halim wrote this hilarious script of a spy sent to Egypt to investigate the murder of a friend. It lends itself to the cowardice of Naked Gun, Get Smart and the Pink Panther and uses fresh humor on current events in a beautiful combination that international audiences will enjoy and I'm sure it will be the only first to come from a revived OSS 117 reworked into comedy adventures. Michel Hazanavicius directed. I'll give it a 7.5 and recommend it.
