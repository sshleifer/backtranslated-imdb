Just watched it on the Hallmark Channel. I was surprised by John Denver! This movie was full of clichés, but it can be expected (a TV Christmas movie made!) The play is as good as any other 80's made for TV movies. The story is, as I have already said, predictable and cliché, but still good. If you are looking for a camping Christmas movie, it will definitely scratch your itch. <br /> <br /> I was also happy when I learned that it was in Georgetown, Colorado. It is a true mountain village west of Denver. Very cool because it's my home region. <br /> <br /> I was never a big John Denver fan (I always found him nice), but he was a decent actor. He is very good as the good old boy as he played in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you get the chance to see it, then do it. I'm sure it will be back in 2007.
