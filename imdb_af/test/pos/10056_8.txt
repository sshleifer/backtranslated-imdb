I wasn't a fan of Madonna yet, but I thought I'd comment on this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie went wrong. One of them, as well as Madonna, was placed by the critics. They were highly wrong and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviews. <br /> <br /> First, Madonna does an excellent job in this movie, which was one of her first. She plays a ditsy blonde in the movie, she is far from such a blonde in real life. Most critics are somewhat harmed by her singing rose and have not shaken her justly. If you see this movie, I hope you understand that the accent and the goofiness are just acting. She was completely hysterical like the movie. <br /> <br /> Griffen Dunne is another person who has not received a fair review in the film. If you look at his filmography, you'll see he's a perfect actor. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie itself is concerned, it's something like pretty woman, but came 3 years before Roberts, Gere succes. It's a goofball comedy with lots of yard holes, slapstick and one liners. Some of the comedies are deadpan and take a comedy aficionado to really appreciate the subtle humor. <br /> <br /> I don't know much about the movie, but I hope it helps to clear any conviction it is a poor movie. It is absolutely worth renting for a pleasant night of great fun. <br /> <br /> Peace. <br /> <br /> Gary
