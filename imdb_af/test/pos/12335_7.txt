I saw it in the movie in the 80's and never forgot it, though I never saw it again. <br /> <br /> I don't know if I've seen it now, it seems dated, but remember the storyline and compare it to some of the horrible modern movies I've seen on Zone Horror. I have to think it. will stand up very well. <br /> <br /> I can still remember his chest slipping out and open and all the bodies are resuscitated, and the blue lightning. After watching hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this one, it should be fine.
