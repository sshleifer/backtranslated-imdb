I love this movie, it's excellent and so funny, Ben is FIT and I won't mind meeting him on vacation !! I rate this movie a 10 because she gr8 and I hope they will never make it again, because it will never be the same. Funny little is winning Andre looks at the moon, and he shouts at Nicole to "come outside and look at the moon", that little bit always makes me laugh and never grow old. Another thing is Nicole looks much older than 14 ... but she's a gr8 actress. But I need help with something. Isn't the name of the song being played at the end, does Nicole and Andr√© win dancing? It's really a bug for me because I want 2 no what it's because it's a nice song !!
