knows someone I can get my hands on this video or the movie for this. I've been looking for it long ago to show my daughter to show her and I can't find it anywhere. probably because it was just on video and they never made the DVD or VHS or idk. <br /> <br /> I got it from Disney back in 1996 and I think it would be the best video to show her. such a good movie showing every kind of emotion throughout the movie. also has many actors who started their careers with this movie. If someone knows how to get a copy of this movie or have a copy and wants to sell it for $ 50 or something, please call 201-566-0148. Thank you
