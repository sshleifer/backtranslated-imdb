This extremely entertaining brief is considered one of the best shorts ever, and I will definitely not argue with it. Even in a country where top-notch animated shorts are regularly created, this movie can still stand out. If you ever get the chance to watch this movie, please do so. It is only ten minutes long, yet it contains a man who is busy with sawing, a bathing bath, and a nuclear war. What more could you have in a movie?
