At a scale of 1-10 "Suicidal Sweetheart", a 11 of me and of everyone at this exhibit. The picture was incredibly funny. I told my wife, "Obviously this man is walking on water, but over a fire bed, it's a bit." This is one of the best combinations of comedy, satire and use of innuendo I've seen since Mel Brooks' "Young Frankenstein". I can't believe this photo was not picked up by a big studio. <br /> <br /> This "Film Festival" audience was sophisticated and could have picked up every comic insinuation, whether visual, spoken or implied. The characters are actually the combination of a good script and a good decision was obvious. Max and Grace are real people with real problems being dealt with, regardless of the chances of success. It makes you smile while you are serious and laughs with all the indirect humor brilliantly built into this production. <br /> <br /> To sum it up, it's a "must see" picture.
