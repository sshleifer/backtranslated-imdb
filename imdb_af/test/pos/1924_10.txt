Deep Water (2006) **** <br /> <br /> "It's careless ... it's there to wait for you to make one slip." These words (paraphrased) may be the best summary of the nature of the ocean I've ever heard. His furies are boundless, not least, her loneliness. These words come from the amazing and heartbreaking documentary Deep Water. This is the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur sailor who participated in the 1969 Sunday Times Race around the World. If you don't know his story, it might be better to stop reading. Don't read this or any other information at Crowhurst or the race. Find the movie and just watch it. <br /> <br /> After the first solo voyage of the ocean in 1967, adventurers and viewers of adventurers began looking for the next. This time the trip has to be done without going or stopping. Crowhurst fell on hard times and saw the race as a great opportunity to get his family back on their feet. He lived because of financial hardship, and wanted to partake of going back to such a life. He then found sponsors, and soon went to Stanley Best and Rodney Hallworth. The two men spelled the potential cash cow and gave Crowhurst a boat, provided that if he had to withdraw from the race, he would be forced to pay the expenses. However, his boat was in great need of repairs, and he feared it would not be ready in time for the final parting day. However, he was informed by his surety that he should simply go? In fact, they dumped the dough and expected it to return many times. <br /> <br /> The details of the story are notorious: Crowhurst's boat took on water and slowed its progress to a creep. Faced with the decision to turn or return the horn of Africa (some death in such a boat) (financial devastation and fatality), he sought a third option. He chose to hide, alone on his hunt, and waited for other competitors to surround Cape Horn in South America. From there he will join the race again. He reported false positions and recorded record breaking speed. Then he stopped all communication for fear that his position would be given away. He also had to build up fake logs for every day of a trip he didn't take. Eventually, the loneliness, the guilt and the realization that he was probably caught, weigh too heavily on Crowhurst. His last log entries make the scenes of a Kurtz quite sensible. Just a few weeks from home, he turned his boat away from the house and reportedly jumped overboard soon. <br /> <br /> Crowhurst's odyssey is a fascinating one, and its ending is heartbreaking, but inevitable. Our dreams become so often in fear, and the consequences of our actions often leave us so few options for a happy ending. It is a story of a descent into madness, tampered with by the infinite abyss of the cruel sea. The filmmakers do a wonderful job of telling this story. It is made up of the cold sound and video recordings made by Crowhurst, and narratives of its ever-increasing notes. The story starts slowly, and may distract some viewers, but the rewards of the story are totally worth it as it progresses. <br /> <br /> There are also queries in some of the other rivals, such as Frenchman Bernard Moitessier, who were at risk of winning the speed competition, just to pull out and make a second trip across the world to start. Also in the film is Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the winner of the competition. He donated his prize money to the Crowhurst family. <br /> <br /> To read briefly about the Crowhurst saga, simply don't do it right. This is of course interesting, but a quick scroll bypasses the raw emotions and strangers offered here. Deep Water's last moments are really heartbreaking, the thoughts of his widowed family, the worship and understanding of his friends. It's a fascinating story, and that's what the documentary carries in such big channels.
