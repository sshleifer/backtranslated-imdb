It's an excellent movie. A moving experience filled with real emotion. There are lessons to be learned about love, sex, work, religion and American culture, regardless of his sexual preference. <br /> <br /> While this film is also a rejection of the Mormon's (Church of the Last Day Saints) belief system, any conservative faith can easily take its place. But it is a little ironic that homosexuality is in no way condemned by the Mormons. Here is a belief that generations have believed believers practice polygamy! And these true believers just gave up this practice because they were forced by the federal government to enter Utah to join the Union. Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy! <br /> <br /> The sex scene depicted in the unprecedented version is tasteful, and surprisingly short. There is nothing here that will offend anyone with an open mind. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie so obvious is that homosexuality is completely natural to people who are gay, as heterosexuality is for straight people! While love and sex are, of course, very different needs, it is absolutely beautiful, beyond words, when both occur at the same time between adults! Deep erotic love is one of the most precious gifts of life! Good luck to the filmmakers for a great job!
