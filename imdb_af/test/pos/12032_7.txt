Hollywood changed the Mafia into a production line of outputs ranging from banal to excellent and despite some good acting and reasonable writing (many of which - for a change - are true!) This "home entertainment" attempt to fall Clap in the middle. <br /> <br /> The writing isn't just obvious (all the checklist is finally typed), but spends a lot of time creating a pastiche of the best of other people's work. . The Godfather is the most obvious, but there are also other references. I won't bother it. Yet it is a good taste borrower! The producer seems to set a quota for shots and murders (one at least every twenty minutes?) And the end is poor and "so what?" I'm told there are several versions of this production, so maybe it's just the version I saw. <br /> <br /> Gangsters don't make money, they take money. Usually by fear. Some seem more in the murder and murder side of the business than making money. They were the first to go (in real life and here). "You can't make money with a gun in your hand," says Charlie Lucky Luciano at one stage. One of the smarter gangsters, though all things are relative. He was a skilled white slave trader and a drug dealer before being brought to Italy. <br /> <br /> The old school's "detached Pete's" was picked up by the new blood that wanted the power and money for themselves and to unleash the straight jacket of Italian / Sicilian power (rarely do business outside themselves). The young Turk knew that they had to be linked to other groups (especially the "Jews" who knew how to save money) and that is at least referred and acknowledged. What is not made clear is that most immigrant groups had their own Mafia - but most of them made their money and became legit. And why not? Who wants to die in prison? <br /> <br /> Joseph Bonanno was a relentless man who was willing to die if needed, but not an unfair or stupid one. His story was tragic in that he could have made money in the overhead world and he showed a special skill to be avoided. With some luck, of course. <br /> <br /> Despite the series of respectable names and three actors in the title role (Bruce Ramsay, Martin Landau and Tony Nardi), there is no charisma or talent to bring us in and feel something. We are - merely - passive observers in a life that we are happy not to lead. The people shown here were born into a cruel world, but their only point was to make it more cruel. <br /> <br /> If you can't get enough of the gangster genre, it would be better than watching Godfather 1 and 2. for the tenth time and it is even better - than basic entertainment - as the terrible burnt-off that Godfather 3 was.
