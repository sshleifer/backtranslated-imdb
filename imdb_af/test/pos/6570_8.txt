A village in Japan is taken over by a terrible cruel abstract form: the spiral. It becomes a theme in everything from animals to clouds to humans and turns them spiritually and literally. This film shows that it happens to various groups of people. Some demonic possession is implied, but nothing is absolutely certain, except that the best bet is to get the dodge out. The film progresses very well from normal life to abnormal phenomena (giant snails and crazy people) to the truly supernatural (running dead). <br /> <br /> As a beloved American horror moviewoman, it was just what I needed. Perhaps it was just the novelty of another cultural film, but it seems to be a very original progression, set of characters, and the point of departure was definitely new. The Japanese can think "horror shapes" (uzumaki means "spiral," I am told) is old, but it was nice to me because I am used to monster / alien / virus / disaster / dead. In an American movie you know who is going to die (the annoying / nasty / capricious / racist characters) and who will live (the kids / heroine / dogs / cats / nice ones). It's not true in Japanese horror. It was not predictable how they would fight the evil or how it would end. Also, it had this very new (but probably typically Japanese) color-spicy Pacific Northwest style cloudy day thing, which was a fresh visual effect for me. The horrible moments were seriously creepy, relying on a little yummy but mostly just impossible exaggerated facial expressions (think The Ring) and body manipulations. It should be one of the great ones, up there with one-off original ideas such as the first Nightmare on Elm Street or Night of the Living Dead.
