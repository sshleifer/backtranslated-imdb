This story had many ups and downs. The storyline is strong, while the story of Ma 'Barker grows up, and then her misadventures are with her sons and the FBI. Theresa Russell very talented and her beauty even shines through, like Ma 'Barker, in Public Enemies. The direction of Mark L. Lester, while not as good as in the 85's commando, was still very interesting. <br /> <br /> Eric Roberts, playing a short-lived part as a security guard, turned (and Ma's Lover), and Alyssa Milano plays a prostitute hanging with the gang. Frank Stallone plays a gang that helps the gang, and while one of his races gets into trouble with one of Ma's sons, he gets in a final way to say so ... <br /> <br /> I was confused, intrigued and enchanted, throughout this movie. So it makes me wonder what movie all these others watched it so low! .. For all those who are wondering. If the FBI had been so bad, they didn't have thumb rifles like the outsiders, and so was quite a disadvantage when they came to gangs of that era in the shooting. Since everything I represented in the 30's, I felt it was more realistic than many other movies that depicted that era. This is happening in the moon like a train wreck. You don't w oom, but just .. enjoy!
