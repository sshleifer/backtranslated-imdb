I don't usually comment on movies or TV shows, but had to comment on Las Vegas. <br /> <br /> Of course here in the UK we are about 2/3 in the 3rd season and although I managed to watch the last series of season 3 (via other means). I am still glued every Friday at 21:00. <br /> <br /> From the very first episode of season 1 I was a big fan of this show and own all 3 seasons on DVD, yes I can't wait for season 4 to start in October. <br /> <br /> So why do I like so much about this show, well, I have to agree with the last poster .... James Caan, I know one person can't make a team, but Big Ed Deline is made for Caan or maybe it's the other way around, I read that producers Martin Sheen is considering Ed Deline ....! I also agree that Caan's character becomes very soft, and I also chose the difficult tasks. I didn't watch the Big Bad Eddy D we saw in season 1 and 2. <br /> <br /> If I said no one made the team themselves and of course the other members carry Josh Duhamel / Danny, James LeSure / Mike, Vanessa Marcil / Sam, Nikki Cox / Mary, Molly Sims / Delinda both good , even both members of foreign countries. such as Cheryl Ladd as Jillian Deline, Harry Groener as Gunther, Dean Caine as Casey, Mitchell Longley as Mitch who can play 6 or 7 times in a season, might as well fit as in each episode of day. <br /> <br /> This show has everything, drama, action, excitement, laughter, romance, glamor, glamor and great-time celebrities who often play their own. <br /> <br /> Many may disagree, but this is one of the best shows on digital TV and I hope it can last long after season 4.
