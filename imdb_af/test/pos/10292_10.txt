This sad romance is inexplicable because the director decides to break his narrative and present the views of each character. So, there are many flashbacks, from re-shooting the same scene. But, it would be an extraordinary moment of cinema to put all the fragments to see the result! <br /> <br /> And it'll be worth it because it's for me, just one of the best French movies ever made! <br /> <br /> All this: <br /> <br /> Cast: First Steps of Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel! Such a presence and such voices, even for a hard hearing! It is symbolic that they fell in love with this movie! <br /> <br /> Directing: his camera is bright, lively, set with the sets or can be mysterious with a long close-up "Ã  la David Lynch". <br /> <br /> Camera: The light is beautiful, between gold and rust, like their love! <br /> <br /> A never seen before Paris: It's a Paris beyond the time of more accurate, a compilation of many districts! Great looking here! It looks like Gotham City, at the same time modern and old! <br /> <br /> Music: Not the big band, but in perfect fit with the frames. And the song by Charles Aznavour made me discover the great singer! <br /> <br /> Oh, ?? the story! As I said, it is a love story, but rather tragic. To say that love for nothing can be, not to make all people happy or guaranteed, is wonderful because this message is not often told! Love is passion, which is derived from the Latin "pain". You may suffer a lot if you fall in love! Because of the Why .., of the endless guard, the lack of courage, the uncertainty. <br /> <br /> And when you can relieve yourself, the devil (?) can put you in the back, just because you come too fast or late and especially because love means 2 in a world of billions! Many things can happen and so many stories can be written! So what is love? <br /> <br /> Personally, I lived a few moments: in a car with the best one. Her mobile rings and you know it's her "special friend" who kisses her goodbye (and not you, though we are always together). So, you want to get out of this car to let them together, not to hear the sweet but cruel words, but you can't, because a wonderful hard rain has just begun! <br /> <br /> I found this movie portraying the moments of tragedy as nobody else!
