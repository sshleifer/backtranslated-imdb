I really enjoyed this movie - I like jail movies in general (I'm not sure why - I'm sure some might shrink something out of it!) I spent one night in prison over 20 years ago and I knew then I would never go back - I got the individual version of "straight scared"! (I spent a few hours in an isolation system on Alcatraz, compliments of a park keeper, but that's another story!) Anyway, the genre really interests me. The soundtrack, specifically "The Simulation for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones, was the perfect backdrop for the movie. To this day I think of "The Jericho Mile" every time I hear the song.
