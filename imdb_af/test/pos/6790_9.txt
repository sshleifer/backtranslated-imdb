First of all, let me say that I find films like Shawshank Redemption and Green Mile, and most of Spielberg is absolutely terrible and tummy. Although, the National Velvet on the surface looks like the same genre and has some worthy moments, I thoroughly enjoyed it, laughed it and blew it into the movie. <br /> <br /> The foreground of the plot, a young girl with an unknown horse from a small town entering the Grand National, is definitely as indescribable as it can be, but that is the only thing that You must accept to work as a fairy tale or allegory. The characters have depth and growth throughout the story. Ann Revere gives an absolutely stunning performance as one of the wisest women ever portrayed in an American movie. Her interaction with the kind-hearted Donald Crisp is funny and sweet. While Liz Taylor is trying a little too hard to be even better than Margaret O'Brien (his passing VAT), her passion and love for her horse shines through her face. Mickey Rooney gives a beautifully nuanced performance by the coach. <br /> <br /> It's far from a perfect movie. Some of the situations and scenes are a bit chaotic and dated (the children's fraud, and Rooney's scenes on the track and in the bar for example), but it doesn't matter. The plot remains true to the characters and leaves quite a bit loose. We do not have unnatural excessive dramatic and beautiful moments - sometimes more is less. The final scene is a good example of this. The emotional dialogue is left to the viewer to fill in. Highly underlined shows, rounded characters, pithy dialogue, intelligent and internal consistent storyline. We believe in the characters and are moved by their story. Yup - they just don't make them like this ...
