Love and war took place on the other side of the iron curtain, and love was as strong as in the West and war was often more gripping (should I be more realistic). <br /> <br /> This film is so much about war and love as it concerns the Soviet defrost of Mr. K's era. It also reminds us of the best war movies that were not necessarily made in the 1990s with rivers of hemoglobin and spent millions of USD on special effects and market actors. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic Soviet theater and an outstanding picture of one of the greatest human tragedies: war. <br /> <br />
