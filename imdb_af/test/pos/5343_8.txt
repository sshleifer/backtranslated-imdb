The people at Aardman did a cool, cute and wild adaptation of their short films from Wallace and Gromit to the length of the feature, such as the man and his dog, inventors who are more of the intelligence (or practical) for the latter. In this case, they invented a machine that can capture all the bunnies that pick up the crops over a quiet English village. In particular for Mrs. Tottington (or 'Totty' for those who are 'intimate'), much to Victor Quartermaine's chagrin, who just wants to kill all the rabbits with his trust gun. Wallace and Gromit look successful with their machine, but Wallace has a mix: a machine he made to make more food suddenly crosses with a rabbit - the curse is on! <br /> <br /> Much of this is about as much light-hearted fun as a kid's movie might ask, but also the hat for the oldest tradition in classic cartoon sleeping stick: Looney Tunes, which is in turn due to very quiet comedy and vaudeville. Assigned, the Aardman guys (Nick Park and Steve Box) have a lot more mopeds and tricks and ingenuity with their material. It is never less than wonderful to see how they use the stop-motion to use, even if a joke or a gag may be a bit on the funny "ho-ho" -hearted "ha-ha" side (a tired criticism, but I'm "will say it"). The curse of the Were-Rabbit works so well on all fronts for the audience, in its discolored story and sudden dips in exposition (the Golden Bullet story is a doozy), Park and Box and the company never gets excited about the material no. br /> <br /> It is vague and sad and totally out-of-the-wall for the kids (even the very youngest will love the adventures and strange gadgets, like the Wallace truck and Gromit driving) adults there are little funky fun , absurd colors in the middle of a classic English farce. Only (and I'm probably a minority opinion here). Compared to Chicken Run, it is almost a bit of a job - there is less plot if there are a series of running gags, and of course many words that include cones and monsters and carnivals. and cheese (and horrible men with egos in their guns like the Fiennes pronounced Quartermaine). But if it's best, it's one of the most entertaining movies of 2005. It's a big, dumb smile when it's on TV.
