Anthony Minghella's "The English Patient" is a film that takes us back to the golden years of Hollywood. It is large and impressive in scale, yet so sadly intimate in the portrayal of human love and suffering. At the Oscar Awards of 1997, the film owned at night, and he won nine nominations of nine nominations, the most decisive cleansing whip since Bernardo Bertolucci's 'The Last Emperor' in 1988. Based on Canadian author Michael Ondaatje's The 1992 bookwriter's story of the same name, 'The English Patient', is a pleasant meditation on life, love and loss, the history of a critically burned man in the aftermath of World War II. <br /> <br /> During the war, a man (Ralph Fiennes) was discovered in the burning remains of an accident. With his face scarcely recognized, and with the man apparently suffering from amnesia, he is believed to be an allied soldier, and is simply called the "English patient". After the war, Hana (Juliette Binoche), in the mining hills of Italy, remained a friendly nurse, who apparently lost all near her, in a devastated monastery to care for the dying man. Over time, she is increasingly concerned with her "English patient", who is actually revealed to be a Hungarian geographer, Count Laszlo de Almásy. Rather than losing his memory in the plane crash, we learn that these scars may have chosen to forget his past, to protect himself from persecution and to heal himself from the tragic memories of his past. Through many flashbacks, we learn of Almásy's former exploitation in the Sahara desert, and his romantic liaison with a married woman, Katharine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas). It is definitely easy to see why "The English Patient" was so successful at the Oscars, which is such a beautiful film that blends the silence of the Italian countryside with the endless golden sand of the desert. to perfection; Since David Lean's wonderful 'Lawrence of Arabia', a movie has shown the desert with such beauty and grandeur, and especially the use of flight photographs of Almásy's plane, even in the more intimate moments of the film. the excellent use of close-ups and lighting the emotion of the scene, of course, with the brilliant performances of all the role-players. <br /> <br /> A long-time favorite actor of mine, "The English Patient", may well include Ralph Fiennes' best performance, and in the light of his history include films such as' Schindler's List 'and' The Constant Gardener ', which is not a compliment to be taken lightly. Almásy is initially very sympathetic e character, but if we learn more about his past, his peculiar characteristics are wiped out by his less admirable trends towards others. "Ownership" is an important theme of the movie. When asked by Katherine, who he hates most, Almásy answers with "Ownership. Own. When you leave, you must forget me." As the relationship progresses, however, and Katherine may try to remove her from him, Almásy reveals a hint of arrogance and insists that his love for her in some way gives him fairness to have her when he likes: " Want to touch you. Things that are mine that belong to me. "Juliette Binoche, who received an Oscar for her performance, is excellent as Hana, the lonely nurse who fears to love because of the tragedies that always damage those nearby. her. After a while to care for Almásy alone, she was joined by a dubious Canadian thief, David Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who lost his thumbs during the war and suspected it was Almásy betraying him to the Germans. Hana also finds a provisional romantic relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews), an Indian bomb diffuser in the British army. However, due to her past history, Hana is afraid that he will become involved with Kip, will kill him, especially in view of his very dangerous work. <br /> <br /> At 160 minutes, 'The English Patient' reminiscent of memories of the ancient romantic epics of ancient times, successfully finding a balance of mystery, love, joy and tragedy. The end of the film is sad and sad, but also in its own way. While some romantic relationships are doomed from the start, others have a very good chance of bringing happiness. Nevertheless, in any case, it is always better to love and lose, than to never love.
