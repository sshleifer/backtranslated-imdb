First of all, I have to say that I don't speak Spanish and usually do not enjoy jokes. BUT Two Coyotes are an exceptional movie. There is plenty of action and loud drama that doesn't matter if it's a joke. The subtitles were easy to read and did not block the action - OR the drama! <br /> <br /> I will tell fans of Spanish-language films and non-fans of Spanish-language films to watch this movie. The action and drama is worth every penny. <br /> <br />
