What I can say about this film, besides the story, is one of the most exciting in film history ... and based on a true story! If you were old enough to remember the Berlin Wall when it was still a country, this film contains a dark insight into the grim imprisonment of East Berliners and their desperate attempts to escape, no matter what the cost. is not. The film follows the lives of two families, who decide to escape by escaping a hot air balloon manufactured by themselves. For eternal fear that the authorities are being arrested, under the supervision of neighbors, they must calculate a plan to reach the other side of the wall. An exciting and exciting story of courage and determination that truly honors everyone who has passed and failed the treacherous journey to West Berlin and freedom.
