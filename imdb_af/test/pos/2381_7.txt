One of several cartoons Scooby Doo movies, "Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster" seems to be entertaining, exciting, interesting, funny and also a surprisingly good interpretation of the Highlands of Scotland. One annoying aspect of the movie is the voices of many of the characters. American people who try to sound like Scotland in this movie are unfortunately not so good, though some people do better than Scottish accent. <br /> <br /> Daphne came to the Highlands to see her cousin Shannon and the Highland games at Blake Castle. Gravely Shannon tells the gang that she has seen the Loch Ness Monster. When more chaos arises, the Mystery Inc Gang has another riddle on their hands ... <br /> <br /> Good for Scooby Doo fans and for people who want to know more about Scotland! Enjoy "Scooby Doo and the Loch Ness Monster"! :-)
