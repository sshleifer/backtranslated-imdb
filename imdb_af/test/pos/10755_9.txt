What is often neglected about Harold Lloyd is that he was an actor. Unlike Chaplin and Keaton, Lloyd did not have the background of the Vaudeville / Music Hall and was not a natural comedian. He came to Hollywood to act; and he discovered that he had a talent for playing funny - first in shorts, then in features. He called himself a name as "Lonesome Luke," a Chaplin knock; With the "spectacle" character that made him the all-American boy, rather than a grotesque, Lloyd got his tracks and his films produced the best during the quiet era. <br /> <br /> He has developed a reputation as a "daredevil" in some shorts, and retains it in some of his best movies ("Safety Last", "For Heaven's Business", "Girl Shy") . He was more popular than Chaplin or Keaton in the twenties and he became very rich before the arrival of sound. <br /> <br /> The first audio movies were often disasters. To get the most out of their "sound", there is too much dialogue in many movies. <br /> <br /> After two decades, Lloyd's acting skills focused on silence. He didn't have a bad voice; its high pitch adapts its "glasses" character. And his sound films were not the unqualified disasters of the legend. Still, silent movies have raised a high art (especially Lloyd's, which is not budgeted and very well-crafted); With the introduction of talkies, films had to learn to walk again and they made some mistakes. <br /> <br /> While trying to move on with the times, Lloyd's best bits from his early (exaggerated) talkies were still visual - like the scene in "Movie Crazy" where he apparently drives a floating car but actually took a ride on his bike. <br /> <br /> Trying to regain the daring antiques that made him known, as he did in "Feet First," was wrong. (In "Safety Last", his best movie and the one who, with merit or not, moved Lloyd into the box as a "bravest comic", he played a determined young man climbing to the top. "Safety Last, "a natural has a structure that has followed the character of his character, the side of the building. He was, of course, scared, but his fear added to the humor. In" Feet First "he accidentally entered" His character was pathetic and curly, aspiration to save his neck - possibly an accurate statement of the 1930s, but not amusing.) <br /> <br /> Harold Lloyd wasn't in the past, like some Wacky Norma Desmond. He embraced sound and tried to take his movies in different directions, grow and change with the industry. When "Feet First" failed, he left the daring business and made a satire on the movie industry, "Movie Crazy". Just as he had to flicker through many movies as 'Lonesome Luke' before cutting his role in film history with the spectacle character, he tried several directions in sound films before he beat his sound in the sound he did with The Catspaw. <br /> <br /> In "The Catspaw" he plays a missionary's son in China, who is unconditionally elected mayor as a front for corrupt political interests. When he finds out the truth, he sets himself the task of cleaning the town. Only in the early forties could Lloyd still act as the unfortunate young man. <br /> <br /> However, the "Catspaw" was another checkout failure, and Lloyd made only three more movies, including the Milky Way. Of his main competitions, Chaplin still had quiet movies in him and Keaton was hopelessly mismanaged. "The Catspaw" and "The Milky Way" suggest that Lloyd could have mastered comedy if he was a little younger, or if audiences gave him the benefit of his early sound phases. <br /> <br /> Although the movie is unfairly angry at the way Lloyd's character cleared the town, it suits him. Of his days in "shorts", Lloyd wanted to scare his audience, and the climax of "The Catspaw" again reached it in a surprising way. until the art is revealed, it seems gruesome, and then the laugh comes. <br /> <br /> As a product of his time, "The Catspaw" is charming and funny. A very well-written healthy comedy, well handled by Lloyd. Targeted by Sam Taylor, his curious mix of drama and clever humor, it almost makes a Frank Capra or Preston Sturges comedy.
