to put aside the "I'm so sure" and "completely gnarly", it is one of the loveliest and vibrant novels depicted on film. Deborah Foreman (where is she now?) As Julie and Nicolas Cage as randy is as classic as Romeo and Juliet, Tony and Maria, Jake and Samantha. You can't help falling in love with them. Plus the soundtrack - the plunger, sparks, the fur, the flirts and of course the modern English - are also outstanding. For lovers of young love movies, I also want the recent movie to recommend all the real girls by David Gordon Green.
