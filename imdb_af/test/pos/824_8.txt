I haven't seen a Van Damme movie for a while, pleasantly surprised, he still looks, older, but louder, like Sly, gets more rough with age. It's a good movie and has encouraged me to check out all the Van Damme movies I've missed over the last ten years. I would like to see a good director of Van Damme on the big screen with a good plot. Van Damme still has the attempts to surprise the audiences, the last film seen at Van Damme was Legionnaire, it was also a good movie. In addition, I looked at Van Damme's early combat history. I also saw my surprise that he was the real deal in his younger years.
