Being American, I have not yet been exposed to this character, which is good because some of you have been disappointed. I have nothing to compare it to. I did not find pleasure in the inexorable idiotic humor in American teenage movies, and although it is a similar kind of humor, I couldn't stop laughing. I hardly get aloud out of a movie. And usually a movie has a few funny parts to me, but this movie was funny from start to finish. My only disappointment was when it was over. I'm actually going to buy it on DVD if I find it.
