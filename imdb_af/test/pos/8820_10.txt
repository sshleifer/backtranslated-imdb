Michael Sheen shines like the afternoon sun in this brilliant depiction of a comic genius. If you are familiar with Kenneth Williams' ways and diaries, this drama takes the essence of them perfectly. When I read about Kenneth hoovering in his swimsuit, I laughed and then it was brought on the screen, but this time I didn't laugh as it was in perspective as the act of a repressed and tortured man. It must have been such a lonely existence in Kenneth's skin, but it paid attention, but it had to be avoided if it really mattered! The last 20 minutes are sad as you see Kenneth gradually sinking to the depth of despair and suicide as the only alternative. I saw it a dozen times and still crying uncontrollably at the point where he is cheaply praying for LOUIE. I can't recommend this drama enough. Sexually explicit, but it drives home that Kenneth does not allow anyone to conquer his world and that is where the sadness of the man lies. For a genius who has brought so much happiness, it is so sad that his private life was so desperate and sad. Pauly.
