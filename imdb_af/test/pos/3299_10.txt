"Boy Next Door" is a hilarious skirt through male neurosis. In just over fifteen minutes, the film takes us on a journey that doesn't even match most full-length features. Great performances, excellent camera work and editing --- these are a classic from start to finish. Kudos to Travis Davis for the dual duty as director and star. He's been the funniest nebbish since Woody Allen. And what a bit to see Richard Moll again. If you thought everything he could do, "Bull" was the sheriff at Night Court, think again. This gem of a movie shows the brilliant funny writing by Stephen Garvey. Remember that name. Forget Charlie Kaufman, Steve Garvey is the true current king of the peculiar comedy.
