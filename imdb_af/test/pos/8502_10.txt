Don't forget the lover on the side! She is a 'hottie', Karen Parsons is nice, she is wonderful, in acting and beauty and style. It's just his Job! HO, now here is an indication that the writing hits you in the bowels and while you have doubled, you kick in the buttocks! With the quote from Peter's wife, she said when they watched the previews for the upcoming 'new' performances at an ABC networking party, she looked at her husband after the preview for 'the Job' played. and said, "It doesn't look like anything else on this network. You're in trouble." Meaning, it looks very good! But it doesn't look like the ordinary 'shiny happy people sitcom' or a drama that has been left over, and they (ABC) are often comfortable placing the Air. From the time I saw it, I made sure after the first episode that I didn't miss that time slot next week. I was immediately addicted to "The Job". Cut white and cynicism, outrageous situations and low role writers make this series a hit! <br /> <br /> Then I felt anger and a feeling of dropping, that the show just fell off the air. I wondered which executive had made the decision to break down a big comedy cornerstone for their network? <br /> <br /> I talked to other people knowing that some do not know, but I know that the stupid network did not promote it hard enough, or I have to say visually enough. If they had, it would have been at least 3-5 seasons, maybe even six. I just believe that notable network shortcomings and too much write down a 'formula' or another that they missed the boat. this one. There was so much room for expansion, it barely started. The situations were funny and serious, fast and sometimes slow, but not much, it was a good fit. A few years later, I finally found it on DVD for $ 50.00. For me it would be worth $ 1,000.00 to have it in my entertainment library. I was amazed when I went to DVD again for the third time and the end of the Betrayal episode went into a total drama segment with the discovery of a murder victim. It was better than most of the drama victims Unit 'and' cop 'now shows up !!! They became so serious in the scenes as a heart attack and so credible, they did as if they were not even beating. Just as it was serious, I was so impressed with the "versatile ways" that Tolan and Leary shared in story lines and scripts. <br /> <br /> In another indignation of the 'entertainment week' learned that the beautiful wardrobe, slips and expensive suits with printed shirts and ultra-stylish shoes ... all sold to the movie made for cable " In the cut "(2003) for only four hundred dollars, that's it !!! ! I am sick. Have you seen what they all wear for every show? A good jacket alone can run like that. <br /> <br /> This was Denis Leary at its best. I recommend this great cop 'dramedy' for east coasters or wherever you are in this country. I even heard that people from Ireland with Leary started joking the 'Bathroom' episode and returning repetitive lines from him because they saw it there.
