If you're looking for a modern movie version of Buster Crabbe or Johnny Weismuller's overcoming the popularity of unscrupulous, white safari guides or cunning, black tribes, while the animal kingdom is being saved, it's NOT the movie for you. It is a repetition of the Tarzan legend from its beginnings in intelligent, mature terms. It is beautifully filmed and true to the Edgar Rice Burroughs stories. <br /> <br /> Tarzan is no action hero, but a man who is cut between two worlds - the natural and the civilized. In a beautiful display, Christopher Lambert expresses this fear with absolute realism. If he only picks it up, the cat will be out of the way: the audience (especially the adult audience directed by the movie) will laugh, and the movie will lose its grip completely. It will fall into the coastal depths. But Lambert never lets this happen. (Forget what you can think of in other movies, when I see this movie at the theater on its original release, I thought he deserved an academic award.) <br /> <br /> The supporting role is uniformly excellent , as other commentators have noticed. I disagree with most of them because I couldn't find anything with Andie McDowell's performance. I wouldn't have nominated her for an academic award - the role is indifferent - but she's totally up to it, as it is. I don't know why her voice was overblown. <br /> <br /> The cinematography of the African segment of the story is absolutely beautiful. It impresses both the beauty of the African desert and the exotic expectation of the collective imagination of those who have never been there. The scenery is lush and exotic, and the colors are lively. <br /> <br /> But it's also a "time period" movie, and filmmaking also shows Victorian England in the countryside, countryside, city and interiors. The costumes are outstanding. The soundtrack is beautiful without being overwhelming or intrusive. <br /> <br /> There are some disturbing scenes - especially for animal lovers - but no more disturbing than some scenes in Dances with Wolves. This is an excellent film about the conflict between civilization and nature, personalized in the young Lord Greystoke, who is convincingly portrayed by Christopher Lambert.
