Such a shame that this wonderful bright spot on the small screen had such talent in writers and actors, such a wonderful scenery that was the ultimate escape for those who were in a terrestrial, sun-deprived state. Many of the actors went on bigger things ... another indication that something was wonderfully lost. At the time, I lived in Columbus, Ohio, with all my (now ex) husband's very large family in a chorus of "NO NO!" every time it is taken over by a baseball match broadcast. <br /> <br /> Someone who wrote here said it was against 'Rosanne' ... all my ex and I noticed that it was always always up for BASEBALL !! Yes, FOX has really messed up something that one and nothing will ever equate to! Thanks for the memories of that.
