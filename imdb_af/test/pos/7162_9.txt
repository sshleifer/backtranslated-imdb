As I hung from film to film to film at the SXSW Film Festival, this movie of the opening hours stayed with me. Curious because it is a dark comedy with quite an absurd premise. <br /> <br /> A car crash causes a family of hyper-disabled fundamentalists in a small community of the same thoughts. Three of the four have the same near-death experience in which they are fully opened, as each one receives a reversal of the concept of original sin (I will not spoil this scene with the details). The fourth, a middle school cheerleader, is not only the only one physically injured, but is also unchanged and is now witnessing what her crazy, apparently spiritually bankrupt, family has become. Every new moment brings a new outrage, as they have become innocent and honest in every possible way that makes her and then the community terrible. <br /> <br /> The forgiveness of the Franklins has the most beautiful sexual elusive scene between a man and woman I've ever seen, the Sarah Brightman song, "Deliver Me," a song now tearing in can bring my eyes. <br /> <br /> The movie is great. Robertson Dean as father, Vince Pavia as the boy and Aviva as the cheerleader daughter, is excellent, Mari Blackwell plays Peggy, the mother's questioning neighbor and best friend, perfect, a much more nuanced, full, true character than it (Everybody in Central America knows a Peggy). And Theresa Willis glows like Betty, the mother. There are many risks that actors play that play the three changed characters and pay off these risks. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie gets a great release. If so, I plan to see it again. /> <br /> Very accurate review at: http://www.fosteronfilm.com/phil/forgiving.htm
