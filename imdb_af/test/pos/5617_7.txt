A shining youngster interested in "serious" music (albeit a vanishing race - who plays the violin when no one can play the violin?) - can find an interesting fiction about street children and great musical stars. Heifitz was, indeed, the greatest violinist of his generation and the film gives him a scarce chance of displaying his technique. The kids, especially Gene Reynolds, are good and the picture is a good example of the first class studio ending at the end of the 30's. It doesn't hit the top of the big '39 list, but it's a great way for an intelligent family to spend a rainy afternoon with AMC or the Video Store. --- Strength at Blockbuster !!! !
