This movie is a love story found in the background of the war. Everything about the movie was perfect. I just saw the movie yesterday and I want to get my own DVD as soon as possible and watch it many times. The story ends when it started. I was very happy that he came back and I was proud of being a doctor and fulfilling her father's dream. She honored her father, boyfriend and her lover. The character had many shades. Christian Bale is also a phenomenal actor. Some stories have happy ends. Apart from the love story, I thought about how a beautiful, tranquil island was affected by war, and it made me realize that the real war of war could have on its people ... the government makes the decision while people are suffering. Her father was a very educated man and wanted more for his daughter while she had regular dreams. I loved the scene where she complained about not getting a dowry and I also loved the scene, both of which lived through the earthquake. They were survivors.
