This lesser-known movie with Roy Thinnes (From TV's Invaders) is actually what I consider a lost gem. It's made at a time when the story was more important that the special effects (although the effect is quite good for its time). A scientist theorises that there is another world in the Earth's Orbit directly behind the sun. Since the sun is always blocking it from us, we can never see it from Earth. Roy Thinnes was chosen to go on a mission to reach this world. I don't want to tell the rest of the plot because it will give away the rest of the movie. Let's just say there are some real surprises. <br /> <br /> The movie is Brits and has that good British flavor of acting in the TV series like The Avengers.
