After spending five years in prison, Thomas Reed, who was played by the imperishable Vincent Ventresca, moved him to the Vagrant fire and flowed the teeth bar. He soon met the nice, Angel-Faced Sunny (Alexandra Holden). "You're wicked." he told her. "You have no idea." she replied while grinding her Slo Comfortable Screw and dragging her cig. Reed finds himself entangled in the violent problems of her family and the femme fatal story unfolds against the desert and despair of the oil-drained western town. <br /> <br /> Canny direction. Great performances. Superior entourage work. And a few loop screens like the sun in the purgatory.
