I loved this movie !! Jack Black and Kyle Gass have probably made one of the best comedies since Up in Smoke. This movie has something for everyone: rock, drugs and Satan. What more could someone have? I present this movie to anyone who wants to sit back and forget all the problems in the world and enjoy a good laugh. Even if the movie doesn't go well in the theaters, it's definitely a cult classic. I suggest someone get the movie from the D's first album because many of the jokes are just made funny when you hear the songs (like JB's obsession with Sasquatch and the epic battle against the devil.) The movie is still is still guaranteed to be laughing, even if you haven't heard their music, but the songs are so great that you can't succeed.
