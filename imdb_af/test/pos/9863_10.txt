I have to warn you, there are some spoilers in it. But to start it off, I got a Spanish judge in February. It was mentioned that it was the last copy, but as I see it was not re-ordered. But somehow, I got it. I thought it was good. I especially wanted to see it because of the big actor, Matthew Lillard (I'm surprised no one mentions the reviews), although it's a low budget, to make enough money to make this movie worthwhile . Man, who is a good actor. <br /> <br /> The story is about an artist known as Jack (Matthew Lillard) who has "claims" to have merchandise called The Spanish Judges. If you don't know what Spanish judges have or haven't seen the trailer for, and that's the first review you've read, I won't even tell you what they are. I think it would be a big breeze for anyone who knew what it was. He needs protection, so he rents some who are also crooks, Max and Jamie (Vincent D'Onofrio and Valeria Golino) as well as a crook who goes by the name of Stuk (Mark Boone Junior). He has a girl who won't even tell her name because she's from Mars, as she said. So they (especially Jack) call her "Mars Girl". Everything starts well, but then it turns into one big game. A game that takes a little lust, lies and betrayal. <br /> <br /> There were a few involved (Matt and Valeria as well as Tamara were not one of them). There were some scenes they could have done better and the score could also have been a little better. The score was actually good. The theme they used for the beginning and end (before the credits) was a good song choice, that's my opinion. The battle scene in the end could have been a little longer and a bit more violent, but what can you do? Another comment on Matt: Damn, he plays a smooth, slick con man. <br /> <br /> I know it's a review, but I have to make a correction for NeCRo, one of the judges: Valeria Golino is not a newcomer. According to this site, she has been performing since 1983. For me, and hopefully for others, she is known as Charlie Sheen's Italian love interest in both the "Hot Shots!" movies. But good review. Although I think this is one of the rare movies I've seen and it's really good (that's why I gave it 10 stars above), I'll give the grade of what I thought when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> 8/10
