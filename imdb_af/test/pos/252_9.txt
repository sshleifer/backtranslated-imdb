It has a loan from a loan to Columbia for Gene Kelly's home studio MGM to realize its creative talent and give it control over what it has done in its own films. Cover Girl also became Rita Hayworth's signature film for the GIs and their pinup fantasies during World War II. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays a small nightclub in Brooklyn, where Rita is a well-known dancer and Phil Silvers, the cartoon. Of course, Kelly is helping himself there. <br /> <br /> Hayworth gets the attention of millionaire Otto Kruger, when it appears that Kruger loved and lost Hayworth's grandmother. In some playback sequence of the gas-light era, Hayworth also plays her own grandmother with Jess Barker playing the young Kruger. You can remember that Jess Barker was the man of the other legendary redhead screen, Susan Hayward. <br /> <br /> Broadway producer Lee Bowman is also attracted to Hayward, but he is not interested in nostalgia. He wants to revue her Ziegfeld Follies and in fact, Cover Girl's biggest song is the title song of the movie. This is well done in Follies style. <br /> <br /> Hayworth also gets a Sure Thing in a guest list era and sings in the only show song not written by Jerome Kern and Ira Gershwin. Hayworth also does an old English music hall number Poor John. When I say sing, as everyone knows Rita mouths words. Singing is done here by Nan Wynn. <br /> <br /> The biggest hit of the show is Long Ago and Far Away introduced by Gene Kelly. It was one of the greatest hits of the Second World War and one of the biggest sellers Jerome Kern ever wrote. It does indeed happen to be a favorite of my aunt, who will celebrate with my uncle 60 years of marriage in September. Long Ago and Far Away was nominated for Best Song, but lost to Swinging on a Star. <br /> <br /> What really sets Cover Girl apart and makes it a milestone movie for Gene Kelly is the two numbers, Put me to the test and the Alter Ego number. Harry Cohn decided to do what Louis B. Mayer refused at MGM to creatively control Kelly over his own material. Kelly later said the alter ego number was one of the hardest things he ever tried in his career. In it he dances with a light reflection of himself and the choreography is brilliant and complicated. <br /> <br /> In fact, after another loan-out movie, Christmas holiday at Universal, Louis B. Mayer, never lent Gene Kelly for the rest of the time he was at MGM. And then he got creative control. <br /> <br /> With those brilliant technicolor cinematography and Rita's red hair and Gene Kelly's boundless creativity, Cover Girl is a classic and will be forever.
