I didn't really think this movie was bad. Certainly, the detective sucked at what he did, and he usually accidentally arrived at Capt. Howdy happens, but he did the job. Capt. Howdy himself was pretty scary. The makeup artist did a good job. I really liked seeing Dee wearing everything geeky. I laughed so hard when I saw it. Personally, I don't see how anyone can sit through a shit like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and call it a wonderful movie, and then look at Strangeland, which is more disturbing, because many can actually happen to the internet that's so popular and call it not bad. Personally, I think Texas Chainsaw Massacre was very shit. Probably one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen. I enjoyed Strangeland. It was a very disturbing movie, because it actually happened.
