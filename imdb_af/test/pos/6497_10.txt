Excellent performance. There are still good actors! Also great direction and photography. Very true to Shakespeare, and a 'must' for all Shakespeare fans. Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved me to tears with his final monologue (short candle). He gave the sphere of moral decay and darkness a human face, making it more interesting. Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can sometimes be excited and sometimes she looks just like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil. If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics ... this is the one.
