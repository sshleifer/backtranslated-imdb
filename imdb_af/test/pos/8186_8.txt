To leave the disadvantages and shortcomings of the film left by other viewers, I have to say that it was a movie about me, which in my opinion is one of the most elusive illusions. I saw the drama of an emperor and people. It seems to me that the director wants to ask a question about what the benefit of nation is and what the price of "happiness" is for everyone. Is there justification for the forced benefit and "happiness"? How much can be forfeited for the country's security and peaceful existence? Is the idea of ​​a powerful kingdom worth reducing to misery and killing thousands of citizens now? It seems to me that the emperor himself does not know the answer and tries to learn it all the time the movie is running. He is desperately torn between these desires and at the same time psychologically plagued by the discovery of his true origin. He seems to hate his subjects to deny his father and his love, half love the people as a good emperor. No wonder his actions are controversial and emotions are confused. It seems to me another movie that represents the problem of power over other men, is the film a success.
