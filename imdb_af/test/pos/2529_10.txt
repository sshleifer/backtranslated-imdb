Movie about the failure of government and the selfishness of adults. Overwhelming impossibility to live and the way the children go to live. Just live. Stay alive in a cruel world. A nightmare world, we are afraid to see it, because we see the truth and are afraid to see it. Seeing a world of despair when we're all so comfortable in our own lives and even complaining about what we don't have if it's so trivial compared to someone else. They, the children of the movie, are dissatisfied. They are more than desensitized by what is around them. They see sex as an act, as they watch a TV show. When one boy is at the hooker, Pixote puts on the bed and looks with an empty star, no feeling. He wants to be a little boy and have a family, but the hooker has no compassion and pushes him away. A "human" film, with "human" relationships and moral judgment in an ugly, frightened, cruel world. Remind us that life is not fair, but you can still have a human connection.
