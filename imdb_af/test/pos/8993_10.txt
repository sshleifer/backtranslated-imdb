I wonder how someone on this movie can discipline. It is based on a real story. It is not necessarily about "Rugby" itself so for the one who is placed here to make a "real" rugby movie, you missed the point. It's not another typical sports movie where a team sucks, they hire Emilio Estevez and turn the team around and win the championship and give everyone the warm and fuzzies. It focuses on a story. It shows how someone can change his or her life to the better. The movies are now days about sex, drugs, party etc. It's Hollywood. I'm a big fan of movies, but I have to say it was an inspiring movie with a good message. If you consider yourself a "tough man", don't look at the movie, it won't meet your standards. If you want to see a good, inspiring movie, it's a good one.
