For once, a Barbie movie that is good. I'm 18 and embarrassed to say that, but I'm addicted to these movies. I hated Barbie when I was younger, but the movies I love. Shiver is so cute and I fell in love with him. He is as cute as the polar bear and totally in love with Aiden. Oh man, I'm in love with Shiver. I love Annika's determination not to give up on hope and it finally works. I love this movie and hopefully their others will be good. Barbie & Swan Lake is another brilliant movie. I would recommend this movie to kids of all ages (even boys) because the movie is so good and I'm hard to please. Barbie and the magic of Pegasus is a movie that is captivating and exciting.
