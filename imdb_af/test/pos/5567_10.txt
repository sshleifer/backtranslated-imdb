Farscape - is the one Sci-Fi show that restarted my interest in science fiction. <br /> <br /> But Farscape is so much more than ordinary and simple Sci-Fi. Comedy, Drama and more :) The Acting is very good. Fortunately, Farscape survived. This is cancellation and has shown to Peacekeeper Wars that it has not yet died. I hope there is a future for Farscape :) I think it's not a problem that some of the characters in the show are muppets. You have to look behind it and you'll see what a beauty Farscape is. <br /> <br /> Farscape sets a new standard in television and I think it will be really hard for new shows to prove they can be equal or better than Farscape. I love this show :) <br /> <br /> SaphirJD
