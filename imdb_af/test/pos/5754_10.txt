I own this movie on DVD and I watched it about 10 times and it is still funny. The jokes will never be boring and I have often burst out to laugh at inappropriate times to just think of them. The premise is that Richard and Eddie or Bottom Fame own the cheapest hotel in Britain next to a nuclear power plant. They desperately need cash and if a movie star is hiding to keep their luck, it may be. <br /> <br /> To see this movie and not be completely bored or frightened, you first need the humor. Some will say that only hardcore fans really enjoy watching it. But overall, it's a good movie.
