When she was gone, Doctor Who, Rose, her alternate father, Mickey, his alternate counterpart Ricky and Mickey's tiny rebels found themselves at the mercy of this reality version of the Cybermen. This second part of the 2 episode Cybermen bow feels more like an episode doctor, unlike the previous part that felt honestly like more of an episode of the chosen show "Sliders" that was awarded was a good performance in its own right. The bow as a whole was enjoyable enough as I am one to sign on to the slide that ANY Who is good Who, but at the same time it is inevitable that it will be compared to the Dalek episode of the previous series. And said that comparisons would just seem to be less work. I just feel that this story could have been done in one episode. Remember, in the first part of the review, I said that these kinds of stories about alternative realities usually have no lasting effects. Well, this is not the case here, but what changes does it feel overall, and not really in keeping with the character. /> <br /> My Grade: C +
