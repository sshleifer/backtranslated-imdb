I finally saw it on video after years of hearing about it. It is by no means a perfect movie, but it is strangely hypnotic - one of those rare, special movies that create its own world. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** First, the bad things. The scenes in Burkewaite's class are unfair. Even if the subject is Social Studies, this man is on top. His speeches are so overwhelmed, they are laughing. And no teachers I ever had, would make their students so whimsical and tell those who protested to "Shut up!" These scenes are short, but they break the mood and pull the viewer out of the story. How does Layne just get out of the police station near the end? What happened to Samson's car after driving the first scene in town? He spends the rest of the film by Layne or Feck. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Ahhh, Feck ... this guy is wonderful. Dennis Hopper steals the movie effortlessly. "Check in the post", "I love the company", "you are my friend" - each line is a classic. He gives Feck an internal logic that makes the story work. Incredibly, he empowers the audience for this man, especially when Samson talks about his (Samson's) future. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Crispin Glover is sometimes difficult to take. Still, the screens of him in the Beetle are perfect - kids with high-school cars always have something to do and buttons to do it. Matt's low key attitude makes Layne a good foil - their friendship is credible. Glover's ways are a bit, but he's consistent throughout. He drives the plot and expresses a sense of urgency that no one else does - just try to imagine this movie if Layne was as much of a zombie as Matt or Samson - snoozefest! <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** What causes "River's Edge" to be disturbing is that Samson is not really angry, in the ordinary sense. He is kind of a boring man who has become ill for granted - in other words, he is like thousands of other boring guys. After killing Jamie, he begins to unravel, creating some tension as we wait to see when he will catch up. *** END SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Part of the film's appeal is the way the action around teenage years is centered and their point of view. The parents are comic relief - Clarissa's mother, Tony's father - or overwhelmed - Matt's mother. It underscores how the children coincide for the attention that no one else gives. It keeps the story focused on the relationships within the click, and emphasizes that the only adult they can link to is Feck. "River's Edge" is a handbook on alienation. It shows how uncomfortable, mysterious and disturbing adolescence is like no other movie.
