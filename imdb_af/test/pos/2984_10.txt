Well ..... I don't want to hear anyone, but I feel the urge to say something I consider important about this BEAUTIFUL movie. I saw it for the first time in 1976 (I was 14) and then another year later. That was it. The rest of it was the pink LP of Elton John's soundtrack to get the music and the story deeper and deeper into my heart. How deep? A week ago my cousin gave me a VHS copy as a gift. (No DVDs yet). Boy .... was I surprised !! Poets have always maintained those deep children's and adolescent experiences of beauty, love, God, idealistic pursuit, staying with you forever. Since they are mostly at the heart's level (no intellect!), They define your soul's contours as a sculptor would do with a stone. If we sometimes do not forget how right they are, we will do better to understand the meaning of every minute, every decision, of every turning point of our lives. <br /> <br /> So, I confess I feel nostalgia. But the fascinating part of this is looking at the movie again, and through this journey back in time, enriching the understanding of why we, the 60s, grew up as we did. The spirit of those times is here: A genesis that is far from the official world of consumption and economic success does not make love, the beautiful pop bales, the poetry of the lyrics, a totally romantic view of adolescent rebellion with the Awakening of sexuality carefully wrapped in soft and social love, these two lonely spirits still full of childless innocence grow together as they learn and change mutual commitment into "adults". <br /> <br /> I showed the film to a group of school years and they left so sympathetic and cynical about it as naive and foolish. Boys, be serious !! Cinema is an art and as art it not only reflects human emotions, but historical moments. And that's exactly what "friends" do in a masterly way. It reflects an idyllic idea of ​​rebellion and new beginnings that we all dreamed of when we were 15. I am now a musician and I feel that some of us, artists for the cause, still dream of it! How else can we live? These are "friends", it's "Brother Sun Sister Moon", it's "Hair". It was the times, still strange to Aids, alien explicit and vulgar texts in pop songs without melody, pornography as sexuality, to this barbarous new world order that grows after September 11th. <br /> <br /> What a heartwarming experience is to see Paul and Michelle scrutinize the new fantasies of their romantic world at the same time. What a journey back to the heart of our hearts: to Paris, to Elton John at its best, to the urban scenario surrounded by 2 CV Citroëns and the VW Beetles. What a fresh air from the tranquil cottage in Camargue, surrounded by fish ponds and wild horses. They made us what we are, such as Serrat in Spain, Brel in France, Peter Paul and Mary, Joan Baez, Luther King, the Beatles, the early Bee Spirit, Belafonte's Spirituals, Gandhi, the Gospel of Elvis. <br /> <br /> People still hope: get this picture. Start with innocence and growth from there. You will find out what it is about. And from there you will have a solid and more truthful foundation; some ideas to look for in life, a way to deal with personal and world affairs. We need so much from this today! Give yourself the chance and maybe the time of cynics will end one day. (I have an extra VHS copy) <br /> <br /> Santiago Zuleta. Bogotá, Colombia.
