It's a madness in the Hitchcock tradition. You are kept in the dark as suspects come and go. Dennis Quaid is supurb as Dexter, a man doomed to die and Meg Ryan is excellent as his babe. There is not much to keep in this tiny tension and all the pieces fit neatly as they should. You won't be sorry, you watched this one if you want tension.
