Unlike the many who posted here, I'm not film-literate. I accidentally stumbled across this movie (channel navigating), and couldn't move away. It's an amazing movie, worthy of all the praise of the critics and those on this site talked about it. Those actors are great. Tatiana is beautiful and innocent. Her fiance Boris is sweet and patriotic. You can't help feeling Boris's father's outrage and sadness, as he realizes his son's folly as a volunteer to serve in the great war. <br /> <br /> Others summed up the movie so well, so I would mention just a few scenes that touched me the most. When Boris's brother told his family that he trusted with his brother and "had to marry Tatiana," Tatiana's twisted mouth disgusted her at this betrayal (although her share in the infidelity could be rape). You are afraid that the rest of the movie can make it right by just destroying Tatiana and the brother, or worse, Tatiana destroyed by an immoral descent in cigarette smoke decadence. Since it is not "French existential theater", it does not happen. Fortunately! <br /> <br /> Another scene that tears your heart is when the nameless "musician" soldier saved by Boris returns to tell Boris's father about the death of his son. He unknowingly breaks the news to Tatiana. I can't describe the sadness of this scene. Still, Tatiana finds a straw to grab and hopes Boris will come home. The musician never really buried Boris. <br /> <br /> I will no longer mention scenes, but note that the touch of Soviet political correctness does not detract from the film. Boris's brother is revealed as the piano player anti-Soviet slacker that someone who has to be his brother's wife should be. Undoubtedly he gets at least a "tooth" at the end of the movie! The end, when Tatiana finally knows for sure that Boris is dead, still manages to be happy and hopeful for the future. You don't even want to imagine the tears and catharsis that have been erased by the theater, when survivors of that war, with their own losses in mind, first saw. <br /> <br /> Incredible. Go see it.
