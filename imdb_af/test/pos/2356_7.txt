Warner Brothers manufactured this 3D extravaganza which was the biggest commercial success for Western in 1953. Guy Madison leads a group of guardhouse soldiers and misfits to rescue two white women held by Indians. The 3D format was in its early stages as a Hollywood gimmick to compete with the growing popularity of home television, and the effects work very well here. The rescuers settle down with the ladies and are pursued by the Indians until the white men stand on an island in a creek bed. The Indian armor is continuously being held at the audience, and a rattler-directed syringe of tobacco is thrown in well. Madison was quite popular as television's Wild Bill Hickock and is good as a displaced cattle farmer who has given his ungrateful task to the army. For all of the movie's prank and performance, the movie was made in just three days.
