It's at least very close to a perfect video publication. Messianic metal group, dinosaurs of rock n'roll, largest and most influential heavy band in the world play their hit songs and remind band's past. What more do we need? <br /> <br /> Beginning of "War Pigs" and ending with "Paranoid" and in the middle are all the biggest and most important classics of the original series included: "Electric Funeral", "Sweet Leaf", "After forever "," Iron man "," Children of the grave "... and of course my personal favorite" In the vacuum ", I'm glad they didn't leave it. Well, how can they? <br /> <br /> However, this video is more than just music. Ozzy Osbourne, Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward are all about the group's colorful history. The only thing that bother me a bit is when a live song is interrupted with interruptions. For example, it is necessary to inform how the song "N.I.B." does it have the name, right in the middle of it, one on top of the other? I doubt. It's still a small mistake, so it's not too big. <br /> <br /> Tire riders are also lazing around in chairs and chatting: pleasant material for a Sabbath fan! I admit I have problems following what Ozzy Osbourne is mumbling, but it's just amusing. I had the privilege of participating in the last dinner tour in Finland and for me personally this video is an ideal way to remember that beautiful show.
