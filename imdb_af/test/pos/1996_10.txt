This movie is the most impressive Turkish movie I've ever seen. Probably, "Okul" is the first Turkish horror movie. I must say I was excited as I watched the movie for reasons. The first reason is that the story is impressive. I mean that at the end of the movie you realized all the details of the movie. This makes the movie attractive and the other reason is that no Turkish man made such a movie as before. It shows that the Turkish film itself is improving over time. Although the first trial to make a horror movie, it was very successful. I advise everyone not to miss this movie ...
