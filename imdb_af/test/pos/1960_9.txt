I saw this movie a few times and found it very compelling and sad. The lack of true emotion of most characters is very disturbing. They look empty, hopeless. The story is based on a real event. <br /> <br /> A teenage girl is murdered by her boyfriend for no apparent reason - apparently he felt the same. Then he boasts about it to his friends, and if they don't believe him, he takes them to see the body - a few times. No one reports the murder. There are two strong clues. Keanu Reeves and Crispen Glover - Crispen Glovers character is seriously annoying. <br /> <br /> Keanu's character Matt seems to be the only one who is right and wrong. It's Keanu at its best - a flawless performance and very credible - anyone who thinks this man can't act must see this movie. Matt's little brother is almost the most disturbing character in the movie. Only twelve and no compassion or love factor in his life. It is very sad to think there are children out there. It makes you very grateful for what you have. 9/10.
