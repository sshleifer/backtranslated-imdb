I first heard of this show in 2005, first online and then (and of course, the purchase) the typically beautiful, BBC tie-in book. Then I got the DVD; it did not disappoint! I have hoped for years, someone would make a science fiction program with the emphasis on the excitement of discovery rather than strangers, laser shooting battles and other Hollywood boogyman gimmicks! Thanks, Joe Ahearne (also for you Dr. Wie works, and Ultraviolet - the mini-series, not the same-name crap movie)! What forced me to write it now (2 yrs later) was that I only saw SUNSHINE last night. And what appears to be in the same family as SPACE ODYSSEY turned around (about 2/3 of the way in). Freddy Krueger meets 2010! This was when SPACE ODYSSEY really stood out as a positive example of how to do a REAL science fiction movie; more science, less fiction! ODYSSEY (like SUNSHINE) also dealt with astronaut deficits (Zoe's failed EVA, Ivan's excessive effort on Venus, the dash of mission control) and the great danger of exploring new planets with unknown hazards (the deadly radiation peak on Mars). I would have easily paid to see it in a theater (I-Max, anyone?). And above all, not only was the space shuttle jumping beautiful, but the characters were also beautifully drawn. I found their interaction more realistic than the wall switch of SUNSHINE's Icarus 2 crew (Icarus, stupid name for a solar mission - did anyone read Icarus mythology?). Sometimes it takes a not-so-good movie to force one to watch a better movie again. As an armchair astronaut, I will exchange my walk on Icarus every day at Pegasus. In all fairness, however, SUNSHINE's footage is quite beautiful and memorable. That's why I have so much root to be successful as an honest-to-goodness-scientific film. So, although this review is almost a backdoor review of Sunshine, I hope it's read for what it was meant to be; strong support for a BBC phone directory that succeeds where most major budget fail, bloated movie letters. SPACE ODYSSEY (v. VOYAGE TO THE PLANETS here in the States) beats the appetite for solid, scientific fiction and delivers a banquet. I also really enjoyed the pseudo-documentary approach. Regarding the timing / light speed quotes, they are addressed if you pay attention. Where SUNSHINE melts, ODYSSEY stays cool. If you're considering going to the movies for another dose of SUNSHINE, stay in; rather go for a real SPACE ODYSSEY!
