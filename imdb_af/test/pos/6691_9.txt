Because of a very misleading advertising campaign, I saw the movie in the theaters at the relatively young age of ten. The trailers on TV portrayed the movie as a comedy and I bowed my parents until they took me. After I saw the movie, I was blown away. I had no idea what to think. Quite different from anything I've seen before, leaving many questions for such a young mind. Needless to say, I loved it. This morning I was the first time I watched in 2-3 years, and I still think it's one of the biggest films made over the past decade. Kevin Spacey and Jeff Bridges are both in the best shape, as a mysterious man who may or may not be from another planet, and the psychiatrist developing a bond with him while trying to decipher his mystery. The supporting film is also perfect, every resident of the spiritual institution is incredibly convincing in their own way. The open end is very well handled, and has given much evidence to support what you eventually believe. How this film did not receive at least a nomination in that year's Oscars is beyond me. If you haven't seen this movie, run to Wal-Mart now. The DVD is usually in the bargain, pick it up! <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
