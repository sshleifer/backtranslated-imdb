Batman Returns is more Gothic and gloomy than its predecessor, and I love it a lot. The landscape is also darker, and the whole area is saddened by the soul-cold music composed by so talented Danny Elfman. <br /> <br /> However, I didn't have the idea to make the idea Penguin a monster, unlike the comic books, where he is a man. Even if he looks like a monster, he does well to possess a human dignity, and I felt very sorry for him when he saw the tombstones of his old parents. But he was indeed a dangerous villain, and he had to be stopped. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton made a "tour de force" with his return as the Dark Knight, and this time he is powerful as in the original Batman. It is not difficult to understand why he is sometimes called Batman in public. <br /> <br /> Also, Michelle Pfeiffer is so sexy and well-equipped in her role, and she has delivered a faithful performance as the female villain / crime fighter dressed as a cat. Really, the actors have done a mastered work with Batman Returns, which made it a successful movie. <br /> <br /> If you like Batman, watch his awesome sequel, as it is very worthy of all the Dark Knight's hard core lovers. <br /> <br /> Steve Baillargeon
