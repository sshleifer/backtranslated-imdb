Just watched this movie and it's not bad; There are a few tense moments and not a very long dialogue strings. Come off as reasonably intelligent; fast trapped almost like 'documentary style'. This movie will call nostalgia and a little cold war paranoia with cars, street scams and life in the fifties. The play is pretty sturdy and at a 85 minute walk it goes well. An atomic era movie buff shouldn't miss this one.
