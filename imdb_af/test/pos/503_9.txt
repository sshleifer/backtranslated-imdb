For a short moment. The opening scene with Traci Lords and the <br /> <br /> techno bar is incredible. I will probably follow her after my ultimate death! Best vampire movie of all time, but with a twist. The battle scenes are awesome. Wesley Snipes shows an athletics that you don't see every day. And Stephen Dorff is impressive and very credible as an ambitious new site that necessitates the hierarchy in any way. Great movie 9/10. Where is Blade II?
