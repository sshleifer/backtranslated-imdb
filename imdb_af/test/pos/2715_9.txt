Comeundone, I love you! I couldn't have come to a better conclusion than you did about this movie and it ended. My family hasn't seen this movie yet, but I know them too well; they will hate it. But this time I saw it alone and I found it very much affected. Although the movie is long, I was tied to the story and surprised at the end. Initially I thought it was weird how she just disappeared, but at some level it made sense. <br /> <br /> But as comedone said, this movie doesn't make sense of reality. Instead, it does it and the viewer must think strongly about what the word "normal" means. It also gives you the insight to personally think about what the end means, I can say I loved how it ended and I'm happy for Mithi.
