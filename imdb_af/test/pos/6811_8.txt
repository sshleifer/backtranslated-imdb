The first in a new style of movies for Lamas-no tattoos, motorcycles or karate. I miss them. But it's a serious movie. He plays an FBI professor who has lived with the bad guys for so long that he no longer trusts anyone, including himself. Gary Busey is either a good actor or someone I don't want to meet in broad daylight on a busy street. Kristen Cloke pursues Lammas as doggedly while following the serial killer. There is one surprise after another, as the story unfolds, not least of what the end is. It never seems to come - there is always one layer to the story. Cloke and Lamas start as the good guys, turn in the bad guys and somehow make the heroes. But it's definitely worth the rent. For maximum enjoyment in sweets, a bag of popcorn and a cool drink. You're going to the movie!
