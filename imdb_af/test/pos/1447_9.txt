If you like your movies to pull your emotions out of you, if you like your movies with a guy you can root and relate to, if you want your movies in black and white, you should see this movie ! Keep it from start to finish, because you don't want to miss a friend. It is sometimes slow and it makes you wonder when something is going to happen, then the plot is unfolding, you will be on the edge of your seat! I know I was! My mom told me about this movie, because our family has gone through the same things as the movie. We loved Frankie, who plays the lead convincingly. What you ever think of Frank Sinatra, put it aside, in the film he is slim and he does not sing, so keep an open mind. For the era in which it was created, it tells a story that is still being told in homes across the country today, and most likely the world. Please, if you like older movies, give this one a try.
