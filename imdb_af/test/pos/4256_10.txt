If you get the chance to get these lost (for many years) gems, I doubt you'll be disappointed. PS has a strange mix of social satire and ultra-cool blaxploitation - even slapstick tips, but it's so strange that it wasn't just that time. There is nothing like it. <br /> <br /> I strongly agree with people who say the movie is dated, especially with Spike Lee's "Bamboozaled" (SP) a few years back, which was a rubbish to try the same message capture. <br /> <br /> Robert Downy's direction is brilliant so many of his actors improvise, the movie gets better than it goes and the jokes of one or the other are so forgiven that those in a Mel Brooks comedy, a mere non-computer. "I can't believe they just said it's fun. <br /> <br /> Favorite parts, the ads. The film switches from black and white depictions of the advertising agency to beautiful (maybe 16mm) color and gets rid of it. <br /> <br /> I refuse to hint at any spoilers, but if you get the chance to see the DVD version, make sure you watch the Downey interview (but first leave it to the movie.) <br /> <br /> My voice 10/10 - the most underrated movie of the late 60's, early 70's. Thank you prince.
