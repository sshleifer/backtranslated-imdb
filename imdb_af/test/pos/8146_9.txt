When I was told about this movie, I wasn't too happy to see it, although it was at the end credits, one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> the movie itself is very graphic (male to male, you don't see everything) would not be a gay theme movie if not ... <br /> <br /> the movie is very Lights with humor and some very funny parts. I recommend this movie, about 3/4 through you, really feel for the main characters, and I think bringing the whole movie together. <br /> <br /> Once again, very nicely compiled. plus cute Mormon.
