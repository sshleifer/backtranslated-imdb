The ultimate gritty heist movie. Elements of Bogie, Welles & Sinatra let you sweat and be satisfied. In comparison, it really makes the proverbial apple cart to see recent movies, such as "Oceans Eleven (remake)" reviewed so much, especially in Europe. Films like Rififi should be shown, spoken and kept alive to remind younger (pathetic) critics what the true classic Noir is. <br /> <br /> Criterion must be praised in their flawless and classic transfer.
