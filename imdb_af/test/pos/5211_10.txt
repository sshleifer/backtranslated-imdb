For the main criticism of the movie ... The love story: it was not a love story. These were two people who got confused to find humanity in ANYONE. The same thing happened to soldiers and the Russian boy. It added a female touch, but came to look at American movies ... not so close to love story. There was no storyline: did war have a storyline? I think it's a stupid criticism. The storyline is this. They start with 400 men and the film is cut off to show the lives of about 10 men and how each one did and died. Death is the ultimate end to any story. Just because there was no happy ending, it doesn't mean it has a storyline. <br /> <br /> There was a terrible truth in this movie. I don't necessarily call it "anti-war". This, of course, had a political statement, but the film was not just about politics. In fact, except for some events when the captain? Arrived, there was never a suffocating air from Nazi Germany. They were far enough out of reach of the main Nazi party. The fat cats are not going to Russia! <br /> <br /> Perhaps not quite accurate and not a Hollywood hit, but it shows a fine knowledge of the common soldier (I want to say exactly and almost any nationality) and what they have to go through. It was a lost battle, of course the movie would be depressed. And to the person who said it was foolish (and foolish) to portray Germans as victims: there are victims from all sides in every war (any real soldier will tell you). <br /> <br /> This movie is a good balance between film and documentary. A few problems with that if you just argue for one, but it sets the best of both worlds. See it as such. However, be careful because it's a hard movie to see if it's not graphic, emotional. <br /> <br /> I wait until they make a movie about Iraq. It will probably have many of the same themes and will be very controversial. I want to see who has the trouble to do it first. (Jarhead doesn't count)
