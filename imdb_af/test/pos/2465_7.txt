Emilio Estevez actually directed a good movie - who would have thought? I directed by two previous films Estevez - "Wisdom" (with then friend Demi Moore) and "Men at Work" (along with brother Charlie Sheen). They are lousy movies --- poorly acted, directed, stupid and offensive. Estevez is a good actor, but has been named director. I turned it on in pure curiosity - it has a good role to play and I have nothing else to do. Prohibited if it didn't catch me. <br /> <br /> It's about Estevez coming from Vietnam, and is permanently shocked by what happened. His parents (Kathy Bates, Martin Sheen) and sister (Kimberly Williams) are trying to reach him but can't. Something in Vietnam has hit him deeply ... and he is exploding ... <br /> <br /> A little over but still very good. Much of the material is familar but the throw is so good that it looks like it's new. Estevez is good, Sheen is great (and Estevez's real life father), Williams touches and Bates is just extraordinary - try to keep the family together. This leads to a powerful end that really surprised ME. <br /> <br /> It's worth catching. <br /> <br />
