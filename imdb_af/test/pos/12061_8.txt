I really like this series. His funny and unique style of wall, sometimes controversial comedy, is a fresh action on the genre. While it is a sitcom, it comes out because of what may be awkward topics. <br /> <br /> Every aspect has a comedic turn, and the performance is really good. My favorite part of the program is the strange commentary of the dad, dave. its rants break the program and allow a very good flow. not perfect, because sometimes the comedy does not come out loud, and the actors sometimes look for an audience response, but otherwise this program is good. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend this program, and I'm very sad that it was canceled. please make another series and complete it properly
