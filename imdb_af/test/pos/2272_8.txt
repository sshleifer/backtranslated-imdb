It is precious. Everything is illuminated, is sweet and sublime funny from the first glorious dialogue. Oh, how I wait to get to Austin. While Elijah Wood is such a charm as Jonathan Safran Foer (the actual author of the novel Everything Illuminated), it is Eugene Hutz (playing Jonathan's Ukrainian tour guide and translator, Alex) who really steals this role. Alex is a hip-hop lovin 'Ukrainian break-dancer who helps with his grandfather Jonathan finds the woman who saved Jonathan's grandfather's life during World War II. The Ukrainian countryside has never looked so breathtaking. I am thinking of packaging and moving to the former Soviet state. <br /> <br /> The tone of the movie, however, moves when Jonathan and Alex finally meet the woman they are looking for, and suddenly this worshiping comedy is in a heartbreaking historical drama about a Jewish village during the Nazi occupation was erased. Everything is enlightened about history, heritage and the wisdom that can be gained to uncover the past. It's perfect.
