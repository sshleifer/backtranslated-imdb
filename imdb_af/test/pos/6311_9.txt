OK, I'm Italian, but there's not so much Italian film like this. I think the plot is very good for 3/4 of the movie, but the final is too simple, too predictable. But that's the only small mistake. The Consequences of Love, in my opinion, have great ranges in the beginning and a good soundtrack. I really like the lighting on it. The best thing about it is a great, good actor. You know, if your name was Pacino, everyone would still talk about this performance. But it's just a great theater Italian actor called Toni Servillo. Yes, someone tells me this movie and this kind of show is too slow, it's so boring, so much silence, but I think these components are fantastic, it's the right way to describe the love story between a very talented young girl, the great daughter of Italian actress Anna Magnani, Olivia and the old mysterious man Toni. One of my favorite Italian movies.
