On June 14, 1905, during the Russian Revolution of that year, sailors aboard the Russian war ship Potemkin rebelled against their oppressive officers. Frustrated by the second-class treatment they receive, and especially the seasoned meat they are forced to eat, the ship's crew, led by inspiring Bolshevik sailor Grigory Vakulinchuk (Aleksandr Antonov), decides that time is ripe for a revolution. And so begins Sergei M. Eisenstein's exciting classic Russian propaganda, "Bronenosets Potyomkin / The Battlehip Potemkin." <br /> <br /> The movie itself is full of shining examples of beautiful visual images: the glasses of a overturned captain dive fine of his rope over which he was thrown; The body of a deceased mute lies peacefully on the shore, the sign on his chest reads "PREVENT FOR A BOWL SOUP;" close-up shots of the pounding fists of the hundreds of spectators eventually fed the Tsarist regime; a foolish baby career runs down in the Odessa Steps as desperate spectators watch with a rush of breath (this scene is memorable by Brian De Palma for a particularly exciting scene borrowed in his 'The Untouchables'); many cannons are ominously similar to the vast Potemkin battleship. <br /> <br /> But the movie itself was best analyzed? not as a fragmented selection of memorable scenes ?? But as a single movie, and indeed, every scene is extremely memorable. Although divided into five reasonably clear chapters, the whole movie flows wonderfully forward; At no stage do we find ourselves interested, and we are absolutely never in doubt about whose side we should be sympathetic. <br /> <br /> The movie is often referred to as "propaganda" and that is exactly what it is, but it does not have to carry a negative connotation. "The Battleship Potemkin" was made in mind by Eisenstein for a specific purpose, and it achieves it in every way. Planned by the Soviet Central Committee to coincide with the 20th century celebration of the unsuccessful 1905 revolution, 'Potemkin' was predicted to be a popular film in his homeland, symbolizing the revival of Russian arts after the Revolution. It is a little unfortunate that Eisenstein's film did not perform well at the Russian box office. According to reports, Allan Dwan's 1922 Robin Hood movie was beaten in his opening week and ran for just four short weeks. Fortunately, although it has banned several occasions in several countries, the Battleship Potemkin fared far more admirably. <br /> <br /> The film also proved that Eisenstein could test his theories of "montage". Through quick cuts and hidden shots of the multitude of extras, the audience is not allowed to sympathize with any individual characters, but with the revolutionary population in general. However, Eisenstein briefly breaks this form into a scene where Vakulinchuk flees the ship's officer who tries to kill him and, of course, during the well-known Odessa series, while our hearts, in the horror of the accident of the unhappy child, tearing in the tumbling baby. The accompanying soundtrack to the version I watched, mainly with the orchestral works of Dmitry Shostakovich, served wonderfully to increase the emotional impact of such scenes. <br /> <br /> One of the greatest films of the silent era, The Battleship Potemkin, is a triumph of phenomenal film-making, and is an important piece of cinematic history. The highly exaggerated events of the film (among other things, there was never a violent massacre on the Odessa steps) reminded them so much that we are often uncertain about the true history behind the depicted events. It's a great achievement.
