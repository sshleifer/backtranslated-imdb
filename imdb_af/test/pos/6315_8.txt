The Effects of Love: There is really something special about this movie, but it's very difficult to put your finger on it. It's a love story of a kind, but not really one I've seen before. It has several love themes that are performed throughout the film. One loves love for a younger woman, a younger man loves his older brother, the mafia love of money at all costs. It's just a few that fall into a story you guess or rather don't know where and how it will end. The movie is all excellent from Sophia, the teasing barmaid, to the straight face to watch the movie's central character. With a simple but affective camera, the work of an ever-changing soundtrack has played down that mixes low-fi trip with luxurious orchestras. The style of the movie changes beautifully with various styles without ever getting junk. Love has never looked so diverse and powerful, as the stories we tell are rumbling about various conclusions. The director is old and newly married in a rich Italian classic.
