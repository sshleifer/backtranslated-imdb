Oz is one of the most sensible and addictive TV experiences ever. <br /> <br /> After catching pieces of it on SMT, I was initially skeptical, but when I finished the 4th season, I unfortunately know that this brilliant performance is coming to an end, (6 seasons), and yet I can't get enough of OZ yet. <br /> <br /> Want something that will push your senses and your stomach to the limit ... Oz adjusts the bill, hands off. <br /> <br /> It's not kids' stuff, people, its violent, brutal, and not pretty. Why, this is an experimental unit within a maximum security prison. <br /> <br /> Tom Fontana's Oz is brilliant in all the right departments, actors, writing and directing. <br /> <br /> HBO's Oz site is also highly recommended for newcomers for information on this series. It was the first one hour show produced by HBO and it proves what a masterpiece is and that others will follow. <br /> <br /> Thank you HBO
