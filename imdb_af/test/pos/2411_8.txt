OK, so it is a complete finishing of the first Karate Kid. However, I think there may never be too many movies like the first Karate Kid. There is something about this type of story that looks particularly like people like me. You get an overall feeling of overcoming by finding out new things about yourself. In this movie, Hillary Swank is a special gem than the Next Karate Kid. You can really say that she has a bright future ahead of her. <br /> <br /> Not to say this movie is not without problems. Unlike the first, Mr Miyagi seems to be a bit too eager to get Julie to learn martial arts and engage her in the fight. It almost seems he has forgotten what his values ​​of the first movie were. There must also be a suspended unbelief when the monks are examined. The film makes monks appear to be too simplistic, and does not really explain why they do what they do in the plot. The villains are also a bit dubious, even if they are really hateful bad guys. I also have a suspicion of Martial Arts movies ending on prom night. <br /> <br /> So maybe it's not a perfect movie. So maybe it's not the best movie to rent on a Friday night. But in more ways than one, it's a guilty pleasure. Hillary Swank loves it, and the story, though unoriginal, works. In a genre of movies that seems nothing but action and violence, it's a fresh air. Unlike all Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van-Damme, it is a movie about the spirit and the heart. There are some people who need such movies, and we'll take everything we can get. My rating: 8/10
