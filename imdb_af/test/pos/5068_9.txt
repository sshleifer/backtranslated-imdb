Very good political excitement about the aftermath of terrorism and the use of political torture to reach the goals of the terrorists. <br /> <br /> The story is intertwined with two families being adversely affected by terrorist events. <Br /> <br /> This is one of Meryl Streep's best roles in years. She plays a cold, calculating, clever director of the CIA that allows these things to continue. She is from the George Bush Dick Cheney School to deal with the war on terror. If her part was expanded, Miss Streep would definitely be at Oscar time for an award. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero. A CIA agent who really can't keep going. <br /> <br /> We have a terrorist who actually has a heart and it costs him his life in this well-directed, fine movie. <br /> Alan Arkin briefly appears in a fixation senator. Mr. Arkin looks better with age.
