SPOILER WARNING <br /> We all heard the "Boy Who Cried Wolf" legend. But what if the wolf was a person in the modern world. Well, this can be something like Big Fat Liar. Fourteen-year-old Jason Sheperd (Frankie Muniz of Malcolm in the Middle) is always in trouble. One day he was under pressure to write an English essay, but it was raised in the hands of the sloppy movie maker Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti). He plans to turn Jason's story into a Hollywood group. Nobody believes Jason when he once tells the truth and ends in the summer school. However, Jason is determined to prove the truth to his parents and to L.A. with his friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes). When Wolf refuses to admit, he gave up his story, Jason plans to make Wolf's life a living hell. B.F.L. is not a masterpiece, but it is a great way to spend 90 minutes of your time. I wish they could have made it a little longer and there aren't so many pranks, though they are smart enough (I like the pool dye best). Maybe I didn't like that much if it wasn't for Paul Giamatti. He is simply hilarious in this. If you kill 90 minutes, try it out. You can just enjoy it.
