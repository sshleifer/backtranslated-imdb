It is a fairly faithful adaptation of Masuji Ibuse's novel, "Black Rain." Like the book, it is very moving and thoughtful. The story revolves around a couple's efforts to see that their cousin is married. They struggled to find publishers because of a rumor that she was suffering from radiation sickness after running on Hiroshima's day of bombing. Well filmed, well-acted, moving, tragic, terrible and funny.
