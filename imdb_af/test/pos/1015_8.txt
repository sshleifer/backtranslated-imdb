I am strangely attracted to this movie, as I saw it on Showtime somewhere in the early 80's. I say oddly, because it is quite a ridiculous piece of soft-core fluff, a genre I'm not very interested in. The dialogue is pumpy and unconsciously philosophical (it makes no doubt not only the French-Italian producers) and the plot quite strange. What this achieves is a wonderful hypnotic and well-pleasing mood. The scenery (the beautiful Philippines), soft focus nudity and wonderful count all contribute to a strange and extremely vigilant exercise in a kind of rarely seen film. This is truly one of my great "guilty pleasures". I was lucky to find it on an old laser disk and watched it more often than I think was healthy. A valuable mood.
