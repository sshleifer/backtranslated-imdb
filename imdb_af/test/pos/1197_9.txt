Hair is one of my favorite movies of all time. Not even part of my generation, I've watched this movie 9 times and I can't get enough of the beautiful message of understanding, passion, beauty and love. This movie is against the Vietnam War and shows how people need to be united regardless of color, origin, religions and classes. I love the characters Berger and Woof and I think Central Park of the 70's is one of the most beautiful places I've seen in my life. <br /> <br /> By the way, I still have this music in my mind: <br /> <br /> When the Moon is in the Seventh House and Jupiter aligns with Mars, then peace will lead the planets. And love will manage the stars. <br /> <br /> This is the dawn of Aquarius's age The age of Aquarius Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> Harmony and understanding abundance and confidence No more fakes or decisions Golden living dreams of visions Mystical crystal revelation And the true liberation of the mind Aquarius! Aquarius! <br /> <br /> ps: I'm surprised to see that the director of this movie is the same director of AMADEUS. I just love both movies!
