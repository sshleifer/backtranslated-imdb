It is one of the best movies on the French Revolution ever made. Being a well-versed person in the period I was amazed at the level of detail. The costumes are on the point. Even the detailed day-to-day items such as ink pits, signs, etc. Is everything perfect. As an American living in France, who has access to the sites in the film through his membership in several historical associations such as the Napoleonic Alliance, I cannot say how impressive I was with the visual accuracy of the film. <br /> <br /> The dialogue, where known, is virtual quotes and the one that is not recorded is in character. I was very happy with this movie and am disappointed that it is not yet on DVD. This is how historical drama should be done. Must see ....
