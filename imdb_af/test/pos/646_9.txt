Loving this little movie, reminding me of the original Japanese gem, WE WILL DANCE? (not the remaining Gere / Jlo remake.) Fortunately, I found it tied up when it was shown on a STARZ Promo weekend, as it is not available on DVD as far as we know. I will just look at anything with Yancy Butler (someone remembers the short-lived TV series MANN AND MACHINE ???), and she looks positive. She does a dance routine after a disco song that is verrrryyyyyy HOT !! Love all the other characters in it, especially those played by Patrick Stewart and Leslie Caron (where has she been for years?). It's one of those movies that I take out from time to time and always get away to smile after I watch it. Highly recommended !!!
