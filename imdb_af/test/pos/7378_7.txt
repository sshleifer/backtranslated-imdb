While traveling in a dangerous zigzag on a lonely night road, teenager Cliff (Jay R. Ferguson) has a car accident with his friends, Lauren (Christine Taylor), Alex (Kim Murphy) and Eric (Christopher Masterson) ). While the cold night is stranded in the bush around a campfire, they kill time to tell ghost stories. In the "Honeymoon", couple Rick (Ron Livingston) and Valerie (Jennifer MacDonald) travel to Las Vegas in their honeymoon. Rick takes a short cut to visit the Clayton Caverns at night, but the stranger Cole (Hawthorne James) commands them to leave the place as dangerous creatures attack people in the full moon. In "People Can Lick To", on the eve of her twelfth birthday, Amanda (Alex McKenna) tells her internet friend Jessica that she is alone at home. However, Jessica is actually a psychopath. In "The Locket", the biker Scott (Glenn Quinn) crosses the country on his motorcycle. If he has a problem with his bike, he finds a secluded home where the beautiful dominee Heather Wallace (Jacinda Barrett) lives with her father. When the man comes out of his herd, Scott finds the truth about Heather. <br /> <br /> "Campfire Tales" offers three good horror stories, with monsters, psychopaths and ghosts and a surprising turn in the end. The worst segment is "The Hook," with Eddie and Jenny, but the other stories are wonderful. The plot point is completely unexpected and gives a good conclusion to this above horror movie. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazul): "Contos da Meia-Noite" ("Midnight Tales")
