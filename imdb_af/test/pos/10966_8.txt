It ends with the statement that "the movie you just watched was an improvisation". Once you feel an idiot thinking about an improvisation, it was a good movie and once again surprised by Cassavetes' genius. Of course, Cassavetes told someone it wasn't really an improvisation in itself, on his deathbed, so ... that's the story of a shiny black woman, Lelia, going for white and her family: for-white brother named Ben, and a black-black brother named Hughie. When she falls in love with a white jerk called Tony, he is unpleasantly surprised when he finds out that she is black, and from there it is about the individual aspirations and shortcomings of the three main characters. Hughie is a jazz singer in the process of becoming a failure. Lelia is still hopelessly depressed over Tony, and Ben is anxious and violent in general, in the need to shock him from his outdated subsistence patterns. Overall, I think it's really about stasis vs change in human life. I suspect Cassavetes organized the plot, and it was just the improvised dialogue. The dialogue itself is very uneven. Sometimes someone will say something memorable, other times it is memorably uncomfortable. What is great is the scope of the amateur actors' personalization of their characters. Cassavetes was whispering in the ears of the top ten students through the stage class he learned when he decided to do Shadows, and that was the result. The guys playing Ben and Hughie are very good. Initially I didn't like Lelia, but as the film progresses, you see more and more, she is one of the actors who get better as the tension and drama build - not necessarily the best with small talk. Shadows are widely regarded as the forerunner of the India movie movement (made in 1959) and it is definitely recommended.
