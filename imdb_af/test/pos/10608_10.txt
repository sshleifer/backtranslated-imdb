I just watched Marigold today and I started to say that I found this DVD on the Blockbuster shelves. As I walked around, looking for something new and good to watch, Ali Larter's picture caught my eye. <br /> <br /> After I slammed over Ali Larter, I picked up the cover and looked at the cover. From the viewpoint, I thought the costumes were a little over. And then I saw the other Indians on the cover and thought it was a kind of ghost film or something like that. <br /> <br /> When I sat down over the synopsis and saw Salman Khan, I did a double job. Salman Khan in an American movie with Ali Larter in a DVD at Blockbuster? Because Salman Khan is to Hollywood movies like Mel Gibson to Hollywood movies, I had very high expectations for this movie: it had to be good! I'm very happy to say that Marigold is a phenomenal movie! It surpassed me and all my personal expectations! <br /> <br /> I think a movie like this is what happens if you have a decent writing, talented, experienced, knowledgeable and goal-oriented director, two amazing actors are playing the lead and just a very hard working support team and crew! Khan and Larter seem to have great chemistry together and both shine on the big screen: they really look good together. The music numbers were not bad at all, it was surprising, as the eastern and long Indian movies are nowadays. And you'll be happy to know that Indian costumes are far from stocking you. <br /> <br /> The start of the movie was a bit slow, the waist was really good, the screens that led to the climax were pretty dramatic, but the end was just fantastic! However, I have a few complaints and complaints about the DVD. Having loved the widescreen aspect ratio of the DVD, I didn't like the fact that several other things were left out of the DVD. There are no captions for starters. If English is my first language, it's not a problem. But when some of the Indian actors and actresses spoke, it was (sometimes) difficult to understand what they were saying; captions would have helped. <br /> <br /> Another thing I would appreciate on the DVD would be a bluer roll or a sort of collection issue. And finally, how about a menu feature that allows us to hit right on the musical numbers? Man, some of those songs were really good! On the other hand, I really enjoyed making Marigold. <br /> <br /> I have more to say about the cruelty of this movie and how much I liked it, but I don't have the time I want to keep writing why I enjoyed it so much. I hope Salman Khan will add more English films to his Hindi films and I hope this Hindi movie will not be Ali Larter's last Bollywood movie. And I encourage the director to continue making Bollywood filmmakers with Salman Khan, Ali Larter and other big name actors - make sure the scriptures are original and good. <br /> <br /> 10/10 - It's just a great love story movie that your entire family can enjoy!
