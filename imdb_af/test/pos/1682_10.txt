The plot line is uncovered by American politics. While the theme is common, making the movie is the unconventional way of telling the story. <br /> <br /> The characters are played with conviction. You feel the innocence of the head and lose innocence. The politician is the prince of double talk, a real snake. <br /> <br /> The camera work is impressive. This confirms the nuances of acting and dialogue. It's for the music. <br /> <br /> The story uses a parable style with fingertips where the message is filled with double-entenders. A very easy strategy by the author / director. The tension in the storyline is transmitted to the last screens. <br /> <br /> The movie was like a good puzzle book. Something was "going on"; you knew it was bad; you didn't know exactly what it could be; you had your suspicions; And when the evil was revealed, you left out your breath. You didn't notice that you were holding on. Sad, shake your head. <br /> <br /> A story well written and well told. 3 screams to a young writer / director.
