Agree that this movie and this talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve. Here is the hope that the DVD will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience. The actors performed excellently and the plot is excellent. Perhaps the movie may have been a bit long, but May Miles Thomas seems to be enjoying his actors when they perform strongly, so they sometimes take longer than necessary. Good for the actors, I'm sure, but sometimes when the audience is ready to continue talking to the plot. May Miles Thomas earn more recognition from the Film business than one of our leading digital film directors,
