Along with the even more understated, The Sun Shines Bright, Wagon Master was one of Ford's favorite films. It is a western of extraordinary beauty and narrative purity. It's good by Ford's stock company, including Jane Darwell, Alan Mowbray, Ward Bond and Harry Carey, Jr. Like almost all of Ford's films, it is a meditation on freedom and community. It is also noteworthy for a much more positive portrayal of Indians than in most of Ford's movies. Ford, for all its mistakes, remains the supreme poet of American Democracy.
