I can't say how many times that one line has made me laugh, or how often have I described the scene to people who aren't familiar with this movie. I saw it the year it was released, I was 19. I don't think there were a dozen people in that East Village theater that night. For years I thought we were the only ones to see it. Nice to see that others have seen it as hysterical as I had, and see it lasting value despite the time that has passed. Rent it, buy it or steal it .... a must see.
