Gray can jump the English language through hoops like no other. He tells a number of events, tied up by writing a manuscript (the "Monster" of the title), a little sad, some uneasy funny, all in its characteristic, sarcastic manner. If you want to keep swimming Cambodia, you will love this one. I actually thought it was a bit more interesting and better said as "Swim to Cambodia". A true masterpiece.
