Duck_of_Death has to watch this movie again, because his big criticism is absolutely basic. The movie never forgot about the delay, and it is explicitly mentioned in a few places. The crew was never shown with mission control talks that did not meet the delay rules. <br /> <br /> One thing I thought was a bit far-fetched, was the amount of risk involved - would a crew land On a planet on which print packages lasted only two hours? I doubt it. Would a manned spaceship go into a star's corona? I doubt it. Will people land on a moon bombarded with large amounts of radiation? I doubt it. Also, the ship looked too firm. Would a ship that designed such an atmospheric plane slow it down? I doubt it. Will it survive being hit by comet drum? I doubt it. I think in both cases the tension on the structure will be too much. But those unlikely scenarios are offset by a number of well-crafted special effects, good editing and production, and some good acting, especially by the actors depicting the ship's commander and Russian astronaut.
