Kingdom County, Vermont, 1927. Noel Lord (Rip Torn) lives with his Indian partner, Bangor (Tantoo Cardinal) in the area where a large dam will be built; However, Noel is not willing to give up on his country, and he has to fight the dam company to prevent the county from any possible destruction. <br /> <br /> "Where the rivers flow north" is a gripping, contemplative story taken by the unforgettable performances of Rip Torn (recently in the small but juicy role of Louis XV in the Sofia Coppola's underestimated Marie Antoinette) and Tantoo Cardinal ("Dances With Wolves", "Smoke Signals") are seen. . Director Jay Craven (who also wrote the script with Don Bredes, based on Howard Frank Mosher's novel), and film Paul Ryan made this powerful story with unique, contemplative tempo / visual art. It reminds me of Terrence Malick and John Huston's best moments. This is an underestimated independent period of the first (electric) half of the 90s, which is usually regarded as the rise of Quentin Tarantino's burlesque ("Pulp Fiction" is indeed a masterpiece, but the man suffers from Orson Welles's syndrome ), Todd Solondz's disturbing Suburbia, Danny Boyle's dark vision of the United Kingdom (let's not mention "Beach" movie with DiCaprio though) ... Jay Craven needs to be seen more on the list of great indie film makers. He has led a sincere, strategic career and it is always a pleasure to see a constant talent like her. <br /> <br /> My voice: 8/10.
