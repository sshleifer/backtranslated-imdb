Conrad Phillips stars in the 1950s action adventure series - William Tell. William Tell is in the fourteenth century during the hostile Austrian occupation of Switzerland, a reluctant fighter fighting violently against the tyranny and oppression of the invading forces. William is the Swiss version of Robin Hood. Conrad Phillips is playing the lead role. It is possible that Pascal Bugnion would have had more success in the role, but he was not available at the time of filming. The classic action show consists of a series of 39. The episodes are in black and white, but it does not disturb the entertainment in any way.
