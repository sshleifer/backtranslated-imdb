You have to be very patient to put a single-liner film so flat and unique that you wonder what the fuss came when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened for such an enthusiastic audience from the 1940s. <br /> <On the top of some poor one-liners and ordinary siggats, the plot is as far-fetched as the stories. The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think he could find a real solution on how to commit and get away with the perfect crime. But then that's how unrealistic the comedy is. <br /> <br /> But if you are a true Red Skelton fan and have a look back on how 40's comedies are made - at least you can enjoy the lovely throw that supports it. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Gray do well as his love interest and Conrad Veidt always makes an interesting villain. One of his more amusing moments is his reaction to Skelton explaining the mysteries of turbans. "I never knew it," he says, impressed with a little point being introduced smartly. <br /> <br /> All in all, typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are. Not always easy for a discriminating viewer, as many of them just fall flat, the way many comedies of this era are done, because the novelty of the zigzags and one-liners simply turned off.
