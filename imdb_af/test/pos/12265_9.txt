I sit around by movie list and don't really see anything I want to see. My appetite continues to say, "Something like BROADCAST NEWS." That's what I want. Something smart and funny, with mature ideas and good acting and a direct style that doesn't call attention to itself. It may be the best thing about Hurt (is it or the BIG CHILL, in my mind): however, eccentric, Hurt is clever and playing an unwise person without making sure - wink clipping - the audience knows - cut wink - - Hi, I'm not stupid ... well, that's right there right. Hunter is not perfect, and Albert Brooks is a revelation. (And he can read and sing at the same time!) Great, good work. <br /> <br />
