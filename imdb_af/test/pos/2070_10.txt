1. I saw Branaghs Hamlet: Branagh is too old, speaks regularly with a loud voice (unwillingly funny!) - not a convincing Hamlet, and his directors qualities - poor! (Also, don't see much about Branagh. The funny parts of the dialogue are mostly cut out, not the director's errors in the dialogue cuts!) 2. I saw Hamlet 2000: I think the scenario is an interesting idea. - But such common actors - all of them. 3. Orson Welles Hamlet is OK - but this BBC Hamlet is the best! Derec Jacobi is convincing - looks a little nice - very suitable! and Patric Stewart - wonderful, and Claire Bloom is a very attractive queen. You believe those actors they say - I think it's the best compliment.
