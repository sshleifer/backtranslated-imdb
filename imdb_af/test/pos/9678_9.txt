I absolutely love this show !!!!!!!, The basic fox's improved version of the simpsons (we can see that the simpsons are very dry if you are above the age of 9. This is political, irrational and irresistible Anyone who says they don't like to lie is a character for everyone, Peter, Stewie, & Quagmire are my favorites Peter because he is rude, stupid and just doesn't give a crap. intelligence and how to hit you with something that an adult would say when you least expect it, and swamp because one of the guilty pleasures is dirty jokes, and there is also an episode for everyone. there Griffin goes to Washington (VOL.2 SEASON 3) If you want more of the sexual and bodily humor, there is impossible emission (VOL.2 SEASON 3.) or if you have any other kind of humor, there Jan Janet (VOL.1 SEISOEN2). Basically what I say is that when you watch this show, there is a cleft humor for everyone. GUIDANCE GIGO GOOOOO!
