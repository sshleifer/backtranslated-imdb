Oh my god what a story! This movie is very good and it had to be God what happened! You did a wonderful job. The acting was really good, you certainly chose the right actors. This movie is so good. I'm really glad you made it, because if you didn't, I would never have known this story, because I'm not a big golf fan. I think it's so boring, so thank you. I really enjoyed it and therefore I gave the movie a 10. I was also from Shia Labouf and was perfect for the role of Fransis Quimet. I hope most of the things you put in there were true too. Oh, and some parts were funny and others, I was just really happy.
