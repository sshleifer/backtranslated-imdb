Elmer is once again confronted with the dilemma of who to shoot. Insects of Daffy. He is not sure which season it is and helps Bunny and Duck arguments. Although Bugs proves he is the smartest once by repeatedly using reverse psychology on Daffy in increasingly subtle ways. And when it runs out, he makes his trademark cross-dressing thing. Daffy freaks out and demand that the bunny be shot. Although Elmer is too stupid, he is hopelessly in love with the girl-bunny thing. Elmer must really make it guilty. If he wasn't so stupid, he would know it. Actually, the duck season, and Daffy just blows. But poor old Daff can't believe the absolute folly of the situation. His cruel misdirection plans were whispered by Elmer's stupidity. Daffy is so shocked that he even goes home with Elmer to be blown into his lounge. <br /> <br /> Poor Daff. He rules!
