Wow! I recently caught it at the IFC after watching a Cheerleader. Id has never heard of this movie, but the description sounds interesting from a distance. I went into low expectations and now I have to say it is one of the best love stories ever in film. Robin Tunney does an excellent job depicting a person with tourettes. The relationship between the two and only the slightest details in the film is so accurate and credible. I usually hate "romance" and love movies, but this movie really touched me. I recommend this movie to anyone with the ability to watch.
