The commentary before me said this movie was the worst ever forced as a child on him / her. However, I must say that I loved this movie when it was little and I still love it today. The film has the best running theme of all-togetherness. Considering the release of the movie, I thought the movie was good. I just wish I could get another copy of it !! From all the 1980s I saw as a child, it was my favorite. I know I watched my brother and my mother at least once a week. I would definitely recommend it to anyone I know - or don't know. So if you find a copy of it, I suggest looking at it! It is wonderful and heartwarming.
