The title refers to the destruction of the remains of a crop, such as rice dogs, by farmers who burn them, creating fires on the plains. This is a deceptive story of the destruction of the Japanese soldier. <br /> <br /> The story is in the last days of the Philippines campaign as a soldier with TB returning from a hospital, because since he can walk, they have no place for him. His superior officials don't want him, because he's really too sick to work or fight. Abused by his official, he is returned to the hospital with orders to allow or kill himself. They will still not take him and he will soon seek out the war-destroyed landscape to find help or a place to stay or even just cost. It is a dark journey with no hope in sight and only death and man's inhumanity to man in every turn. <br /> <br /> Named a sad journey into the dark heart of man and war, it's also a very funny movie. It's not to say she's not scary, it's sometimes, but it's also dark blue. How can it not be? Here is a movie where madness and madness run, people are constantly trying to find tobacco leaves for food, trying to get even a slightly better pair of shoes, trying to stay a Japanese soldier in the face of absurdity by constantly marching but never not getting anywhere and you can't help but laugh. To be sure, things are getting darker as it becomes clear that cannibalism is literally and figuratively the only way to survive, but at the same time there is something uncomfortable about human comedy. <br /> <br /> Fetching as a great anti-war movie, its sharp photographic style makes the insanity of war clear, even because it shines our eye on its beauty. Here we see landscapes full of bodies that include the soldier and the citizen. amidst fields of forests and trees that would otherwise be, and to some extent quite beautiful. It's a disturbing sensation. <br /> <br /> What is interesting is that I read that it is based on a novel about the redeeming power of Christianity. The director removed everything about the religious references to hope and salvation and instead used to show that life is stinking, the war stinks worse and there is no hope at last. <br /> <br /> I admire the movie, emotionally I do not. Part of it is a critical expectant score that emphasizes what we see on the screen. The lily almost enlarges as the images are so strong, it doesn't really have to force the music to feel somehow. <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, it's up to you to decide. Certainly this is in contrast to any other war movie, bloody, horrific and real in ways that big budgeted movies claim to be, but never. It is not for those who are detrimental to blood and gore, as it is here in spades. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth it.
