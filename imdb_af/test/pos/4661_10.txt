They no longer make movies like this? although some may say it's a good thing. Although it falls under the first of Disney's PG rated movies, it has more of the G movies that invented their studio in the 70's (ie "Freaky Friday," "The World's Greatest Athlete") as the PG films that have came out in the early 80s (ie "Watcher in the Woods", "Tron," "Something Wicked This Way Comes"). Of course, because of Disney's support, "Midnight Madness" had a huge budget. A great cast and a ton of different places go to show it. But zaniness, a madcap scavenger hunt, and a spectacular visual style were not enough to save the movie from an enormous flop ... A failure at the box office, most of us were released early in the film on HBO . 80s, back in the days when the same movies will be shown 29 times a week (Oh, wait? They still do it!). Essentially, HBO for this movie that CBS did for "The Wizard of Oz" ?? they have created an enormous cult audience for a pure sweet mega-flop .... <br /> <br /> The biggest problem that makes it a "bad" movie is that there are too many characters and that many little of them fleshed out ?? Eddie Deezen's "team" doesn't even have names! The blue team, though they are the villains, are the most engaging and most work in their characters (except the girl who can't act and doesn't have enough to do). Perfectly played by Stephen Furst, Harold is actually the only one whose character is fully realized in the movie. The other striking character is goof-off Melio, played with tons of charm by now-director Andy Tennant. Although at the time dr. The spokesman, David Naughton, was supposed to be the star, and his character often comes off unpleasant, especially when hit against his brother Adam, Michael J. Fox. Although everyone has favorite characters, I don't think anyone who loves the movie can agree. Furst and Fox are the only two characters you really learn about. <br /> <br /> Despite the movie's many bugs and bad actors (most of which have fallen off the quake after this movie), it still works because the actors have fun - and fun on the set is equal to screen. Come on, which college jock doesn't dream of driving into a beer and what a beautiful girl doesn't dream of stealing the show at the local disco ... about it ... I think it would be present today. .. Nice, nice clean fun for all those young in the 70s and 80s, it is fitting that it finally got the massive video release it deserves. But where the hell is the widescreen DVD released with the comment, trailer and full version of the song playing in the disco?
