OK. A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian. Be careful about who you see this movie - ie - don't watch children watching this movie. I'll explain why. <br /> <br /> 1 - the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance - I assume it was the intent of the producer but is annoying 2 - the film itself is very disturbing. I have some problems - the first is that the film is not violent or sexual and therefore not a horror movie. But it's a very disturbing movie, and involves a child and his parents and a small town. <br /> <br /> OK, it comes down to it. The film is not suitable for minors because it contains rows and images that are disturbing and confusing to a child. Is there a bizarre quality, and this is ONLY because it has a child in it that makes me feel inappropriate. As a parent myself, I feel strong enough to tell people because I only read the other day that it has a release in the theaters. <br /> <br /> I hope I'm not insulting the filmmakers by saying it, but I think it's my right because it gets a release and only has an M rating (because it's not violent or is not sexual). Just strange and disturbing, but pretty good in and of itself.
