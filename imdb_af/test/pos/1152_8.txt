Now, you guys, I loved this movie, but not quite as much as FAREWELL TO THE KING, another beloved John Milius epic. It was fun, much more than it was based on a Tennessee Williams drama. It's a good yarn, with a lot of political correctness. I love this movie for its beautiful photography, its humor and the weakened criticism of the bad guys (Berbers) and the REAL Bad Guys, the spear carriers for the "civilized" world, with their repetitive guns, artillery and big rifles. there in the harbor. <br /> <br /> The striking scene is the Berber camp with blue-gray smoke from the cooking fires rising in the cool desert air. This is visually eloquent, highly appealing. <br /> <br /> WIND has a helpless American woman (Candace Bergen) in Morocco in 1904. He is taken hostage by a drowning, but unkind Berber bandit (Sean Connery - the very model of a Scottish Muslim nomad). The exciting story is based on some historical facts. Photography is beautiful, spelled by Jerry Goldsmith's outstanding score. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Pedicaris and the Raisuli predict long-lasting and leap around in the desert between oases. Although the Raisuli traces his proud pride to the monkeys, he is a perfect gentleman - he even lets her hold her head after she hit him on chess! A naval explosion storms the Bashaw's palace, which emits fires of competitive hegemonies. Don't mess with the Corps, Abdul. <br /> <br /> There are many entertaining stereotypes: <br /> <br /> Suspicious Sultan - looks like a hidden ferret. Certainly not a liberal. <br /> <br /> Cruel German officer - a big, bellicus Dachshund who plays a monocle. He prefers to fight the Raisuli with swords, instead of enforcing him in the way of Indiana Jones. Noblesse obliged, through Von Clausewitz? <br /> <br /> Dashing Marine Officer - kick the shit out of the Bashaw of Tangier's army and storm his palace while tobacco tobacco. His speech is slightly aphasia. The Bashaw asked him not to breathe on him. <br /> <br /> The Berbers - a horde groveling sycophants led by a beautiful megalomaniac. None of them take baths, except perhaps in camel urine. <br /> <br /> President Teddy Roosevelt is unconditionally portrayed as empty and busy with guns, toys and stuffed grizzly bars. <br /> <br /> Beautiful American widow - giving men a lesson in courage, just like her two children. She apparently has a large stock of clean, stored clothes and rarely has a hair out of place. <br /> <br /> The Raisuli sends Teddy Roosevelt a message and thanks him for the gift of a remington repeating rifle that declared, <br /> <br /> "Master Roosevelt, you are the lion and AIEE THE BREAK WIND. "<br /> <br /> How true. <br /> <br /> Don't make my acrobatic remarks I didn't like the movie. I almost had so much fun writing it when I watched Da Pitcher.
