The Vietnam War era is definitely well ahead of me, but it has always interested me, and I've seen many movies about it. All the others I saw worked strictly on the front line of the battle. When I read a description of "The War At Home" I found the concept intriguing. No Vietnam War movie I've ever heard of talking about what happens to a soldier when the fighting is over. <br /> <br /> One night, while browsing through channels, the movie was broadcast on The Sundance Channel. I put the remote down and tied to see it. I didn't move out of my seat the whole two hours; It's one of those movies that interests you a lot because there's no way to predict what will happen next. <br /> <br /> This movie made me a big fan of Emilio Estevez. I really enjoyed him like Billy the Kid in the "Young Guns" movies, but I never saw anything he did afterwards. Emilio proved that he was very talented to write and direct. <br /> <br /> The pacing of the movie is done very well. I'm hard to think of a point where it's dragging. <br /> <br /> What surprised me is that it didn't get an Oscar or any real recognition when it came out. It is a dramatic story about parents trying to cope with the fact that their son is not what he used and probably will never be as they remembered him again. Definitely worth seeing.
