It is probably the largest war movie and certainly one of the greatest films. There is no sentimentality, no patriotic agenda, not even a hopeful message of universal brotherhood in this dark view of what we can only call hell. It is this silence and lack of manipulation that gives the film its amazing power. There is also no attempt to make a hero from Ichikawa's protagonist Tamura. He's just a poorly-damned juice trying to stay alive in a world of horror that hopes, but isn't sure, he can hang on to his humanity in the process. Ichikawa's fierce lack of cant and illusion makes Brande on the Plains alone. Ichikawa died in February 2008.
