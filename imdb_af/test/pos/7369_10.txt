This movie is about a group of four friends wrecking a car while driving. They build a campfire to get up the night and wait for help. To pass the time, they tell terrible stories. To tell this, the movie will ruin, so rent and enjoy! <br /> <br /> I'll say it starts a bit slow, but every story gets better and better. These film stars from today's hottest actors Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movies), James Marsden (Disturbing Behavior) and Ron Livingston (Office Space). So you can see there are big names stars just not the big ones! Go rent or buy it as soon !! This movie is great !!
