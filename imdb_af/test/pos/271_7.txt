The third entry into the "Stepford" franchise, but apparently the three made-up TVs made for the TV, incredibly dark and difficult to track, while the 70-year-old original as well as the newcomer with Nicole Kidman are well known and is popular. I also didn't see the early 80's "Revenge of the Stepford Wives" or the mid 90's "The Stepford Men", but this "The Stepford Children" is a very charming and highly entertaining movie. It's basically exactly the same movie as the original movie; of course less mysterious, much more cheesier and incredibly 80's to ninth grade. The main difference here, as the title implies, is that it is not only the liberated women, but also the rebellious and punk teenage films in town undergo the typical and highly effective "Stepford treatment" licensed by the local men's association. For some reason, the scenario attempts to maintain the Stepford mystery late in the film, although no one will probably look at the sequel before checking the original and probably all knowing about the unbundling. The Harding family are all packed and ready to move from the creepy city of New York to the small and quiet community of Stepford. Father Steven, in particular, is excited about their new life because he already lived in Stepford and always wanted to go back since his first wife, whose new wife, Laura, and adolescent children, Mary and David, have little knowledge, died under mysterious circumstances. The town is almost too perfect, with picturesque neighbors and model students, and modern teens in particular are experiencing great problems. Their efforts to modernize the place and seize the local youth of Stanford cause confrontation with the prominent townspeople, especially the members of the Men's Association, and put the family relationships under stress. David meets and falls in love with the last "normal" girl in the Lois school, but once she transforms into a domestic dummy, David can convince his skeptical mother to investigate the sinister Stanford secret. The first hour of "The Stanford Children" is slow and tame, but the finals are trashy and cheesy like the VHS cover promises and should be like an 80-year-old thriller. The modus operandi behind the Stanford secrets is illustrated in greater detail, and I think scared fans and lovers of the original movie would appreciate it. At least I did it. The overall plot does not make much sense and the writing is full of irrational aspects, but it is a pleasant formula and undoubtedly an atmosphere of tension and fear. The acting performances are well above average. Particularly the arrogant and unpleasant members of the Men's Association show adorable characters and even teenage players Tammy Lauren and Randall Batinkoff give impressive performances. Recommended without hesitation!
