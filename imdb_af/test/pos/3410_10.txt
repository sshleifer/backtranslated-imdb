One of the best! As a fan of the civil war, I was very pleased with the first installment of the North and South trilogy. Patrick Swayze gives and extraordinary performance, as well as James Reed and Leslie Ann Down. Looking at this fantastic story, it unfolds in a time that has never been forgotten, the subjects of love, passion, sadness, shame, harmony and cruelty come to life. I was first introduced to this series when I was in eighth grade. As a young boy, you would think I would not be interested in this civil war soap. To be honest, this story stole the hearts of everyone in my class, and that's just the first book. I bought the novel and studied the sweets and differences and it was wonderful. I am now 17 and still enjoy the story, characters, subject, and remember the times of the civil war. As a film director of the future, I will always enjoy North and South: Book One.
