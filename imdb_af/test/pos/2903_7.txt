I will give this movie high marks for film photography and performances. I just read a user comment about the actress acting a royal courtman fleeing Sinuoeh, the main character. I remember a mini-biography of this actress following the movie the last time I saw it. Apparently she was a Holocaust refugee, discovered by a French man and woman in the film industry who was taken with her extraordinary beauty. She died very young and under tragic circumstances. Gene Tierney is also outstanding in this movie. Like other neo-biblical films of the 1940s and 50s, the Egyptian reflects the moral and values ​​of that time, but it's still great entertainment because the performances are awesome and the story so good.
