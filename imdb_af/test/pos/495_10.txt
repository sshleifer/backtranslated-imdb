Leaves are probably one of the best vampire / action movies ever made. It has everything: action, horror, blood. This movie is for action fans. It's whether you enjoy it, or you hate it and if you hate it, it means you don't like action or vampire movies. Wesley snipes take his role seriously and he is the perfect guy for blade.
