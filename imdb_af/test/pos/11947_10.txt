"One Crazy Summer" is the funniest, craziest (not necessarily the best) movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Just when a crazy scene is done, another comes up. It never lets you rest. Just one thing after another. The soundtrack is wonderful. The songs are the rights for the screens. <br /> <br /> It's also a clean movie. Few dirty ones. <br /> <br /> Of course, it has challenged the story of the guys you wouldn't trust with your lunch and win more resources. Who wants to see it if they have failed? There is a serious side, because parents and children do not meet each other's dreams. One should always have an open mind, and weigh all the options. This applies to both parents and children. In "One Crazy Summer" the parents are wrong. This is not always the case.
