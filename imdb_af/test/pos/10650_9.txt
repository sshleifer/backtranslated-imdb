This 1925 film portrays the story of the mutiny on board ship Potemkin in the port of Odessa. The film celebrated the 20th anniversary of the 1905 uprising, regarded as a direct precursor to the October Revolution of 1917. Following his montage theory, Eisenstein plays with scenes, their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message , except he uses different camera angles and revolutionary lighting techniques. The series "Odessa Steps" in Potemkin is one of the best known in the history of the theater. The baby carts coming down the stairs after his mother was shot were later recreated in Brian d 'Palma's The Untouchables. Clearly, the movie is one of the best ever made, taking into account its time and how innovative it was, although you need some patience and a real movie enthusiast to go through his 70 minutes .
