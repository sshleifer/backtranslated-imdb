For every fan of the upcoming stories, this 3-hour adaptation of the <br /> <br /> Sarah Waters novel is pure fun. Kinematic nod to Baz Luhrman's kinetic style, as well as to all the prim and proper period pieces <br /> <br /> ever present on the BBC (where you probably almost saw <br /> <br /> every prominent member of this role). It's rather bawdy and over <br /> <br /> the top in places, but that's just what the novel needs. The cast <br /> <br /> is attractive and in the case of Anna Chancellor and Hugh <br /> <br /> Bonneville, perfect. In the case of Rachel Sterling, as our heroine <br /> <br />, simply ignore the fact that she is too good to be <br /> <br /> ever running for a boy and running with it . It's a fantasy, though. <br /> <br /> Some adherents of the novel can be expressed by the different changes in <br /> <br /> character (especially those of Jodhi May's character, Florence), but <br /> <br / > The changes all work towards the greater benefit of this teleplay and <br /> <br /> offers a high quality entertainment value.
