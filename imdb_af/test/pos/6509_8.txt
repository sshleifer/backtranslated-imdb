It's almost the entire soundtrack of this movie. I only saw this baby at the Munich Film Festival and it shook the house. Director Doug Pray has never been seen in this documentary, and I think he's not even heard, but he has done a very intimate look at the lives and history of the "mixer". He segmented his film into about eight chapters and then his motivated group becomes enthusiastic interviews throughout the herbs according to what they are talking about. I was never big to scratch, but the movie does a great job of keeping elementary elements for those who know little, and jokes for those who are experts in this area. Mixed master Mike of the Beastie Boys is in this movie, but only after the movie did I mention several heavy hitters in the industry (DJ Shadow, Q-Bert, etc.). The extreme fascination for turntables by these talented and peculiar DJs is evident in their explanations of what their music means to them. The movie also casts a surprising light on these guys (and one woman) to be classified as musicians. Pray does not leave his film idle, and if there is a slow scene, it will soon be resurrected by almost never stopping music. If nothing else, this movie will increase your snake vocabulary. I have to come back to dig, so I will end this review. See, it will be important. Good stuff man. Good stuff.
