I've seen what I believe is the best Australian film of the year so far, Jon Hewitt's Acolytes. <br /> <br /> Acolytes are an attractive thriller with a killer condition. Get it? Two bulls and molested teenagers discover a local serial killer in their suburbs. Then they put him in jail to kill the bully they molested. Hewitt picked a top spot, including the excellent new blanket Sebastian Gregory, Joshua Payne and Hanna Mangan Lawrence to play the teens. Add to that three, yes it's three big psychos! Lead by Joel Edgerton in an excellent performance of serial killer du jour, Belinda McClory's strangled husband and Michael Dorman as the teen raping bully, with swastika tattoos. When you add these teens and these threatening adults, does hell break loose? Hewitt made a ball on the wall series thriller that was original and finished. You can see the influence of Larry Clark and David Lynch's Twin Peaks, but Hewitt makes it all his own, in a Qld suburban backwater, always calling with the drunk emptiness. The script of Shayne Armstong, Shane Krouse and Hewitt is tight. <br /> <br /> If properly marketed, this movie can be an outbreak with teens. The next Wolf Creek? It can be good. It makes all the right moves. The teens are the real ala Larry Clark. They do not suck and have an attached PC agenda, they are not communicable, beautiful and hip. The killers are dark with real threat. Joel Edgerton steals his scene as the soft-mannered local Ted Bundy, a butterfly on his 4WD savings-ala John Fowles The Collector sport. Dorman's petrol rapist throws up the threat that suburban Mayhem is up and offers a sly boyfriend you can't wait to see the farm buy. <br /> <br /> The movie is fast, tough and brutal. Not only that, it displays a trust and direct mastery of Hewitt that will surely win an IF or AFI nomination, if not award! The animated and poetic mise and scene, brilliant sound design, excellent cinematography and stiff structure mark it as one of the best-targeted Oz features I've seen so far this year. <br /> <br /> The movie is shaken, thought and unceasing. This is a wonderful issue of returning to the genre currently taking place in Australian theater. This will surely ensure Hollywood's interest. Oh, and did I mention it came in Toronto? What other Oz movies can say so much? The world must be ready for a new author, Jon Hewitt.
