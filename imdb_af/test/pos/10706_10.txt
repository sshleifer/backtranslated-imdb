Facts we need to know to have a context for understanding the meaning of the specific story being told here The story itself is well-developed, with a strong narrative arch, and for more measures it is shot with great tension There is an arresting, charismatic central protagonist, Anderson Sa: he's a skilled natural leader, articulate, brave, spiritually developed, a talented artist, a visionary she talks about. <br /> <br /> D There is also a lot of music and dance to entertain. There are talking heads ?? mainly Sa and his closest associate, Jose Junior - but they are presented with imaginative cinematic brilliance. The editing mixes beautiful footage of different themes, but only occasionally with some fact-filled stills. The pace is as lively as the music. A little is reached in 78 minutes. <br /> <br /> Grupo Afro Reggae, the environmental club that Anderson, Junior and a few others founded in 1993, has music and dance as the weapons to act against the chiefs of drugs. and the double police. They teach percussion skills to any child who wants to join a class, along with dance, martial arts, a community newspaper. The only requirement for children to hear is no smoking, no drinking, no drugs.

He burned his characters editing feature documentary for PBS and others, and he taught film at the New York Film Academy and elsewhere.
