I turned it on (on cable) at an impression and was treated quite surprisingly. Although it was very predictable, this movie was very enjoyable ... no big stars, but well directed and just nice. With all the overheated shit out there, it is very nice to occasionally get an unexpected surprise ... and this little movie fits the bill well. 9/10
