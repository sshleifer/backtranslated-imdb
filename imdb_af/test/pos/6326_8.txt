It's a very noir type episode. It starts with Jim returning from a weekend outing with a new friend, the recently divorced Karen Mills (Pat Delaney - daughter-in-law of John Huston, who knew a few things about noir film) and her daughter. When they arrived, Karen went home while Jim picked up her daughter from the back seat and brought her to her room. He then discovered that Karen had disappeared without a trace. Of course he calls Dennis and when the police arrive, they see no sign of Karen, but finds her neighbor neighbor in the bush killed. So of course it makes Jim an immediate suspect. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful secret and the first half of the story is shown by Rocky, and asks Jim to go over the story again. Rocky suggests that Jim tells the story that he might remember a little detail he wasn't important at the time, but now it can lead to an indication of what happened. It is a very well written scene and completes the transition from the Rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent. It's also a lot to show that Rocky is not just an old man. As he says, "You come to me because I'm your father. And I'm smarter than you!" This is one of those times where we see where Jim has become smart. <br /> <br /> This episode also features hottie Lara Parker, who played Angelique in the Dark Shadows series and plays Laura. Banner, Bruce's wife in the "Incredible Hulk" series, a few years later. She looks fantastic here. <br /> <br /> This episode is also the first mention of the Minette crime family, a name that will almost keep the Rockford files, almost when they need a mob family. This time, she's Vincent Minette who helps Rockford understand. <br /> <br /> Lt. Diehl (Tom Atkins) made his first appearance on the series and Dennis is quietly rejected by a police lieutenant that he was once sargent to a police force in the previous season. I think they thought it would be better to have Dennis less powerful and add a little conflict between Jim and the police. Honestly, it was right, though I did the later Lt. Chapman prefers Lt. Diehl. <br /> <br /> Not much of the typical Rockford humor in this episode, but a good secret with lots of heart.
