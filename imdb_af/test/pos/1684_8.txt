Over the years, there have been some films that just pass by and hardly any opinions. <br /> <br /> Selecting Conner is one of those movies. <br /> <br /> This little jeweler played at some festivals and had a short 2-week break in a small theater in West Hollywood, all about $ 5500. <br /> <br /> It's now on DVD. I hope many more will see it now. <br /> <br /> It's a weird drama of a sloppy young politician who has a very bright influence. 15 year old boy. This politics also has an attractive cousin (about 17 years old) who agrees with the 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> The above paragraph is a bit vague about what is happening, SO is the movie, & that's what I appreciated, we don't get all the facts. Many are left to our own thinking. You will hear a dialogue that makes this logical. <br /> <br /> Steven Weber (Wings) is our politician, his role is slightly vague. It's another point for the audience to think. <br /> <br /> Alex D. Linz is 15 years old. He was about 17 when they made this movie, but could easily pass younger. He's been in movies and TV since he was a young child. He is a very good actor and is very convincing. <br /> <br /> Escher Holloway is the older teenager. This role is his first big part. is excellent. <br /> <br /> Now I'm saving the best for the last, author / director, <br /> <br /> Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old. For a first try, a big thumb will pop up. <br /> <br /> Please: *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
