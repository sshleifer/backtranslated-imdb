Maierick director Seijun Suzuki eventually managed his dream project, Princess Washing, movie, and in a way it was fortunate that he didn't try it in the 1960s. Special effects and computer graphics that made certain types of production easier than the old movie mats would have. <br /> <br /> Some familiarity with Japanese history and theatrical traditions will help you enjoy this movie. Very familiar with Shakespeare's "The Tempest" will help Peter Greenaway's poem "Prospero's Books". These two movies have a bit in common, though, "Princess Raccoon" is much more colorful and easier to look at for someone without the background to fully appreciate it. <br /> <br /> Whilst the art design, play and direction are fine for most of the movie, it seems to this viewer that the energy runs out in the final third of the movie. Most interesting sets have already been introduced and the camera seems to go back for more of a filmed play experience. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a unique movie experience and I recommend it to anyone interested in alternative forms of movie performance. It's not really meant for kids, though nothing happens to upset them. If the last third was better, I'd give it nine stars.
