I have to admit that I've never heard of this movie. I caught it at TMC last night. I thought it was hysterical. I laughed and loved so hard. Beeld who wants a Marx brother's movie if they work with Salvadore Dali and Malcolmn X and then all lose LSD. <br /> <br /> Funny and edgy are two overused words nowadays, this movie is sure to plus about 200 IQ points of most comedies today and surrealistic to start. I had to get up at 6:00 and watch until 2:30. I slept and missed my obligations. Still worth it. I would not recommend renting it, I would recommend to own it. It was so good. <br /> <br /> The only warning I have is that such references are dated and may not be found by younger people. Bare it and use your head. <br /> <br /> I'll put it in my top comedies of all time.
