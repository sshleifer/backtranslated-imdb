After the collapse of Yesilcam (Turkey's response to Hollywood) in the mid-90s, but the foremost of observers could have predicted such a recent pique in the Turkish film industry, it may be based on the work of former photographer Nuri Bilge Ceylan. br /> <br /> Uzak is the director's third feature and is something of a trilogy with his two previous photographs (Kasaba and Clouds of May), which follow similar themes and techniques. The film finds Mahmoud, a commercial photographer, alone in a small apartment in Istanbul, sometimes visited by his brown, married lover. Yusuf, his cousin, left his village after closing a factory and losing his job. The younger man stays with Mahmoud while looking fruitlessly in the city, drinking in cafes and looking nervously at young women he never approaches. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie is translated as "Far" and the movie beautifully illustrates every possible connotation of the word; Yusuf's physical distance from his home, Mahmoud's emotional distance from the world around him and the generation distance between the two men. <br /> <br /> Ceylan's films seldom feature increased dramatic, but leave the full and rich characters within the tight frame, static shots. He acts as director, producer, writer, filmmaker and co-editor, and throws friends and family into many roles. Such a limited, isolated approach to filmmaking is expected to result in films that are difficult to infiltrate and connect with most viewers, and make Uzak's undoubtedly humanity more impressive. <br /> <br /> However, Ceylan is a better film formalist than a playwright, taking the reign of such former film language masters as Ozu and Tarkovsky. After watching Uzak, I think of some better suited to the task.
