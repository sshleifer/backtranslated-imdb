I just watched the Dresser tonight, just once before, about a dozen years ago. <br /> <br /> It's not a "big" movie, and doesn't try to make a big splash, but my God, the glory of the two just makes me speechless. Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay are nothing short of wonderful in this movie. <br /> <br /> The Dresser is the story of Sir, an aging Shakespeare actor (Finney), and his dresser Norman (Courtenay), kind of a valet, a production by King Lear during the flash of London in World War II. These are two men, each dependent on the other: Sir is almost helpless without the help of Norman to adapt him, and bully to get to know him for his 227th show of Lear. And Norman fervently lives his life; without sir to need him, he is nothing or thinks he is anyway. <br /> <br /> It's a character-driven movie; the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters, and as such it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life. Finney, just 47 years old, is completely credible as a very old, very sick, booming, bully but brilliant stage actor. He slants and smokes with his fellow actors, even when they take their bows! And Courtenay is no less convincing than the trinket, sometimes acting more than a mother as a herd for his elderly employer. However, employer is really the wrong term to use. Because although they are technically their relationship with employer and employee, Norman and Norman like nothing but an old couple. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are others in the movie of this movie, but there is no doubt that true stars are Finney, Courtenay, and the wonderful script of Ronald Harwood. It is not to say that there are no other fine performances, especially Eileen Atkins as the slow-paced stage manager Madge. There is a wonderful scene where Sir and Madge talk about old desires, sorry and what would have been. <br /> <br /> Although not spoken these days, it is worth remembering that The Dresser was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Actress Nominations for both Finney and Courtenay, Best Picture, Best Director (Peter Yates), and the best custom script. <br /> <br /> I remember being a good movie, but I wasn't prepared to be as complete as I was from start to finish. If you want to see an example of what great acting it all is and be totally entertained, I should encourage you to see The Dresser.
