If this film was made in the 50's or 60's, critics and supporters would have praised it too. I enjoyed the movie from start to finish. It is not a timeless piece, and has not been obsolete over the years, but it is nice to watch. What Mrs. Ritchie's acting? Not the best on the planet - but it adds to the movie's unique slapstick comedy aspirations, and shows Madonna's (often underrated) sense of comic timing. Madonna plays Nikki Finn, a former culprit for a crime she did not commit. Griffin Dunne plays the unlucky future groom / puppet sent to escort her from prison to the bus station, where a series of unfortunate events occur, creating the plot. (And there is * one, people!) Give the movie a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised at how funny it is.
