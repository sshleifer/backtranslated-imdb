I get a scoop of the new Who excellent fans call it. They are entitled to the opinion, but the new series is not quite there yet, but it is there. This is definitely good. <br /> <br /> First, the good stuff. The special effects are apparently better nearly 20 years later since the last episode of Doctor Who "Battlefield" was broadcast. <br /> <br /> One thing the BBC has always liked is Doctor Who (except if they tried to cancel in the 70's and 80's). However, the expectation and the pressure were good, but I think the New series has passed the test, it's good, it's still not excellent because it has errors. The stories "Dalek" were very poor. I suppose it was written in a few minutes by an idiot who never disturbed the Dalek character or never had the old series. <br /> <br /> "Aliens in London" was by far the best episode So far, it has begun a new storyline about Aliens that has been on several episodes, including "Boomtown". <br /> <br /> Now the other bad things, companion Rose, Billie Piper, are not good. She is actually quite annoying, but it is Dr. Whoever has to choose a young teenager and she has the part. <br /> <br /> Christopher Eccleston is fairly respectful, he started catching his niche. He tried to play the character, straight and funny, always missed the right punchline, but he took it much more seriously and showed it. <br /> <br /> There are still some problems that haven't been resolved well, Paul Mcgann was still the doctor before, but he didn't return. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, overall overall good, I didn't miss an episode and it never gets boring, so I recommend any doctor who is looking to watch it and the new Doctor Who series to see.
