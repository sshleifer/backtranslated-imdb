I just found the entire 3 DVD set at Wal-Mart in the bargain for $ 5.50, so I thought I'd look again. Total of 13 hours to watch it all (26 episodes). I was born in 1948 and saw most of them on TV in the sixties. Many independent stations have repeated them for many years. <br /> <br /> Better than I actually expected, was the time for the remarkable sincerity of its creators, and for the obvious gratitude and respect they gave to all the Allied fighters and women. More abstract and arty as a straight forward documentary, but much truth in it is portraying the causes and final results of World War II. The war was largely dependent on seafaring, and the final victory was dependent on who achieved the final mastery of the world's oceans. The allies were the ones who could do it. <br /> <br /> Also interesting to see how they are trying to balance big events and the individual soldiers and sailors they've made. The score is impressive, as a little too much according to today's standards. I read somewhere that Robert Russell Bennett contributed as much as Richard Rodgers to the final score. I suggest Rodgers provided all the main themes, and it was up to Bennett to adapt them to the images. Great work! <br /> <br /> Must be seen by every ruler, or potential ruler. A warning to tyrants that the wars are eventually won by ideals, determination and supplies to recover. Logistics: their quality and delivery will determine the ultimate victors. The Allies defeated and outperformed the material's quality of ashes, attacked their source and ensured their ultimate defeat. <br /> <br /> Sorry to see producer Henry Salomon lived a very short life. IMDb's facts were pretty shameful, I have to find out more about him. He did some outstanding documentary programs before his early death. Maybe more at a later time <br /> <br /> Trivia: I've made 3 LP records of the background music, pretty good overall. Unfortunately, the producers have decided to add sound effects to the last one, listening to novelty status, rather than listening to serious music, just after news. Too bad, because it contains interesting but less important themes in the series. Silly stuff like 16 inch guns fired, torpedoes, bulldozers, planes ... just for kids mainly. <br /> <br /> RSGRE
