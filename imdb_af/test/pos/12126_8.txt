a very surprisingly underestimated movie. very realistic. and authentic. With a great dialogue. Being Italian, I can certainly relate to the situations and phrases used. I thought Joe Cortese was wonderful. as a mad bob cowboy type, and pesci and Vincent were also good. I like the actor Criscuolo who played the boss. He was very authentic. I think director Ralph devito was on his way to good things, but was cut too early, perhaps because he knew too much. I thought it was wonderful. It earns more airplay and recognition. It was a sleep movie. great. very good. it really had good authenticity. It was well done.
