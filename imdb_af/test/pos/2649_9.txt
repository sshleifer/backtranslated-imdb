Dear Readers, 2001: A Space Odyssey is Kubrick's best ... although I really can't say that Space Odyssey is his only movie I've ever watched. But it's still a good movie. Strange, but good. <br /> <br /> The movie is in three acts, much like the novel ... which is unpleasant since the author wrote the script. In any case, we first start with the simple but spectacular opening with also Sparach Zarathustra that leaves on the speakers. Then comes the boring fiancee 'Dawn of Man' order. Then there is the strange 'Find of the Monolith' series on the Moon, played at Strauss's Blue Danube. Eventually things get well with the space giants and HAL will be berserk and kill people. Then things die and we have the 'Entering the Monolith' order that was too long and the ultra strange end. Although, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a good movie. It's not Star Wars, Stargate, Terminator or The Abyss, but it's steep. My compliments to the chef, Mr. Kubrick. <br /> <br /> Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
