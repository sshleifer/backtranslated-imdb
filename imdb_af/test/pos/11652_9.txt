Tim Robbins makes a wonderful movie. His wife (Susan Sarandon) gives a wonderful performance as sister Helen Perjean, who wants to help Mattew Poncelet (Sean Penn) accused of murder and also dies. what you get. Great play and it's a movie that is considering something! <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon deserves the 1995 Best Actress Oscar. This is probably one of her greatest films ever. <br /> <br /> I didn't see The Craddle Rock, but I should definitely see more movies from Robbins. <br /> <br /> Rating: 9/10 or *** 1/2 out of 4. Go look .....
