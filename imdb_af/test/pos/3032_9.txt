Forget about the plot of this movie. Remember that it was wonderful acting by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies that Jennifer Lopez faces, which I can stomach. Although the story has been made impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems to be the only important thing to remember when considering this movie. It contains some of the most amazing and disturbing images ever placed on the film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama. A must for anyone who is seriously interested in filmography and the use of the film as a canvas to display true works of visual art. I will give this movie a 9/10 for its wonderful visual performance.
