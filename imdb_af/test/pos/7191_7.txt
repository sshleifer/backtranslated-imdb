In the original French version, the jokes of Numérobis (wonderful voice - Jamel Debbrouze) are very funny. <br /> <br /> But in translated versions (I saw the German and English versions) it is not half as good as the original. <br /> <br /> But: goof Special Effects, almost complete comic (with differences, such as the figure of Lügnix (German name) is placed in another comic book. <br /> <br /> Sure, the Asterix comic book is cult, but if you watch the animated comics from 1968 to 1998, you'll see much better jokes, better story and the old "charm" and "flair" of the cult stories. <br /> <br /> For French speaking people suggest I see it in the original version, with or without subtitles, where available in different languages.
