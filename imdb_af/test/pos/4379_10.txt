This movie was sooooooo good! It was hilarious! There are so many jokes that you can see the movie over and over and not get tired. John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson were great like Pete Hogwallop and Delmar! I love the guys! I also like the adventures they are going on. I definitely recommend this movie. <br /> <br /> The music in this movie is great too! I like to sing along with all the songs!
