It is always a pleasure to see characters in a movie that is quite kind and well-meant, even when surrounded by those who are not. The conservative, religious Franklin family (mother, father, teenage boy and girlfriend) is involved in an accident in which parents and brothers experienced a near death experience, meeting Jesus, a pleasant but somewhat indignant soul they remove the burden of 'original sin'. When they return to their lives, many have changed their views and attitudes, much to the dismay of the daughter, who did not share the experience. The religious side is, in my opinion, a good balance, from the good (Jesus) to the frightening (that of his "followers" who are busy with the sins of others and totally unaware of their own). It's a movie to make you think, give you some good laughs along the way and leave you with the pleasant feeling that the world can only be a nicer place than you think it is.
