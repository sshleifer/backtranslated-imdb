Of all the great 30-star actresses, Miriam Hopkins is the most bizarre overlooked and underestimated. Her string of excellent 30's and 40's is very impressive, but is often called stag or brittle. Yet she had a good sense of humor and was unforgettable in various comedies, including this film, Old Acquaintance (with Bette Davis) and The Smiling Lieutenant (with Maurice Chevalier and Claudette Colbert). Hopkins was known for her aversion to Hollywood, and the results were a bad rep - undeserved. <br /> <br /> In Wise Girl, she plays an heir who tries to save the children of her dead sister's guardian - the sister's brother-in-law (Ray Milland). The movie features a hilarious scene like Hopkins taking a bath is a storeroom. Hopkins includes Milland and Guinn Williams in a $ 3 Greenwich Village restaurant to act as "bohemians". Milland is also excellent and very funny. <br /> <br /> Hopkins and Milland make a good couple. The film also has strong support from Williams, Walter Abel, Henry Stephenson, James Finlayson, Margaret Dumont, Grace Hayle, Leonid Kinskey and Inez Palange. The two girls are OK. <br /> <br /> But Hopkins, drunk on a "cut wine" and wears a dressed dress twice her size, is hilarious as she blows with stray hair while she smokes. A Gil.
