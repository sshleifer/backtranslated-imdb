Don't even try to find out the logic of this story. But ride with 10-year-old Gus on the most bizarre road trip ever seen. More strange characters and incredible situations like a Twin Peaks reunion! Nothing makes sense, but it's impossible to stop watching Motorama! Now, where can I find that 'R' ????
