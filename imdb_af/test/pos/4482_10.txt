Passion in the desert illustrates spatial grander. This is a visual story, illuminated by beautiful cinematography. Passion is filmed in place in the deserts of Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, Namibia and Tunisia. <br /> <br /> We are in Egypt, 1798. Augustin, a Napoleonic soldier, accompanies author and artist Jean-Michel Venture De Paradis on an official mission to document, measure, draw, sign the country's cultural orientations and paint. Egypt: its dunes, astonishing ruins and mysterious people. <br /> <br /> But, can you really "document" majestic shadows, broken buildings and wild Bedouins? Can you really capture the essence of Egypt, nature, man and time? <br /> <br /> Jean and Augustin are lost in the enchanting glittering golden desert, whose abundance overwhelms their senses. <br /> <br /> "You can't be lost in Egypt! There is the Nile, and there is the sea!" says the dehydrated Augustin, and soon he discovers an old, winding cave that leads to " a palatial ruin. <br /> <br /> Delirious and near-delusional, he tries to rest; a confusing sound boasts him; his eyes, body and emotions are closed hypnotically in time as he stumbles into a sensual, sensory experience .... <br /> <br /> A wild, slender female leopard stares back at him and their love affair begins. ... <br /> <br /> A brave love affair, a brave movie.
