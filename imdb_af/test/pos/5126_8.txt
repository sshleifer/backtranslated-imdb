In 'Hoot' a new child comes to Montana from Montana. He first looks at the common problems of mixing and handling the local bully. Soon, however, he becomes aware of a bigger problem: a Franchise restaurant chain is trying to build a site in the village, where a number of diggers live. This movie has the look of a family movie, but it is rather more radical than it seems, as it shows sympathetically how Roy and some friends do not move away from legislation (including private property vandalism and briefly the chain manager of restaurants) in the name of environmental conservation (to save owls, no less). Now one can agree or disagree, but at least the film has the courage not to shoot off its beliefs. A good, solid movie, everything.
