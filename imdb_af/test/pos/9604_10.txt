As you can see, I submitted 2 comments on this show since 1991. And no, ITV has not yet made it available for general expenditure. <br /> <br /> But I recently contacted ITV to see if there was a way to get a copy, and that was their answer ....... <br /> <br /> "Unfortunately, there are no plans to release this program on DVD / video. Buy copies of our Viewers Requests Dept. Their email address is: viewers.requests@itv.com". <br /> <br /> Hope you get the chance to enjoy this classic short comedy again. <br /> <br />
