It's not a step in the park. I saw when it came out, and I didn't have to see it again. You will never see a more terrifying or depressing movie. I felt badly beaten. What kind of world do we live in when we have children who are treated worse than garbage? This is our world, which we created, which allowed us to happen. And I would hesitate to say that I-I-we are not responsible for this. Babenco made this film to wake us up, shake us to our core, and he succeeded. How can we be cruel, or self-sufficient or negligible to our children, when we see the graphic results of such behavior? He shows us a finger at all to do it to the lowest and least powerful of our society. And if you don't do something every day to prevent it, then you're part of the problem. I'm not a religious fanatic, but this movie made me think of the state of my soul.
