I watch a lot of movies, but at present my genre is number one Asian horror. I just bought this DVD and I initially found "Janghwa, Hongryeon" an intriguing but confused movie, as I didn't understand many parts of the story. But in IMDb Board I have a message entitled "Explanation of a Masterpiece (answering all your questions) faster load", written by opiemar, and I was really impressed with the high quality of explanations this user gave to viewers like me have missed what points from the story. I would like to congratulate opiom on his excellent work and propose to write a correct summary of this movie in IMDb and help other viewers. <br /> <br /> Finally, I agree that "Janghwa, Hongryeon" is a great Korean movie, but I don't give ten in my vote because very few people can afford to see the same movie more than once, As this film demands, and without the great support of Opiemar, I could not understand the story as a whole. I plan to see this movie again in the near future. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Medo" ("Fear")
