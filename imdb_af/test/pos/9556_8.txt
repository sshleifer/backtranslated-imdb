"Best in Show" is an often hilarious spectacle that we prepare in the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who are preparing for the event. The only thing that separates this movie from real dogshows is that dogs in "Best in Show" act healthier than their owners! Funny stuff from a leading role including Eugene Levy (Catherine O'Hara, Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, Michael McKean, Jennifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch and Christopher Guest (who wrote with Levy), all of them funny, but Fred Willard steals the movie with his explosive funny performance as the dog show announcer who says the most outrageous things. Plus the dogs are nice too. "Best in show" is not exactly the lazy riot I expected, but there is laughing and it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> *** (out of four)
