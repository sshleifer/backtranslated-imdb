This film by Fridrik Þór, director of Children of Nature, is powerful. It has good music by Sigurrós and good acting. It shows how sad madness can be as a disease. There are many good jokes, but the humor is dark. If it's not a problem, you should see this movie. Note, it's not a comedy, but a drama.
