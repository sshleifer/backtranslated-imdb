* spoiler * * spoilers * * spoilers * I found the movie amusing. It was weird and I enjoyed it, I laughed a lot, so the bottom line is that I recommend the movie. But I have problems with what LaBute wanted to say. Plot is very simple. Betty (Renee Zellweger), a woman with a lively life, watches her husband murder and while she forgot everything she saw, she follows her true love for a maritime character, dr. David Ravell (Greg Kinnear). Simple enough, but not enough to hold a 95 minute movie. And here comes the big question. What is the film about? The reference to "The Wizard of Oz" is obvious. Betty and Dorothy are both from Kansas, while Dorothy at the end of the movie concludes that "there is no place like home", Betty does not come to any conclusion. And by the end of the movie we wonder what she learned from her experience and the answer is simply nothing. She doesn't seem to have any influence at all. <br /> <br /> Then is the film about the different between reality and fantasy? but the scenes dealing with this topic are short and no more than a joke and not a serious plot line that the movie can take to other places (and, incidentally, "The Truman Show" has it deal with topic in a much better way). <br /> <br /> The movie can be obsessed. Betty is obsessive with the soap series and Charlie (Morgan Freeman) is obsessed with Betty. LaBute shows two sides of obsession and he seems To forget the obsession is in any form dangerous and must be condemned. He looks sympathetic to Betty's obsession because he regards it as a harmless one. <br /> <br /> All of a long film has our scenes that in themselves can be a subject for a whole movie, but it is left to us to rethink without affecting the characters. <br /> <br /> The end is simply a makeup that has nothing to do with what we have seen before. This is a pity because the film could be sharper if it were to concentrate in one or two subjects. As it is, it is about many, but actually nothing to say. <br /> <br /> What we left behind is the feeling that we've seen a little movie, amusing and strange, which could have been much more.
