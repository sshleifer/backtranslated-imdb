In the wake of my personal investigation into the pending "end cycle" of 2012 presented by the Mayan calendar system, I believe this movie should be seen as much as "What the lack we know?" While some may believe that top-level science matters should only be communicated at doctoral level, "The Elegant Universe" breaks such barriers, and the footage and menu make it easy to understand this step through the history of physics. There are many messages in this movie, the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to revise what is being taught, true, pure exploration science is beautiful because there is always something extra and exciting to come up with if we have the courage to do so. looking out into the face of 'established' science.
