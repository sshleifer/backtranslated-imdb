I watched two very different Holmes adventures this morning, but you will be amazed at the similarities. <br /> <br /> It was probably the first collaboration between Basil Rathbone (if I was king, Romeo and Juliet) and Nigel Bruce, and director Roy William Neill. It wasn't their first Sherlock Holmes adventure, as they did a few years before. <br /> <br /> The team made an excellent team, but I prefer the Hammer version that I will talk to later. /> <br /> Holmes relies on many disguise to do his job, and I am constantly amused by the ways that are displayed when depicting something. They always seem to have a new idea. <br /> <br /> The story itself to keep a bombing of the Germans in World War II was interesting and focused on the mystery.
