Yes, 2:37 is in some ways a frost of Gus from Sants Elephant. It's about some students who handle their problems leading to the suicide of one of them. Yes, it's full of clich√©s, but it's life. You just can't deny those creepy nerds, disabled people, or popular students who have problems in spite of their popularity, but in the real world. <br /> <br /> But that's not what this movie is about. It's not about high school life. It is not about the misery of life itself. <br /> <br /> If you look below the surface, under the soap-like social relationships shown, you will find a gripping, thoughtful criticism of our society. <br /> Why do people commit suicide? Do we really understand their motives? Or are we just trying to understand, after it's too late? And why is it always someone, you would never have expected it? <br /> <br /> This movie does not answer this question, but it does increase it. And it does so in a very intense way. All the way you keep guessing, whose blood it may be, you see from the beginning. You follow the paths of some students, everyone has more or less good reason to end their lives, just to be forced to see the horrific act in the final. <br /> <br /> Did you know who would be? Or are you surprised, as in real life? <br /> <br /> The message is eventually spoken by one of the surviving children. We are always so stuck on our own problems, we forget to see those of others. There may be someone, a colleague, a friend who no longer wants to live. But if you don't open your eyes, you'll never know until it's too late. <br /> <br /> This movie is doing well. It may have errors, but they don't matter when it's over. Or you see a reflection of society, or you are blind to reality.
