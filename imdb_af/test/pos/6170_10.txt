Since I grew up in Czechoslovakia, I have followed the history of RAF pilots and World War II teams in Great Britain, their stories and tragic ending in battle or in communist prisons and camps. This is undoubtedly more than a dark chapter in our history, though the fact that those brave men can work through it and repair it afterwards is wonderful. To all the people who want to see a good movie ... this is the one! During the recent visit of Czech Republic I saw this movie three times in three days (they only play it for three days ... otherwise I will see it a few more times! It's worth it!) I hope you it will enjoy, although it requires a little more thought and knowledge of background information behind the story, exactly the same way the movie was "Kolya". It's not a simple movie because of its deep story, and the way it said it will probably make you cry ... it did me three times in a row. Zdenek Sverak has always done like a big book, and his son Jan has a big movie and the movie? Undoubtedly, all of them did good work, I was amazed at Ondrej Vetchy, played the big part by Oldrich Kaiser and all the other actors who just made this movie BIG !!! If it's not an Oscar nomination, I think I'll stop at Holywood.
