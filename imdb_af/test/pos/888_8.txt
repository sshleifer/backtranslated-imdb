Well, SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD edition in Korea, and despite the most negative responses I've heard and the suspiciously daring DVD release, I couldn't help it, but any wu xia movie is better. as most non-wu-xia movies in my eyes: D Perhaps low expectations were an advantage because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the movie very enjoyable. <br /> <br /> A killer kills a number of ministers involved in a throne-seized revolution, and the government's top swordsman has the task of identifying the culprit. It doesn't take long, but the answer is not one he wanted to hear. Through prolonged flashbacks, we learn why, and the history of the swordsman and the assassin and of the revolution. <br /> <br /> The movie is typically melodramatic for a Korean movie, and resolutely serious in tone - no HK-style comedy moments can be found here. The story can only be a little difficult to follow, but everything makes sense eventually. The movie is going to be a bit wobbly but not worse than a Chang Cheh movie, and for the most part I found it enjoyable. The production values ​​are high, with some good cinematography to capture it. The battle scenes are not up to the caliber of the better HK wu xia movies, but maybe they're not meant to be - the battles are more "realistic" because they are less like choreographic dance routines, but there are a few wiring and occasionally cgi setting the movie in the "wu xia" mode. The movie doesn't have the best role, unfortunately, with the clues a bit lacking in charm and sometimes difficult to distinguish from each other. There is a young lady in the movie I don't think I've seen before, but made the best impression on any of the principles of the game. Not just because you see her necklace ... or maybe it is: p The movie is missing The charm and grace of the better HK wu xia movies, and maybe the beauty, but I just wish HK would make them half the good - TWINS EFFECT 2 doesn't give me hope that it will happen soon, although Tsui Hark still has it in it if he can get the funding and throw. SWORD IN THE MOON does not go on my favorite wu xia list in any way, but it is a lot better than ROMANTIC WARRIORS or LEGEND OF THE EVIL LAKE - maybe better than BICHUNMOO, although I'm such a movie like this movie had a little more on a second show. Obviously it is nowhere near the wonderful MUSA, but it's actually another matter. SITM will probably get a second impression within three years, which may be the best indicator of how much I liked it :) 7/10
