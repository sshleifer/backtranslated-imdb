Motorama viewers are both keen on other offbeat b-grade desert-based films such as Baghdad Cafe or Repo Man (more or less in the desert). It also models some of the bizarre humor (and especially eccentric characters of characters) of the writer Joseph Minion's comedy, "After Hours." In a kind of desert road trip fantasy, a metaphor of temptation and salvation, Gus (played well by Jordan Christopher Michael), a clever ten-year-old boy bumping into his piggy bank, stealing a Mustang and running away from his big neglected parents. It begins as a journey through salvation (apparently in the scenes with John Diehl), but as soon as he touches a scratch game called Motorama, he is easily infested with temptation and loses his childish innocence. He travels from one crazy fictional state to another way to get Motorama cards from participating petrol stations, just as he can spell out the winning word MOTORAMA and qualify for the $ 500 million cash prize. <br /> <br /> Along the way, he has dozens of strange characters, such as Flea who plays a high-powered bus boat, Meatloaf playing a crazy biker, and Mary Woronov and Sandy Baron (a Seinfeld regular) as two violent kidnappers. <br /> <br /> The DVD extradition can be very misleading as well as previous attempts to first sell this film to the non-cult market, with taglines comparing it to Home Alone and Thelma & Louise. The latest calls it a love story with the tagline which suggests that the movie about Jordan Michael Christopher is on an adventure to meet the girl of his dreams ... which despite the size of her photo on the DVD cover actually just over a second comes Drew Barrymore as the fantasy girl Gus dreams of. Why didn't they just market it for what it was? Think it looks quite bizarre at first sight, it's actually a well-designed story. <br /> <br /> Motorama is good material for fans of strange b-grade comedies. It was quite an interesting story, especially because of the strength of his main actor - Jordan Michael Christopher (unfortunately few other screen credits) - and the clever metaphor inherent in the plot. Hopefully the re-release on DVD will make it easier for cult fans.
