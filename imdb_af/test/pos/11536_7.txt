Jennifer Egan's novel was screened by Canadian director Adam Brooks. Based on a few comments from contributors to this forum, it is a bad proposal, but it is much better than one led to believe. <Br /> <br /> It's a story about two sisters who loved each other. Faith, the righteous and happy hippie girl, takes her younger brother, Phoebe, under her wing. Phoebe obviously believes; When the parent decides to follow her boyfriend Wolf to Europe on a summer vacation from Berkley, she promises to send Phoebe a postcard every day. Faith until the cards stop coming in and one night, a while later, the family gets a call to inform them. Faith died under tragic circumstances. <br /> <br /> Phoebe can't forget Faith. Therefore, after a few years she decides to take the same route the older sister took. She takes the cards from Faith and visits every place, starting in Amsterdam, then to Paris and she wants to travel in Portugal where Faith experiences her untimely death. <br /> <br /> In Paris, Phoebe is associated with Wolf, who is no longer a hippie, and lives with his girlfriend. Wolf, trying to persuade Phoebe to leave and return home; She suspects that Wolf has the key in solving the mystery and if she goes to Portugal, she makes a discovery when she finds a picture that clearly contradicts Wolf's version he told Phoebe. He feels guilty and decides, to his friend's wishes, to accompany Phoebe to the town where Faith died. The story changes at this point and we go back in flashbacks to what Faith in Europe has experienced and what happened in her last days. <br /> <br /> The best thing about "The Invisible Circus" is the actions of the principals, something that Mr. Brooks must receive the credit. The big surprise is the series Cameron Diaz, who, like Faith, looks light comedy parts, if she can do really good dramatic work by the right director. Jordana Brewster is seen as the older Phoebe and makes a wonderful contribution to the film. She is a beautiful beauty with what appears to be a natural act. Christopher Eccleston is Wolf and shows he is also able to do more serious drama. The lovely Camilla Belle plays the younger Phoebe very convincingly. Blythe Danner appears as the mother of the girls. <br /> <br /> The European locations are photographed by Henry Braham in a glamorous way. The film is also enhanced by the musical score of Nick Laird-Clowes and Petra Haden's original song. Elizabeth Kling has been edited with great elegance. Eventually, this movie shows Adam Brooks in a good shape, as he gives the right tone to the adaptation of the novel and is rewarded by the right to do wonders for him.
