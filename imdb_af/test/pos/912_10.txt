This movie is not just about feelings and human emotions, it's about everything that can be, but it's not. Poetry in movies can be terribly boring and annoying, but this movie is great to watch. Not to mention the great Irene Jacob, a great actress in France - one of the best, actually. When the movie ends, you can only feel sorry. After all, if something really good, we want more (Well, for another great movie by K Kieslowsky with Ir√®ne Jacob, we can always see La double vie de Veronique)
