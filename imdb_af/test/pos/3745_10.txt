Before I talk about the end of this movie, I'll talk about the plot. Some man named Gerald breaks his relationship with Kitty and goes down to Craven Castle in Scotland. After a few months, Kitty and her aunt ventured to Scottland. On arrival at Craven Castle Kitty, Gerald finds himself outdated and he became commonplace. Gerald has certain rules for the castle (the rules are the same for 200 years). Gerald doesn't want them to stay, but Kitty insists on staying by making excuses. One evening her aunt got a look at the monster running across the hall. It scares her so much that she disappears and (another excuse) they have to stay longer. Kitty becomes more concerned about Gerald after she tries to enter the maze, but Gerald catches her and is even encouraging for her. Kitty then sends out reinforcements, she calls their doctor who is actually their friend and his widow. Then things don't make you suspicious, they invite some other friends (who do nothing). Blah, blah, blow Kitty and her aunt in the maze where the greatest tension of the story is. They are somehow separated and they try to find each other. But the aunt stumbles upon the creatures ... here it is the moment we've been waiting, what is the creature in the shadows? ... it's a huge FROG !!! OMG, that's better than that! After seeing the aunt, the frog is literally mad and running, oops, I mean hoping the stairs to the top of the castle. The frog then jumps out an open window. We then go off the ground and see the frog gal to us (oh yes this movie was in 3-D). But you want to know what's funny is the frog falling out of the window is actually a toy, as it is 1/10 the size of the frog before it takes the leap. It is then revealed that it was already evolutionary, bladder, blah and kitty and Gerald married. Then the last shot of this masterpiece of the tomb of the frog in the maze, is the only place he ever really was happy;).
