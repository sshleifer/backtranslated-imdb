Here's another of the 1940s westerns I see when it comes to TCM or FMC, because while it's historically flawed, it's extremely entertaining and well-behaved, plus it has Randolph Scott, my favorite actor, second only to Gary Cooper-Wel, OK, fourth behind COOP, Charlton Heston, and Gregory Peck. But the movie itself, anyway, is fairly historically accurate and, as I said earlier, it did well and flows very well. I think I've seen it 50 or 60 times and enjoy more than the one each time. I did it on tape from TCM, but would buy it in a minute if it ever came out on DVD. See it if you haven't guaranteed it!
