In the way it looks at the other comments made, it seems that many people didn't get the point on the movie. It is not centered around sombies. They are not zombies, they are a device that is reproduced by the wizard to kill the girls. His main focus is on Meg Tilly, who wants to help him finish. work that he died while doing in the first place, and what you get is a great movie with a great ending, it's hard to find on video, but every time it appears on HBO or Cinamax, check out, I gave it a 10 and strongly recommend it.
