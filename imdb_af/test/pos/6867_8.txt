I was very curious about Anatomy (aka Anatomy) and if I saw it, I had to buy it, since no video stores in my area were wearing the movie. Since it was not a low-cost DVD, I had a chance and thought I'd look at other comments on IMDb. Many of the comments didn't give me enough hope to spend too much money on a movie I've never seen or had any clues. I basically had the idea that it is a sexy youth-oriented skirt that is compared to many cookie cutter teen thrillers. Well, something behind me told me to ignore and buy such comments! I did and was pleasantly surprised! <br /> <br /> If compared to any other movie, I'd say it's a variation of Coma and Extreme Measures. I couldn't see any comparison with films like Scream, Urban Legends, et al. Yes, the role is young (that's because they are fellow students! At least it's not the increasingly boring high school type of characters), and yes, some are funny (basically the character Anna Loos plays, and it is handled very tasty in the German version), but Anatomy is well built, there is a strained mood throughout, the sets are wonderful, the makeup effects are a wow, and Franka Potente is very credible in her role. I found that I enjoyed it all despite some gaping holes in the plot! The story of a student who discovers a kind of secret society doing autopsy on patients with a lasting life is a pretty scary scenario and then it is quite clever. Sure, you can ask why she didn't just come from that town? Well, then the movie will be in half an hour. <br /> <br /> This was the first attempt by the German part of Columbia Pictures, and it's actually quite impressive. There was a little care in the production and to actually provide real excitement is an achievement. It is a bit mature in mind, as it does not resort to constant sexual encounters (a breast party) or juvenile joke joke. Anna Loos's character, while often making sexual remarks and looking for fun, was actually a fun touch - with a character more intelligent than any of the men in the school. She found that sex was just a distraction for her and the men who lacked quite a bit. <br /> <br /> THE IMPORTANT STUDY: Watch this movie in the original German language with English or French subtitles, the best way to enjoy it. I saw the theater trailers in English, and was disgusting about the change it made in the scene of the movie. I have never seen a nice movie in my life - they can never find voices that match the film's actors or characters. Sure enough, I've been trying to look at some of the anatomy dubbed in English and its intelligence level has diminished, which looks like a comedy. A good example is when a man is about to be cut open and screaming to be tied up again. He heard it sound in German, but called in English, he sounded like a comedian. Frankly, I'm sick of hearing people say they can't handle reading subtitles or watching a "letterboxed" movie. Anatomy comes down as stupid with confronted voices that seem to be too high for any of the people you see in the movie, and Anna Loos's sexual commentary sounds just like horrible remarks right out of Fast Times At Ridgemont High. I wonder if the negative comment about Anatomy of people who bought it, it doesn't look like the same movie! This is not a cheap horror movie and must be earned as it was created. Interesting to note, some of the English subtitles are different in scenes in the function and "make" supplements. <br /> <br /> I seem to have worked and won with Anatomy. It's a skillful game with similar characters and doesn't try to get cheap excitement.
