It is one of several era seafaring yarns of its era, which has the dedicated distinction (though not in itself unique) of a female buccaneer in its center. Initially, both leaders - Jean Peters and Louis Jourdan - may appear to be scandalous, but they eventually become good at their roles. Thank you to the talented players (Herbert Marshall, Thomas Gomez and James Robertson Justice) who support them. Fatty-tuned Marshall is cast uncharacteristically as the ship-bound philosophical prosperity of a doctor and Gomez is better than life than Blackbeard's The Pirate. <br /> <br /> The cast is completed by Debra Paget as Jourdan's wife, which causes the jealous rage of the tomboyish titular character in which Jourdan causes the first pang of love (which, however, does not save him or her sword) ; incidentally, the film was the second exotic teamwork of Jourdan and Paget in one year, after Delmer Daves's BIRD OF PARADISE. The direct result of this unexpected mitigation of Anne's character is that she falls with Blackbeard's crew and her unlikely climate sacrifice to save the lives of stranded Jourdan, Paget and Marshall. <br /> <br /> Whilst the film is not an exceptional example of its kind, Jacques Tourneur's energetic direction and Franz Waxman's grandiose score ensure an above average quick move. Coincidentally, Tourneur has already performed in the genre with the superior Burt Lancaster vehicle, THE FLAME AND THE ARROW (1950). As usual with vintage Technicolor productions, the film gives the film a wonderful and refreshing movie. By the way, for this movie different run times are given (81 or 87 minutes) and for the record, the version I watched was the shorter one.
