I tried to reconcile so many bad reviews of this movie, while the vast majority of reviews are given a score of between 7 and 10. The reason for this is that this film can hardly be described in a positive review, although a couple did it pretty well. This film is confusing, depressed and does not have a happy ending. I still gave Pola X a score of 10 because it's basically for my literature and art combined on film. It's really my favorite type of movie entertainment. I only saw two of Carax's movies: this one and Mauvis Sang. As with this movie, I become somewhat pretentious if I call this one of Carax's best films - but I am. Carax has a minimalist style. If that type of film doesn't appeal to you and is boring then it's best not to see it. But Pola X was less minimalist than Mauvis Sang, so it had a lot of intensity for a thrill - at least for my taste. I found it very interesting and absorbent. The two main roles have done an excellent job. (I mean the head and the young woman he thought were his half-sister.) Catherine D. is always wonderful, but her role wasn't very big or meaningful in the story. But everyone did a good job. I thought the cult goods were wonderful. It may not be very credible, but it is because it is rather abstract. There is a lot going on between the lines in this movie. It's a very Freudian psycho-thriller.
