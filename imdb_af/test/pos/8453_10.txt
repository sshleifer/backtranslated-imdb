TV newswriter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical camper Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are at a nuclear facility when a serious accident happens. The plant managers played it down, but Adams filmed it all. Wells and Adams are trying to get it on the air, but the corporation managing the plant prevents it. Plant manager Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) realizes there are serious problems and tests have been falsified. He tries to get drivers to believe him - only they know it. Wells, Adams and Godell find all their lives in danger. <br /> <br /> I saw it in a movie in 1979. I was just 17 and it made me dirty. To make matters worse, the Three Mile Island accident occurred around this time, making the movie more real. If I see it more than 20 years later, it won't scare me, but it's still a great movie. It works as a mystery, a gripping drama and a nuclear power expose. Fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as Wells - she brings out her character's increasing suspicion and horror when she realizes that a nuclear disaster can happen. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He began to believe in his company and work and began to unravel slowly when he found out things. He was legally nominated for an academy award for this. Douglas is good but he has a small portion and is completely overshadowed by Lemmon and Fonda. <br /> <br /> A very good movie - one of the best of the 70's. do not miss this one!
