David Cronenberg movies are easy to identify, or at least display the elements in the movie as his trademarks. Fetishism, blurring between the organic and inorganic, turbulent throbbing things that should not be discouraged. "eXistenZ" is classic Cronenberg. In short, it's about a future generation of computer games, but instead of a video monitor, images are provided by your mind. The game goes directly into a 'bio gate' in the base of your spine and while the game is running, the player can't tell the reality of the game. Jennifer Jason Leigh plays the game's developer and leads a novitiate marketer, Jude Law, through the game. While in play, they discover strange actions and possible crimes. But are they really, or is it the game? Not even the game's author knows. <br /> <br /> The movie is quite a spoil, keeping the viewer engaged, but in the dark until the final minutes. Another thing I like about "eXistenZ" is that it doesn't rely heavily on special effects, it's the story itself that propels movie. Recommended for Saturday night when science fiction is called.
