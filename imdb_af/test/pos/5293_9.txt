Ponyo is a beautiful animated movie with a few dark undertones. It has a child-sized story of longing and love with ecological implications, but it is not preaching. Hayao Miyazaki merged Andersen's Little Mermaid with Japan's native myths and his fancy stamp-punk flight from fancy, and the result is very rewarding. There are some terrifying moments of storms and floods of oceans, but they are exciting, not scary. <br /> <br /> If you ever wanted to run the waves along the shore, ride a jellyfish as a lift, change yourself completely or make a friend for life. Ponyo is a fable for you.
