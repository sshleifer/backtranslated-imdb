"Imaginary Heroes" is a 2004 film featuring Sigourney Weaver, Jeff Daniels, Emile Hirsch, Michelle Williams and Kip Pardue. <br /> <br /> The story is about a dysfunctional family that becomes even more dysfunctional when the oldest child (Pardue) commits suicide. <br /> <br /> "Ordinary people" are often mentioned in connection with this movie; It's kind of "Ordinary People" with a role reversal. The mother in this case, Sandy Travis (Weaver), is more accessible than the father, Ben (Daniels), who is clearly devastated and unable to go. Like the ordinary people, the younger son Tim (Hirsch) is the focus of the film. <br /> <br /> For me the movie was enough to watch, but it has a strange debauchery about it. There were some wonderful interactions: mother and son, mother and neighbor, brother and sister (Williams) and some good anticipating moments. What never clicked was that Ben was any part of that family or had any chemistry with Sandy. It seems to be the goal of director / writer Dan Harris. In one scene in a grocery store, the checkout notes that Sandy is "about 30" and gives her his phone number. Daniels almost asks Sandy for the next scene if she wants her plastic operation. Weaver was 55 when this film was made, probably 54, and looks phenomenal. So what does Ben look like? However, there is something to do about Ben's complete debauchery because the viewer doesn't really see how Daniels is ever attached to that family. <br /> <br /> The end has some twists and also some very pleasant scenes. Everyone is very good, with Weaver and Hirsch as standouts. <br /> <br /> There is not a huge dialogue in this movie and much stare. The writing could have been sharper. But "Imaginary Heroes" is a good effort.
