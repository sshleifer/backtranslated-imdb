A great movie about the triumph over all the no victories trying to kill your mind, the impossible. I will not think about it, except to say that I would like to reflect on this movie when I hit something special, and realize that if Lindberg can do what he did, I can surely do the job in front of me. Definitely a good movie. <br /> <br /> See it. You won't be disappointed.
