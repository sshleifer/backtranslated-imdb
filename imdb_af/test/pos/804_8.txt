Just after moving into his new home in the English country, Hercule Poirot is inviting Sir Henry and Lady Angkatell, the owners of a large home-based neighborhood. But the next day, one of the guests was shot near the pool, and his clumsy wife held a revolver a few steps away. <br /> <br /> This Agatha Christie secret is somewhat thin, although the Killer's plan is still very clever. This is the beautiful filming and cinematography that elevates the story to a higher level. This episode mostly shows the seriousness of "Five Little Pigs" and "Sad Cypress", but contains more dark humor than them. The film may include the two most famous actors who worked at this point in the series, Edward Fox (as the butler) and Sarah Miles (as Lady Angkatell), although the striking performance is given by the stunning Megan Dodds as forwards. Henrietta: her one-on-one confrontation with Suchet's glitter and are the highlights of the movie. Oh, and since an English police inspector got involved in the case, I think they could have brought Philip Jackson back for this one. (***)
