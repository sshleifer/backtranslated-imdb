I am surprised people, after such a bad movie is in the top 250 or just in the 7.0's, I thought more people would get a kick from "Gooi Momma of the Train". It was a great comedy by two great comic actors, Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito. Together they made a great duo of madness and obsession. Billy is a man who has just lost his million-dollar story to his ex-wife and wants her death repeatedly, Danny has an insane and senile old mother who just abuses him. When Billy gives some advice to Danny, Danny presents Billy. If he kills his ex-wife, Billy must kill his mother. It's a crazy and funny story that can always get a good laugh. Please, sit back and enjoy this movie, people! It's a good one! <br /> <br /> 7/10
