When I first heard of this movie, I noticed that it was one of the most controversial films of the 1970s. I noticed that the music was by Elton John, so I thought I didn't lose anything, so I got it. What a surprise !!! The movie was wonderful. That was where love is about. The characters (Paul and Michelle) had no luxuries, no money, and sometimes no food, but they were still happy. I recommended this movie to all my friends, but they all criticized my taste and even called me names because the movie was two minors naked. I think it just made the movie more realistic. The cinematography was wonderful and it just came to show the great abilities of director Lewis Gilbert
