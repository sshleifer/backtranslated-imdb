Uzumaki has a formidable reputation in Lovecraftian circles and now I know why. Uzumaki is based on a Manga title (which is allegedly better than the movie) and follows the bizarre events that a typhoon envisions. an isolated Japanese village. I'm not going to tell you anything about this movie because it's an absolute must-see movie. I watched it for the first time last night and I was blown away. It has shot in the best movies of all time and the Pans Labyrinth is the best fantastic movie (literally and photographically) released in the past decade. <br /> <br /> This movie is very loving in nature. without having a direct connection with the Cthulhu Mythos. It's made the same way that Lovecraft made his stories; It radiates power as an aura of 'something that is not quite right', intensifying through an alarming phase of fear and ultimately horror through subtle progressive changes in the soundtrack and cinematography. It is indeed a "foreign language" excellence. <br /> <br /> Simply stunning.
