THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting feature made for HBO film that gave a detailed look at the power struggle that followed between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This battle is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who don't know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now, it might be interesting to learn that David Letterman wants to replace Johnny Carson as host of THE TONIGHT SHOW as Anything in the world, but Letterman found his dreams to be derailed as a regular host. Leno had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, in his corner and worked tirelessly to get her client's job. It is not often what we will see behind the scenes. Hollywood filming recreates for entertainment, but for fans of these two late night superstars, this movie has a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late-night television. According to this film, Letterman was promised the work of Carson himself while NBC promised Leno the job and that's where Helen Kushnick came in. The film offers Leno like a milqueto mast that allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick ignorance of some of Helen's brave manipulations of some of NBC's greatest power players. It offers Letterman as this clever and skilled businessman who, despite Carson's support, was run up by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck respectively credibly recreate Letterman and Leno, but this is the sharp performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates and Helen Kushnick who makes this movie bubble. Bates recommends the screen in one of her best, if not so well-known performances as the poisonous Hollywood agent who eats breakfast television studio executives. There is also a wonderful turn by Impressionist Rich Little like Johnny Carson, but it is mainly a fascinating story and the generator performance by Bates that makes this one worth checking out.
