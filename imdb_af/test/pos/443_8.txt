I watched this movie three times in different lives of my life and always enjoyed it very much. This Can-Can is an authentic explosion of joie de vivre, such as Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly musical, but in the French way. And a Jean Renoir is a good tribute to his time, his friends, lovers, music and dances. At the same time, it is a show chronicle of that age, full of love and French mood. This is an honest tribute to Impressionism (people who love impressionist painters will love this picture). This is especially a tribute to Toulouse-Lautrec and of course to Jean Renoir's father, Pierre-Auguste. You will find a reliable and wonderful colored recreation of some Renoir masterpiece. Excellent casting, landscape, sound effects and music. Even this tells us about the creation of the Parisian Moulin Rouge, of course it is a fiction story (and not very original by the way, because it falls into the very good moral that the performance must continue). But the Jean Renoir production is wonderful. <br /> <br />
