Got it the other day from the creators on DVD. I advertised it in a free magazine while the family stopped in a hotel and didn't hear anything about it. After reading it was filmed on Balmedie's beach. I just had to buy it. I always took the kids to the dunes in the movie while I was living in Aberdeen. <br /> <br /> 1st off I'm not a big Sci-Fi fan (Star Wars). I just wanted to see what they did with this movie spot, I was amazed at the moment. It was not a standard Sci-Fi, more than a mix of sci-fi and survival horror. <br /> <br /> Had a good story, which was different, had huge special effects for the budget that it was produced by Â£ 8,000. Acting was better than average for a low budget movie. The way they worked out the whole coastline to make it feel that the dry desert plan they were doing was nice. <br /> <br /> Weapons in the movie were realistic and the creatures were cool as a predator in the invisible file. <br /> <br /> All in all, I will buy any future releases from these guys, maybe a whole horror following (Hint Hint). The extras on the DVD were very informative to give background to the producers. I would like to see some of their shorts included as extras on a next DVD edition. <br /> <br /> Excellent work keeps it up
