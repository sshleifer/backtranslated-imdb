"Two Hands" is an entertaining, funny story about the Australian lowlifes. The script contrasts the world of quick money and deadly deeds with the inexplicability of fate and circumstances. In a subtle way, we are asked to think of the concept that important events in our lives are sometimes generated without our being fully aware of the causes. The forces of fate and circumstance take Jimmy, the main character, into situations that result in the realization of his shallow dreams and ultimately an understanding of a more promising world. <br /> <br /> The clueless Jimmy, depicted With Heath Ledger's grace, is a child who grew up without a chance. The high paying world of crime offers the greatest appeal to its blunt senses. The love and help of friends leads him to a higher plateau. <br /> <br /> The movie is well-directed and well-acted. The band of criminals boasts between beloved and despicable, and holds us in the madness throughout the film.
