It's a very good movie. I give it a 10. <br /> <br /> It's very different because it's kind of a long stalking scene throughout. The fact that the main character is dumb is used by the story in a very credible way. <br /> <br /> She sees a murder (for a sniff movie) and decides to run, but is rushed (it takes a lot of time). I won't disclose the rest of the movie, as it will spoil the experience, but be assured: it's very credible, well-played, very intense and has some good surprises and a good ending. <br /> <br /> Don 't miss this movie.
