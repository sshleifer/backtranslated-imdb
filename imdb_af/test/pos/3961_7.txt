it is a teenage movie and while you watch it expects it to be uncomfortable here and there, but overall the movie is very effective. It makes you questionable and makes you think the story is far-fetched, but is credible and makes you feel good in series, it's not as it does and tries to go. The characters are fairly well defined and convincing. Justin stands out for a long time between all the others and looks forward to his speech. In the end, he will convince anyone with that speech. He is simply brilliant in that speech. He has to take even more serious roles, he is worth more than just teenage movies. etch this movie and be freed
