Robust David Innes (solid Doug McClure) and doddery Dr Abner Perry (a beautiful daughter Peter Cushing) drill their way into the heart of the earth in their spiffy mole machine. The duo discovers an ancient prehistoric world, populated by dangerous giant animals and people used as evil food and slaves by evil telepathic pterodactile men. Director Kevin Conner, who is written from Milton Subotsky from a silly dummy, maintains a constant fast pace and treats the exceptionally silly premise with astonishing seriousness. This gives this picture a lot of serious quality that is both amusing and engaging in equal measure. The lovely hokey (not so) special effects are quite (unintentionally) funny. In particular, the cheesy spectacle of the cut cattle is positive on the side: rough-eyed-in-obvious-clumsy-rubber pterodactyl men, equally rinky-think wild-monkey-man-brute, and a hilariously ridiculous whimpering frog what blows up real good. A brand new highlight comes when McClure mixes it with a fat and awkward giant reptile. Another valuable scene shows a dinosaur dressing a doll in his slave jaws. In addition, we also get a while and an exciting climactic slave rebellion. It is a total surprise to see Cushing share in a rare broad comedic part in a bad, broad comedy, and in the final third of the movie become an unlikely but enthusiastic arrow-swinging action hero. Everlasting Caroline Munro looks positive like Princess Dia, plus there are nice supporting shots by Cy Grant as gallant fighter Ra and Sean Lynch as treacherous coward Hoojah. Mike Vickers' neatly varied score ranges from a bunch of orchestral music and wonky droning synthesizer stuff. Alan Hume's sharp cinematography adds a brilliant luster to the infectious proceedings. A full championship riot.
