Rififi is a good movie that is overlooked. This is a crime drama where a man comes out of jail and plans another job. This is an over-used story, but this one differs from the other. They call the ordinary suspects for the job. This film watches the family torn apart as time goes on. The real hoist scene is one of the best I've ever seen. Instead of an exciting soundtrack, the director decided to remain silent for about 30 minutes. It fits perfectly into the mood and is copied today. Of course things go out and people die and it ends in a good end that builds up in tension. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a great movie noir that doesn't talk to many people. this is a good addition.
