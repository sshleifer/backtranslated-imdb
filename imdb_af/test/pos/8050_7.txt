While making the movie a 7, I must also point out that it is historically interesting (such as star Mae Marsh, Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and less well-known) and have a very exciting action for her. day. . <br /> <br /> The plot is strange to a Western, as all the problems with the Indians start for the weirdest reason I've ever seen! The Indians decide to have a huge dog bank (no, they don't feed dogs but feed on ON dogs) and when two Indians arrive late, there are no pooches left! So they steal two dogs that belong to two orphans of the nearby White settlement and this is actually a complete war! Not only is it stupid, but it seems to play on the prejudices of audiences. I don't know if American Indians actually ate dogs, but it looks like the kind of stereotype that is later applied to other ethnic groups. All this about dogs! The movie has some great fighting scenes and exciting moments - like when Mrs Marsh crawls over the battlefield to save a baby! Exciting things! But, STRANGE, too!
