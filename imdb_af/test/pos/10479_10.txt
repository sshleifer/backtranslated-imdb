"Babette's Feast" and "The Horse's Mouth" are the two most informative, accurate films about what it is to be a true artist. The key lines in Babette's Feast are not as some other commentators have said here: an artist is never poor, but two lines that come before and after it: <br /> <br /> "I was able to make them happy when i got my best gift ........................................... ..................... <br /> <br /> For nine years, I produced an experimental multimedia theater in San Francisco, which earned money for productions who had dozens of singers, actors, designers, and so on, and the artists I supported, every penny in their effort to do their best, just like Babette: they were desperate to get every dollar needed to Doing their best work Babette's art is fine French cuisine, and for her to do her best at 10,000 francs, when after years of political exile from France, with two caring spiders on a dark Scandinavian coast, Get a 10 000 franc windfall, she does what every real artist would: she sees that she has the chance to do her very well, and so she does. She spends all the money, so she can do her best work as an artist. The twist in the movie is that we don't know she's such an artist until she actually cooks and serves the meal. Until then, she appeared to be a working French lady who was a little involved with the artisans, and was very serious (her husband and son were murdered in Paris in 1871). <br /> <br /> For such an artist it is secondary whether there is an audience for the art capable of appreciating it. Therefore, the author puts this dinner in a community of people who may not have understood what they are receiving. Babette did not create this meal as a gift to the two spiders, or to the religious community. It was not her goal to attain a reconciliation or spirit of good feelings among the members of the small religious sect. Indeed, she never leaves the kitchen to talk to any of them. After dinner she sat alone and drank some wine and didn't pay the slightest attention to how the guests responded. She is happy to finally do her best as an artist. <br /> <br /> That's why it's so satisfying and so important to the general that the general arrives unexpectedly - because, as Babette knows right away, a general will know what she has put in front of him, and will appreciate it. Because there is a kind of tragedy in a great work of art shown to an audience who even has one person without knowledge to appreciate it. She is happy, very happy, he has come, in fact he is the only guest she ever mentioned during the whole dinner, the only one she chose for special treatment - not one of the spiders. But she didn't plan the meal because they knew that someone would come to receive it. <br /> <br /> For anyone who had the opportunity to enjoy a real first-class Parisian dinner, as I did (my father was Naval Attache to Paris in the 1980s, and I have my honeymoon in France) Dinner, and Babette's satisfaction with making it, and the pleasure it brings to the dinners, is absolutely convincing. If an art has the power to enjoy the recipient with joy, it is a good French meal cooked and served in France. This movie claims the transforming effects of great art on the recipients. Before dinner, the members of the small religious sect are frightening, getting the old remorse. The old songs fail to restore good community; people ignore them, talk about them. But the shared experience of sensual great art - because people can enjoy the taste of food and wine, even if they have no idea that they are experiencing great artistic content, puts them in a forgiveness, reconciles them, and make them happy, encourage them to love one another and thus have a divine holy effect to bring peace. This is the demand found in the modern art movement today - that art can replace traditional religions to make man more peaceful. So, unlike the commentators here who say that this film speaks for the power of Christian faith, it is more accurate to say that the film claims that art can cure wounds that Christian ritual cannot. After all my years in the art world I have to say that this claim - that art brings peace that religion cannot - blows and is invalid. But this is a beautiful imagination and this is the second main theme of this beautiful film. <br /> <br /> One last note: at Babette's arrival at the spiders' home, a specific French general, Galliffet, is the name of the person who carried Babette's husband and son in 1871 and a military rule imposed that she had to flee. At the end of the film, as the general tells the story of the wonderful meal he had enjoyed in Paris many years before (before 1871), it seems that the same Galliffet was his host at the dinner. As the general tells the story, French General Galliffet praised the chef of that meal as the greatest woman, the only woman for whom he would dare his life. Of course, that woman was Babette. So, ironically, the same French general who had honored Babette over all other women was responsible for driving her away from France forever.
