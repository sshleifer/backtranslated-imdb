I was very surprised by the PG score on the back of the DVD case. I definitely don't want my kids to look at this one. I think it will make the shit out of a 10-year-old scare. <br /> <br /> Plot: A girl trying to fit into the click is devastated and tormented by "in crowd". They talk to her about spending the night in this Greek mausoleum (it reminded me of Phantasm ...) and they continue to torment her at night. Little do they know, a recently deceased clairvoyant comes back to life and makes the dead around them! It sounds a lot cheesy, but the age and budget, which were undoubtedly quite small, are on very flat fun. <br /> <br /> Look for an early EG Daily as one of the crowd. I enjoyed it and it scared my girlfriend. <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10, kids.
