This first (and hopefully not the last) Wallace & Gromit feature meets expectations. There are many jokes (a little tough) as well as some great tributes to the past of Science Fiction movies. With the obstruction of horrible and formal films being rinsed out of Hollywood, it is great to see such a good movie as it is for everyone. In addition, if there is any justice, it will be the cashier and the next Oscars for the best animation will be named. The animation is wonderful; The characters are remarkably expressive and their adventures are great. This is one of those movies that the whole family can enjoy. Tasty, smart, fun and good, what's not to enjoy?
