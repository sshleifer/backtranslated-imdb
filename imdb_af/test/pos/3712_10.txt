A beautiful photographed and fast short film. It understands the feelings of this family and much of the country just before and after Pearl Harbor. I appreciated the visual appearance of the film - of course and at the same time poetic. Great work by a great D.P., David Boyd. <br /> <br /> Although a family movie, the story never becomes maudlin or saccharine. We understand and believe the motivation the young boy drives on his odyssey. I understand the love of the younger brother for his older brother and do not question why he is smearing to do what he does. I understand that he is driven by a deep desire to be with his brother in this time of crisis. The child is tough, and the performance by Jonathan Furr is great as the veteran performance by Ron Perlman.
