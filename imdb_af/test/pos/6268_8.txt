God bless Joe D'Amato ... I love Italian horror, cheese (film-wise;), sci-fi, etc. <br /> <br /> This one was a bit harder to watch, but another fun BAD movie. <br /> <br /> I like how people submit a negative review with "I usually enjoy bad movies, but ..." No, it's a bad movie. For people who love bad movies. This is one of my top bad movies. <br /> <br /> Miles O'Keefe was a poor man's Conan, but oh, it's nice. Who can't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb, a hang glider and a cheesy rubber sample? It is nice to hate this movie if you just want Hollywood stuff like "Titanic" or "Pretty Woman", but if you really mean, you should love LOVE movies, check this one. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies that is fun to rent for a beer bust or when you have some friends and a little bit of pointless fun. <br /> <br /> My rating 8/10.
