As an earlier reviewer said, Travolta stole every scene he was in. Recognize the character? It was Vinnie Barberino, all big and still a little sleepy, but still nice, oh yeah! <br /> <br /> Disappointing was William Hurt and Bob Hoskins, perhaps because their characters were poorly written, or just didn't care. I saw one of the Baldwins (never remembered) in the Hurt role so the incredible talents of Hurt were not wasted. <br /> <br /> Andie McDowell is a sweetie but not very credible; partly the writing. Character development was just not a big thing in this movie. Just look for Travolta, sit back and enjoy.
