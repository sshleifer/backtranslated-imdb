English entry from Europe over Czech fighter planes flying for RAF during World War II. It is always interesting as an American to see a new position on well-known events in history. There's nothing terribly original or revolutionary about the style in which it is filmed, or the romantic love triangle that anchors the story. Yet it is imperative throughout. There is a good balance between drama, romance, humor, action and symbolism that is beautifully underestimated by the director. It is a breath of fresh air after you have been put through remaining and boring Hollywood episodes such as "Pearl Harbor". A solid production all around. It is definitely worth your time if you are a fan of foreign theater.
