This is an excellent film that addresses the issue of racism in a delicate and balanced way. Great performances all around, but absolutely outstanding by Sidney Poitier. <br /> <br /> He breathes this movie and lives. His portrayal of a man struggling with discrimination and violence is simply blowing. His play is powerful and delicate and subtle at the same time. Actually worthy of an Oscar, Poitier had to wait for many years (because of his skin color) before the sheer glory of his acting was recognized by the Academy. Cassavetes also turns into a good performance, withdrawn, upset and realistic as it became his characteristic. He and Poitier inevitably contrast the powers of cowardice, courage and human transformation through friendship. <br /> <br /> The movie is enjoyable and at the same time deeply haunting in its depiction of racism in the US. The irony is that it somehow reflects the realities under which Poitier had to work.
