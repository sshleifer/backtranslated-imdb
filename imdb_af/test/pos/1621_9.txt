I recently got the movie and all I can say is a good movie. There are many famous Rome monuments and historic sites. It is from the same author and director of The Da Vinci Code. Tom Hanks dies with Ewan McGregor and Ayelet Zurer. The film begins with the space and time experiment in Sweden until one of the cans is stolen by the church's most hated enemy, the Illuminati. The plot is difficult to talk about without spoiling anything. It is a race in Rome after the Illuminati trail to get to the Illuminati secret meeting place. As we walk by the time to find the path of the Illuminati. Over all this is a movie that hell needs to see hell, I watched it 3 times and I still like to buy it eventually. It's much better than the movie 2010. And the end has a fantastic plot twist.
