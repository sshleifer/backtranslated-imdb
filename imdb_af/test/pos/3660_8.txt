I was so happy to hear that Hari Om will be released in 2007. I watched this movie at the Vancouver International Film Festival three years ago and waited for it. Since then, I could send everyone I know to see it. It's like taking a trip to India .... colorful, magical, mind-blowing. Apart from a rather strange Hollywood-style car rickshaw chase scene this movie is very realistic. It's not a Bollywood style song and dance movie, but it has drama and romance and humor. The interactions between the Indian taxi driver and the French tourist are a good reflection on the fundamental differences between Eastern and Western lifestyles and philosophy. The characters are a bit wide drawn, but the acting was very good. Visually, this movie is a surprise, as you really get a feel for what Rajasthan manages, like ... dreamy. Sometimes it's hard to believe everything you see and experience is real ... the movie has the same quality. Great soundtrack too!
