There are subtleties in this movie that I think many people may miss if they are not careful. You really have to follow what Leland says and read his character to find the intended "why" that ends the film. Nothing it is fixed, it's not definite, it's about what the individual viewer takes from it. I think it was the plan of the beginning, people are not meant to understand everyone the same way, it's almost about to form your own personal relationship with Leland to perhaps feel better. <br /> <br /> The storyline is interesting, but the summary can never explain what the movie really is. It's dramatic and thoughtful, very heavy ideas, but the pace of the movie is almost soothing, even with its more intense screams. I think it's probably Leland, he's just calm and almost quiet, even for all his sadness. The film embodies Leland in a way. <br /> <br /> Of course it's fascinating and engaging when you leave it, but there are some recycled ideas. I mean, Leland has very impressive dialogue, he's all but typical, but he's not a prophet. All he says is not a revelation, many people I know have mentioned things he called. Even I observed a few things he observed. Leland is the unique and attractive character he is most likely to be for Ryan Gosling's portrayal. <br /> <br /> In the end, the play is all exceptional, there are no real bad guys, there is no way to evaluate Leland psychologically. to understand him and life better. <br /> <br /> Comparable to Igby Goes Down I don't think comic, but similar in his general outlook.
