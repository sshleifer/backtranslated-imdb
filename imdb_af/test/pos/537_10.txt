Most families recognize similarities between their own family and those created by brilliant acting by Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon. Natalie creates a screen image that justifies her as one of the best actresses in America and one worthy of a Golden Globe Nomination. The control of her emotions is so intact that at any stage they can type in the movie and release an unforgettable scene. Susan is also wonderful in this movie. She once again chose a role that is so different from anyone else and works it through with true professionalism. <br /> <br /> Any Natalie fan would have seen the movie based on her past successes, but you should also see it for the emotions released during the movie. It is a particularly humiliating experience.
