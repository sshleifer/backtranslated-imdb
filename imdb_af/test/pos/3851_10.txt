Oh my earth !! I love this movie sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo It is so amazing ...... I loved it as a little babe and still love it as an adult. This is my favorite Disney movie of allllllllllllllllllllllllll! You have to look at it, look and love it. My friends and I watch it a ton ..... This is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. I recommend it to someone who is a child or child. My favorite part is the song and dance number with all the straws and Thomas O'Malley. The authors / producers / director left this one completely ... yes, it nailed to the wall. <br /> <br /> xoxo ~ Wolly ~ xoxo
