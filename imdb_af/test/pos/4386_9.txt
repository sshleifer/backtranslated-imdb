I've just seen all the Coen brothers' movies, and I have to say it's one of those better movies. I dare not say it is better than "The Big Lebowski", but it was very good in its own right. <br /> <br /> I thought the story was sometimes very interesting and hilaries. I loved all the characters, especially Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete). <br /> <br /> There is really nothing I can say about this movie, but this movie is not for everyone. . It can be safe to say that if you like the other Coen brothers' movies, you'll hopefully like this one as well. And if you like what you've seen in the trailer, I think you'll like the movie, but don't stick to it. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I hope you do the (d) movie as much as I do. Thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> -Chris
