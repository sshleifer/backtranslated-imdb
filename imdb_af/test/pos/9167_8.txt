I think the basic idea of ​​any movie is to entertain or inform. If you want information, look at real life movies and historical movies. Sometimes it is one of the same. The other side of the coin is to entertain. Did Hitch entertain me? Yes, it did. Well, the formula is standard. Boy meets girl or in this case boys met girls. They come together, fall out and come back together. The way it happened in this movie, however, was refreshing. I especially like the bar scene with Hitch and Sara. The Allegra Albert romance was a pleasure to see unfold. Most real men are ashamed when it comes to the dreams of their dreams and I have Hitch's advice. I'll probably get my wife on the altar in half the time. I read the first comment on this movie that appeared to be playing this movie safely and that it was good, laughed a few more. I tend to disagree. There is so much laughter that you can pack in a romantic comedy without making it in a farce. Apart from relationships, there are serious moments. All in all, I found Hitch quite entertaining, the actors did a good job (I will see them in other movies) and Hitch is a movie I really like in my DVD collection.
