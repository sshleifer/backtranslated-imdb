I watched this movie as a young child for the first time around 1990 and it scared Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I died to get my hands on it. <br /> <br /> In 2002 I remembered that this movie existed, but I had no idea what it was called, so I went to the I Need to know IMDb section and explain what the movie is about go and try to get its name. Anyway, somebody on IMDb finally told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie. So I finally got it on DVD, and now I like this movie as one of my most valuable horror movies. I really love it, and I think anyone who sees it will be very scared next time in the bush. 9/10.
