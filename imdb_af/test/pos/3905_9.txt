I remember watching an elizabeth montgomery movie when I was 5 years old (if any) and to this day I can remember this movie (just in bits). It was the movie I remembered throughout my life because I was so scared. I think I remember the story part of it and the house is still dark. The biggest part that was most freaking to me was Elizabeth, who had been wandering around the house dark and there was someone in the field outside. Then I thought I was an old witch, but the memory of it is now dirty, so I can't really remember who it was, but it was someone who was definitely in a field outside, and that part provoked me . the most. I really wish I could see this movie again. If someone knows how to get a copy, email me at valid908@yahoo.com
