The aftermath of World War II almost led to the death of the Soviet theater. In the early 1950s, film production came to a halt (only nine feature films released in 1951), and the work of all filmmakers was carefully monitored, and often censored by the government. After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953, filmmakers gained more artistic freedom with their images, although many were reluctant to challenge the heroic, optimistic, and propagandist warfare that prevailed in previous years. It was only in 1957 that director Mikhail Kalatozov and author Viktor Rozov became brave enough to produce what is widely regarded as the first post-Stalin Soviet masterpiece, 'Letyat zhuravli / The Cranes Flying', one of the most beautiful representations of war I have seen from any country or period. Not only was the film praised for its artistic brilliance in the Soviet Union, but soon international recognition will be recognized, and Kalatozov's film was honored at the Palm d'Or at the 1958 Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> 'The Cranes is Flying' is a refreshing visual festival and a hectic, humanistic representation of war. Unlike many Soviet war films of the time, it was less restricted by the archetype of the traditional war-time hero and more worried about the futility, cruelty and inevitability of conflict. Love, as a cinematic concept, is too often individualized as an idea that somehow overcomes everything and endures endless hardship, yet reality is much less romantic. In the film, two lovers, Veronika (Tatyana Samojlova) and Boris (Aleksey Batalov) are separated by the advent of World War II (widely known in the Soviet Union as the Great Patriotic War, 1941-1945), promising to marry after the war . But tragedy denies the couple their wish. Veronika is being betrayed by the eternal torment and uncertainty of waiting, to bet Boris's cousin, Mark (Aleksandr Shvorin), an attractive but unworthy youth. The film derives from the proud victory of the Soviet Union, and a patriotic flagship parade, but the optimism of this series is overwhelmingly obscured by the bittersweet tragedy of our young female protagonist, who walks through the celebrating crowd. <Br /> <br /> Perhaps the most remarkable feature of 'The Cranes Flying' is Sergei Urusevsky's inspired and dynamic hand-held cinematography, which captures the chaos and confusion of war realistically and dizzy, not necessarily in the hail of gun and the cries. from dying comrades (virtually, just one of the film's rows joins Boris on the eastern front), but from the point of view of the family and friends left behind. In a particularly impressive, often quoted long shot, the camera follows Veronika, looking for Boris in a crowd of departing recruits and their families. The hand camera follows the girl off the bus, moves through the crowd next to her - trapped moments of loved ones who say goodbye to their boys and men - before they are unexpectedly placed above the crowd when Veronika disappears in the dust of a passing squadron. lower tanks, a breathtaking movement that offers space and urgency to the dramatic episode. Urusevsky first obtained his filming as a military cameraman during the war and obviously fell in love with the storytelling of hand photography: "The camera," he once explained, "can express what the actor cannot portray. inner sensations. The cameraman must act with the actors. "
