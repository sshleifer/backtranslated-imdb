Fulci ... Does this guy make one of the most wonderful and strangest movies ever made? Answer: Yes! Cat in the Brain, also known as Nightmare Concert, is Fulci's last masterpiece. Yes it is, no matter what some people will say about it. There are few facts why this movie is one of the best Fulci movies. <br /> <br /> Fulci makes fun of himself and his movies with this one. Role in this movie is no different than Fulci himself, who plays ... good horror-spatter-gore director, who thinks he's going to go insane. It's filled with black humor that works differently in most of the modern horror movies here. To be Fulci, you need to know it's a pity. How much? Well, pretty much. I always loved being in the movies and I never get enough, but Cat in the Brain stopped my thirst for gore and I believe it's difficult to archive. Even the Braindead didn't stop it. CITB is all about gore. Almost every scene revolves around Fulci, who, after the hypnotization by * khmmm * evil psychiatrists, sees all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees. Some of the screens mean that he accidentally dropped the whiskey, and instead he saw a rotten body lying on the floor, spitting on the wounds. Forget the Beyond of Zombie 2, this is the guriest Fulci movie! Now I love how Fulci manages to apply all the comic parts in the gorefees movie. He is such a brilliant director. A few funny moments and lines come from time to time, like one where Fulci says, "Make gore movies are kind of a disease." The end is very good, as Fulci (and most Italian horror masters) know it doesn't make sense. or many plot holes. If you're fun with the Fulci, make sure you pick it out. If you have a poor stomach, avoid it and repeat "It's just a movie" ps. some of the gore scenes in this movie: chainsaw dismemberment (full), torn out tongue, eyeballs torn, chopped bodies, zombies, decapitations, face placed in boiling water, stuck in the shower (after head), throat gap many parts of the body and organs are toast aside, hammer smashes face ...
