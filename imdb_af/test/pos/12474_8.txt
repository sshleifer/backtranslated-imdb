Once I saw it, I thought, "Wow, this is the most spectacular film, visually speaking, I've ever seen." Since then, I've seen some hit it, but it's still one of the best in that department. I'm not disgusting. The long-awaited DVD is so poorly done, the quality of this transmission is barely better than the VHS band. <br /> <br /> The jungle scenes are filmed in Cameroon, and "lush" is the best adjective to describe what you see. Except for jungle sounds, view is certainly almost everything in the beginning, as there is almost no "hearing", until dialogue until Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) is befriended by Ian Holm and vice versa .... so be ready if you don't have this watched movie. <br /> <br /> Narrative, all I will say is it's not the Tarzan that many of us got in Johnny Weismuller movies ..... but it's not a complaint. For that urgent action, and don't mind the movies like me, just pass the silent introductory period <br /> <br /> In this Tarzan version, our hero goes back to Scotland (his roots), suits the environment (for the most part .... and a bit too fast for credibility, honest) and then back to the jungle without Jane. This is probably more true for the Tarzan books, written by Edgar Rice Burroughs. <br /> <br /> The special effects made here by Rick Baker, one of the best in the business. Sharp DVD or not, it's still a beautiful movie to watch and very interesting by its 2 hours and 15 minutes.
