Kritters 4 is a good movie. A bit of a twist in the series, as it happens in space, not in an earthly community. Good results and acting make this movie a must see. I'd like to recommend this to fans of Horror / Science Fiction. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of Horror Movies like this should check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp, Slumber Party Massacre, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
