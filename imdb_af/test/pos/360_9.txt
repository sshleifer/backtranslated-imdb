I just repeated this excitement, one I believed earlier that he was one of Hitch's smaller efforts. How wrong can you be! Maybe because I'm older, or maybe because the movie gets better with each look, but now I think it's wonderful. Every bit of tension is washed out of the smallest details, and the final scene on the cheerful round is just breathtaking! Perfect in every way, highly recommended.
