In defense of this movie, I have to repeat what I said before. The movie is called Arachina, it has a no-name cast and I don't mean a name but in actors playing in smaller art house movies. I mean no name as your local high school decides to make a movie, and it may have a $ 2 budget. So what do you expect? Hitchcock? <br /> <br /> I felt the movie never took him seriously, which automatically takes it from the worst movie. This list is only for large budget all-star movies that take themselves too seriously. The film The Oscar appears, most of Sylvester Stallone's movies. The two leaders were not Hepburn and Tracy, but they did their job well enough for this movie. The woman kicked and the man was not a quick idiot. The actor who played the old man was actually very good. The man who played anal retentive professor was not a Clifton Webb, but he did a good job. And the Bimbo's due to a lack of better were played by two skilled actors. I laughed at the 50 cents special effects. But it was part of the charm of the movie. It played like a hybrid Tremors met Night of the Living Dead. The premise of the movie is just like all Giant Bug movies of the 50's. A meteor or radiation stirs up the ecosystem and before you know it, we have giant ants, lobsters, rocks or lizards that terrorize the locals. A meteorite was the cause of the problems this time around. I was very entertained. I didn't expect much and I'm going much more than I negotiated.
