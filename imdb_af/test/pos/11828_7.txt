I don't think this cartoon was as bad as some might think. Of course I was only five when it came out. But I found it very entertaining then and will give it a glimpse of the opportunity today. Batman and Robin, spoken by Adam West and Burt Ward, were a good touch and gave me a sense of familiarity. I was also looking for re-launch of the 1960's campus live performances "Batman" at that age. This cartoon also introduced some new twists that I forgot about everything, such as "Bat-Mite". Looking back, I'm sure he was probably as annoying as many think, but he didn't bother me much. The best thing I can remember is his voice like a cross between Dumb Donald and Orko. Give, I wonder why? :) Anyway, give it a look as you can and make your own thoughts. You may be surprised.
