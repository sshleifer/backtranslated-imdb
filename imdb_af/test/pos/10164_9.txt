I got this second version of "The Man Who Went Too Much" on my Top 10 Hitchcock movies. Along with "Frenzy" it is probably the most arrested film among the fans of Hitchcock. I find it much better than, say, "Rebecca", who got an unreasonable appreciation. <br /> <br /> The movie contains many ingenious scenes (most of them are mentioned in other reviews), but it's something to be expected from Hitchcock. It takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen, but that time is used to make the following events, which is full of interesting tension. <br /> <br /> If you can ignore the awkward rear projections, the only weakness of this movie is the greatest villain played by Bernard Miles, which is a fairly flat and undeveloped character. Fortunately, there is a creepy killer in the form of Reggie Nalder. And Hank, the little boy, is not as annoying as most children in old movies.
