It was a very strong look at bias and group mentality. The cast is made up of excellent actors who do a remarkable job. The sets are beautiful and just a little stylized. In addition, the art direction is accompanied by great cinematography. The story is stiff and shows how prejudice and folly can flourish. It is disturbing to its realistic violence and portrayal of a fairly typical community. I was very impressed.
