I think several others have already commented on this film, but I liked it so well. I just wanted to say how good a movie is. I gave it a score of 9 out of 10. It did not get a 10 because it is very slow. I almost keep up, but I'm glad I didn't. Hang in there, it's worth waiting for. <br /> <br /> It is mainly a movie about relationships: fraud, trust and betrayal. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer, Jessica Lange and Jason Robards all work in this movie. <br /> <br /> In the west, Jason Robards's character is a farmer whose grandfather first settled there. Jason's character gets older and he decides to build a trust that divides the thousand hectares of agricultural land between his three adult daughters. This is when the plot of this film really starts to boil. <br /> <br /> Sisters are facing each other because of misunderstandings rather than greed over the country. They also make some discoveries about each other's childhood, and their present-day marriages, including an adulterous relationship, while the father is increasingly abusing, demanding and paranoid - until the terrible truth about everyone finally comes out. <br /> <br /> This movie reached me emotionally, I got angry with some characters and saddened with them. I could feel their pain because of the excellent achievements. <br /> <br /> The end was a surprise to me, but in line with the growth of the characters. <br /> <br />
