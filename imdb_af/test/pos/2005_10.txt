Eva is a eye-catcher, because of the great scenery and technology-no music in the backgrounds, we hear. This film shows a good aspect of the human body that God's creation is and to think about, and viewers can better respect the legendary story of Adam and Eve (whether true or just a fairy tale, depending on what We believe in watching this movie. Actress / model Inger Ebeltoft's imitation of Eva is so good, there is no good word to describe her performance, and I cannot imagine another actress being Eva. This movie for me comes in very handy for the type of stress relief therapy. We have never been so relaxed to watch this movie. This movie is a masterpiece, God wanted this movie to be made in the first place! <br /> <br /> Mr. Razbin!
