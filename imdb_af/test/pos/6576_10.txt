almost 4 years after the events of 911, when asked what comes from that day, most people will probably comment on things like the eyes of airplanes crashing and the collapse of twin towers, the number of people being killed, act of terrorism and heroism mixed together, etc. Anyone who was alive at that time would never forget that day. but for most of us, the memories, although moving, are not on a personal level. Now comes an extraordinary film that anyone who doesn't lose a friend or family member has a chance to get involved on a personal level just like we've lost at 911. This is a movie to be seen.
