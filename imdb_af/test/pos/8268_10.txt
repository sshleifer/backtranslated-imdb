Having known and loved this book since I was eleven, I was afraid to see it come as a movie - what if they made a terrible mess of it? In that case, I don't have to worry at all. Everyone was very well thrown and the play was great, it followed the story very well, except for the strange addition of the scene in prison that didn't add me to me. But it's really the most beautiful love story and I'm so glad I chose it so I can watch it again and again. My only gripe is: why didn't they give Kester a green jersey that made him such a male man? Such a simple thing, when they made so much effort for everything else. If you get the chance, see it, it's great.
