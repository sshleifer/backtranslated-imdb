I must confess, I was surprised at how good this movie was when I first looked at it. I planned to see it in theaters during the summer, but found it unpleasant that it was already gone and gone. That's why I expected it to be removed from theaters because it was bad. Then I rented and watched it today and really enjoyed it. The speed of events was questionable. It could have been a bit longer. I found it very true to the book, but it left out important parts: Mullet Finger's real name, etc. I felt like I didn't read the book, I wouldn't really understand what was going on. The actor was pretty good, another thing I expected to be poor, but the policeman, sorry I can't remember the actor's name, could have done a bit better. All in all, I found this to be a very entertaining movie and recommended it to all audiences!
