This film essentially contains all the elements of a 70-year-old exploitation movie, except in the late 80's for the live video market. <br /> <br /> You are in love with a young couple, but the whole world around them is also involved in cracking or gang violence. When the boyfriend goes to jail, the girlfriend ends up vulnerable to all the criminals, who are all in this movie, except for the police. First, she is torn by a trader, and then he is owed Brown's property as a drug chief Jim Brown. Then she is basically addicted to a military style cracker after which the film is named. <br /> <br /> If it's not enough reason to see this movie, you also have Anthony Geary playing a seemingly conservative school guidance counselor. But he's really a big cracker. In a sloppy but hilarious scene, he claims sexual favors from the heroine because she has no money for a solution. In an earlier scene it was established that he was her counselor. That scene and another where Jim Brown forces her to take a cold hot shower because she is stinking is hysterical. Lead actress Cheryl Kay was really good at this movie. Tarantino, bring her back. <br /> <br /> It is not surprising that someone in another review mentioned that Tarantino is a big fan of this. It has just the right blend of comedy, action, sex, romance, and even a central message to stay away from drugs. Jim Brown's villainous turn deserves to be named in the same breath as another 80-year-old B-villain, Wings Hauser in Vice Squad. Sometimes I think there should be a b-movie Oscars where performances like this can be recognized. In the meantime, we hope that modern straight DVD manufacturers will learn to use the same kind of tongue in cheek humor.
