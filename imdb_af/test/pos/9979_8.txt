Rain day with not much to do. We followed the movie network channels and found this one just started, so we gave it a chance. <br /> <br /> The more we looked, the more we doubted the story. It is the old story of the working class to do this in a sport that at the time (1913 I think) is usually played by the rich higher class, but this movie was just as interesting as Seabiscuit and it is also based on real story. <br /> <br /> The play is credible and the casting is brilliant. AND. . . . We are not golfers, so don't miss this one just because it's about golf. Any individual sport would serve the plot because it is about the people. Golf works well for this story because of the class disagreement and snobbery that some people who play the game involve. <br /> <br /> Bottom line. . . . It's a good movie. It's well merged and it's not always fun to see those who think they are better than others getting a pen or two.
