Karim Hussain's masterpiece of art / gore - this cat is definitely a talent to look out for. We cut in these several longer vignettes with a few shorter victories. It's all a very powerful movie that relies on its intense graphics and symbolism and it's not for all viewers. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a short called OVARIAN EYEBAL. Very short segment that naked woman naked on a table. An unseen woman's hand covers the back woman's face with a red cloth and makes an incision in her abdomen from which an eyeball stalk is pulled out. I have nothing too much to comment on. <br /> <br /> PEOPLE is one of the films lynchpins and it is a completely improper portrayal of a wrong act committed by a disturbed man has a bloody love for his pregnant sister. This is one of those "to be seen to believe" of things. I will say that this movie has some of the best effects I have seen in an indie horror movie, but the subject will make it an unpleasant unpleasant experience for most (not me - I live for that!). <Br /> <br /> REBIRTH could all have been cut out of the movie together. It's the worst segment of the movie and it has a lot of naked people who get bloody holes in a field and what isn't. Very short, but this one kind of blows the movie's momentum. RIGHT BRAIN / MARTYRDOM is one of the most profane representations of religious images I have ever seen and it kicks overall ass. Think "P iss Christ" or menstrual blood paintings of the Virgin Mary. Many harsh sexual / sexually violent / gory images are presented in this piece, and it is certainly not for anyone who is offended by the sanctuary. <br /> <br /> Subconscious cruelty is one of the best movies I've seen under the banner of extreme horror, it will be a very divisive film among horror fans and the filming public in general. Some will call it trash, some will call it brilliant. I don't see much ground. I thought this movie was pretty damn original and I would recommend it to anyone who is adventurous enough to try it. 9/10.
