From the perspective of the hectic, contemporary world in which we live, the so-called "good old days" seem so much more peaceful and innocent; an idyllic era that we just have memories and shadows hanging on the silver screen, like at "Christmas In Connecticut" a warm and impressive film by Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane, a popular Martha Stewart type journalist who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe in the middle of the story. One of her greatest supporters is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the magazine's publisher. Yardley has never visited her farm, and in response to an idea he expressed in a letter from a nurse, Mary (Joyce Compton), he decides to have an old-fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and child to spend and as a special guest, a certain Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor, recovered only after exhausting 15 days at sea on a raft after his ship was touring. Of course Elizabeth can't refuse her boss, but there are problems; Not least is the fact that she does not have a farm and writes her column out of the comfort of a high in the city. This makes her and her editor, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne) a difficult situation because the one thing Mr. Yardley demands of his employees is total honesty. What follows is a beautiful and fun romantic comedy that brings the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place, to share a Christmas past where a warm fire, good food and friendliness prevail. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck absolutely gleams like Elizabeth, with a smile and presence hotter than anything the grandest fireplace can offer, and totally convincing as a city girl totally out of her element on the farm. Morgan also travels well as the somewhat naive sailor, whose trust in his fellow man is admirable. Even with the cheats being played around him, he is the kind of guy you know, somehow landing on his feet, and finally Elizabeth is what you really feel about. One of the true delights of this film is Sidney Greenstreet. His Yardley has a grueling side, but it is clear to you that it is a man with a heart as big as Texas. It's a simple, honest depiction, and it's a joy to see him work; The most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him. <br /> <br /> The supporting film includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), the awesome Una O'Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge Crothers). A Christmas movie that is played especially during the Christmas season, although it will work any time of the year. Christmas In Connecticut, a memorable film that never takes too much is totally uplifting and will leave you. warm place in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world look like a good place to be. It's a real classic, and one you don't want to miss. I rate this one 10/10. <br /> <br />
