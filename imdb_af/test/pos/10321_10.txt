It's the very first Three Stooges short with Shemp I've seen, and that's one of my favorites! <br /> <br /> That's what I really liked about Shemp when he returned to Curly's stroke, he didn't try to be like Curly, he was his own character, and that's what I admire! Shemp is my favorite third stooge, I love him more than Curly, but I like Curly as much as I like Shemp. Shemp is wonderful, he's funny, he's stupid, he's SHEMP! <br /> <br /> I really loved the scene where he dropped the nickel, and Moe got in the cage with him to find it and they eventually grabbed the wires and hurt very much ! <br /> <br /> But what I really thought was scary when Shemp hit his face against the glass of the phonebooth, he looked like a distorted professor Snape! <br /> <br /> Poor Shemp, he had a lot of bad things happening to him in this brief but it's just typical Three Stooges, they always have very bad things happening to them! <br /> <br /> This card is another must see for Three Stooges fans! <br /> <br /> 10/10
