This movie has a particularly strange setting, which takes place in a very old school, but it certainly does not look like a sterile medical school environment. Many Gothic and atmospheric. As far as the movie itself is concerned, the point of departure is a bit far-fetched, but hey, that's why we watch movies, isn't it? And it is less far-fetched than some of the garbage that is out today is sure. Medical students experiment with 'short-term' death, such as killing themselves briefly so that they can experience the afterlife. It is so nice, in some cases, until parts of it come back with the traveler and begin to get together in their earthly life. I didn't see this movie for years until I got it on DVD and I have to say I just forgot how good it was. And it struck me that Julia Roberts looks really nice in this movie, not like actresses of today that are supposedly beautiful but dressed and made up like cheap hookers. Agh, the good old days. Anyway, this is a good movie, maybe not for fundamentalist Christians, but many others can enjoy it. 8 out of 10 stars.
