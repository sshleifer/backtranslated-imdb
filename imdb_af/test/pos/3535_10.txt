I saw the Messiah: - The First Murder and I thought it was absolutely one of the best programs I've ever seen. It was one of those programs that you think, no, I can't watch the rest of this, but you just have to see it to see who did it. Jamie Draven was an absolutely wonderful actor to alternate between two completely different characters. One of these is the evil, nasty person who did it, and the other person who is the policeman Jez Clifton. To do this, though, I certainly can't do it, but not without cracking. I really love Jamie Draven with my whole heart and I will always think up to the end of time I think Jamie is the loveliest, cutest, youngest, youngest man in the world. I absolutely love Jamie in Ultimate Force as he looks god damn sexy in the blacks he wore. I love Jamie Love Paula Draven <br /> <br /> -X-
