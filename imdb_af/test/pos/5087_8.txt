Although briefly "The Amazing Spider-Man" was one of the best for the TV versions of a famous comic book hero. Only Wonder Wonder (Lynda Carter), the best of the genre and The Incredible Hulk (Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno), was better. <br /> <br /> The Amazing Spider-Man gets out of the 1966-1968 "Batman" because the high-pitched elements of the latter often ruin the adventure. "Spider-Man" outclasses all three television interpretations of "Superman" - "Lois and Clark", "Smallville" and of course the George Reeves "Superman" who brings the back. <br /> <br /> The Amazing Spider-Man was an action drama, in the late 1970s, the pre-CGI era, when stunts had to be performed by stuntmen, not in the computer database. "Spider-Man" had his own very talented stuntman to perform the deadly brave acrobatics. His name was Fred Waugh, who printed the spidy suit for the action rows. Nicholas Hammond, better known as one of Julie Andrew's kids on the all-time movie classic "The Sound of Music" was Spider-Man during the dialogue screens. Hammond's Spider-Man also has his own secret identity as Peter Parker, similar to Christopher Reeve-Superman / Clark Kent, Adam West Batman / Bruce Wayne, and of course Lynda Carter as Wife / Princess Prince. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the series only had 13 episodes. Because when the first episode hit the airwaves in November 1977, the whole country watched CBS on Wednesday night. In all honesty, CBS has to do this piloting section as well as the "Deadly Dust", the "Captive Tower". Release on DVD briefly. "Spider-Man" was short-lived, but followed a cult, and in my opinion a lot better than the film layout of the famous comic book hero, Toby McGuire. <br /> <br /> CBS may be reluctant to release these episodes for two reasons. (A) There may not be a broad market for them, based on the lack of life span of the series and a generation of children and young people who were not born when the series was originally broadcast in the 1970s. (B) One of the early episodes of "Spider-Man" had a terrorist with designs at the World Trade Center, which were attacked twice after this show fell from the air in 1993 and, of course, the devastating attack on this land. on 9/11/01 where the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost. <br /> <br /> But I don't think it would be a bad taste to release this "Spider-Man" episode. even though the show was adventure, derived from a cartoon and nature camp. The live action "Amazing Spider-Man" does not have a big following, but it has a cult that follows. If and when CBS releases it on DVD, this cult sequence can be explained along with the episode in which Spiderman saved the towers in 1978, but how in September 2001 real life was different from the movies. I like to follow the news, but I also like Science Fiction / Fantasy. That's why I'm eagerly awaiting the release of The Amazing Spider-Man on DVD.
