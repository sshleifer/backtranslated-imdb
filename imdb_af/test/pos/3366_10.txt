There's nothing about this Perry and Croft masterpiece undone - as good as any of the best episodes, fortunately it's still filmed in time before the late James Beck died to be included to show his talent. <br /> <It shows from the beginning how the platoon is formed from the national emergency, which shows the boys improperly under Captain Mainwaring (Arthur Lowe) and Sergeant Wilson (John Le Mesurier) as usual throughout the series. <br /> <br /> Along the way, Mainwaring keeps its usual desire to show authority, but the hoods can't help but turn it off at every turn, during wargames and suspects. However, they have a chance in the movie to save themselves if they catch the Nazi airplanes that hostage the congregation. <br /> <br /> It was a good final, especially since Mainwaring could have proven himself in the general, getting one last chance to form. A good movie, very good lines and laughs, it's another one for the DVD cabinet. I'm glad the BBC is repeating it. And on this day 2,8.08 they deserved 'Dad's Army Night'. Not to be missed!
