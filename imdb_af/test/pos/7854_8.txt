It's probably the best movie by Clint Eastwood. Here is action little, but with very good acting. A Yankee soldier Eastwood is wounded and taken by the female pupils and teachers of a school in the South, where he is hidden and cared for. Shortly after his recovery, all the ladies wanted fun, and some of them managed to include the director of the school (Geraldine Page). Erotic scenes come to the ladies discovering that their "macho" has been shared by several of them, so they got angry and poisoned him in a farewell dinner. Geraldine Page, although a little old, could play a very suggestive role as the director of the school, a woman with more failures than happiness in her life.
