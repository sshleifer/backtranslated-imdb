Many movies try the ambitious. Min pass. This movie is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although charged as a black comedy, the term seems to limit the true nature of the story behind Max and Grace. Multi-hyphenate Michael Parness has succeeded in weaving elements of absurd comedy with incredible real emotion. Although the comic aspects are definitely present, the heart of the film lies in his clues: David Krumholtz and Natasha Lyonne. The delicate balance of the film - really crazy about true love - falls to them and they reach it, passing it from the opening scene to the heartbreaking climax and to the heartwarming end. David Krumholtz, in the titular lead and narrator, anchors the picture and does an exceptional job. We see the world through Max's eyes and Krumholtz imbue them with a kind of wonder and hope that one would not expect to be credible of a character who had previously committed suicide. There must be no doubt about this point that he really achieved the foremost male status, which earned more than a decade of memorable supporting roles. Natasha Lyonne can be something of a revelation to anyone who has only seen her in less challenging roles. Grace's role is vast, requiring both great anger and great tenderness - sometimes within seconds. She manages to convince us of Grace's profound despair that lies just below her alternating torpor and mania. <br /> <br /> It's not a nice kind of comedy, so the movie doesn't see humor from the beginning. to finish. Think more dramatically than comedy. There are some very dark moments, as one would expect to give the subject of suicidal individuals, and some strange real moments were delivered by Emma Adele Galvin and Max's sister, Sis. The most humorous scenes are those filled by the many actors in supporting roles. While Lorraine Bracco and David Paymer lend the most surrealistic aspect to their scenes, the other supportive characters who satisfy the institution where Max and Grace meet, are the real surprise. Guillermo Diaz is an unashamed playwright than the beautiful, frenzied oddball, Hector. Ralf Moeller, as Bruno, acts as his straight man but has his own charm and appeal. Rosanna Arquette occupies Vera's role completely with the crass vitriol of a bitter truck stop waiter. Even her heartfelt character eventually melts, like everyone touched by Max's literally unspeakable love for Grace. <br /> <br /> Can conquer love, everything may be the question behind the movie and although the realist says no, movies are about an escape from reality, even if it's just for a few short hours. I recommend that this film be seen as an antidote, not just for reality, but for cynicism that says a love story like this never happens. Spend a few hours immersed in a world where it can and can work wonders on the psyche. <br /> <br /> (Seattle International Film Festival - June 2005)
