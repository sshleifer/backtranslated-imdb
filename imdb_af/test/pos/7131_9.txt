Dead Gentlemen Productions has created a movie with incredible production values ​​in light of their budget. Anyone who has ever played a role-playing game, especially any fantasy RPG (they play Dungeons and Dragons in the movie) will love this movie. Brilliant performances everywhere - especially with regard to the dual nature of the principles, play their players and their characters. Anyone who has ever filmed or acted in a student love will appreciate the amount of work and love they have put into this project. This movie (and its prequel) is fantasy movies and role-plays that are Blazing Saddles for Western - highest-order parody. I have only a few small complaints about the movie itself. None of them will prevent me from buying the DVD once it is available (just 6 weeks - I count the days): <br /> <br /> 1. When Lodge talks to Joanna about joining the gambling group , he gives her a copy of the Dungeons and Dragons Players Handbook and says "It'll tell you everything you need to know." The camera is hanging too long on the book for a while, and at the moment it really looks like a commercial one. <br /> <br /> 2. The jokes are hilarious, but they spread unevenly throughout the film. The last third of the movie, after the almost continuous obstruction of visual and verbal humor that precedes it, slows down a bit, as if the narrative catches the jokes. Odd, but Blazing Saddles always struck me like that. . . and i also love the movie. <br /> <br /> One of the narrative strengths of the story is the unsolved nature of the romantic subplot. Will Joanna become the GM's friend? Will she go back to Cass? Or will the three retain a platonic friendship, immersed in role-playing camaraderie? (Yes, it sounds juicy, but there are a few saccharine moments, especially when Cass and Lodge end.) But the movie spans one week: in terms of human relationships, the questions can't be answered in a week . The fact that the characters' relationships are left indefinite strikes me better than the more classic choices you see in most movies, as the girl gets her prince and they move to the castle or the prince falls to three tries in the North. Atlantic Ocean. boring and predictable hours. The authors really understand the characters of the characters, and you can see that the characters (both the players and the players' characters) change over the course of the film, but not suddenly, and not unbelievably. <br /> <br /> I'd love to hear more brother's wisdom. "The man who stands out from the darkness is ... fluorescent."
