One of his lesser-known films, many horror fans, has not yet captured this Dario Argento offering, which is unfortunate. It is mostly underestimated by the fact that not enough people really saw it. The movie boasts the A-Argento Gore, with its usual close-ups that have terrible rock scores. While it is true that this writing is not very complex, it is not as bad as other entries in its genre, or its own personal resume for that matter. <br /> <br /> This movie symbolizes more of the "dread" he wants to portray in his films through his own admission. Must be a good look at any night.
