A real comedy. The dialogue is quick and very crazy. Eleanor Parker on her physical peak. Just like Flynn can be "the spectacular crook". Although he is over now. Most screens between the principals are short, so the movie moves well. If you haven't seen this movie, please take a look. You'll be surprised at Flynn's comedy timing. The scenes between him Tucker, Parker and "Herds" Sakal are hilarious.Just on the basis of the outfits worn by the most beautiful Parker, this movie is worth it. The romance of this 40-movie will not be lost to those who are so inclined to watch Hollywood's golden past movies. My bet is that Never Say Goodbye won't disappoint.
