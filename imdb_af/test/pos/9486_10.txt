What can I say about this band, I was in 68, I was a 10-year-old child, I grew up on the Blues all my dad, then these guys came from the Midlands, a merger of Country rock, Heavy Rock and Blues , I wish I could have seen them in the early years, I was lucky to be there in 79 (Knebworth). It was the best concert I've ever seen, I hope a full version of that hot August. The night will be the best. This CD gave me the chance to see the boys over and over again. The song remains the same, it is fantastic, but this CD comes to the nitty gritty. Life lives the Zepp.
