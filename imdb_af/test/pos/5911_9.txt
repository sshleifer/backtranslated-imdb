Stewart's age didn't help me in this movie, though he portrays a much younger person. I still remember my fascination with Lindbergh's story and while I was thoroughly mature by the time this biopic was made, I had to see it. <br /> <br /> Not only does it boast Stewart, but it also gives a good performance. a very fascinating technical data, which makes it understandable to the technically challenging like myself. And the view of the plane itself was wonderful. <br /> <br /> I loved this presentation of a period before my birth and the childhood love I had for airplanes and the idea of ​​air travel.
