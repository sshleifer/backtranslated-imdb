A well written script. A moving story that shows the middle class English at its best. Some great plays by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson. Tom Wilkinson is one of Britain's best actors. He knows how to be subtle and honest. Emily Watson is an actress I don't know, but with her credit she does a good job of playing the ****** woman. The director, Julian Fellowes, did not succumb to the typical Hollywood gimmicks to give the film a meaty storyline. It no longer dramatized, it is the portrayal of the English middle class. The movie does not fit, although it is not a facial. A good turn in the plot, it's not predictable. " Beautiful English country village. I really enjoyed this movie. The sites were also very well chosen. If you enjoy movies about relationships, it's one to watch. Better to have some tissues ready!
