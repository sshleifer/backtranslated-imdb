Plunkett and Macleane are a wonderful update to the swashbuckling tradition, which predicts Johny Depp and his pirate friends. The tone is loud, with a touch of social commentary, but nothing too heavy. One can see almost Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone. <br /> <br /> It starts in low gear, with the introduction of characters and the establishment of the themes of social inequality and rebellion; but it kicks in high gear as soon as the boys hit the roads. The robberies are large and stylish, with romantic touches that are the bread and butter of swashbucklers. The actors are tempting and help raise the material, which is pretty hollow. There is not much depth to the figures, but they are played with such charms and skills that do not matter. <br /> <br /> Muh is about modern music. Period music tended to be more serene, which seemed out of place. A classic Celtic rhythm count for the action pieces can work, but the more modern, rebellious rock and techno music was a prerequisite for the action. Since the characters are more legend than reality, accuracy in the music seems meaningless. The pieces tend to fit the mood of the faces, so it usually works well. I just wonder how they missed Adam Ant's "Stand and Deliver". Don't make a mistake, it's not a serious movie. It is pure escapism and a wonderful lion. Tony Scott shows some of his visual flair, but I don't think we're going to see many Oscar in his career yet. He looks here to understand the material here and pulls off a fine film. Over time, he can prove that it's a name to count on. His father took a while to age as visual styling and became a more rounded director. It's definitely one to watch for an entertaining evening or for a swashbuckling movie festival.
