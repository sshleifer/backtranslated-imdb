I tackled The Morrison Murders on Lifetime Movie Network and I watched The Morrison Murders on the lifetime, lifetime film network and on Courttv. Jonathan Scarfe and John Corbett had a good job of playing Luke and Walker Morrison. I'm glad Walker got his brother Lukas to confess that he killed his parents and their brother Bobby. I enjoy watching Real-life stories, lifetime movies and Courttv. The Morrison Murders is a great movie to watch. Next time The Morrison Murders is at Lifetime, Lifetime Movienetwork or Courttv I'm going to watch the Morrrison Murders again, because my favorite actor John Corbbett is in The Morrison Murders. I give The Morrison Murders a ten because it's a good movie about Walker trying to find out who killed his parents and his brother Bobby. In the end, Walker discovered that it was his brother Luke who killed his parents and his brother Bobby.
