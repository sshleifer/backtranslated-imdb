"Murder by Numbers" stars Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt as two rebellious high schools who are satisfied with the perfect murder for the sake of their exaggerated self-esteem. Sandra Bullock plays the hero in the direction of their plans as Det. Cassie Mayweather. It is nowhere near the traditional pointing murder mystery, as the film graciously reveals the killers (Gosling and Pitt). What the film does rather is the purpose of their murder and concentrates on the deadly murder. <br /> <br /> The title itself is a straightforward one for various reasons, mainly because the "Numbers" in the title are the most vocal. The angle that focuses on the reasons behind the horrific murders, though, will discourage your cold dialogue (especially from the indifferent boys), is not entirely based on the origin of what they lead to their deadly madness. The characters are sounding, you have the affluent rich child Richard (Ryan Gosling) and the intelligent but socially uncomfortable Justin (Michael Pitt). In school, they pretend to despise each other, and even give the classmates Lisa (Agnes Bruckner) a go, but outside school they are allies and work together in a ritual in which murder is an escape to free the mind . <br /> <br /> Certainly, the story of the boys looks exciting, but it's pushed to a more general subplot with Det in the background. Mayweather (Bullock) who assumes their murders was due to discrimination (thus the arrogant outlook of Gosling) and unexplained traits, but managed it right. Initially, the audience can despise Cassie's character because she is very strong and not very supportive. She shows dominance and control over her junior partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Even if he tries to argue with her, he knows it's a fight he'll certainly not win. <br /> <br /> The reason for her tyrannical behavior comes back in what Cassie was the sad victim of a crime left a permanent spiritual scar on her. This side story doesn't have much of a place in this movie, as it doesn't offer anything to the main plot (the boys' murder boom). It also offers some development to Bullock's character in the movie, but it is only a half-work and not much accomplished. I would have liked it if they had the diabolical students a side story. The resources were right in front of them for the perfect crime foil, the creative schemes for the boys to manipulate the police with their false testimony and lay just to get out of a potential life sentence in jail. <br /> <br /> Despite the sloping underground and the senseless "real killer" ending, "Murder By Numbers" sports a strong performance by a good role. Sandra Bullock was convincing as the tough, verbal, inexorable cop who tried to shift her inner pain to a more positive light. Ben Chaplin shows his strength as the young detective who tries every way to understand his mate and occasionally fights her tyrannical retrenchments. But the players are the devilish duo of Michael Pitt and Ryan Gosling because they hold you to their seat and wait for what they will do next. The chemistry of the boys is reminiscent of Matt Damon-Jude Law in "The Talented Mr. Ripley".
