Let me start by saying that if you expect subtle humor, you're in the wrong theater. It's low brow and hit hard. But he's not tickling your funny leg. He pulled out the sledge hammer and pulled a bead on the side of your head. But don't be afraid. Like movies, it's a pretty gentle education. Oh, too, heavy on the curse, but again, Mike Judge, not Fred Rogers. <br /> <br /> Was this movie called 'intelliocracy'? F *** no. The jewel, the essence of Mike Judge, is that he has the ability to make people laugh at themselves. Beavis and Butthead were the most popular with teenage boys, the people in whom it has been incessantly fun. <br /> <br /> With that in mind, I don't think the humor in this movie is super-intelligent. Maybe you're too smart to get it. But he doesn't strive for you. He strives for your average Joe. And he has a message: get your act together and for God's sake, learn botany! It's a bit twisted and the narrator is getting a bit annoying, but again, this movie is meant for people who need a lot of narration ;-) It's funny. It has a message that it wants to make sure we all understand. <br /> <br /> I question Luke Wilson's decision in the role of a man with a 100 IK. Sometimes he can't play (what does he have, like a 104?) To the level of his character. Forced slightly. <br /> <br /> Kudos on Dax Shepard in this one. I remember seeing him in Zathura and thinking, "These guys look like an idiot." In this movie he makes a big idiot. Maybe I'm psychic. <br /> <br /> It took a while to warm up Maya Rudolph, but I gave her a little leeway. After all, she had to play straight man to a whole planet. But as soon as she has a bit of screen time, she made a solid contribution. <br /> <br /> Terry Crews played the same psychotic, aggressive character he'd played before, but he is a first-rate president. <br /> <br /> Another bonus is that the place was virtually empty. When I counted my girlfriend and I, there were literally six people in the theater. We could have had a braai and a mariachi band. So, no annoying people talk, as it turns out to be the norm in the 'talk-to-TV' age. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good premise and a capable delivery, given the intended goal. Lots of laughter sprinkled all over. <br /> <br /> What made this movie scary was the fact that when we left the theater, it was as if the movie was still playing. We've seen a lot of idiots around us, maybe it was clear from the dose we got in the theater. <br /> <br /> They're all pods, everyone!
