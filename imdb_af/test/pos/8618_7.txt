Catherine Brreillat is a French director who likes to challenge her audience. She takes us together to see how a movie is done in place. The film in production seems to be based on herself, since the person in the middle of the story is Jeanne, a woman director, like Mrs. Breillat. Jeanne acts as the alter-ego of the right director. <br /> <br /> Jeanne reaches a dead end at the start of filming. Not only did she choose the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold game, as it is bodies that are too cold for actors and extras. Jeanne has problems with the two main actors, especially the male head who has difficulty accepting the way the director decided to show him in the movie. the main actress is not an angel either. <br /> <br /> Movie entertainment, me. We tell you that we are a process like no other in a creative work of art. First, there is the writing period in which Jeanne, in this case, wrote a screenplay, that when it goes into production, reveals problems that the writer / director did not think. There is the problem of how to photograph a love scene in which the young woman of the story has her first sexual contact. What appeared on the written page does not necessarily translate into an easy time before the camera. The actor is made to wear a false penis and has many problems accepting the fact that a makeup should touch him in ways he never thought he would ever be touched by another man. <br /> <br /> Light Anne Parillaud is wonderful as Jeanne, the director. She comments on the production, the actors and the crew that fit well with the story being told. Gregoire Colin and Roxane Mesquide play the lead role, with all the uncertainty that some actors bring to a movie set. Jeanne needs to massage their egos to finally get what she wants. Ashley Waninnger plays Leo, Jeanne's assistant. <br /> <br /> "Sex Is Comedy" leaves me. Breillet allows to present her own films in general. It's a good look at the way movies are done in a typical Breillat style.
