College teacher Larry Donner (Billy Cristal) has been a blocked writer since his former wife, Margareth (Kate Mulgrew), has stolen him and steals his best-selling novel. He did not hide his hatred for Margareth, and upset his girlfriend Beth Ryan (Kim Greist). He is an anthropologist teacher in the same college. While presenting classes of Creative Writing, he is bumped by student Owen (Danny DeVito) who wants to get to know his crime story. Larry says he didn't like it, explaining that in every mysterious story the killer should eliminate the motive and establish an alibi, otherwise he will be caught. Furthermore, Larry suggests Owen to watch Hitchcock's movies to understand the structure of an exciting story. Owen, who wants to kill his atrocious mother (Anne Ramsey), looks at "Strangers on a Train" and understands Larry's advice and believes his teacher wants to swap murders to eliminate the motive. Owen travels to Hawaii and in a ship, Margareth falls overboard into the sea and is considered dead. Larry does not have an alibi and becomes the main suspect, while the depraved Owen pushes him to kill his mother as part of their alleged deal. <br /> <br /> "Throwing Momma out of the train" is one of the funniest comedies of the 80's and a great tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. The direct reference is "aliens on a train", but there are jokes with "Vertigo" (with the rotating camera), "Family Plot" (with the car without breaks) and other movies. The lines are excellent and there is an interesting point when Larry says every big romance or riddle has a train. Anne Ramsey is wonderful in the role of a nasty and insulting dominant mother and the viewer will certainly feel sad and understand the madness of Owen. Kim Greist is very beautiful and Kate Mulgrew is the perfect bitch. Billy Cristal performs an obsessive character with many stupid and unreasonable attitudes, but needed for the plot. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Jogue a Mam√£e do Trem" ("Throw Momma from the Train")
