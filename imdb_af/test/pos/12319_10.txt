Easy one of my three or four favorite movies. Definitely one for the desert island. There is nothing brilliant about this movie. On the contrary, it seems warm and welcoming. The audience is invited to a party and, like any good party, the joy comes from the interaction of the guests, and what you learn as you progress from one to the next. With the excuses for Joyce, the film's title, a number of ideas were kept that kept the audience away. The movie isn't terrifying. It's not depressed. It's a beautiful look at a time gone by, in which people grow up, and others fall off. Some are frustrated, and others are quiet. And everywhere in the evening, everywhere, the people and the parts of the people lying around are resting. The words these great actors are given to speak are perfection and are an audience celebration on the Irish Brogue's music, especially for our flattering Americans. About the lack of luster I mentioned above, I take it back. There is no other word to describe the final scene between Anjelica Huston and Donal McCann. It talks about silence? Well, everything. Some beautiful snowy night, rent this movie and let it happen just before you. No rifles, no car hunters, no dinosaurs? Just film at its most sublime.
