After the boat was stuck at the end of the previous episode ("Three Minutes"), the survivors were shocked to find out who the occupant was. Using the boat, Jack and Sayid come up with a plan to confront "The Others". But when Jack, Sawyer, Kate and Hurley Michael follow The Others, Jack is forced to reveal Michael's deadly secret while in the middle of nowhere. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Locke decides that the time has come to figure out the time has come to figure out what will happen if the button is not pressed. But Mr Eko's decision to continue pushing "the button" is surprisingly strong. So, if Locke puts in a plan to help Eko out of hatred with the help of an ally, I'm going to surprisingly desperate lengths to prevent Locke from making what he believes will be a big mistake. <br /> <br /> This is a classic episode of lost, full of secrets, tensions, and very few answers to the many questions it poses to its viewers. But some of the secrets that reveal this action-packed episode will be truly shocking to the fans. There is also a trademark seasonal hanger that achieves the richness and confusion. One thing is guaranteed, it will make you guess until the end of the guess, and you will still be frustrated with more staggering questions while waiting for the Third Season to start.
