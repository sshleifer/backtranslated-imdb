I saw this movie with my girlfriends and we all loved it! It's so nice and heart-warming, a real tear! I still thought of the story after I saw the movie. It's such a beautiful story about the difficult things that all families are going through, that's something someone can link to. I recommend this movie to anyone after a Saturday night. With your friends, your family, your boyfriend, will really enjoy everyone! : D It is a true story about a true family that would draw on someone's passion. Not to mention, beautiful landscapes and fantastic acting. See it, I'm sure you'll love it so much I did!
