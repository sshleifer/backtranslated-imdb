Then Finnerty and the Dan band are so-o-o-o-o-o good, they must be seen to believe. Does anyone out there buy a copy of the Bravo concert? Please, if there is an upcoming issue, let's all know. I checked the Bravo website, but there is no future date scheduled for a repeat performance by the most enticing guys ever choreographed, the Dan Band. Whatever the great energy they are embracing themselves, they have a cute attitude of American boys, based on the delicate sensitivity that is wrapped in roads and tears, enabling men and women to fall in love with them. I hope enough people can influence the powers at Bravo to bring the performance back into our lives, as a semi-annual special.
