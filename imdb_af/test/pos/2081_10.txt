Trapped this movie on the TCM in the early A.M. It was incredible. <br /> <br /> Start slowly but ominously. Scott is a shade that prays to women. In this case, two women due to a legacy in Southern California. <br /> <br /> The 1940s beach and ward sets are original and intriguing. The title may have become more creative, but the theme and shady shadows of human nature are intrigued, almost in a Hitchcockian version. <br /> <br /> Scott reminded me of the character Oom Charley in "Shadow of a Doubt", one of Hitch's famous favorite films. The audience learns, we really don't know what lies in the dark side of the human mind. This movie is a displaced jewel and worth buying. 10/10.
