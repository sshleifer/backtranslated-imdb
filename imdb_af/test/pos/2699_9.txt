Once this show came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another "fat man, skinny woman" show that populated the networks at the time. It was just "okay" at initial views and I didn't look it again; But when I went into syndication, I caught several episodes (just because it was twice a night), and I tell you the more you see this show, the smarter it is. Once you see how all the great supporting characters are connected, let this show make you laugh out loud. Every new episode I see is more creative than the one before - people who only see it a few times won't see it. The writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they first appear (it is far from "according to Jim"). First of all, Kevin James is hysterical, incredibly charming, and a talented comic actor, and the supporting role-play. Leah Remini has excellent timing, and Patton Oswalt's Spence is one of the more beautiful characters on the show. And of course, Jerry Stiller is brilliant than Arthur. I was shocked to read that he was the worst part of the show. He's a big part of why this show is so good. His rendering of these ridiculous schemes (finishing off the crazy dad character) is beyond hilarious. And the scream - the best episode is when they show him as a child who is "Lemon Icee!" Shout. This episode, during which Carrie takes him to a therapist, hopes to give him medication (to make Doug less stressed), admits guest star William Hurt that Arthur is screaming because he has never been confirmed. The latter part of the episode where Doug is hitting his childhood in a therapy session is quite funny. This is one of the most creative scenes I've seen on a sitcom. I feel the strange need to defend this show because it is seriously underestimated. Although "Friends" was sometimes amusing, and "Raymond" has some great episodes and characters, they both had the creative touch of King or Queens. In an era where most sitcoms have caged jokes and are mediocre, "King of Queens" continues to squeeze the sitom casing and show real comic genius. Critics of this show do not get it, of course - or have not watched the show giving it a chance, because anyone with real comic and creative sensitivity should laugh out loud as they watch. It's definitely on par with my other two favorites, "Seinfeld" and "The Office" in his ridiculous tone. It's the Arthurs, Kramers, and Michael Scotts of TV that lets us watch, and laughs out loud.
