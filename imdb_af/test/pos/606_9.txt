MINOR SPOILERS <br /> <br /> Understands classic remains one of Henson's best and most personal films. It might be funny to call a movie as a loved one if this one has 'misunderstood', but people seem to remember this one mostly for Jerry Juhl's funny script and Paul Williams's knockout songs. Although these things are great, such as the movie's formal playfulness (screenplay-in-the-script, movie break, etc.), the 'Muppet Movie' of the other Muppet movies distinguishes the serious, capricious thread running through the picture . It's a road movie, ok, but like most road movies, it's the pleasure to get there, and achieving the characters' goals is tempered by uncertainty and knowing that they can never really go back. During the film, we are shown to the side of the show, even before the Muppets made it: Piggy lets Kermit sail without a second thought to her call, Gonzo addresses the loneliness and regret of an artist's life on The Road she haunts "I'll go there someday." And worst of all, Kermit is constantly tortured and tested by Doc Hopper, who wants him to commercialize his art for the most unholy of purposes. (One can only wonder what Henson made of his family's management of the company after his death.) Kermit himself agonized about his choices in the desert conversation, and the final "Magic Store" number asks if it's all worth it is worth it, before you decide it probably doesn't matter either. All of these are structured with the expected Muppet chaos and satire and fun horrible jokes, and of course the serious things won't work if it isn't. But 'The Muppet Movie' is not just a wild festival, as the rest of the diminishing return Muppet movies will be. No, it's a beautiful, gentle metaphor about the relationship between arts and entertainment and business, and it's just as effective today as it was 25 years ago. 9.5 out of 10.
