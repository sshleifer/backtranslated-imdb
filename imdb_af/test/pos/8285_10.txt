AWWWW, I love this movie. My cousins ​​and I enjoy this movie a lot, and I'm just a GREAT WINDOW !!! I hope they bring the TV series to DVD soon. Come to name it, I haven't seen the TV show in a long time. Such events! Where I Come From Australia The Chipmunk Adventure is known only to people in their late teens and adulthood, which is kinda sad because the young children do not know what is missing. <br /> <br /> The songs in this movie are Ace the one I love the most. Boys / girls from rock n'roll, Diamond Dolls and the song I make sure you want to cry My Mother. <br /> <br /> This movie is sure to be young and young. ou CAN CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE TODAY! 10 out of 10, such an excellent movie.
