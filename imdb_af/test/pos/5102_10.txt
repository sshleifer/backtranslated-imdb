I saw this movie when it first came out and didn't know what to expect. What followed the Overture was one of the most enjoyable storytelling experiences I've ever had. A fun score of songs and music by Britisher Leslie Bricusse (from Doctor Doolittle & Wilie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory celebrity, as well as making his mark on the Broadway music scene), and played by the unforgettable John Williams. There's not a bad song in the whole movie. Plus of the most beautiful movie, costume design and filming stations I've ever seen in one movie. Not to mention the Oscar nominated performance by Peter O'Toole, and the equally strong performance, I believe, by the wonderful Petula Clark. Since Peter is not the same caliber, a singer who is Petula, he still drives his songs to the audience, and that's all about it. This is a faithful adaptation of the excellent book by James Hilton, and deserves to be appreciated for future generations. I recommend this movie for a family show, but most men will consider it a 'chick' flick. But if you like a really good movie, then this movie is for you. But be warned that a standard Kleenex wardrobe is just as important as popcorn for your viewing space.
