Twenty years after I watched it, I still find myself in the movie, "Watch between the two giant melons", or I'll start singing the "Pabst Blue Ribbon Theme". On the other hand, 20 years later, I can now make the meaning of the "Battler" because there are still many stereotypes like these out there that they used for this movie. These are signs of a good movie for me. I can say this movie is the test of time, which I can't really say for many 80's. I am glad this movie is still on a list of many people's favorite movie as a child growing up in the 80's. If you want games, and have dreams of becoming a "Game Master" or blowing yourself out of these 80's movies to relive your childhood, then you should look at it. It is also sometimes sarcastic and funny. But one thing is for sure about this movie, if someone ever invites you to a "Big All-Nighter", it doesn't mean an X or acid travel party, which means you have to be ready for Midnight Madness! Oh, you will see. Everyone will die to play! hehehehheh.
