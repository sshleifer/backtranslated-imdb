Leaving the box of big league stars is phenomenal in this movie !! William Baldwin, Kiefer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon and Julia Roberts !! This movie was also made in one of my favorite years, 1990 !! I am a Chicagoan, and the Chicago area was also very identifiable and artificially accelerated! I enjoyed this movie, and the agitation that motivated the climax in this photo was a powerful element for the plot that was totally sensational! /> <br /> "Flatliners" center around a group of disgruntled pre-med students who want to be flat as a way to achieve some kind of common justification !! If life doesn't make sense, it seems very illogical to be curious about apocalyptic nightmares !! At the same time, once their surprising curiosity got the better of them, there is no return !! The king of the hill is the one shouting aloud: I WILL DO TWO MINUTES! Who is going to do it! Someone wants to try for two and a half! Eventually, all these newly arrived and many unwelcome accusations now have a very ubiquitous attitude in the lives of these needs of life !! The consummation of their justified or unjustified pathos has a full 360 degree perspective on the issues that they were too outraged !! Whatever this reckless and academic chicanery is, is definitely an original approach to claiming your personality! I love this movie, 1990 was also a good year for me, it looks like that year is in place! When I watched this movie a night in November during the year 1990, I was very happy to have done so !!
