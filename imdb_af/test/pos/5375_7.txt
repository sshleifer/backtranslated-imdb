This totally strange ball feature is a typical and leading example of satanic shocking 70's horror. The events are really confusing and it takes quite a while before you find out what the hell is going on, but the breeding atmosphere is battling you right away. From the indescribable bizarre intro, which attracts some ominous children to make toys in real war machines, you just know it's a compromise and eager shocker. "Brotherhood of Satan" is expected to be another installment in the alleged and unofficial "flu small town that conceals a dark secret" subgenre. A young widower, with his new nice girl and an 8-year-old daughter, stops in a remote village to report a car accident seen on a nearby highway. The residents are very hostile and demand that visitors leave immediately. The town is bathing in an atmosphere of fear and panic, as local children disappear, inexplicably disappear and unnatural powers all remain within the borders of the village. Hillsboro is in the grip of a satanic cult, apparently controlled by the elderly community members. I loved a lot of "Brotherhood of Satan". The story reminds me of a novel written by John Saul, but I can't remember the title. It also dealt with a cult elderly person abusing juvenile residents for their own greedy earnings. The film is mainly made up of creepy scenery (such as dolls and witchcraft relics), but a slightly more involved and coherent screenplay would have been nice. The subject often raises many issues and questions, and director Bernard McEveety can't always give us answers. The climax is great, very seventy (meaning shocking) and memorable. Beautifully shot movie too.
