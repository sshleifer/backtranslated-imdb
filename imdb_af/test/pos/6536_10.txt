wow is all i can say i really loved the movie and one thing i could say to Aaron Carter is that i really think you should be much more movies because you rock. I love Aaron Carter so much, it's hot and so I say thank you for making this movie. I really wish he could make a lot more movies because he was a great dancer, actor and singer. I wish, I can sing as well as he can. and I was always a fan of her and I will never stop loving him again. I rented the movie and I had it for two days and I literally saw it 10 times. laugh out loud, you can call me crazy, but it just proves that I liked it very much. If you want to talk, you can hit me on dvlbab300@aol.com, so email me if you want. I love your AARON CARTER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
