Gary Busey is wonderful in this musical biography. Great song and excellent soundtrack. The Buddy Holly Story is a much better movie than La Bamba. From reading other comments, there may be some historical inaccuracies. Regardless, this is a fun-to-tapping movie, and a great introduction to Buddy Holly's music.
