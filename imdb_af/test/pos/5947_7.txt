Fans of the Pink Panther, Naked Gun, or Get Smart will definitely enjoy this farce who won one Cesar and was nominated for four more. <br /> <br /> Jean Dujardin is Agent OSS 117, a man who doesn't know. an idea if it hit him on his head. He is also a reflection of the colonialist attitude indicated by the West. <br /> <br /> All Russian spies, Nazis and Muslim radicals around him are just as stupid, but there are Larmina (Beerice Bejo) and the Princess (Aure Atika) to keep things interesting. <br /> <br /> OSS 117's impossible ability to retrieve languages, play musical instruments, the first time he picks them up, and sings like a native, is all more impressive than Bond's tricks, but he's still still stupid.
