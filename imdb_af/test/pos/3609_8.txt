Warning: If the Coen Brothers or David Lynch define your taste in film, ignore this review and move on. <br /> <br /> Yes, I borrowed the "one line summary" from the book on President Ronald Reagan, but, under other virtues, this film highlights the role the character plays in the lives of honorable people. This film is full of honest, decent people, and they have integrity to save. In a word they have 'character'. <br /> <br /> A little nitpick: Unless you know the history of WWII, you probably don't know, from Captain Correlli's arrival on the island until the fall of Mussolini, 3 and a half years passed. The average viewer might think the romance was of the "whirlwind" variety. It is not so. The romance develops slowly, giving it both dignity and meaning. The film's deliberate pace can be the director's way of marking time. <br /> <br /> Some reviews have criticized Kage's Italian accent. The Italian speaking members of my family assure me that his accent is pretty good. <br /> <br /> History was right on the point. Yes, the Germans turned against their Italian allies, who for the most part were reluctant allies. If you find it shocking, remember that the French Mediterranean fleet was blown up by the British in 1940, just after France's capitulation, so that it did not fall into the hands of the Vichy government or the Nazis. <br /> <The portrayal of the Italians as educated and cultured was a compliment to an educated and cultured civilization. <br /> <br /> This film was beautifully photographed, and its story was lyrical. The writing was not tempting, nor was it clever, but here was a situation where confusion and cleverness were not needed and would not be appropriate. <br /> <br /> The story is soft, and the message is exciting. The characters are honest, brave, serious, sympathetic and enjoyable. It's a nice little movie. 8/10. <br /> <br /> <br />
