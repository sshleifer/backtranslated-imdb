It was an excellent movie! I saw it at the Karlovy Vary IFF in the Czech Republic, and it won an award there. This is the first film I've ever seen from Jan (the director), and I was impressed. It's a wonderful story about love and family. The film has a great balance of comedy, romance, drama and tension in one. I won't give away the plot, but it's a well-made movie, and I'll see it again if I had the chance! The cinematography / editing is great, the movie just flows, and the characters are warm, and they are the kind of person you can connect. I hope you can enjoy this movie as I did. If anyone knows where to find it in the United States, or if they plan to leave it on DVD at any time, please let me know !!
