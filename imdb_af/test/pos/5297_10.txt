Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli shows his wonderful touch animation, infusing life, into every little action of the characters in Ponyo. When Sosuke puts his little boat so carefully to get the red fish, you know you will have a great time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The characters are interesting and you really care about them. They visually remember other stories, Riisa looks like Nausicaa with a boy, an old woman in wheelchair remembers the witch in Howl's Moving Castle. <br /> <br /> The presence of the elements, wind, rain and the sea With its huge, powerful waves, so strong that I think it was never created in any other way. It's a simple story, loosely inspired by the little mermaid, and it reaches the heart of the audience, just like Totoro, the other Miyazaki's true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> An instant classic, with a good soundtrack and a catchy song at the end credits. Don't miss it.
