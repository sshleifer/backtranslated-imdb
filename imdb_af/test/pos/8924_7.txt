This movie was clearly an early attempt for a new director, but still managed to be original and entertaining, as well as in some moments they thought. But I must also say that the story would not have been so good without Paul Anthony's starring as Pip. He made and influenced well-written parts, and the more poorly written parts are much more bearable. I must also mention Alan Cumming's performance. It was refreshing to see him like that. He gave a weight to his role, which provided a very basic element for the film. As for Paul Anthony: Who is this man? Why didn't I see him anymore? Someone gives him more roles, please!
