The many reviews I can get online from Barnens really don't do it right. I read them all before ordering the DVD, but for some reason I ordered it anyway. I almost immediately regretted it, but the order had already gone through so I couldn't cancel it. I'm very happy now that I couldn't. It's an extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> I won't give a summary of the plot because other reviewers have already done so. But I will say that I do not understand that it is dark, shocking, strange, clinical, depressed or pornographic. It's certainly very unusual, which I think may seem strange to some people, but the other criticism must reflect the judges' own issues, because I didn't see anything in the movie I just watched. I'm not dressed for boys, so the nudity didn't look pornographic to me at all - it's just a kid trying to figure out who he is without any help from irresponsible adults in his life. And it's Sweden, not Utah, so topless women aren't a big problem. <br /> <br /> But what surprises me most is how positive the movie is in portraying this gutsy lost child who is going on a kind of Odyssey through all sorts of strange experiences, eventually finding and finding herself. It is fascinating, thoroughly original and deeply satisfying. <br /> <br /> I'm not surprised that Barnens รถ won three great Guldbagge awards for the best film, direction and actor, but I'm absolutely amazed that the actor who won was not Tomas Fryk , the child whose fearless performance as Reine must be filmed one of the most remarkable ever, but Ingvar Hirdwall in the relatively insignificant role of Stig, Reine's mother's clever boyfriend. I don't understand it at all, but it doesn't change the fact that it's a good movie.
