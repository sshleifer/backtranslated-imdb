I was very surprised to learn that Goldie Hawn won an Oscar for this movie. She was very lifeless and completely trained by the 54 (!) Year old Bergman in the screens where they stand side by side. If it's written today, I think Bergman and the young man Ivan would be together (Ingrid is so hotter than Goldie ...) and the two self-absorbed characters played by Matthau and Hawn would be left out in the cold. But it was written and felt at the end of the 60's like Plaza Suite or Barefoot in the Park. However, Matthau's one-liners, Hawn's innocence and Bergman's elegant performance make it fun to watch.
