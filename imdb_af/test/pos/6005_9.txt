This production was fairly well done for a television original, offering a very appropriate original slide on Swift's work. To make the frame story work well, the movie starts with Gulliver coming home. Everyone who reads the book knows that it will happen anyway. The frame story of the book has Gulliver's confused confusion in sections. For example, he was shocked that he would crush few people in England because he had just returned from a land giant. But the film has all the book sections within a long journey. When Gulliver tells his travels, the editing knots from England are very effective. I confess that I initially found them intrusive and irritating, then they became natural. Eventually they became a welcome addition to the story. While telling his adventures for a bigger and bigger audience, more and more people listen to his compelling fantasy even though they doubt the truth. For example, his hatred of dirty Yahoos and admiration of pure logic from the fourth section is good when he defends his own common sense. The intervals between events in England and similar events or scenes in the story are very effective. For example, ripping the cloth out of the table to represent the motion of the trailer of a group of ships is inspiring filming. The addition of Gulliver's family threatened by the lecherous doctor works well. Swift only hints on this by protesting the long-suffering woman against further journeys. It becomes a natural part of this story. The decisive and acting was continuous. Some roles were exemplary. Omar Sharif's crazy wizard is wonderful. O'Toole's little emperor is grateful to senility. Many specific complaints made by other writers here make me a simple personal preference, which is what we are talking about here. I read the abbreviated version several times a year from fourth grade. I may have escaped the full version of a college class, but have read it a few times. And I had to start it again when I read about this movie. While the Danson version is better than any previous movie, it doesn't replace the book. However, I think it will bring many readers to the book. If you haven't read the book, enjoy this movie and then go to the source. If you appreciate the satire, find Swift's "A Modest Proposal" and its "Drapier's Letters." Both are satires attacking the poor treatment of Ireland and the Irish during Swift's time. The drapery protests cheap, inflated copper coins are dumped on Ireland. It was Wood's light weight, not good for the nominal value in paying taxes and official debt. The exclamation of Swift's satire caused the coins to be sent to another battered British territory, the American colonies. The universal satire in Swift's book and this movie just makes fun. they cannot change human nature. Give Danson's painful experiences a chance. I think you will find them challenging and entertaining.
