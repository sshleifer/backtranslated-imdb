Has the distribution of relatively high quality shows on the broadcast TV networks made it possible for people to produce in their own films, live, finance and / or stars that couldn't otherwise do? Is this a good thing? <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't answer the latter question, but it seems that without Garb, Jeff Garlin couldn't make me want someone to eat cheese. <br /> <br /> Like most new producers / directors, Jeff Garlin's independent piece doubles a lot more sensitive sigh than the vehicle he is mostly known for (Curb). And yet it's a sensitive old movie? He is not really a sensitive man. Probably, sure. Reliable, indeed. <br /> <br /> What this movie really is about is a bit difficult to say. I can only relate to what I took away from it. <br /> <br /> I hired the movie because of the trailers, especially the scene of an advisor portrayed by Amy Sedaris, who told James Aaron (Garlin) that a particular woman was interested in being a "chubby chaser" is. "I almost fell from my seat. Based on that scene alone, I ran to my computer to write a note to myself to rent this movie. The reason - I thought the school counselor (Sedaris) was about Beth Spoken, portrayed by Sarah Silverman, I introduced a light romantic comedy between the foxy Silverman and the bold Garlin, I didn't think the story would be something original, but that the dialogue would be funny and the screens with a In short, I thought it would be a comedy. <br /> <br /> It was interesting that the movie started out, but then it made a much more realistic turn when Beth told James the heave ho gave, because "I've never really been to a fat man." That's how brutal our lives are, and it was quite realistic. I welcome the decision. It just means that Beth is now leaving the building and with her, the one funny person in the movie. <br /> <br /> James's far attitude with his mother was also interesting. That part made me wonder if the whole concept didn't start as a play. It had that complicated feeling. (The whole "Marty" movie in a movie was completely lost on me, because I've never seen that movie.) However, there were serious doubts about the character of James Aaron. Is it really possible that he didn't have a serious relationship? And he's an actor? It didn't really celebrate with me. To me, his persona was less actor-y, and more corporate. I also couldn't really buy his habit. No doubt he was very disappointed that things didn't work out with Beth. We felt it. But then, did he really care? <br /> <br /> Another thing - how in the world can he and his mother afford to move out at the same time? Didn't he just lose his job? The last one he had? That was one of the reasons why he wasn't for me. Where does the funding come from for his life? <br /> <br /> Yet, I read reviews that talk about the realistic depiction of urban loneliness, so there it is. Yes, it is very realistic, the way we should be content with what we have, because that is all we have. The way we disappear from ourselves and each other in interactions (James and Stella), a kind of self-failure that just happens to continue to the next moment. This, unlike the possibility of determining ourselves through our moments, our thoughts as James had with Beth, is really much loved. <br /> <br /> Well done.
