Little Gus is a ten-year-old delinquent. He walks away from his parents and decides to go on a road trip. To reach the crown is a bit difficult for him, so he creates a device to help him. His goal is to win a clumsy lottery ticket game called Motorama. He must find all eight letters to play M-O-T-O-R-A-M-A. Dark lag follows as it changes into the road trip from hell. He walks in some tangled Lynch like characters. Most memorable is the gas station clerk, who places his picture on a kite hoping God will see it. Later, Gus gets a tattoo and an eye spot for his injured eye. He becomes one of the most rebellious 10-year-old bad asses you can ever see on the screen. It's not a kid's movie! Search for cameos by Jack Nance, Flea and Drew Berrymore. Be warned though Drew is on the cover, she only appears in the movie for a few seconds in a dream sequence. Also, the movie becomes confusing until the end of the David Lynch area, and you can see it several times. "Motorama" was written by Joseph Minion, best known for his "After Hours" and "Vampire's Kiss" performances. So enjoy this depraved surreal road ride!
