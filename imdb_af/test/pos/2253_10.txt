"Everything is illuminated" is like viewing a fine piece of museum artwork. It certainly surpasses the emotions through a very broad spectrum. Jonathan Safran Foer is played by Elijah Wood. He is looking for his paternal inheritance in Ukraine. His travels put him in touch with Alex, played very well and played with extreme humor by Eugene Hutz. His grandfather is the most emotional tie to this movie and he is portrayed appropriately by Boris Leskin. If one finds little humor in the human characters in this cinema, one must first go to Mickey, a real dog, who is Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. By Alex and his grandfather are turning. They also call him the "eye-eye". The cinematography is spectacular. The colors are a very important part of the patchwork of the film. It's a film worth the time and emotional investment.
