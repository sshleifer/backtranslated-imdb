The reason why this movie is not better known and appreciated is because of its subject. Due to his controversial topic, this movie never got a great deal of release and remains quite unknown. However, not that it is subject is now more controversial. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a movie about a white man who befriended a black man. The friendship doesn't seem to be forced or unrealistic, but the way it is portrayed in this movie makes it very real. We see that these different ethnicities are intermingling with each other, as if it were just normal. Unfortunately, this was not normal again. Seeing a black man talking to a white girl and just enjoying her as a friend had to have been a difficult thing to look at, for example, some proportions of his 1957 audience. <br /> <br /> You can really understand why Sidney Poitier has always been and remains respected so much by the Hollywood community and the black community in general. Of course, this is one of the reasons why he also received an honorary award at the Oscar in 2002. In his films, he often fights against discrimination and disadvantaged issues, with, of course, "In the Heat of the Night" as the best example of this. A real role model, which has certainly inspired many African-American actors so far. But he was also a good actor. Yes, he is still alive, but he has completely retired from movies. It looks like its last credited role is from 2001. <br /> <br /> This movie was Martin Ritt's director debut and he was not given too much movie to spend on his movie. The studios were probably a little hesitant, mainly because of its concept and / or because it was Ritt's first movie. Or maybe it was simply because MGM was no longer so big and it left its best days behind them. Since the 50's at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the reputation of not making too big and cheap movies has been, but in the early years before, it was truly one of the biggest studios with many star and award winning directors attached. , which made many award-winning classic movies. Fortunately for them, their reputation has started to change and when the MGM logo appears at a movie, it no longer expects a movie. <br /> <br /> Anyway, even with its limited budget and limited resources, managed to make a big movie out of this one. The movie is very simple, with only a few characters and a simple plot in it. However, the movie still manages you with its story and subjects, without ever getting preaching or anything about it. It also makes the movie effective with its subjects. <br /> <br /> Really a movie to be earned. <br /> <br /> 8/10
