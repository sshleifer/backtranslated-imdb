Really don't mind that nobody likes this movie, I do and that's what this review is about. Lou Diamond Phillips is wonderful in this comic role. that line over train ab and c is now a quick classic for me, the cg is big, yes, the train looks a bit fake, but the strangers wow ever move them, Todd Bridges, where is Arnold and mr. Drummond, wow he's out of the loop, thinks that's what jail is doing to you. A Bullet train is on its way to Las Vegas with the Senator giving him a big speech, a meteorite has just hit, and now suddenly we have strayed aliens on the train and our helo police word has to save the day To make matters worse, his ex-wife is on board with him. I just thought this movie was so wonderful, a must see if you like action.
