I saw this movie for the first time years ago when it was new and I was happy. It's a great Hollywood belief story for teenagers. However, this is not true to life. As many as you want to believe, these stories never happen. So it is annoying to watch movies like that. They play with teenagers' thoughts, just think how many girls still believed in high schools in that magic and disappointed. I would not recommend this movie to my little sister or cousin. The director had to spend more time on the plot instead of thinking of actors. Yes, they (actors) were good, but the idea is not worth it. There are many films about teens. So why don't we make a better one?
