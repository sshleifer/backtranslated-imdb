My husband dragged me to this role because I had no interest in seeing an anime cartoon. I was absolutely delighted by the simple story and wonderful animation. In a digital world where effects are computer generated, it was refreshing to see a beautiful, imaginative hand-drawn animation. The world of Sosuke and Ponyo is a lively fantasy land that is mixed with the minimal reality. I didn't see this animation as I was a kid and it's great to endure and succeed. <br /> <br /> The actors who deliver the voices in the English version were fantastic. The length of the movie was perfect, especially for children who tend to get squirrel in movies. Overall a wonderful experience which is the very expensive ticket prices we have today.
