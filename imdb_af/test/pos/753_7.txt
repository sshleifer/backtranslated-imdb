Nurse Charlotte Beale (the beautiful Rosie Holotik) turned up to Dr Stephens clinic for the madman who was preparing for a new job. What she doesn't expect is to get another supposed doctor in his position after Stephens is attacked by the adulterous "judge" Oliver W Cameron (... in a running mouth, confronting a situation out of his control, he comes back to repeat his name). That doctor is Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick), who is not sure if Beale is fit for their establishment. After a long conversation about the position (this is quite an uncomfortable scene, since the two debates on Beale's letter are sent a letter by Stephens to get a job at the Masters clinic, she often reminds him not to Masters agree to make her work in the nursing position, but the good doctor may not be what she looks like. <br /> <br /> The variety of payrolls includes Sam (Bill McGee), A simple daughter who was Stephens's last victim of lobotomy, Jennifer (Harryette Warren), a woman who needs an adult to comfort her as she falls to the Master's heel like a puppy. Danny (Jessie Kirby) is a troublesome obstacle that is often the fake baby of disturbed Harriet (Camilla Carr), Allyson (Betty Chandler), a sexy nympho who just loves and hopes for someone she sees, and "Sergeant" Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) is your typical case of soldier who has not escaped the madness. /> <br /> The rolpre nt shows Masters's unorthodox methods of running the clinic by running the patients free with the doors to all the lockable rooms that are in doubt. And not to forget, the fact that Oliver is still allowed to walk around despite just dr. Stephens with an ax. And what exactly has dr. Stephens happens? Ah ha .. <br /> <br /> Tacky 70's ride-in trash is great fun when you're in a warped brand of theater. I am attracted to bizarre movie about mental rejection because of their unpredictable nature. You never know what hell can happen, especially in this case where they can often be unattended. Some consider the low budget as a liability, but in the case of this movie, I think it improves the experience. With the inexpensive photographic and poor production values ​​(shot for peanuts in a horrible place), it looks cleaner and I feel like a voyeur shining in the madness through a camera lens on the outside.
