Hilarious, clean, light-hearted, and quote-worthy. What else can you ask for in a movie? It's my all-time, number one favorite movie. Since I was a little girl, I dreamed of having a blue van with a flame and an observation bubble. <br /> <br /> The clich√© characters in ridiculous situations make this movie so enjoyable. The wonderful comic chemistry between Stephen Furst (Harold) and Andy Tennant (Melio) makes most of my favorite parts of the movie. And who didn't love Flynch's hopeless discomfort? Don't forget to adjust Leon's fiance's fiancee, dressed as Hari Krishnas: dance, sing and play the tambourine - unbeatable! The clues are genius, the places are classic, and the plot is timeless. <br /> <br /> A word to the wise, if you didn't see this movie when you were little, it probably won't be a place in your heart today. Yet it gives a chance, you may find that "No matter what you say, no matter what you do, you have to play."
