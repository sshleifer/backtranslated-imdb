I just want to say that Chris Diamantopoulos's role as Williams shows for the whole show was Emmy worthy. It was unpleasant how good he did. And being so fast and as random and as creative as Robin Williams really is .... WOW. There were screens where Diamantopoulos supposedly had to say 20 quick lines and 15 different characters while delivering the lines. Everything sounds as much as ROBIN WILLIAMS what characters do. Well, my friends are impressive. The one thing to do for a few minutes for Robin Williams' imitation. The other is to do it for a whole TV movie. <br /> <br /> I don't know how I felt about the whole show, and I don't know how much they played with the facts, but I know it was Chris Diamantopoulos who made me look. That's why I give him a 10.
