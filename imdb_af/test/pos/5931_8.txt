Probably the best Royal Rumble in years. <br /> <br /> Match 1 sees Edge battle Shawn Michaels in a good but very long game. Next one of the worst wrestlers on the grid - Heidenreich takes The Undertaker into a boring camp. Match number 3 sees Bradshaw defending his WWE title against Big Show and Kurt Angle in a surprisingly good game. In the next match, Triple H sees his 10th heavyweight title government against Randy Orton in a good match. <br /> <br /> Next time the Royal Rumble will take place in 15 Raw Superstars and 15 Smackdown! superstars are beating the ring to try to win the junk and see the champion who can be at Wrestlemania 21 anyway. Highlights included, Hard enough 3 winner Daniel Puder gets his ass kicked by Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Hardcore Holly! All the superstars beat the shit out of Muhammad Hassan and Raw superstars vs Smackdown! superstars! <br /> <br /> Not a bad PPV. <br /> <br /> Edge vs HBK - 8/10 Taker vs Heidenreich - 4/10 JBL vs Angle vs Big Show - 7.5 / 10 Triple H vs Orton - 8.5 / 10 The Royal Rumble game - 9/10
