Many of the comments seem to treat this movie as a baseball movie, but I feel it's only secondary. It's really about living in Japan and it's really successful. <br /> <br /> I stayed in Japan for a few years, and I think the reason this movie didn't do well is that you have to experience Japan to get it. I watched it with a well-traveled friend who had never been to Japan, and he noticed that many of the events in the movie were so ridiculous that they destroyed the suspension of unbelief. My answer was that these events were the absolute inexplicable truth about life in Japan! <br /> <br /> I think this movie is definitely worth watching, especially if you lived or were interested in Japan.
