This movie is bombarding at the checkout and in the voice here, but I loved it. One measure of a movie's worth is how much you can remember after 25 years. I will not drill you with a list, but there are dozens of deep comical scenes, also a good story and good casting. The inexorable robbers are a hoot. See it and judge whether it ever goes on TCM.
