I have been using this movie in my Ethics courses for more than 10 years (including Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors" - another tremendous multi-level ethical study). <br /> <br /> It's fiction. I do not focus too much on the unrealistic characteristics of "strangers" because all fictitious films on many levels are, of course, untrue. I love the movie as a gallows comedy, with naughty tales, with very ironic twists and visual pleasures - even if it is incredible. The story is told so well that I do not even think about its likelihood (although I have to admit that the tennis match seems to be the worst part for me - too much Hollywood fluff and not enough real tennis competition). <br /> <br /> Some problems presented in the film promise promise of realistic moral education and ethical discussion: <br /> <br /> 1. Ethical Passivity: Some Weaknesses of Guy Character Become Hitchcock mean. A primary ethical insight of the film is the danger of inability to express your moral positions. Guy can't effectively block Bruno's crazy suggestions. An interesting question is why and how does Guy be so passive, inefficient? A possible answer is his depression due to his intense and complicated divorce process. <br /> <br /> 2. Miscommunication: Guy at the beginning yet another failure: on the train, to get away quickly, he agrees that Bruno's ideas are all right. But Guy's literal meaning is to his bent, sarcastic meaning. Bruno takes the literal meaning as an agreement for the cross-murder. Guy takes the sarcastic meaning as an escape from any murder agreement. Bruno may, to some extent, initially claim to have entered into an agreement to further sign Guy into a web of complicity. Bruno manipulates Guy; Guy's linguistic ambiguity on the train gives Bruno a chance to put an ethical "stranglehold" on Guy. Bruno Manipulating Guy can also take other meanings. . . . <br /> <br /> 3. Secrecy: Some have speculated about a sexual relationship between Guy and Bruno. Initially, it looks ridiculous, especially as Guy naturally appears heterosexual in his relationships with Miriam and Anne. However, Guy is also ineffective for both women. Guy appears (stereotypically - remembered in 1951) effeminate, especially in relation to Bruno. Guy, the strong athlete, is weak on the inside. Bruno is also contradictory (playing against himself), which initially seems physically and physically strong, but then exhibits some "effeminate" characteristics (Bruno's fashion and footwork, his emotional to Guy in various situations, his manicure of his damn mother Bruno kissing and discouraging his mother's hand, other more subtle gay stereotypes that find cryptic meaning of Hitchcock's point of view. I wish I could hear Hitchcock, explaining his intended meaning here. <br /> <br /> 4. Dishonesty and distrust: Guy makes some colossal blunders in hiding truths about Bruno's family and police. Guy fails to fully understand that the recognition of guilt can quickly be better than a cover or a delay in confession. Once again, Guy is driven by passivity, uncertainty, fear - and perhaps a self-hatred that is closer to Bruno's own self-reproach than we would like to see or recognize. Both Guy and Bruno act on their own parables of impotence. <br /> <br /> 5. Lack of evidence: Guy feels a problem collecting the evidence to free himself. As he quickly goes to the police to solve a big problem, Guy throws himself with his own doubts and uncertainties: the absence of desired alibis; the inability of the alcoholic professor to testify on behalf of Guy; the obsessive need to appear politically impeccable; and other personality factors that make Guy feel defenseless. He is as dysfunctional as Bruno - just not that dangerous (yet one can partially blame Guy for Miriam's murder). <br /> <br /> 6. Disease and Mental Disorder: An interesting question is how lawful Bruno is for the murders? The more ethically incompetent Bruno is as a sick sociopath, the more guilty Guy may be as a healthy person who has not risen and acts morally to prevent the crimes. Guy's failure is like a man who fails to call the police when a sick friend threatens suicide and causes death. One can argue that more than one crime has been committed and that Guy is an emotional hobbled accomplice. <br /> <br /> These and many other features of the film make Strangers on a Train a gem of a morality game, a diamond for philosophical and film.
