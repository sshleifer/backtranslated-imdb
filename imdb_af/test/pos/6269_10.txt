Blademaster is definitely an unforgettable entry into the categories of swords and witchcraft. I joined Blademaster with a search for the Mighty Sword at a catering shop by mentally handicapped people and was very happy to pay 2,00 each for them. Incredible sets and costumes, good sword fights and a beautiful female fighter, Mila, make it a pleasant watch. A few problems, however, were in the plot a lot of details, which didn't quite fit, like the cave men for one. I didn't understand their purpose. Also, this movie really benefited from some more samples. The snake was cool, but I think it borrows a little from Conan. However, any primitive kind of movie where someone with a hangman winds up is OK by me (see Yor and Battle for Endor). I think Ator is cool! Oh, and was anyone else reminding Gallager by the villain or is it just me? I give blademaster a 7/10
