Some commented on the captions that are not a problem in this movie - I recommend to disagree - the nuisance in facial expressions and subtle interactions between characters is such that you can't afford your eyes for even a fraction take away a second. I tried to look at the DVD in English to overcome this problem (don't make this mistake, the result is a travesty). The only way to get the full benefit is to watch it fast or fast two or three times, so you know it and then ignore the captions. An acting master class - not in dialogue, but body language. <br /> <br /> These are the little things - the postmaster / shopper pushes his chest out and goes in to get his cap before delivering a letter from France! France !. The general's confused expression as joy in a bunch of perfect grapes evokes a biblical reference with a dignity worthy of being there. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is wonderful and the dark minimalist village with its elaborate color just highlights the abundance of the festival when it comes. I have a friend who claims he comes from the Borgias and whose family motto is: "If it is worth doing, it's worth doing too much." - Amen. <br /> <br /> I laugh aloud and cry every time I watch this movie
