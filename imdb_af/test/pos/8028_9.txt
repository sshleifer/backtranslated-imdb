This film is about Carlos "The Jackal" (Quinn), an international terrorist, who appears by CIA agent Henry Fields' (Sutherland) description, seems to keep women and children down. At least that's what he says he's found guilty. The US naval officer, Annibal Ramirez (Quinn), is commissioned to represent Carlos and set him up as a traitor in the eyes of the KGB. Ramirez is apparently physically identical to Carlos, but he is spiritually his antithesis. He is kept in order and Carlos is borne of chaos. <br /> <br /> The movie is not all the shotgun jumping action, and that's a good thing. In his first half, Ramirez is trained to act and think like Carlos, and that's where the film distinguishes itself from other action flashes. An Israeli agent (Kingsley) joins Fields in the training of Ramirez, and together they seem to tackle the roles of parents in the birth of Ramirez's new character. Ramirez is taught not to keep the things that Carlos deceives, to act like Carlos, and even to love Carlos (with friendship with Carlos's ex-girlfriend). Of course, everything he learns will be used in the later half of the movie. It's a bit confronted, but Quinn gives a resounding performance as a Carlos wannabe. <br /> <br /> Another thing I like about this movie was that it didn't use the much exaggerated plot point in evil twin movies - you know, the one in which the evil twins incite him into the good twin's family. Ramirez's family comes in the picture, but instead emphasizes how she ruins new character wrecks on his family life. <br /> <br /> Good chuckle humor is injected into this movie, and often comes the sharp duo of Sutherland and Kingsley. An exception is the overused and apparently free joke about Ramirez's first name (Annibal, Annabelle, get it?). Also exaggerated was the constant resilience of the duo about how powerful and smart and intelligent Carlos is. In my opinion, the payout was unable to match up. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was enjoyable. I'm not a big action movie fan, but this movie was more intelligent and staggering than the average action movie and it kept my attention throughout. <br /> <br /> My rating: 9/10
