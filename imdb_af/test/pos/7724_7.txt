There were about 60 different movies and television games, besides the classic Opera of this story of a sex-loving girl and her unfortunate soldier lover. This story has been done so many times in different ways. <br /> <br /> Vicente Aranda directs Joaquin Jorda's script adaptation of Prosper Merimee's classic novel and play. <br /> <br /> This is the story ONLY from Bizet's opera Carmen <br /> <br /> Fitting Vega is an exciting Carmen, full of passion and the ability to manage simple men to do terrible tragic things . Leonardo Sbaraglio is the unfortunate soldier who is fed into Carmen's poisonous web and has caused bad things. <br /> <br /> Jay Benedict is the writer Prosper who tells this story. <br /> <br /> There is not much action, BUT there are some very hot sex scenes. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's almost an NC-17 movie. <br /> <br /> Because I saw this story so often in so much It is a very well made movie and will be of interest to those who may not know it. <br /> <br /> My not overly enthusiastic review. It may be that I miss Bizet's fantastic Opera score. <br /> <br /> See it as you might have more of it than I did. <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 82 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
