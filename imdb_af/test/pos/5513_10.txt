Honestly, this is one of the BEST horror movies I've ever seen. I was captivated by the story, strengthened by Captain Howdy and on the edge of my seat for the whole ride. I don't really understand all the negative reviews. <br /> <br /> The setup has already been discussed in depth; Captain Howdy is an on-line predator that raises adolescents' meetings, kidnaps them and introduces them to his favorite pastime of body modification and piercing. Dee Snider is Captain Howdy and he is one of the most frightening psychopaths ever created. maybe the scariest because he is so human and you get the sentence (especially if you don't change the body at all) that there are really people like this in the world. <br /> <br /> But the biggest reason I liked filming and why it's so terrible is that Captain Howdy becomes the hero. At the beginning of the film, the roles are clear; the victims are innocent, the policeman is the good guy and howdy is purely angry. However, in the second law things changed a bit. You want to be Howdy angry, but it seems he is just a victim of circumstances and maybe the good and the bad are not obvious. It is frightening to rejoice for the bad guy. <br /> <br /> A few people mentioned that Strangeland had to be broken into two separate movies. To be sure, there are certainly two separate "acts", but this movie works so well because the two acts are back. The first act is the typical psycho-thriller, but the second act is the most disturbing because of the seers' reaction to the situation. I don't think that would have been the same if the second act was extended and changed into a successor. <br /> <br /> As a big horror moviewoman, I recommend this movie. This is the first horror movie that EVER will give my nightmares.
