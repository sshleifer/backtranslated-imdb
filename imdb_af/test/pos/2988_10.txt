I really love this movie, I saw it for the first time when I was a video store. When I went to buy it, they told me it was out of print and I couldn't order it that way. I just thought I'd look today. and then I found them in Spain on DVD under the name "Algo Mas Que Amigos" and you can buy it in English and Spanish on the DVD .... hope this helps ..... I know how It's hard to find movies we love that they didn't release to the US market. Congratulations .. for more information here is one place to look .... http://www.zonadvd.com I think it's going for $ 10 usd on eBay too.
