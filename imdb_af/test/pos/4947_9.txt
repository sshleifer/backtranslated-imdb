Iron Eagle has long been one of my favirote films. It looks like Topgun, but with a different plot and (many people will not disagree with me). I think it's better than Topgun. <br /> <br /> This movie has wonderful dogfight scenes when the fighter planes zoom in. through the air. It also has the Queen song "One Vision" which has been immersed in the background, which in my opinion is a fantastic song. <br /> <br /> To be honest, Iron Eagle was very good, but it's prosecution as rubbish. <Br /> <br />
