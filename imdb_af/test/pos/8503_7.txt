So Dark The Night presents a difficult challenge: it is very difficult to write it in any detail without destroying it for those who have not yet seen it. As it remains quite unclear, it just includes just about everyone. The film will hit those familiar with his director Joseph H. Lewis' better-known titles in the noir cycle? Gun Crazy, The Big Combo, Even My Name Is Julia Ross, Which In Short Does It Look? as a strange choice. <br /> <br /> For the first time, the rural French countryside serves as its environment. Steven Geray, a middle-aged detective with the Surete in Paris, is setting a holiday in the village of Ste. Margot (or maybe Margaux). Quite unexpectedly, he finds himself in love with the little girl's daughter (Micheline Cheirel), even though she is engaged to a rough local farmer. But the siren song of life in Paris is hard to resist, and she agrees to marry him, despite the inequality in their centuries that inevitably becomes the talk of the village. <br /> <br /> But at night their engagement party fails to return to the inn. Soon a hunchback finds her body at the river. Her zealous love lover is the logical suspect, but he was also found dead. Then anonymous notes threaten more deaths, which happens. For the first time in his career, the robbed Geray finds himself blunt. <br /> <br /> A particularly bad writing, all but the movie; it plays like bad Cornell Woolrich crossed with the murder of Roger Ackroyd. But Lewis is making this creaking vehicle proud. He takes his time near the beginning, but then is the story? and the storytelling ?? get momentum (unfortunately, just about the time the script breaks). Burnett Guffey illuminated and photographed the film, with an intriguing look to look out and look in windows; There is also an effective score by Hugo Friedhofer, who has responded to many noirs. A good talent has been sown on So Dark The Night, but in the end is it no more than a gimmick? and not a very good gimmick on it. It is a once-off pony of a movie. <br /> <br />
