Here is one of Jane Austen's movies that I found very pleasant. I first read the book and then listened to the CD and was captivated by how a young Victorian girl could be persuaded to marry the man she loved because of his lack of fortune or education. The joy of knowing that Anne is apparently reunited with a lost love. The fact that her mother-in-law is trying to marry her is nothing for cousin just for money. Look at the snobbery that comes from the upper classes and how class investigators can divide couples to follow their hearts. Captain Wentworth realizes he loves Anne for another seven years. His final understanding that Anne's love was always that time and that she was not going to let her family interfere with her true happiness and eventual marriage to one she really loved.
