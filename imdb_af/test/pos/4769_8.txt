just can't watch this bit too many times, it's full of real enthusiasm and smartness that Mickey Mouse had in its first 30 years. At present, Mickey is a smart ass, a little nice when compared. Steamboat Willie always makes me smile, at least the end where Mickey laughs after hitting a potato parrot. Animation is very nice and although Steamboat Willie has no dialogue, the music is enough. <br /> <br /> If this little does not earn 10, a cartoon is not just because it is a true classic, but also because it is so full of joy and it is always fun to watch.
