Named the most expensive film ever made in the Czech Republic, it automatically makes the idea that it will be glorified and cleaved (for fear of the budget). But with a budget of 8 million and half of the film in English, it wasn't exactly a big, high-risk movie. <br /> <br /> What we have a great epic story centered on the friendship of two people, the younger Charles and the older Frantisek. As pilots in the Czech air force when the Germans invaded before the start of World War II, they escaped the country to England to join the RAF. <br /> <br /> The love of the same woman makes their friendship tense. However, there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond just being friendly. Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country. Remember, they weren't the winners, but the Germans just defeated to invade the Russians. <br /> <br /> Funny, exciting, intriguing, beautiful, sad and enlightening this movie is one of my favorite war movies. Most of all, I like the way they encourage the British in a way that is incredibly loving and gives a wonderful insight into the way the British army fought World War II. <br /> <br /> Forget the recent US efforts (Peal Harbor, Saving Private Ryan), this is the best WWII movie for a long time.
