I am a huge fan of the legendary director Elia Kazan. His movies often deal with people trying to overcome their weaknesses. It is obsessive love in 'Splendor In the Grass, poverty in a tree growing in Brooklyn' or racism in 'Gentlemen's Agreement'. While looking for other films made by Kazan, I went over a movie based on a novel by Arthur Miller. The movie called "Focus" stars William H.Macy (who is one of my favorite actors) and Laura Dern. It deals with anti-Semitism in a very realistic way. <br /> <br /> Macy's character seems to be going with the bigots in his neighborhood and on his work, until it touches him personally. This is the key here ... the reason he acted was not because he knew it was wrong and he wanted to take a stand. He acted because he was now regarded as an outsider. He got the same body, the same remarks, and the same brutal that Mr. Finklestein (David Pamyers) experienced it. <br /> <br /> The movie was very well written and performed well. Meat bread makes a wonderful job of playing a dirty bag! Both Macy and Dern performances are outstanding! It's easier to get together in life, rather than to go. Sometimes people have to influence their lives, or the lives of their loved ones, so that people can take their stand. Only then will some find their moral compass.
