It was 1913. A studio plug boy spies the actress who will be Hollywood's next big movie star and he is the director who will make it happen. After inventing teasing and the keystone police, his dream comes true. However, he is completely absorbed in his film production, but he does not see that he loses his leading lady to another man. Several over-budget flops later, he is known as nothing more than the director who turned Rin-tin-tin. Fortunately for him, the loyal and compassionate residents of Hollywood do not become by ambition and ego. He will be good as long as he still has his friends. <br /> <br /> This movie starts out as a mad-cap comedy that is typical of the era, and in the opening styles it holds its own with the best of them. It has a playful lack of self-awareness, which is lacking in most of today's comedies. However, shortly in the movie, it moves from this comedy and we try to entertain ourselves by using the movies in the movie. They are silent bang-stupid comedies, well done, but nothing extraordinary, and they last much longer than needed for any audience who saw the original. On return, the film takes a dramatic turn. It is well written and the film makes an excellent job of making the transition, but the film really had to decide what it was going to be. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie it has changed again - this time in an attempt to glory Hollywood. The small town of Los Angeles has grown into the city that makes the movies entertaining the whole world. <br /> <br /> In spite of its promising start, this film did not age very well. However, it does have some strong scenes, some nostalgic appeal and an entertaining sub-text about the people who made it and the audiences it was made for.
