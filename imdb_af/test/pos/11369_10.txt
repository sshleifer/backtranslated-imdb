This series has recently been upgraded and extracts can be seen, at least in Britain, via http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/527213/index.html. It is suspected that the series could eventually be. available more widely. The problem is that this series was followed by the series THE WARS OF THE ROSES which had a similar star cast and was available for cable television, or at least overtook the market. <br /> <br /> The two series are very different in dramaturgy; THE TRUE consolidates the plays through extensive rewriting and moving scenes; An age of kings is approaching Shakespeare. Both series benefit from integral casting.
