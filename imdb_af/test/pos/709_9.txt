A movie that earned diabolical release. This television for television is a movie-like gem that illustrates Michael Mann's technique with the stirring of contemporary music that is tightly integrated into the visual images. Always with Mr. Mann, enhancing the impact of the music is almost as if there is an invisible academy-award-winning actor added to the ensemble cast, writer, director and filmographer. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely one of my all-time favorites. While nothing is perfect, this movie comes very close. <br /> <br /> Along with an excellent script, good direction and masterful acting by Richard Strauss, there is an all-star ensemble of character characters at their best: Roger Mosely; Brian Dennehy; Ed Lauter; Geoffrey Lewis; Richard Moll; Miguel Pinero; William Prince; Burton Guilliam; Ji-Tu Cumbuka; Richard Lawson and Billy Green Bush. You may not recognize the names, but you will recognize every face. <br /> <br /> When it comes to TV, put it together with popcorn, turn up the sound for an incredible soundtrack, and make a performance for riveting for the 97 minutes of the movie. I recommend this to register as it is only available on VHS and DVD from Holland and the DVD is region 2 encoded.
