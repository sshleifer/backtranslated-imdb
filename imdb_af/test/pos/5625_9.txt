American Movie is a wonderful documentary. It follows the trials and tribulations of a very determined independent filmmaker if he struggles to complete his first film. <br /> <br /> The raw material and informative content of this movie is an excellent example of how documentaries should be produced. I also feel that the film can be very inspiring for those of us who want to be filmmakers themselves.
