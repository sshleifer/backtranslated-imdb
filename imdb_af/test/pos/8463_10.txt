Ever wonder where that episode, "Tuttle," comes from in the middle of the first season of M * A * S * H? Now the cat is out of the bag: they got it from the Soviet movie, a satire about how stupid the Tsar is, because of a pen slip (which is the words "the lieutenants, though ..." in the lieutenant) Kizhe "has no meaning" and no one is honest or gutsy enough to contradict him and just tell him the truth - Kizhe doesn't exist and never did. So they make an imaginary life for him and eventually kill him. And 40 years later, David Ketchum and Bruce Shelly borrowed this great plot and essentially gave us the same story just across the road from the Cold War, proving that people in high positions can be equally stupid, regardless of their loyalty. can be!
