It's a hasty job. Just ten minutes long, but I'll pay ten dollars in the cinema soon to see it than to see a full-length movie currently doing the rounds. It's a simple piece of a man's reflection. He arrived at a young man in this place and was enthralled by a room and the music came from it ... and now he is sitting in this old age in this old place so closely connected to his youth. The music in it is brilliant, the guitars have that jazz room, like neil young's music in the dead. If you get the chance, watch this movie. It is worth the effort. If Rutger made more films, I think he'll get more respect than he gets. The moment you hear him put it under the phrases like "everyone's favorite soul". surely that's not what Rutger wants to remember as an actor for. He also directed this film, pointing out that he is a very artistic actor / director. Some of the b-grade movies have changed what he has done since the early 90's. I hope to see more of this rutger owl if he is one of my favorite actors.
