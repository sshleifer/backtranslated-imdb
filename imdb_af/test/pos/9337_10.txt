The video starts with a scene from a horror movie, in which a man represents his girlfriend. He began to tell her that he was "different". As the full moon rises, he becomes a werewolf. He strives for the forest, and just before he attacks, we are taken to the inside of the cinema. Within the theater is Michael and his girlfriend. She is too scared to look longer, so they go away. As they leave the theater, he starts teasing her. ("It's near midnight, something in the dark in the dark.") Michael sings and dances with his girlfriend down the street. This scene shows Michael's skill with the camera. He never once "aware" of his presence, as many other artists do. As they passed the cemetery, the graves began to open. As soon as they get to a alley, they are confronted with a horde of the dead. We then see the terrible face of Michael's girlfriend. Who wouldn't be abusive, see if their date was morphed into a zombie? Yes, he becomes one of the dead. (A very bright and shiny one.) He and his fellow zombies then start what might be the best-known dance choreography of any music video. To tell you yet, the end will throw away. <br /> <br /> This is my favorite music video of all time! You don't want to miss it! I give it a 10/10. (Yes, I know you can see the curtains in the back of the sound phase, and the werewolf looks cute according to today's standards.)
