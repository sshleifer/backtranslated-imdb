I'm an avid Julie Andrews fan and I just watched it for the first time on DVD - the Director's Cut version. I was very surprised that it was rated. G. How did they get bedroom screens, a seduction story line, two strips of war and war / shooting / blood in a G rating? Strange. I'll upgrade it to PG-13. <br /> <br /> Unlike I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was a beautiful showcase of Andrew's voice and talent. The acting was wonderful. The storyline was a bit weak and left gaps that could be filled with good dialogue. There was too much "not talking, just running" scenes for me ... I would like to see the relationship between July and Rock flowering so the intense love would be more credible.
