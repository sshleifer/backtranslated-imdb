The sub-genre of the "old dark house" that dominated the early talks seldom comes down if we see the parent again today. Here's one that contains so many suspicious characters, you have to wonder how they can connect all the loose ends in the 6-line running time. <br /> <br /> The Crooked Circle is a gang of counterfeiters and thieves who have decided to take revenge on Col Walters (Berton Churchill) who sent one of their ranks to jail. They decide that he must die all night. Meanwhile, the Colonel's own group, The Sphinx Club, is determined to protect him at all costs. Thelma (Irene Purcell) fianc√© of club member Brand Osborne (Ben Lyon, late of the mega-budget HELL'S ANGELS (1930)) likes him to leave the club and stop his own life at risk set. Brand promises to resign after the colonel's life has been saved. The Colonel may be the new owner of Melody Manor, but it is an old dark house, complete with eccentric neighbors (such as Raymond Hatton as a local hermit) and perhaps even a ghost. Zasu Pitts is the best custodian, Nora, the housekeeper who expects a mind to see every corner. Throw a police spokesman (James Gleason) who is sure Brand is a criminal and we have a picture packed with action and surprises. <br /> <br /> You will immediately notice that the author's writer has a loss to get too much dialogue because many characters repeat the same and the same lines. Yoganda (C. Henry Gordon) a Hindu mystic (which movies of that time were loaded) says: "Evil is on the way." many times and I lose score of how often. Pitts says, "Something always happens to someone!" There are many suspects and two characters (Mr Gleason as the stereotypical silly policeman and Roscoe Karns as Mr Lyon's partner) who serve as comedy relief. The house itself is appropriately haunted. (In fact, I think the same series was used in the PHANTOM (1931)) with many secret passages and violin music coming from empty rooms, but somehow you never get a sense of danger. Maybe it's because no one in the movie, and I mean nobody !, is quite what they look like. It all comes to an end; But to go into more detail, it will spoil you. <br /> <br /> Look carefully for Robert Frazer (from WHITE ZOMBIE) and Frank Reicher (best remember as Capt. Engelhorn from KING KONG) to be among the suspects. <br /> <br /> THE CROWDED CIRCLE is a fun movie. Some aspects of the plot are predictable and then there are not a few others yet. I suspect you will enjoy it.
