Just after many years I saw this beautiful classic again. The next film, led by Henry Cornelius, who died three years later at the age of 45, was the same as the movie's male star Larry Harvey. 1973). Three future directors were in the crew: Jack Clayton (Associate Producer), Guy Green (film photographer), and Clive Donner (editor). This film is based on the autobiographical story 'Goodbye to Berlin' by well-known British writer Christopher Isherwood, who first turned into a play by John van Druten, which was then performed in a musical, a musical, 'Cabaret' , and finally filmed as 'Cabaret', which brought the wonderful Liza Minelli to worldly attention, with her voice breaking a glass at a distance of miles. Isherwood appears as a character in the film under his own name. He was gay, but in those days it was illegal and he could end up in jail, and he disguised his proclivities under the description of what he called a confirmed bachelor. It is key to its Platonic relationship with the wildly eccentric, wacky, promiscuous, always cheerful and thoroughly unique character he calls Sally Bowles. The portrait of Sally Bowles in this movie is a tournament by young Julie Harris, who sweeps every scene into a magical and engaging web of sparkling personal charm. What a vehicle for an actress with lots of charm of her own! This is one of the great films of the 1950s. Isherwood is played perfectly by young Lawrence Harvey, in a finely rated show that never lets the comedy go over the edge. Even the moments of a farce bordering on the slapstick are somehow 'almost credible'. Larry is so funny to portray a wimpish hypochondriac. What an irony, seen the total lack of hypochondria that showed its bravery and stoism in the last year of his life, when he died at the end of the stomach cancer and wore with such dignity and lack of complaint. I know him well over the past three years, and he was a generous, warm and humble person. He loved his daughter Domino. He also died tragically. This film was his best early performance, followed by his spectacular work in 'Room at the Top' (1959), 'Summer and Smoke' (1961) and 'The Manchurian Candidate' (1962). Larry was often undervalued in his lifetime because he was too clever, was often cast as a cadre, and glamorous boys were not always accepted as good actors, but many of the best actresses played against him and they had no doubt about his abilities. , and he was a strong lead in many of his most important films. If he lived outside of the middle age, he would have gone from strength to strength and become a 'big old man' from the screen. He was sitting in his home in Hampstead one day, and he gave me a glass of his usual white wine from a big bowl he brought from a strange cellar. I said he always gave me such nice wine, what was it? He proudly replied that it was a Sancerre he had chosen in France at the vineyard and sent it specially. He added with utter resentment, "You know, I've been waiting for someone to comment on it for four years and ask me what it is and you're the first person to ever do it." What was important to him was to be recognized for wine tasting, and his more glamorous friends denied him that satisfaction. In this film Anton Diffring gives a cheerful performance as a serious young man (later he had to play Nazi officers too much arm), and young Shelley Winters plays a rich German Jewish girl in her usual noisy but effective way, but that was not too difficult because she was a noisy Jewish girl anyway. This movie has such an air of joie de vivre about it, it is pure pleasure.
