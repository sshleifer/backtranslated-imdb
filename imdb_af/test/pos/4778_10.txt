STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an incredibly important movie in our movie history. This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (after the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his best-known movie - mostly because it was so groundbreaking. This is because it was the first sound story. While you are not yet speaking Mickey, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film - something we now take for granted, but which was a great crowd in 1928. <br /> <br /> Now, if it was just an important historical movie, it would be worth seeing - especially animation lovers. However, after 25 years of having seen it again, I was amazed at how timeless the movie really is. While Mickey and Minnie are acting a little strange compared to the characters we've grown to love (thanks mostly to the crazy thought and talent of animator Ub Iwerks), there's a contagious charm over the movie. It's just great to see Mickey playing "Turkey in the Straw" on a highly imaginative (as occasionally cruel) way. Clever and a true crowd-pleaser - this film still falls under Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.
