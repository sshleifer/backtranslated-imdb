This production was quite a surprise to me. I absolutely love obscure early 30's, but I wasn't prepared for the last 25 minutes of this story. If you're not convinced in the first half, hang in there for the final. Of course, you should regard blatant racism as purely topical. A fascinating viewing experience, but I think the CAT's PAW is not yet available on video / DVD. View your PBS lists!
