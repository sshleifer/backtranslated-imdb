This Stan Laurel comedy short is a cute little parody of the Valentino movie BLOOD AND SAND. If you've seen BLOOD AND SAND, you'll probably appreciate this movie and laugh at some of the screens that the Valentino movie mocks. However, if you haven't seen the movie and just watched this movie, you probably won't be very impressed. Although I really enjoy the title cards, we have repeatedly used the word "bull" in many funny ways. <Br /> <br /> Stanly plays "Vaselino" a bullfighter that looks pretty dim and wins just because the bulls are lazy and non-aggressive. Even the bull at the end of the movie, which 10 men suspected to have killed, is, of course, just a homemade bull. <br /> <br /> Not a good movie by any imagination, but still a cute and harmless movie.
