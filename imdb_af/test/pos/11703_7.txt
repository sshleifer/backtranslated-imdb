I was reluctant to see this flick before reading the external reviews and user comments here. Why? Firstly, because Mick Malloy's humor can (in my humble opinion) be a bit scratchy and on top of it, his badly outdated shemozzle of a television show turns back a few years. And secondly, because good Aussie comedy films are unfortunately as scarce as the Tassie Tiger. <br /> <br /> Sensual Mick has limited his natural comic exuberance in this surprisingly viewable movie. Who would have thought that a bakkie club would provide one of the funniest Australian movies for years. The film is excellent with well-known local old timers that all bring credible performances. <br /> <br /> Interesting to see John Clarke playing the villain in this piece. It's a one-dimensional part, but JC still adds a touch of the class, as always. Good to see Judith Lucy also got a Guernsey or should I see uniform on the big screen. She is a true talent, sorry that a number of her orders were explosive. Her own material is much whiter. Interesting character already. Cucumber reporter on a local cloth. How low can the journalistic food chain get! <br /> <br /> Crackerjack may not be the funniest movie I've ever seen this year, but it's definitely a nice distraction, which is worth it. Many other people obviously agree with me as this is the biggest Australian movie this year. Good to see someone, finally make a strange, soft comedy without trying to beat. The laughs like many Australian "comedies" before it. <br /> <br /> Finally a little trivia. If you're wondering what the Aussie Rules team is supporting Mick, check the flag on his workstation. Also look out for his old partner in crime, Tony Martin announces in the final bakkie scene. <br /> <br /> <br />
