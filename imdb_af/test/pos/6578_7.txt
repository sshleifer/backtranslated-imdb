Paha Maa is another Finnish movie. But the things that make it different are copied abroad. Some narrative techniques are from Amores Perros, Jackie Brown and Elephant. Screens are shot from different angles. Paha Maa is a good movie, but it's not so good that the hype says, "Realistic movie, no happy ending, and no commercial recordings." Some actors did good work. Sulevi Peltola was as good as a vacuum cleaner. Jasper Pääkkönen also shows his skills. But Mikko Leppilampi was so paralyzed. He is so over-rated actor, he is attractive and a good guy, but not the best actor in Finland. But if you like Finnish movies, Paha is worth seeing.
