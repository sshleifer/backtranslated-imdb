Directed by the younger brother of great director Leo McCarey, it is a very good short of the Three Stooges, nominated for an Oscar. Here are the stooges doctors called Doctor Howard, Doctor Fine and Doctor Howard. They are not the brightest doctors, but they get the benefit of the doubt as long as they handle service and humanity. <br /> <br /> I like this short. It's not one of their best, but some moments are hilarious though. One joke repeated more than once works every time. The part where they have to manage the hospital's boss is great. To say more, some of the jokes would spoil, so you should see it yourself. Just another fine short of the Three Stooges.
