I watched this movie when it was released and was very young and not too much in the movie. It was one of the most fascinating movies I've ever had and it really left a mark in me. Initially, I didn't quite understand the story and probably didn't make the necessary correlations between past and present, as the movie presented them to the viewer. <br /> <br /> Years after I first looked, I got it again and it was the time I fell in love with 'The English Patient', it got me so deep and it made me the best movie ever made. <br /> <br /> Anthony Minghella made a great movie, all the places are incredible and through his camera control he creates incredible emotions in you. <br /> <br /> Of course, the music of the movie is such a big part of the whole emotional journey of the characters and the movie won't be the same. <br /> <br /> But personally, the best thing was the fragile show that Ralph Fiennes gave in the book is masterpiece. He plays so well the man who falls in love, but so deep with Katherine Clifton, opens his heart and dives into this forbidden relationship. <br /> <br /> The most heartbreaking scene for me will always be one. Where Katherine is hurt, Almasy is carried toward the Swimmers Cave and she carries the thunder he bought. She says, "I always wore it. I always loved you" and at that moment he started crying with such pain flowing from the inside. <br /> <br /> Also in her performance, Juliette Binoche deserves the Oscar she won. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a movie that someone who preaches himself a cinema lover should look into their homes.
