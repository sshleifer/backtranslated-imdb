Hey now, I never laid a Manga cartoon, but apparently this movie is based on one. Oh, that's life. Anyway, it's a bit bizarre, at least the movie, as things literally fall out of control in a small Japanese village. People become obsessive with the uzumaki (spiral) and this young girl watches her friend's dad snail a videotape, and later in the movie people become snails? It also seems that this boy's father becomes so obsessive that he somehow commits suicide in a domestic appliance. There is bizarre humor here that can be at home in a Tim Burton movie, but there is a bit of nastiness & gore as only the Japanese can do justice. Like many Japanese movies, the end is the end, and has anything solved? Well, not in my mind, didn't do it. There are a few tips on why this all happens, but they are not explored and there is a lot of imagination left over or else it is not considered important. Yet there are many things that can be feasting on, and if you are not obsessed with everything that makes perfect sense, it is worth seeing because it is just as original and bizarre. My favorite was the father with the turning eyelids, personally. 8 out of 10 stars.
