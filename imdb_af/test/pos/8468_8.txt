This is a pretty interesting experiment to watch. It is the first, ever-existing, attempt to unite face with sound. It features two men dancing to a violin player (possibly William KL Dickson himself) standing next to an Edison recording cylinder, capturing the sound. <br /> <br /> The sound and images are not linked to one another. And it wasn't until recently that the sound and image were technically added together. This is probably why people hesitate to call this movie the first ever good picture. <br /> <br /> The film was made by William K.L. Dickson, an assistant to Thomas Edison himself who ordered him to find a way to unite photos and sound. The answer he provided was the Kinetophone, a Kinetoscope (basically a large wooden box with a viewing hole in it so people could see the moving images) with a cylinder phonograph inside, for the sound. This is the first, we know, surviving movie experiments that contain this technique. All the later movies using the same technique were shot as silent movies and sound effects were recorded later and separately. So the Chinese phone was not an attempt to synchronize sound and images, but more of an attempt to have images accompanied by sound. In some cases, people can even choose from three sound cylinders, with 3 different orchestral performances to accompany the images. Only 45 Kinophones have ever been made so you can't call the Chinese a success. Also after this experiment, the focus went to other biotechnologies, especially with respect to film projectors. <br /> <br /> Of course, the experiment itself has not been a success, also because it took more than 30 years before the first movies. They could not yet technically synchronize and the sound and the images nevertheless got together and even if they could and would have been available techniques, it would have been very expensive to do so. It is therefore not the most influential or historically important film movie movie, but it is very interesting to see how people are constantly trying to improve the quality and techniques of early theater and movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
