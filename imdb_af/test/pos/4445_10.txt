"Don't Torture a Duck" is one of the coolest Italian horror movies I've ever seen, and I've seen my part. To call it a giallo is a bit misleading because it's not really a typical murder mystery. It's more of a straight horror movie. <br /> <br /> Complete with one of the most brutal and greedy scenes ever in a movie. This guy, Fulci's turn and spin film, harvest with a creepy atmosphere and an Italian feel to the old Italian school. The area is perfect: an old Italian village. The music is ridiculously perfect. The final is right and original. <br /> <br /> After seeing, "Don't torture a duck," wonder how Fulci's later stuff beat so fast. I like all his stuff, but he got lost. Maybe he thought he'd done it. Because with this movie he hits the bullseye. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks Dario Argento owns the Giallo genre. Fulci hit him with this one. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, kids.
