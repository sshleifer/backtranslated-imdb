It's a fantastic movie. The acting is the best I have ever seen. Tatyana Samojlova is of course very beautiful, and she automatically draws you into the movie with her credible acting. The cinematography was much ahead of its time. If I see this, I could see parallel cinematography today. This is truly a groundbreaking film. Because of the cinematography and acting, the audience can feel the change in tone from start to finish, as the tone changes in the environment. It is a very touching and powerful piece. My friend told me to see it, and I definitely agree with her. This is one of those movies you watch and never forget. Everyone should see this intense moving movie. It should be placed on everyone's "Movies to See Before ________ (whatever)" list.
