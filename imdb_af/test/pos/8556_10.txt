I might have seen this movie 100 times. Never get tired. I saw this movie for the first time when I was 7 years old and it has left a point in my memories since then. It is an enchanting love story that sets the sun in most people, even in the darkest times. I think it's a "must see" movie and one of Anthony Quinn's best shows ever. I just want the TV channels to send this movie more often. It inspired me in a good way and will do it for many others. If there was an actor I wanted to meet, it would have been Anthony Quinn. There will never be a similar one on him on the silver screens. Wish Anthony Quinn is still alive. May God bless his soul.
