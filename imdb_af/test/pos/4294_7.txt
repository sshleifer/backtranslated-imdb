Although this film is among the sophisticated English upper classes, it is a simple story of a few being torn. It has a slightly dated air, which is an adaptation of "A Way Through the Wood", a 1950s novel by Nigel Balchin (once very popular and now forgotten). Julian Fellowes, who has a somewhat anachronistic persona in spite of an academic award for the "Gosford Park" script, wrote and directed the writing (the latter for the first time). With the DVD version I've seen, Julian is a very enlightening audio commentary. His primary focus was to get his characters right, and he largely succeeded. He was helped by two outstanding performances by Tom Wilkinson as James, the designated City attorney, and Emily Watson as his attractive wife Anne. He also kept it short; The running time is just 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> James and Anne have a townhouse in Chelsea and a comfortable former pastoral in Buckinghamshire. Anne is a few years younger, but they are childless. Besides, they look happy, but James, one of the moralists of nature (unusual for a city lawyer), is a control freak. Just below the road is the aristocratic Hon. William Buel, who is not for middle class morality, is more than happy to take advantage. But there is a complication, a road accident, in which an elderly cyclist in a country trail is pushed through a ruthless Range Rover, such as the Hon. Bill see. Soon, James, Anne, Bill and the victim's widow (who seems to be James and Anne's cleaner) are in a conspiracy to hide what really happened. The primary focus is on the corrosive effect of all these things on James and Anne's relationship. <br /> <br /> The third person in this Monday, a trios, Bill, is played by Rupert Everett. From the point of view of casting, his desperate, better way is right for the part, but in some way he does not get there completely. This is partly because he is supposed to be sick for some of the time and he looks good if he should be sick and vice versa. The part looks underdeveloped. Interestingly, John Neville as Bill's father, who has only one significant scene, manages to establish his character beautifully in the time he has. <br /> <br /> The world of five-star hotels and excellent restaurants is well-spoken. As Julian Fellowes says in the audio commentary, these people can convince themselves that the Edwardian era still exists. In the meantime, the movie is about what a couple pulls together and tears them apart. Nigel Balchin went through a marriage break when he wrote the book, and Fellowes made a good fist of the atmosphere. As he says, she's a pretty free custom, but the central theme is the same.
