"What Alice Found" was a pleasant discovery. As written and directed by A. Dean Bell, it is a combination of a road movie with a cautionary story as well as a discovery series. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie, you may need to stop reading here. <br /> <br /> Alice is a case study of a young woman who wants to break away from the unfortunate life she leads in a New England town. Her excuse to go with her best friend, studying at a Miami university. Alice is the product of a single mother's house, one who struggles to meet ends, in stark contrast to the comfort her friend seems to inhabit. In flashbacks we get Alice's life before he is on his way. <br /> <br /> Alice, as her namesake in Alice in Wonderland, begins a journey to the unknown that life has not prepared her. The highways of America are full of predators looking for the swakes and innocent. Alice met with a disaster when her car broke down and a friendly South couple came to her aid when a strange man approached in the dark, with the excuse that he wanted to help her. Sandra and Wetsontwerp convince her to come along in their pleasure R.V. on her way to the south. <br /> <br /> Nothing has prepared Alice for what this couple seems to be. After all, she did not deal with what Sandra and Bill did in her protected life, doing her new benefactors during the overnight stop at the rest stop in the American roads. It comes as a shock to her the realization that the kind of Sandra is nothing more than a prostitute who meets her in the truck driver who meets you in those places. <br /> <br /> Alice, brilliantly played by Emily Grace, is studying how the young woman wakes up to the new reality she can't escape. In fact, Sandra makes it so easy that Alice tries her luck in the oldest profession on earth to earn bad money. <br /> <br /> Judith Ivey is a great achievement as Sandra. Me. Ivey is perfect as the seemingly normal woman, one won't suspect she's doing the nasty thing with clients she and Bill find along the route they travel. Me. Ivey is wonderful when she reveals the truth about her life to an accused Alice. As the man, Bill Raymond is good at portraying him as the man, who is actually a lawyer. <br /> <br /> Under the excellent direction of Mr. Dean Bell, the movie is not afraid to go to capitals. movies dare not go. Congratulations to this director who wrote a probable story and created the perfect role to play for our benefit.
