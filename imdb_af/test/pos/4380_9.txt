It takes a rare movie to get better every time you see it. Oh brother do this and then some. The first time I saw it, I have to admit I've never seen anything like that. Then I wanted to see it again, and now I have double figures with this great movie, the best movie of Coen's brothers they ever did, with Fargo and Hudsucker Proxy in second and third penalties. br /> <br /> George Clooney is performing his career with Ulysses Everett McGee, a fast-paced, well-known, all-escaped culprit who doesn't really know much. Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro are the perfect sidekicks for Clooney, especially Nelson and his portrayal of Delmar, a loyal but uneducated co-escapee. John Goodman is my favorite little character as Big Dan, perfect. It reminds me of his part in Raising Arizona, he's just a perfect actor for this role. Coen brothers' favorites, Holly Hunter and Charles Durning, also offer memorable performances. <br /> <br /> Joel and Ethan Coen are masters of their trade. It's not as if they are trying to win an Oscar every time they try to make a movie, they just try to tell a story they want to tell, and it's entertaining. This is a loose adaptation of the Odyssey, and I mean loose to all your Homer fanatics. It's just wonderful. <br /> <br /> However, the most wonderful part of this movie is its color. I watched them get the dusty feeling for the movie and I'm still upset about it. The color becomes an important part of the film. Great big movie.
