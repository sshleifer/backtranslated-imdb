I'm a sucker for a decent superhero movie. (I'm not counting on a superbug budget, no storyline Batman's.) <br /> <br /> Some of my favorites are The Phantom and a budget movie called The Demolitionist. The Black Scorpio can be added to that collection. <br /> <br /> If you've seen the Demolitionist, get this movie. It's basically a copy of that heroine. (It's even the same man in both movies) <br /> <br /> If you don't, let me explain ... A police's father is being murdered and she is seeking revenge. She eats the black outfit (a sexy catwomanish, skimpy outfit that looks very good at Joan Severance) and goes out to kick a booty. <br /> <br /> It's a fun, action-packed movie, you think, you shouldn't let the kids see it ... without first checking whether you approve of the pretty graphic sex scene. Severance did it. What I think was a bonus (alright, give it an extra star <grin>)
