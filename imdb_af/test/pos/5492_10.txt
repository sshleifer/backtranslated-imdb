One of the best movies I watched ... Good screenplay, original plot of a man haunting JFK's assassination when he assigned him to protect him on the Cold November day in 1963. Thirty years later, another anti-social madman wants to kill the current president. The secret service agent loses his mate along the way, to the mad armed men who are scheming, lying and killing someone in his path. <br /> <br /> The movie accompanies with a great memorable score and a limited but meaningful romance between Russo and Eastwood .... showing how difficult it is to have a romantic life in that kind of work. Malchovich is wonderful, sure that many other candidates played the role he played, but how much did he do with such austerity and intellectual behavior in the movie? <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I thought it was a good movie ... every time it's on television, I have to see it. And I own it on DVD! I am a great Eastwood fan, it has just promoted his fabulous career and Malchovich's best role so far! <br /> <br />
