I was not going to watch what was messed up when I saw the MTV preview, but since I had nothing better to do or watch on a Sunday night, I watched it. <br /> <br /> Wasted was not a Requiem for a Dream, but it was a very good movie as it was made by MTV. One thing that attracted me to look at was Summer Pheonix, the sister of the late and wonderful river Pheonix staring. I suppose talent runs in the Pheonix family because she was good and so is Jaquien though not river. Nick Stahl also gives a good preformance as a junky jock. There is not much else to say about wasting. It was a dark depressing and insightful look at the lives of three small towns. I recommend it to those who love the subject. 8/10
