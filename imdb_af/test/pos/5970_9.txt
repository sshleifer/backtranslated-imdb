It comes as no surprise that Larisa Shepitko was married to Elem Klimov, who would later get the most offensive war movie, 'Come and See (1985).' 'The Ascending (1977)' ?? Shepikto's final finished film before premature death ?? is built in much the same shape. During World War II, the film follows a number of Soviet parties trying to protect food for their famine while evading occupying German troops. The first forty minutes are being tense, as the two men jog themselves through the hard, snow-capped landscape, the world around them completely sown with life, warmth and color. Indeed, so monotonous is the beauty that it has taken me literally long to realize that the film was shot in black and white. <br /> <br /> Following the partisans capturing by German soldiers, the film a cold meditation on loyalty and morality. While Sotnikov (Boris Plotnikov) refuses to betray his army, even forcibly, the less resolute Ryback (Vladimir Gostyukhin) tries to save himself. Is he wrong to do this? Ryback's betrayal is annoying, but the film doesn't immediately condemn. His actions are treacherous; Instead, the viewer is forced to consider what their own response might be in such a situation. Shepitko regrets Ryback as the Bible regrets Judas. Both men betrayed their allies to the enemy and forced them to see them executed. But while Judas committed suicide by hanging up (at least according to Matthew's Gospel), does Ryback even find that option closed to him? In a fearless naughty climax, the band is loosened around its neck. <br /> <br /> 'The Ascent' draws its emotional power from Shepitko's amazing pursuit of realism. I have no doubt that the two main actors spend daily on the snow-capped earth on their hands and knees, and indeed their conviction is that I have actually become a cold while watching the movie (seriously, I did it) . Interestingly, the film, on several occasions, on this reality, as Ryback suggests to make an attempt at freedom and then be shot down by his German prisoners. This device, though unusual, works well with its Biblical allegory; Ryback is faced with a trial of his dignity, and every turn he is selected with a new dilemma. He constantly chooses the selfish alternative, his own life is the only decisive criterion. By the end of the film he still lives, but the nightmare of war and guilt continues.
