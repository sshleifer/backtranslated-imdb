Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson were great in this movie / music game. The opening song by me. Andrews, "Whistling Away the Dark," will always be in the back of my mind. The plot line during the First World War is great and exciting. If you're romantic, you'll love this movie. It's a movie I always enjoy watching again and again.
