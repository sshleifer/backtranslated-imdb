I enjoyed this movie tremendously, due to sharp scenes (humorous as well as ironic, even "tragic"), believable performances, witty dialogue and a sincere version of what it wants or wants, or gay and looking the fulfillment of your desires. I am aware of the paradox here: gay and heterosexual .... this is something that the film does, but never uses for caricature. If you are as open-minded as the people seem to have made that movie, it doesn't matter to you if those in each other's arms are of the same gender or not. <br /> <br /> "Matrix's" Smith gives an admirable turn as a gay house salesman with a "strange" appetite here, but it's not the only thing to marvel at. enjoy .....
