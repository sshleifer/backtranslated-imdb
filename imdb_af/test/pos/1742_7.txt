I really started to enjoy this show. It just started slowly and it wasn't the chance it earned. It is summer so many people are not watching television at home. I know there are some talent and singing competitions, but I enjoy it like many others. Believe it or not when the American idol is being done for the year I miss it. Although it wasn't American idol, I thought it had potential. I feel bad for the singers on the show who really start growing on me. I wish they would reconsider and start the show again. I think it was a hurry to cancel. My only complaint about the show is that I don't give much to the judges.
