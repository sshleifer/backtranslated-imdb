This is not the video-rich Night of the Demon, as there is more than one. Actually, there is only one, but it multiplies. <br /> <br /> After living in Suzanne (Scream Queen Linnea Quigley), she sends it to Angela Angela (Amelia Kinkade) by a nice long kiss. /> <br /> Next we see Linnea we show her chicks in the bathroom. She shows much more than Jay (Lance Fenton) thinks he's in a little fun. <br /> <br /> Soon everything will literally go to hell as bodies fall and be owned one by one. Judy (Cathy Podewell) and Max (Philip Tanzini) are the last two to try to escape. Max is not much help, and let it be for Judy to find a way out. <br /> <br /> The makeup was absolutely fantastic, and the only thing that kept it even better was the extremely long build up of the action. <br /> <br /> The old man (Harold Ayer) who appears in the beginning will be back and she just gets desserts. <br /> <br /> Linnea Quigley can be the Scream Queen, but Cathy Podewell definitely showed the biggest lungs in this movie.
