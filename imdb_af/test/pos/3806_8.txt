This movie may be best if you like movies and laugh and then topic your friends to watch those movies too. If you're anything like me and you're probably, you'll be laughing at the jokes in this movie for years. One of the funniest parts is when Gus takes some money from a guy with children and then the man takes those kids in the bush like Hansel and Gretel, then he and his wife go with them. The soup-scene kitchen is filled with comic genius of buffooning: "Inspection officer - Here!" and the lines that follow will probably remain in my mind forever. If I showed this movie to my friends, they usually say, "What was it?" so if you're in the mood for one of those movies, yippee! This movie is so OPEN it's no longer funny, so probably the easiest way to get it is online auction. The first time I saw it was a rental.
