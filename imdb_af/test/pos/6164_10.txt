Absolutely one of the best aviation films of all time on so many levels. Hardware junkies will reenactment the largest single massage of airborne Spitfires outside a Battle of Britain. No less than eight flying spikes are on hand for very accurate ground and air ranges. <br /> <br /> Those who are amazed at the lore of flies and will identify with High Fog with a foggy eye with the central characters' reverence for the freedom to be fast, free and high in their Dark Blue World. Be warned: romantics and even dog lovers are treated to a very emotional ride in this movie. The core message is one that is shared by many war vehicles, as their best hours, their lifetime, when they felt most alive, were in the war when everything else was sad and gray. <br /> <br /> The plot covers Czech pilots escaping from their country when the Nazis invade and join the RAF-free Czech Squadron. There are a few subplots, all of which receive thorough attention. It's just an ordinary old-fashioned movie that will keep even the most inventive anti-hardware romantic love (keep the Kleenex handy). Beautiful photography, first-class acting, accurate details of the RAF life during the Battle of Britain. Easily a candidate for any aviation enthusiast's personal DVD collection.
