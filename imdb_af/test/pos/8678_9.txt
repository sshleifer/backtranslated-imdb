Andreas comes in a strange city. He does not remember where he came from and how he came there. He is ordered to come to work and get his own apartment in town. All his co-workers are nice and polite to him, they say hi and smile as they pass. But later, Andrew discovers that the city is not as pleasant as it seems. He goes home from work and sees some people wearing gray suits, cleaning the bloody mess of a dead body, apparently a suicide victim who threw him out of the window. The procedure is done with a calm mind, as if emptying a trash. The next day, Andreas meets the suicide victim at work. More and more Andreas is discovering the inverted atmosphere of the city. <br /> <br /> The scary men can be the best Norwegian movie I've seen. Original, artistic director is usually missing in Norwegian films, with only a few exceptions. The plot is also very original, and can even be called post-modern horror, as the film gives us a frightening thought to handle a completely uninhabited world. and the more you try to fill your life in this city with meaning, the more meaningless it becomes. I am fascinated by how the director manages to create the feeling of an elusive universe, a nightmare that you simply cannot escape, even with death. <br /> <br /> Seeing it, it's really worth it! I gave it 9 out of 10.
