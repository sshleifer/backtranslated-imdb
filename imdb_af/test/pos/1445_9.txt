Otto Preminger was one of the great maverick movie directors. Like John Huston, he was a character from one of his own films, such as Mr. Huston, he was a wonderful ham who slipped randomly into and out of performance, but the final product of his work was undeniably his own. With a few exceptions, movies are now being made by corporations, not individuals, and as a result, "stuffed" is usually packed, a product similar to a golf ball, a can of dog food or a car is a Die. People's involvement in the process is almost coincidental. So the appetite for the product is that there is no end to the line of well-finished, shiny, superficially entertaining but ultimately empty movies that overflow the many TV channels and movie There is no time for a man like Mr. Preminger to stand a little out of the stream of a product and produce a personal artwork. Of course there was always the "art for the sake of money for the sake of money - for the sake of Christ", in the film making, but now Ars Gratia Artis has already been shipped in history to the dressing room floor. Today, Otto Preminger will be happy to do a job delivering pizza in Hollywood. Half a century ago he made the controversial novel "The Man with the Golden Arm" in his eccentric and individualistic filming. The Laura, "Where the pavement ends" and "The moon is blue" He rather stayed in the studio and became silent almost expressionist sets, strange castings (Frank Sinatra - warming his success in "from here to forever) ", the young, inexperienced but breathtakingly beautiful Miss Kim Novak and Arnold Stang, a man whose peculiarities were his own heart and a remarkable era - definition of score by Elmer Bernstein with the West Coast cream jazz . An Otto Preminger movie has always been an everyday experience to be viewed as a whole, rather than acting in the scene, directing, photography. What appeared on the screen was Preminger's vision, his creation and his interpretation of Algren's novel, not a film by Algren's novel, one of twenty competent Hollywood hacks, produced it. From the first soundtrack sound that accompanies Saul Bass's iconic title series, we are drawn to Preminger's performance on what is currently called "The Life", in fact, a dark area run by hustlers, junkies, police officers, drug dealers, rock players, jazz musicians their wives and hangers-on.The lines are blurred in "The Life", and the dog eats dog there. The residents circle each other like sharks, looking for a sign of weakness being exploited. France Machine (Mr Sinatra) a professional card dealer, ex-junkie and aspiring jazz drummer is a born victim. When things get tough, he goes back to it. Although he kicks the habit by going cold turkey, there's absolutely no guarantee he won't go straight to it. Mr Sinatra's portrayal of an addict in the withdrawal bar split the critics, but the fact of the matter is that even fifty years later most of us have probably never seen such a thing in real life, so we do not know how accurate the portrayal is. When I first saw the movie in the late 50's, I was very impressed. I recently watched it on video, it was impossible, hammy. Perhaps he is a victim of his own success, which many actors later do Cold Turkey has passed its performance over the years and refined it slightly. Arnold Stang is excellent as Machine's pal Sparrow, a show he just exceeded in "It's a crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy world". Try to view it on the big screen and consider it the movie of a true author, a giant under today's pygmies - Otto Preminger.
