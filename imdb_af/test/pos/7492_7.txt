When I watched this movie, I had no idea what it was about, and I never heard it. But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The first few minutes are almost the funniest of the whole movie. India's shop clerk is just too funny! Anyway, the story isn't really too much to talk about, but I think it's okay. The actor on the other hand is pretty good, and still the only actor I recognized was Mickey Rourke, who wasn't really in the movie to the end. And the end is where the turn-off I think, it's not bad, but I don't feel it really ends. I felt that there was something more to be done. A final fight somehow. I do not know. All in all, it was a good movie and I recommend it to everyone in Tarantino-type movies with a lot of violence and dark, sinister humor! I rate it 7/10.
