For this clip, music videos were simply to show an artist. Michael Jackson's "Thriller" has created a whole new part of music videos that can be frankly called mini-movies. "Thriller" follows a couple while traveling from a movie to the girl's home. Along the way they meet zombies announced by the immortal Vincent Price. My favorite part is where the zombies turn to the couple stagger and the girl to see that Michael has changed in one of them. Then they do a little dance. The frightening thing about "Thriller" can be the fact that it is consistently more fun and fun than many movies made. After twenty years, it remains the leading music video. <br /> <br /> P.S. My Music Video Top 5: 5 - Madonna "Like a Prayer" 4 - Guns N 'Roses "Sweet Child of Mine" 3 - Nineteen Nails "Nader" 2 - Peter Gabriel "Sledgehammer" 1 - Michael Jackson - "Thriller"
