I read that Paolo Sorrintino's inspiration came for The Consequences of Love to simply see and speculate a businessman alone in a Brazilian hotel what he can do there. The film comes to us in a similar way. We consider the existence of Titta who has been living alone in a hotel in Switzerland for 8 years. He is mysterious and avoids friendship. His life is dominated by order and regularity. Gradually, the truth of its existence is made known to us until eventually its world begins to fall apart. <br /> <br /> The mystery of Titta is central to the effects of love and it works to a great extent on the beautiful display by Toni Servillo. His character is becoming more and more interesting to us, as small details are revealed - that he injects heroin once a week, that he has no imagination. Although some here criticize the dialogue because they are not naturalistic, it doesn't matter - it's not such a movie, and I think the writing is good. The camera work is also excellent. <br /> <br /> If you have to criticize, the movie loses its way a in later scenes, as the secret of Titta's existence is revealed to us and as its world begins to fall apart. However, the tragic final scenes are just as good as the earlier build-up.
