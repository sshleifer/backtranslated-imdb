This movie is great! I can watch it again and again. Robin hood is perfectly thrown, and Marian is beautiful. Personally, I think Marian's German husband is the funniest character with Latrine and the Sheriff! While space balls become boring and stupid after a while, this one always keeps your interest! W O N D E R F U L It was a good movie, and never gets boring. A great role play is in the roles and it is perfectly played and makes so much sense and can be watched again and again! You will love this movie if you will only see it, unless you hate comedy or don't think Robin Hood should be tampered with. But this old story gets boring, and this movie gives it a great new flavor!
