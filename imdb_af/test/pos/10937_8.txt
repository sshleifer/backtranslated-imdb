This split of THE SEARCHERS is one of the strangest movies I have ever seen filmed by a British in a strange, unknown Mexico. It is often said that the best films about America are made by foreigners, who can approach the acquaintance with an outsider's eye. But this crackpot movie is something else. Although apparently occurring in America after the Civil War, it is not an America that is recognizable by myth, theater, television, etc. The film has an air of timeless fable about it, while dealing specifically with Western mythology. <br /> <br /> Director Harvey uses the title horse as a focal point for the interconnection of stories, all of which deal with the traditional Western clash of primitive and civilization. The former seems to have the upper hand. The vast scrub and desert of the film's landscape is unbroken, ripe for allegories of the mind. The only concise places of civilization are a stage assignment of missionaries and landowners, and their hacienda, which both lead to something civilized. <br /> <br /> The basic story divides three stories. In one, a goalless devastating, Pike, lost his trading partner, had a miraculous horse, Eagle's Wing, supposedly because of his grace and speed, stealing. Secondly, an Indian, White Bull, owner of this horse, leads a stage coach and kidnaps one of his female residents. In the third, the Spanish men sent to find that they ignored this search in favor of a murderous, looting spree. <br /> <br /> Although a revisionist Western, treating the Indian is problematic. Unlike Pike, his character is never declared, forever inexcusable, he denies a voice, except for a rude song. If he is not a strange other, he is a symbol, whose role is not fully worked out - at one stage a brutal brute, in the other, he illuminates nature and freedom. <br /> <br /> But Pike notes at the beginning that the film will pay attention to the period of primitivism before civilization. In many ways, the movie looks like 2001 - a SPACE ODYSSEY, especially its opening sequence. Part of the movie's power lies in the connections between the three diverse characters, forcing us to see the mythical battle and missions in a different light. Indian culture and Catholicism are linked to superstition, ritual, greed and murder. Both Pike and White Bull are musical and alcoholic. White Bull is demonstrated by both Pike and the kidnapped as a "bastard", who unknowingly reveal the tactics of illegality used by the colonization of whites who have partied the natives and become "essential" fathers. <br /> <br /> Unlike a traditional Western, making history, civilization and progress, this film is a dual detective story, past trial, trace, remnant. <br /> <br /> What gives this movie its remarkable uniqueness, I think, is, despite Maltin's racism, his British. The climate standard is more like an Arthurian joust. The film itself bravely the dialogue generally, created the kind of visual and audience tapestry Malick missed in THE THIN RED LINE, and would have ventured slightly less Hollywood directors. The existential duplication and search motives are more European myth than American (like another British Harvey Keitel movie, THE DUELLISTS). <br /> <br /> Most amazing is the use of nature. Most Western uses landscape as an awesome backdrop: there is little sense to actually live in the West. In many ways, EAGLE'S WING is like a Powell and Pressberger movie, with nature a powerful, pantheistic character in its own right - alive, dangerous, hostile, beautiful. There is a sublime scene reminiscent of a BANBURY LANGUAGE, when jewelery is dropped by Witbul into the trees, suddenly blown into the wind: there is a haunting, tingling, magical, exciting effect that more reminiscent of Arab nights as a horse opera. My heart was almost silent.
