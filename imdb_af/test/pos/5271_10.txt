Helge's best movie by far. Very funny, very surreal. If Bunuel made a movie with Buster Keaton as Krusty the Clown, it would look like that. <br /> <br /> Brilliant performances by the cast we already know of other Schneider films, especially Helmut KÃ¶rschgen as the sidekick of 00Schneider. (Andreas Kunze, who once again plays the woman in this one, is a bit annoying). And of course, Helge himself as Nihil Baxter is absolutely incredible. <br /> <br /> PS: If this movie had a proper merchandise, I'd really like to buy a replica of the "Holz ist" painting.
