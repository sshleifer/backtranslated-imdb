Even though it is a Christmas movie, Christmas in Connecticut could be done anytime of the year, as it is the story of a soldier who spends an idyllic time with a Martha Stewart type. That's what he thinks. In fact, the woman in question, depicted by Barbara Stanwyck, is a popular magazine column on life on a farm with her husband and baby. She has no farm, no husband, and no baby, nor the many recipes she makes her publish. They belong to the restaurant owner nearby. When her non-nonsense editor, Sydney Greenstreet, insists she's entertaining the soldier Dennis Morgan, she enters the help of her boyfriend to use his farm, and she transports her and the restaurateur there. There is even a baby ... well, actually there is more than one. Chaos follows, and the charade is becoming increasingly difficult to play out, especially if Stanwyck falls in love with Morgan. <br /> <br /> It's such a wonderful movie, and even if you are seriously depressed, Christmas is in Connecticut "you can straighten it out. Barbara Stanwyck is great if the career woman has become home-maker. She was not as flashy as Crawford or Davis, she could do whatever role was created, she could be cheap, elegant, hot, nasty, cold and / or sexy, making it easy, and always attractive and attractive Dennis Morgan is an attractive and beautiful solid, as an extra bonus he gets his Irish tenor, Engaged Reginald Gardner is all busy and you can say he is not quite right for Stanwyck SZ Sakall as the fake uncle Chef is hilarious, especially when he prays, Stanwyck can flip a pancake in front of the audience. <br /> <br /> I could imagine the impact this beautiful film had at the end of World War II. be a true beacon for the better times.
