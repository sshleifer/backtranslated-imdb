Flatliners left quite a noticeable impression in my head. The story is faster and makes you constantly recorded and tense. It is about five remarkable student doctors (especially Julia Roberts and Kevin Bacon) among whom one of them invented the remaining death mechanism (or flat plane) for a few seconds and then came back to life. <br /> <br /> The procedure is fairly complex, with an abundance of medical knick knacks injections, electric blankets, oxygen masks and a variety of esoteric medical terms. I strongly suspect doctors have created all these words so they should never get rid of. But they follow the KISS (Original version for engineers: Keep it simple, stupid). (Extended version for doctors: Keep it mute, Simple). To get the risk of being approached by an avid doctor reader, let me continue. <br /> <br /> So, the first guy who sounds up, gets the answers to life that philosophy and religion cannot convincingly answer. He hopes to get it through applied science (and become known). He has about two minutes of flat lines and then returns to our world, rather shaken. At death, he had a vision of an incident when he was young, which left the strongest impression on his life. He killed another boy when he was accidentally a child, and he still feels responsible for it. <br /> <br /> With the success of the first craft, others follow everybody who is expanding their flat line. time further and further to the limits of how long one can stay dead and experience life after death. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, monsters of the past and future remain to haunt them to their platinum experience. The first runner is chased by a young child who tortures him if he is alone. The second comrade, all the women he slept, sees television sets all over his videos. The third is haunted by a young girl who has been squatting at school. The fourth is being pursued by her suicide-dead father, whom she feels responsible for. <br /> <br /> Everybody is fooled by this ghost and obsessions and thinks the past wants to take revenge. The main focus on being flat lined is that your whole life is going through your eyes, at the moment of 'death', no matter what stage it is, and you are mostly left with the strongest impressions of the live in your mind. As they do not die, these strong impressions somehow revived and became the focus of their lives. <br /> <br /> All of them somehow have reached their past demons (and extinguishes). All of them, besides the first one who realizes the only way he can move through life, are flung. During this flat-line session, he saw himself flattened for the first time and saw the boy he killed and tried to kill him this time. The boy killed him this time for a few minutes, so he took revenge. For a few minutes in the movie there is another question whether he will come back. Fortunately (because most of us like happy ends) the boy escapes him from his past and returns.
