A dark and painful look at the dangers of drug addiction, Sinatra is wonderful in this movie. Just looking at his cruel and screaming and destructive rage near the end of the film is enough to make someone think about heroin, maybe they should show it to children in the health class, instead of the ceaseless drives that our year after. years must endure. <br /> <br /> This is the story of a man just trying to make a new, clean life for himself after being in jail, trying to get rid of his drug habit and his work Handling cards in illegal gambling operations, which are deducted, is thrown back by the evils of human nature. He is used by his employers, drug dealers and even his enigmatic, clever, yet stupid woman. <br /> <br /> Even if you didn't like the movie itself, it's just worth seeing the soundtrack. It's all heavy, swinging jazz with big drum and copper sections. This, with its coarse but slightly sinister sound, helps the mood with the grumpy, thin drug and card dealers, who always look like vultures around the Frankie Machine. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to anyone - especially if you like movie noir, soot packs, fedoras or jazz.
