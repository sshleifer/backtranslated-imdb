Love In Limbo is my all-time favoirite movie. (in W.A). It's hilarious and has an outstanding role play, including a group of three beautiful actors, Russell Crowe (As Arthur), back in the day when he was actually looking hot with short hair and no face hair. Aden Young (Barry McJannet), and Craig Adams as Ken Riddle. <br /> <br /> Ken is a senior high school student who has sex with sex and is chosen for selling pornographic drawings to his classmates. He is starting a new job at his uncles clothing factory and is close to another new man, Barry McJannet, who buys a car so they can look out and pick up chicks. They become friends with good-twosh geek Arthur Baskin (Crowe) and the three guys drive to Kalgoorlie to resist a brothel and lose their virginity. <br /> <br /> Look, this is a classic !! For so long, I've been trying to hold a DVD or soundtrack, anyone lets me know if you have any.
