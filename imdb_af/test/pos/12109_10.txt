It's a movie about the music currently being played in Istanbul. Istanbul was the centerpiece of the two Old World superpowers, the Byzantine Empire and the Ottoman Empire. Today, it's a megalopolis of almost 10 million. It is therefore not surprising that many music are played in Istanbul, with a wide variety of voices, styles and influences from all over the world. This is of course Turkish music, and I was fascinated by Turkish music since I bought my first record long ago. The film has different singers, instrumentalists and bands. Spoken music commentators illustrate the music being played and the social context in modern Turkey. For my perspective, the most interesting comment was from Orhan Gencebay. In addition, the movies show urban beauty, mainly from Istanbul, which is very pleasant to watch. <br /> <br /> "Crossing the Bridge" is listed as a documentary and includes music from minorities, e.g. Kurds and Roma. Other important topics are omitted such as Turkish jazz music, or music from the Armenians and Greeks. <br /> <br /> This movie is highly recommended for lovers of the music and culture of Turkey, the Balkans, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East. It can also be worthwhile for those with a keen interest in the global effects of music styles such as Rock and Roll or Hip Hop.
