A true sudsy soap opera here like Spencer Tracy the role of an illiterate approach to 20 years. He marries the woman who teaches him and her ambition and his drive leads him to success. <br /> <br /> Success but no luck here. A n-do-well boy and a false marriage lead to disaster and tragedy. Tracy buys a railroad and only manages to be subject to a disastrous rail strike and the death of 406 workers. <br /> <br /> The movie appeared to be in the beginning, but was rejuvenating thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks here. <br /> <br /> A double separate suicide here. We know that wealth cannot buy happiness, but it is a little too far-fetched. Nevertheless, we have striking performances by Tracy and Colleen Moore. Mrs. Vinson, as the 2nd woman, is also very effective.
