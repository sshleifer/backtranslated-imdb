I went to Western History when I was a college student who saw the view of World War II, and it was quite awkward and totally wrong. World War II was the most graphic and bloody affair ever seen in world history. While the ash powers did many crimes against humanity, which are still the show today and many people forget that not every German soldier is wiping out the Jewish population, not every Japanese soldier has swung a Samurai sword and kamikaze missions did not fly. every Italian soldier was a fascist. Most of these soldiers for the Axis forces were normal people like you and I caught up in a terrible conflict and just fought for a country they loved. <br /> <br /> The Battle of Stalingrad was probably the most deadly battle. in world history with more than 1,500,000 casualties during the struggle. The film Stalingrad follows a German platoon and its leader Lieutenant von Witzland, as they are sent to the eastern front to fight the Soviet Union at Stalingrad. Von Witzland acts as the main character with two other men, Rollo and Fritzi. They are all ordinary men and seem to be completely unaware of what is happening in Germany and Poland. <br /> <br /> The film follows the course of the battle. The movie is generally very dark when it comes to portraying battles and a soldier's life during the battle. We have been shown numerous gruesome battles and intense violence outside of the fight (including a coaching group). Overall, the battles are the earliest examples I know of depicting the loss of limbs and overall in your facial cases and violence. Much of the inspiration for saving Private Ryan's battlefield seems to be this movie. <br /> <br /> The film is not aimed at making the Germans completely innocent of everything in the film. Several of the higher ranking officers of the army are portrayed in the common view most people use, evil. Most of the soldiers are just ordinary people who often speak from home. The film makes it very clear that not all Germans were responsible for what happened during the Holocaust, most of the country and army were totally unaware of the fact that genocide had taken place. The film makes it clear that the soldiers in the German army are simply fighting for a cause they really didn't understand and most of them just wanted to go home rather than freeze in negative grade temperatures in Russia. <br /> <br /> The movie really shows how a hellish war, especially World War II. The battle scenes will shock you with its eager realism and the story is pretty easy to follow because you just follow a platoon during the battle. As with most war films, you do not expect much luck after seeing it. It will leave you a bit of a depressing mood just because you see the lives of most of the soldiers on the East front. Not recommended for children. <br /> <br /> 4/5 stars
