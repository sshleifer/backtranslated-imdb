<br /> <br /> "We can exchange Murders - your wife, my dad - seemingly innocent conversation between two strangers - Bruno Anthony and Guy Haines when they meet lunch on a train journey. Guy, a solid, respected tennis player, whose problem is that his wife, Flirting Miriam, will not divorce him, so that he can marry Senator's daughter Anne, jokingly. The next week he didn't laugh anymore. In a scene of classic Hitchcock tension, Bruno Mirjam bumps through a carnival and strangles her. As he does, her glasses fall off and we see the murder frankly reflecting twice through her lenses. Cold heart and amoral Bruno, completing his part of the deal, approaching a terrible Guy, even pushing him to do his bit. "Matters aren't helped when Anne's preliminary and outspoken younger sister suspects Miriam's murder. Accused of a murder he did not commit and expected to commit another, what will Guy do? The power of this movie is in presenting people as a murderous side to their nature - and this Hitchcock is perfect.
