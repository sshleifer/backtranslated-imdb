She's The Man was everything I wanted, and maybe a little more. I love the teen type "chick flick" movies and I knew this one would be fine !! She is a unique, well-written, very well-educated comedy with some of the funniest lines and physical comedy I've seen long ago. . This is probably the funniest movie I have seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther.) But she's the man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the spiritual writing, "Three's Company 'style story of wrong identities, and mixed messages, and the cast. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes is a star !! Even since the days of the terrible camp (rather odd, entertaining "The Amanda Show", she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy. She is probably one of the most talented comedians out there. Her style of physical comedy, imitation and spiritual dialect She was hilarious, previously her big-screen debut (where she was the star) was the spectacular and well-made "What a girl wants." If it wasn't her outbreak vehicle, then she's the man who looks down. Bynes is really the ultimate girl next door, it's a pity she's no longer doing big-screen work, as she can be the next "It" girl, she's the All American, cute, earth-bubbling teenager (though she's twenty now is) and whether she can transfer her talent and style to be an adult actor, will continue to look, but for the purpose of this movie she is perfect! She is legally pulling the rather exorbitant plot of her personalizing her twin brother and make it true dense. Not quite ... but credible enough. Most of the scripts rely on the comedy of her mistakes trying to be a man, but it's just hilarious, not stop laughing. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005's "Havoc" by playing Duke. He is the jock, the captain of the soccer team, and finally Bynes's object of love. Unfortunately, he is also Sebastian's roommate (who is Bynes.) He is a good front man, and chemistry is perfect between them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who is attracted to Sebastian (who is again Bynes.) She also does well, although her part is small and she doesn't really play the role of the role. James Kirk is big in his small role as the real Sebastian. His likeness to Amanda Bynes is amazing ... they are absolutely credible as twins and beyond, from afar you can understand anyone Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the role is all in place and their roles range from short to more support, but in essence they all support the story between Bynes and Tatum, but all support more or less Bynes' tremendous performance. She easily wears the film without hesitation and makes it worth it. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies that shows so much in the trailer, yet it's not one of those movies that come at that time. No more funny. The parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilaries in the real movie. Relative newcomer Andy Fickman does such an incredible job on this movie. He weaves together a possibly complicated story and lets it flow naturally and drop everything. The story loosely based on Shakespeare's twelfth night, but it is remarkable how much they have translated it into this contemporary film. It seems to be completely out of the wall, but more precisely to the classic comedy than you think. There is not too much to say of a downside, except that the last half hour is dragging a bit and becoming a predictable one, but it doesn't change the honesty of the first half of the movie. Yet you will laugh at tears and this is one of the funniest movies in the theater right now! 9/10
