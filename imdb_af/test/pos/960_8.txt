I don't know why people consider it trashy or stupid; It's not like American Pie or anything. I don't know why people are offended by the universal plugs; since it is part of the plot, the advertisement is excusable. <br /> <br /> It's a funny movie with good dialogue, good subtle whites, a good story, a good moral (grateful not too juicy), GREAT acting, and a cheesy ending . <br /> <br /> (basic predictor) The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd dog (Muniz) who lies so bad that no one believes him when the Wolf (Giamatti) comes along. So he gets his best friend Kaylee (Bynes) and they are disgusting to the Wolf. <br /> <br /> Frankie Muniz can't be annoying in other roles, but not Jason Shepherd. He handles the self-confidence of his character perfectly, and at first glance, a lack of expression seems to be a perfect nonchalantness. <br /> <br /> Amanda Bynes. What else can I say? The girl has the gift. She is funny, talented, versatile and very, very attractive. (I'm only 6 months older than her. I must come to California soon.) The best friend's part was originally a boy, but became a girl once the makers saw Amanda's interest. It works pretty well, because the part would have been pretty boring without the blessing of Bynes's abilities. <br /> <br /> Paul Giamatti is a very talented man. While some would play Marty Wolf as evil and deadly, Giamatti made him - not only for a while but just a nice mop, a while on the screen, rather than deliberately obscuring it. And I doubt many other actors can deduce the psychological collapse Wolf also undergoes. <br /> <br /> All in all, a good movie. I loved Jaleel White mocking himself. I loved seeing all the references and so on in the movie. (One of the guests in the party scene is director Shawn Levy, another is Bynes' former co-star Kenan Thompson). Amanda wondered in those outfits ........ Get the DVD if you can. It has all kinds of good extra stuff, and the lovely girl. Bynes is your guide through the menus. :)
