I loved this movie !! I waited for this movie to come out so I could see it. I saw how it started night and loved it. Some people told me that this movie was not good and to stay away, but I thought it was wonderful. The actors did well and it was scary and made me jump. Paris Hilton did a good job for her first movie. Everyone gave her a hard time when she did well and she didn't even play that role. The set was wonderful, it was made of all was and how it was made. The two brothers did a good job and the death syndrome was wonderful. The murderers were very scary and made me close my eyes and didn't look at them. I can't wait for this movie to come to Video so I can get it and see it again. The review of my review is about watching this movie if you like Hororr movies and you won't be sorry. I love this movie. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 IT ROCKS !!!
