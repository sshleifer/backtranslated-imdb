It is mainly about love in World War II, but we must remember that it is also a biopsy for Dylan Thomas and those around him at this stage of his life. <br /> <br /> The movie's timing is just wonderful. It really matters what I would have been in those times; smile and hope you won't be bombarded. Although it can be boring to anyone, the movie has a particularly dangerous advantage. <br /> <br /> At one point my heart played towards the end as the movie reached its peak. It really contains some striking moments that are handled by the four main actors with skill. Cillian Murphy is in fine shape here, like Matthew Rhys. Both are polar opposites and make for an interesting look. The relationship between Sienna Miller and Keira Knightley's characters is wonderful and we have the grateful thanks to thank you (and look out for a cameo by Suggs from Madness). <br /> <br /> Despite this, it's a pretty slow movie. Coupled with the fact that it is only ashamed of two hours, it is quite a trick to come to the conclusion. <br /> Overall, this is a solid non-fiction war movie with many wonderful moments that are undoubtedly helped by the beautiful number of famous British names behind the scenes. But sometimes it works far too much. Worth another. 10/07
