To be myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie !! I relate to the Ann Ann character more than most would. My mother is not as eccentric as Adele, but the feelings of loneliness are the same. This movie is perfect in the ating aspects, and Natalie's, and Susan's performances are so tied up that it's the best screen twins I've seen in years. Their chemistry brings the characters to life, they become real people! I would recommend this movie to anyone who hopes to get away. Because there are many people who would like to be, "Anyone But Here," including me! And if you can, see this movie with your best friend or mom. These are the tears that all around you mix!
