I loved this movie. You can't buy it, rent it or find it ... but it's a custodian. <br /> <br /> Wonderful chemistry between Braccho and Walken ... and Ferrar .... <br /> <br /> Great non-stop action and reactions .... loved it. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I've watched my pirate copy six times over the past decade ... every time it came to someone who had never heard of it. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and watch it. <br /> <br /> So many movies are running over and over - without any of the white and style of this small movie. <br /> <br /> I didn't know it was made for TV. .. my copy is an 8 song I've pirated years ago ... I hope it's expensive.
