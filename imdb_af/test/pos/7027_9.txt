Dirty Dancing follows the story of Frances 'Baby' Houseman (Jennifer Gray) and her family while spending the summer at Kellerman's Family Summer Camp. We find her discovering her because she falls in love with the dance instructor, Johnny Castle (Patrick Swayze). <br /> <br /> The movie is full of wonderful dance (so the title!). wonderful scenery. It deals with some difficult issues with dignity and grace and of course (shocking spoiler here!) A happy, wonderful, good ending! You know how it will end from the beginning, but it's not really the point here. The point is the journey, a journey that affects every member of the family. <br /> <br /> It's one of the movies I need to watch when it comes to TV ... no matter what I have already memorized!
