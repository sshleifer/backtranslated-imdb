Watch the stranger as the director of the fiction Marc Forster's The Kite Runner is the movie-like equivalent to eating your vegetables because this home-made epic graded PG-13 is good for your movie diet. No, it's not the kind of movie I'd like to put on the couch and eyeball at the end of a difficult day. The Kite Runner is not your typical mainstream movie designed to entertain you and let you forget about your problems. First, there are no celebrity stars in it. Secondly, nothing is cut and dried, black or white, or so exorbitant that you don't believe an image you see. Thirdly, the Kite Runner falls into subtitles when the characters speak occasionally in their mother tongue. Fourth, Forster's film is not a romantic little thing about a boy-like girl, son-losing girl, and then son-winning girl back. Fifth, this strange language film can make you feel uncomfortable and challenge your assumptions about life, friendship and survival. The main themes here are cowardice and redemption. The protagonist commits a cowardly offense in the first half of the action he must reconcile at the expense of his own personal security and integrity. Right, The Kite Runner is about delivering yourself to past sins. We're talking about personal liability, don't rent or buy this wonderful movie for a boy's night celebration or something to take the bad taste of the day out of your system. Based on Khaled Hosseini's bestselling novel, this culturally enlightened melodrama looks right and down, initially as one of those light-hearted adolescent film films in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Sandlot potatoes. About half an hour in its 127 minutes, this escape over two young people flying kites in Afghanistan is dark and indifferent. However, if you can handle the remaining hours of the plot, you will be satisfied, relieved, and perhaps even entertained. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner opens in San Francisco in the year 2000 when our protagonist, Afghan emigre Amir Jan (United 93 Khalid Abdalla) and his wife Soraya (Atossa Leoni or The Florist) published two boxes. copies of Amir's first novel. Not sooner did Amir have the chance of baking in his triumph of a lifetime as a storyteller when the phone call came out of his reverie and he was reluctantly withdrawn into a past that had best left him. Rahim Khan (Shaun Toub or The Nativity Story) calls Amir from Pakistan to make a request. Rahim was a servant in Amir's household in the 1970s when Amir lived in Afghanistan with his rich Pashtun trade father Baba (Homayoun Ershadi or A Taste of Cherry) before the Soviet invasion. "You still have one more chance to be good," Rahim Amir told his request. Basically, Rahim wants Amir to fly to Pakistan and then invade Afghanistan in War-torn and Rahim's young grandson Sohrab (Ali Danish Bakhty Ari), imprisoned against his will as a sex slave for Assef (newcomer Abdul Salam Yusoufzai) be saved. cruel Taliban captain and Amir's once feared opponent. <br /> <br /> The Kite Runner moved from San Francisco in 2000 to an extensive setback in Kabul in 1978 when life was idyllic. Twelve-year-old Amir (Zekiria Ebrahimi) and his father's servant's son, Hassan (Ahmad Khan Mahmoodzada), like to watch movies, like John Sturges's western The Magnificent Seven, when they don't fly kites. By the way, it's been kite flying as you've never seen kite flying. Not only do the children fly, but they also compete with other children to see who can cut the strings of another child's kite. The kite camps fighting the kite generate the same kind of excitement that the dog shield tones had in Tony Scott's Top Gun. Hassan is Amir's best friend, but unlike Amir, Hassan belongs to the devastated Hazara minority. Earlier, young Amir and Hassan had a confrontation with young Assef (Elham Ehsas) and his two flunkies. Assef was about to save them, but Hassan pulled out his shift and threatened to use it on Assef. Assef has no choice but to go back. Meanwhile, Amir was prepared to suffer the handler who treated him. Amir's father, Baba, complains about his son's lack of spine and fears he will grow up half of a man because he is a coward, unlike the spicy little Hassan who hits Amir out of trouble. Anyway, Amir and Hassan come out with Assef without a scratch. Later, after Amir set a new record with his kite and fighting skills, Hassan ran to a kite to claim it. Hassan is the unambiguous character referred to in the title. Hassan claims the fallen kite, but he finds himself to be the grace of Assef and his two followers. Assef lets Hassan maintain the kite, but his little ones point out Hassan eagle, stomach in a alley while Assef kisses the youth. The worst, a traumatized Amir looks at the assault nearby, but does not have the courage to intervene on behalf of his friend who intervened. <br /> <br /> Apart from the extraordinary aerial photographs with the kites, the Kite Runner is down-to-earth, straight ahead. When Amir returns to Afghanistan to save Sohrab, he is disguised as a Taliban fighter, but he does not carry a firearm. The rescue scene in The Kite Runner is rather like the escape scene of The Midnight Express. While Forster does not explore local politics or bump into the ethnic and cultural issues at stake here. Wedding scenario owner David Benioff had to eliminate certain parts of the book and the races and ethnic prejudices are not clearly demarcated, so you have to accept certain things on faith. Forster lent the film in almost China to give it a real look. Forster deserves credit for making these two hours plus epic fascinating. The performances, especially by the children, stand out for their credibility. The Kite Runner is a movie you won't easily forget.
