I know little or nothing about astronomy, yet; I was initially a little skeptical about the plot of this movie. It follows three children who were all born during a solar eclipse and therefore have no emotion and therefore (of course) become relentless serial killers. The plot only sounds ridiculous, but once you realize that a solar eclipse is breaking out of Saturn and as you know, Saturn is the emotional planet. It all falls into place. make sense and it is then that you know you are not just looking at another silly 80's skater with a pea mind map. Thanks for that! Overall, however, Bloody Birthday is based on a ridiculous point of departure, but it does more than its originality. Making a bunch of kids to kill people may not be the most ingenious masterpiece ever seen in theater, but when choosing between this and another boring Friday the 13th clone, I know what I will choose. <br /> <br /> Also, the movie from the hole helps some people think it's foolish, dug it in, it's extremely entertaining. Many slashers are getting too fast, and the audience just ends up watching it go. However, this film goes without saying with some big, sly performances of the kids (looking back at creepy kids' classics like the Verlatenes village), a constant stream of sick humor and a small, but impressive, type of film, dose tension and tension. One thing I love much about this movie was the wide variety of weapons. There is nothing worse than a shooter where the killer uses the same weapon over and over (cough Halloween cough), but this is not the case here, as Bloody Birthday offers the place to jump from rope and arrows. There was no room for a chain saw, it's a big shame, but I don't think every movie can have a chain saw in it.
