Fantastic Chaplin movie with many unforgettable moments, as Charlie joined the army to fight in WW1. <br /> <br /> Initially he goes to the camp, where he has to learn how to handle his gun and how to walk. It's a very funny scene because the tramp is not used to keeping his feet straight! <br /> <br /> Next thing you know he's in a ditch in France. Hilarious scenes here include a hungry Charlie who eats the mussel cheese and reads a letter from the house about someone's shoulder. <br /> <br /> When Charlie goes to bed, he finds his bunker all overflowing and snoring his roommate. It's such a funny part! I can't really describe it, just watch the movie. When Charlie wakes up, his legs feel clumsy, so he tries to wake them up. It made me roll on the floor when it appeared that his second leg still felt numb ... while Charlie was actually rubbing his roommate's feet! <br /> <br /> The movie then becomes a bit funny, because Charlie shoots a few Germans out of his trench (though done in a very funny way) and sees him as a tree to get close to the enemy , and a friend of his to save a death team. <br /> <br /> Last part is a French girl in trouble by hiding in her home. He must then save her and while he does, he also captures the German kaiser. To do this, he embodies a German colonel or something. I love it if Charlie is asked something in German and he is like no one. The soldier looks at him in a funny way so that Charlie changes his mind: yes yes yes! The kaiser is caught and Charlie is the hero ... but then he woke up again in bootcamp, it was just a sweet dream! Charlie did one of those 'dream sequences' before (The Bank comes in mind) but who cares, this movie was so funny that I laughed all the way. Chaplin also has something to say about this movie (since his later work has become more of a social commentary on various accidents in the world) and is best explained in the last sentence of the movie: "Peace on earth, good will for all humanity. <br /> <br /> In short: a Charlie classic, very funny, timeless. 9/10.
