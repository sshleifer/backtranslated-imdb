I now watch "The Big Chill" on DVD. One of his actors is Meg Tilly. I watched it on IMDb, which led me to read Meg's bio that called me and remind me of Meg's sister Jennifer Tilly, whose film movie "Key West" included one of my wife's and my favorite shows. . Then I read the whole thread of the reviews. <br /> <br /> Wow, I also loved the show and agree with all the sentiments about the peculiarity and uniqueness of the characters and situations. <br /> <br /> Like most everyone, I wish it was on DVD or otherwise available. <br /> <br /> The last reviewer says he looks at reserves, so I wish I knew what network, channel, day, times it was. <br /> <br /> So if anyone knows how to see "Key West" episodes, please let us know.
