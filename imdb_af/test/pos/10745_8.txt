Sequels is a volatile lot with most nowhere near the stature of the original. Sometimes you find a successor who is considered better than the original, some critics (like John Charles) said Project A2 is better than the original. I do not differ, but this movie is still a good follow-up and fits in well with the output of the brilliant Hong Kong action theater in the 1980s, as well as Jackie's own oeuvre. I wonder how with such an immense release of big movies that his later films were not so good. He only directed two films in the 1990s and no one has passed it, but in many of the films he was not officially the director, he did much. <br /> <br /> Earlier in 1987, Jackie followed brain surgery following a disastrous fall in filming the armor of God. It encouraged him to work on his next film near the house. It did not encourage him to stop his life and his entertainment team for our entertainment. What followed was a smash hit at home that darkened the original in box office (31 million HK dollars compared to 19 million for the original). Jackie Chan is again the police officer, extraordinary Dragon Ma and he is ordered to work with the "Three Wane" Superintendent Chun (Lam Wai, Royal Warriors) who is the only Chinese police officer allowed to have a gun, arrested to make himself look better and to ignore the crimes of a triple gentleman. called Tiger Au (Michael Chan Wai-Man, Dragon Lord). Apparently, Chun is too much power to be shot down, but he is relieved of the Sai Wan district (now he is "Two Wan") taking over Dragon Ma. This ineffective and corrupt office will soon get a makeover and there is a wonderful scene where three officials, who do not know who to do, are trying to teach Mom to learn a lesson on complaining about police officers. He soon took care of that district ship and cared for Tiger Au. The battle of choreography and stunts with Tiger and his men is pretty great. My favorite stunt was a beautiful brutal second-floor fall in a large vase and the vase didn't soften. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, some subplots happen. There are pirates who have survived the first film seeking revenge and food. Then there are revolutionaries including Maggie (Maggie Cheung, In the Mood for Love) and (Rosamund Kwan, Casino Raiders) trying to raise funds for dr. Sun Yat-sen to overthrow the Qing government as well as government operations trying to find these rebels. Throw a mix of corrupt Hong Kong and British Cops as well as legitimate kids and you have a stew that gets a bit too many ingredients, but still seems to coalesce. It works well if there is a Marx Brothers scene (the Marx Brothers did this kind of scene several times with The Cocoanuts (1929) the first) at Maggie's place where everyone is looking for someone while hiding from someone otherwise. Many weeks have been spent on this scene alone and the trouble shows definitely. <br /> <br /> There are several errors with the movie. There is a certain didactic nature that crawls into the film that looks a bit out of place? especially a small speech to the end that Jackie gives when dealing with mainland revolutionary and the extremely easy conversion of the pirates who survived the first film. Female characters are once again appreciated and used, especially Maggie Cheung. I wasn't so happy with the continuation of the plot as much as the first movie. The individual scenes dominate my feelings for the movie rather than thinking of this movie as a coherent whole. I do not mention the movie because I cannot have Sammo Hung and Yuen Biao as the first (I heard the main reason this two Eastern Condors filmed, but I wonder if Jackie could wait a little while in the next, they will work together for the last time next year in Dragons Forever), but they are missed. <br /> <br /> I have found it quite a pleasant and well-made film and it is seen as one of the better comedic action films of the 1980s. This movie is also pretty good in some unexpected places. The art is excellent (Eddie Ma Poon-chiu), the costumes are beautiful, the cinematography is good and the film looks really authentic. But the stunts, comedy and action are what I remember for this movie. There is a chase with a handy dragon and Chun which is excellent (part of the ax-throwing center will be used in Shanghai afternoon). The last twenty minutes are full of awesome hits, falls, chili peppers like a mouthwash (Jackie writes in his autobiography on how he used real peppers in this scene, and you can see him a lot of mouth pain during the outtakes of the end) and is a worthy conclusion for this movie. The best-known stunt of this series is his tribute to Buster Keaton of Steamboat Bill Jr. (1928), with the exception that there is no hole and only a weak part where his head passes. <br /> <br /> Fans of Jackie and / or Hong Kong action theater should consider having and watching their own. I definitely do.
