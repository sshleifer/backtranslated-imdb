Watching this movie has caused a reasonable emotional response. This is what documentaries are about today. It is refreshing to see something so personal, honest and real. Mr. Block's thoughts, opinions and disclosures are rarely seen and are displayed incredibly well. It's a good line to walk between personal truth and exploitation. This film is very careful and reasonably successful. <br /> <br /> One would think learning about how a seemingly normal couple can't have society's expectations will cause pessimism ... but it doesn't. On the contrary, it made me feel good. I feel I now know more about marriage ... about women. Definitely visit it, it will make you think - exactly what a good documentary design should be.
