The Box is one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. To explain my experience, let me use this word shot: Imagine working on pixie sticks and paint gases over the past month while watching nothing but Twilight Zone reruns. The resulting coma ends up in a hospital, where the nurse gets a kick from the shooting of adrenaline in your IV. The dream you have in the coma will be like this movie. <br /> <br /> SUMMARY: A man appears at the door of a couple. He gives them a box with a button on it. Press the button, they'll get a million dollars cash and a person they don't know will die. I will try to spoil nothing, but from there things become so intertwined and complex and purely original that it will make you question your common sense. But hey, most of us have been healthy for a while and the change is good. <br /> <br /> PROS: Amazing storyline, overall good acting, not a slow moment when it is going. It questions human seldom questions that are rarely asked as ever in popular culture. This movie is deep, it has meaning. It's not summer stumps special effects fluff (not that something is wrong with it); this movie had a relatively low budget and it showed in some places. But I think it's maybe the thing that makes me look so much. CONS: The first twenty minutes before it goes, is really pretty slow. At the end of the movie you will be so confused that you just have to sit and think for a good half hour. I can guarantee that this movie will not get nice reviews from your peers or critics; It's too strange and there's no explosion three times. In fact, there are no explosions of any kind in this movie (except that your brain pops to try to understand exactly what the slope just happened). Personally, I don't think it's a bad thing, but a lot of will. <br /> <br /> RATING: Easy 9/10. I have never had an experience like watching this movie. The only reason I can't give it a 10/10 is that it's just wrapped up in itself. There are several great things that are inexplicable at the end that still bother me when I sit here. But overall, it's the best experience I've had in a kiosk long ago. But be warned, you won't like this movie if you can't sit back, turn your odds up to about 150%, and prepare your brain to do impressive acrobatics. <br /> <br /> Visit www. thestuffblag.com for more reviews
