Lady and the tramp ii: Scamp's adventure I think this is a good movie, but I think the first lady and the tramp movie are better, because it is the original and I think the original movies compared to the pads are better. Lady and the tramp ii descend to the original, but this time it is junior's turn, Lady and Tramp's youth (shield) hate is always treated with the things to do with him, according to the rules in the house, bathrooms take. The time and things are nice and easy, the shield gets angry and goes away with a pack of dogs being released. Scamp meets another dog named Angel, they both get well and do the things the lap's mother and father did, with an Italian meal (Spagetthi and Meatballs etc). After that, Scamp realized that he was loved by his family, especially his partner, who came back to the baby, and Angel joined the family. I give this movie 10 out of 10.
