Blind Spot's images are wonderful. The action pulls you in completely, even though the movie is a bit long. By the end credits are all you can think about the positive highs of the movie. The lead actors have the most incredible screen presence. The story is heartbreaking. The movie score is well underestimated. Completely moving in its own powerful way. Not your default melodramatic cuing. Trance-like moments add poetic resonance to the exciting narrative and tremendous visual compositions. Hope you get a chance to see this movie. It dives into a dark area, but you come out of the tunnel and see nothing but white light.
