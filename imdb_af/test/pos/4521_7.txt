This film is about a deadly venom that occurs in tiny glass sheets used to kill. This is apparently done to hide a espionage setting to steal plans for a new American bomber. Now much of this plot has been repeated in other Chan movies, THE JADE MASK and THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS. In addition, it was first used in MR. WONG, DETECTIVE - everyone has the explosive glass balls - a plot element that is obviously over-exploited. It was interesting in MURDER OVER NEW YORK, but at these later movies it was quite over. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, the rest of the movie was fresh and the plot worked out well. With a clever downfall where, of course, the culprit reveals itself. However, no airplane can fly the way this one did - especially in 1940. Such extreme dives and fast uphill were pretty stupid of this already outdated aircraft. By the way, in a small role as a porter, you see Frank Coghlan Jr. - The same actor Billy Batson played in the CAPTAIN MARVEL series. According to IMDb, Mr. Coughlan 93 years old and retired from the film industry.
