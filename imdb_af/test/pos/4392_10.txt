I thought this movie was fantastic! I saw it when it came out in the theaters, so I didn't remember all the details. I remember it's based on Homer's story on Odysseus. Names and events have changed, but you can still see the deal with the story. <br /> <br /> I found it funny how they would find themselves in trouble and how they would get themselves out of it. I really enjoyed this version of modernized old stories much better than the Romeo and Juliet with Clair Danes. <br /> <br /> I agree that in some parts of the story it gets too stupid, but all in all it's a great adventure with some great names actors.
