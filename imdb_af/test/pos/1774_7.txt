This movie was much better than I expected. ++++ Jean Peters actually does a pleasant job as a pirate and does decent work in her sword fighting. (As far as she can double the action, it's hard to tell ... but Peters himself does it well and does it well.) ++++ With a good and serious writing, it could be a great movie have been. But it's basically cheesy. Still entertaining. +++ Not a regular Jacques Tournier movie, but definitely above a regular Jean Peters movie. Color is typical of this' 50s period, ie. too crazy and not realistic. The actors for Blackbeard and her first mate and the drunk doctor were good. Louis Jordan was a little weak. I also don't think Debra Paget was right. But definitely Jean Peters and Debra Paget were probably the two leading female stars in the 50's.
