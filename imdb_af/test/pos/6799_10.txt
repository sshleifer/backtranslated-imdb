It's a beautiful movie. The screens are well depicted. Anne Revere's dialogues are very well written and inspiring. The philosophy and thoughts that make this movie and the things it teaches make it wonderful and wonderful. <br /> <br /> Mickey Rooney is big in the movie and his role goes through many emotional turmoil as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Taylor looks very beautiful, her plays in the film are inherently poetic, the way the camera follows her and the way the music makes you feel, makes every scene of her eaten beautiful. <br /> <br /> This movie has a good spirit and a beloved, valued classic. <br /> <br /> Angela Lansbury is quite amusing in her role though unrecognizable if you saw her in the role of 'm' in the Manchurian Candidate. <br /> <br /> Donald Crisp did his father's role of justice and the scripture gives him enough things to justify his role. <br /> <br /> It's a very nice movie and a must see for family and kids an evergreen Christmas favorite.
