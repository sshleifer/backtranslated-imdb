Smashing movie about film-making. Show the intense and strange relationships that can develop between directors and their actors; the manipulation and mind games; the preaching egoism of artists. As in any workplace, sexuality is complicated, but here to the nth grade while filming a sex scene. <br /> <br /> Absolutely fantastic performances by Gregoire Colin as the fragile, wannabe macho male head, and - Anne Parillaud as director's self-portrait. The image of her laughing and eating at the end of a banana, and finally getting what she wants from her dolls, is pure joy.
