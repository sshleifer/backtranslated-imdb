ABC's version of the late pope's life: They just put it slightly before CBS's version and it may have suffered, but the program itself was excellent. It was moving fast because it only had two hours (with ads including time) to cover this great man's long life, but Thomas Kretschmann was wonderful. He has done a remarkable job for the emotions and strife that John-Paul endures. Unlike the CBS biopsy, he played the role of the youth up to the age and seemed to be "realistic on both sides of the scale. His credibility never wavered. He has a tremendous variety and depth. It is a pity that the program could not have been longer and more detailed, but worked within the timeframe they had. I think they did an excellent job of putting it on the small screen.
