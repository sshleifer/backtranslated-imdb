When it comes to these ominous and incredibly small crime films, the kind that spins around characters border on the screen and live in an equally gorgeous environment. In addition, the waving and pale feel, thanks to beautiful, grotesque cinematography and a very black comedy. Dead bodies are the kind of movie Paul McGuigan wants. Unfortunately, the mad and sporadic Gangster No. 1 as well as the same over the shop, but interesting exercise in surrealism mixed with realism, the attempt titled The Acid House is the only one of us to go that far. Dead bodies are Robert Quinn's piece based on a Derek Landy script, a film that crosses the line between psychological horror and neo-noir. intermingling elements of crime and terror with themes related to morality and unnatural obsessive disorders. <br /> <br /> McGuigan's British crime efforts carry the rippling and distorted feelings, such as seeing someone's nightmare and having front seats in the process. His films are capable of being disgusted, some areas and entertainment in others are with their excessive and all-over-the-place approach. They carry a very dreamy sensitivity, despite being based on a very realistic, dried-up, funny world? the real world with so much emphasis on the horror and terror of the situations that haunt his characters than anything else. Dead bodies are a film that tackles both a somewhat offensive character-driven situation as well as a brief inclusion of a delicate psychological mindset study. Only here, the film balances both the eccentricity of its characters; the horror of the scenarios in which they find themselves and the much better morality problems. Dead bodies are effective and rather simplistic without ever feeling manipulative. The suggestive and knowing tendency to hammer home exactly what people think and feel does not detract from the experience. Early on, we meet Tommy McGann (Scott), a young boy whose friend Jean (Davis) dominates him, his life and the screen when she is in the short time. The point of being his lifestyle in a less than desirable home; With a stack of shelves and a partner with which he does not work well, it is clearly conveyed. Just like the way the audience is given, it is clear that Jean does not like Jean, with the bratty, spoiled and anticipated attitudes she so clearly possesses. Later, the film will remain on a police officer's face, as suspicions and tensions rise in what is clearly a cheap and easy way to tell the audience that our hero is not in trouble. <br /> <br /> Compare it to Gangster No. 1, in which the episodic and misleading approach McGuigan applies to the material; that an important, important plot point arises when a character is traced, leaving a building by someone else on a "random drive" in a scene that takes place several months after the previous one. The feeling is not as grounded or fulfilled. Dead bodies configuration is dominated by Kay Davis' Jean; A femme-lethal, but just itching to choose a fight of one kind or another, but just can't really find one. She led Tommy to jump through rings; Go there and do it without Tommy ever really responding the way he can, mainly because he is controlled by her promises of sex. The start builds some strain due to Tommy's underlined reaction to what's going on and culminates in a separate release when the initial incident occurs and Jean dies. <br /> <br /> If the setup is simple enough, then this is one thing, but the pinch of the project is the way Tommy decides to get Jean off his hands by burying her without tell her death a best friend. Things sharpened when it appeared, there was a second dead body in exactly the same place. Tommy buried Jean, with suspicion, denial and general trouble, the overall ingredients of the day. It is at this point that the film fades the lines between noir and horror; Indeed, Tommy lives earlier - a large, ominous, haunting and even Gothic house he shares with an older family member living in the upper parts of the house. It recalls memories of Hitchcock's 1960s movie Psycho and Bates's set-up he has with his mother and where she has been placed. Nor is it coincidental. This place of horror is the place for Jean's unfortunate ruin. <br /> <br /> Placing a dead body in the hands of the unfortunate male leader to act as the initial incident is a classic set-up for any noir; from Ulmer's 1945 film detour to a more recent, and more contemporary compared to Dead Bodies, 2006 movie entitled Big Nothing. What this film unfolds is a twisted; Quite unpredictable and rather terrifying story of genre hybridity and mind games have told a palette of clear drained visual arts. The voice-remains and the treading on the fine line that does the chapter for most of the film between right and wrong help push it into the neo-noir of the nose; Looking at the fact that the main thing is essentially innocent and its murder remuneration unfair, it is one thing, but its attitude towards Jean initially saw him without action and his cover of her death is the anti-thesis for the fall of the murder cost. Dead bodies are taught; Entertaining to look at without ever exploiting and offering a consistent tone to the boring physical and psychological content being investigated.
