A wonderful Christmas story about the moving theme of "Susie Homemaker finds her Inner Amazon." No, I'm serious! Geena Davis's amnesia begins to improve when she is hit on the head. From this familiar beginning we are moving in an unexpected direction. Good fit, good action, fun story, lots of explosions and chaos.
