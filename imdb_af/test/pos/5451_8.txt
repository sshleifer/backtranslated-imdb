Good movie, good story, great characters, I really enjoyed it, enough to buy the DVD when it came out. <br /> <br /> The real life story it pretends to tell is more engaging and exciting than the fixers could ever come up with. My friend in the media business said they shouldn't show such insider deals, it gave the business a bad name. As if. <br /> <br /> There are, however, some problems with the DVD: First, the volume of sound is very low, so you have to upload the TV volume to watch it. I can see that this is also the case when HBO does so, it is in the original production copy. Secondly, for about the first five minutes the left side of the video is cut, that is, the picture about one centimeter short of the left. After the five minutes it fills the screen well, left to right. Untidy technical production like this is very amateurish and I don't know why the director and producer leave such insomnia. <br /> <br /> Even with the technical flaws, it's a pleasant story, one of HBO's best I think.
