Steamboat Willy was not the first cartoon to use Mickey Mouse. The first film to die America's friend was "Plane Crazy". "Plane Crazy" was released on May 15, 1928 in Hollywood, California, in the silent movie format. "Steamboat Willy" was released on November 18, 1928 as a SOUND movie (it was also released on July 29, 1928 as a silent film). So "Steamboat .." makes Mickey's first SOUND movie but NOT the first movie for the little American Mouse. While many game shows used the question: "What was Mickey Mouse's first appearance?" The real answer is "Plane Crazy" not "Steamboat Willy". These dates can be at IMDb under "Release Dates".
