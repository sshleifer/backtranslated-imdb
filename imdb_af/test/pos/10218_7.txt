Clive Barker of Hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror movie that is funny and exciting. <br /> <br /> The make-up made by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic. It had quite an imagination to solve these mutants living underground. It was a real surprise to see the quality of the work. <br /> <br /> It wasn't particularly terrible, because the worst being was actually a human killer. <br /> <br /> I just saw Craig Sheffer in the shadow of doubt the other day and he also has a good job in this movie. Nothing spectacular, but fair. It was just Anne Bobby's third movie, and she was also good. <br /> <br /> The end was spectacular and the red cakes had only desserts as well as David Cronenberg. Ha!
