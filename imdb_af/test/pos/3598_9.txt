Forget all the people who tell you, it's not as good as the book. Approximately? It's a movie, though. It is a mere joy to watch, entirely in Cephallonia, fantastic photography, but also with dark, disturbing moments. The only problem I have is with the obvious failure of Nicolas Cage as Captain Corelli. In addition, the film was a very pleasant surprise.
