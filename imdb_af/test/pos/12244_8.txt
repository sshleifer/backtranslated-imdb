I loved this movie for the first time I saw it. It gives such a detail of what the executives involved in the news industry will only do to get a story on the air: especially Jane Craig, who runs Kenny to edit the piece to get it off, and then hit Joan Cusack struggles to get it in and Jane Hurt, who says Jane is an incredible violation of ethics, eats his tears during his date rape interview, an error pointed out by Aaron. Another high point is when Tom Jane uses his own benefits, and then turns around and sleeps with Jennifer. The writing is brilliant, and directing is almost as good. All three major actors were big in the portrayals of their characters, especially Holly Hunter, and Albert Brooks, who is the funniest in the film. William Hurt is also very good. It earns at least three Oscars, best actress (Holly Hunter), best supporting actor (Albert Brooks), and the best picture. I like the last parts of the movie where they seem to meet again 7 years later. <br /> <br /> 8/10
