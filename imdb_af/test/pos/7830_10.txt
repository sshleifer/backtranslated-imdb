It's one of the funniest movies ever made. And for those who don't, it's supposed to be funny. So often the comedies come so intentionally funny that they miss, but here is finally a movie that manages to be hilarious in the most subtle ways. Even "spoofs" lack the originality and natural feel of this movie. It's a comic classic that will surely be appreciated at another time when studios regularly do this sort of thing. kudos to the creators, and a hilariously subtle cast of actors, including Isaac Wade, whose performances are top-notch. Truly, a true outbreak star performance through a truly understated stage actor. It would be great to see this man get his debt.
