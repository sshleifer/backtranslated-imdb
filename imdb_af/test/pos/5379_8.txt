This is a flu moderate Gem with cold performances and a fantastic final! All the characters are great, and the story was great, and I thought the end was really cool! The plot was huge and it never bored me, plus while the child's actors were bad, they gave me the creeps. It happened on the space channel some time ago, so I decided to check it out and paste it, I read some good reviews from fellow horror supporters, I have to agree with them, It is very creepy and exciting, plus Strother Martin, was fantastic in his role, as Satan worshiped. It has a lot of creepy atmosphere, and it keeps you guessing, and all the characters are really nice and you really start to root with Ben and his family. It has very disturbing moments, and the movie suddenly shocked me, plus it's made very well on a low budget! It's a scary minor jewel, with cold performances and a fantastic final! I recommend this one! The direction is very good! Bernard McEveety does a very good job here, with a big camera work, creating a very creepy atmosphere and keeping the movie at a very fast pace! There is a little blood and gore. We get a cut bone, very bloody corpses, bloody slits, cuts and dicing, dapapitation and impaling. The Acting is excellent! Strong Martin is fantastic here! As Satan worships, he is extremely unpleasant, very convincing, was completely cold, was very intense, seemed to have enjoyed himself and just done a fantastic job in general! Charles Bateman is wonderful like Dad, he was very caring, very nice and gave a good performance! I liked him very much. L.Q. Jones is wonderful like the sheriff, he was funny, on top of things, looks very young, had a cool character, and has just a wonderful job overall! Done. Ahna Capri is good as a girlfriend and did what she had to do well. Charles Robinson passed to the extreme as the Priest and did not convince me once! And the laughter of her was especially bad. Geri Reischl is actually pretty like the girl, she was a little nice and just got on my nerves a few times, I'd rather love her. Alvy Moore was goofy, but very nice in his role as Tobey, I dug him! The rest of the throw is doing well. Overall, I highly recommend it! *** 1/2 out of 5
