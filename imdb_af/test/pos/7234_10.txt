This is the best movie I've ever seen. And I saw a lot. I'm not even a Troma fan. I've never heard of Troma before I watched this movie. <br /> <br /> I've already given hope to watch a good movie until I saw Tromeo and Juliet. This movie is a dream come true. Shakespeare will probably be proud of this modern adaptation of his classic. There is sex, violence, humor and satire. It breaks a lot of taboo. <br /> <br /> This movie is not disgusting or stupid. It is difficult to describe with words how clever, funny, exciting and witty this film is. The music is great and fits every scene. The characters are very credible and the acting is great. I really cared for the characters. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not just for Troma's fans. It is for all people who have a sense of humor and like smart and credible entertainment, as opposed to totally stupid and incredible mainstream movies who dare not do what this movie does. <br /> <br /> The bad reviews just prove that this movie is great and something exceptional. You also love or hate it. Like all true artworks, it is not understood and appreciated by all people.
