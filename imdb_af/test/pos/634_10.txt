In today's world of advertising and teenage cruelty and sensation, it is very rare that one gets a movie and can't think of it. Movies such as Psycho and Blair Witch, while in great excitement (both with great editions) are spoiled by the fact that we all know the best scenes and at least the plot before we see it. With Stupid Witness, a rare gift, I stumbled upon this movie and watched it, in the middle of the night scared, rude. I was afraid of the imminent Russian atmosphere, the snuff theme and the claustrophobic fate of the dumb and the fact that the (amusing, always leading to parable) characters could meet the end at any second. Since it's a low budget and scarce movie, we see it without any expectations. It also looks at Fay Ripley in a rare movie role, and prepares to be excited, scared and excited about totally unexpected ways.
