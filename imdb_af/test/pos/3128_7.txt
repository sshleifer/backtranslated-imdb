The Western can be divided into many sub-genres. One of the widest divisions is between Western and Plains Westerns. Most Westerns are a mix of both, but on one side of the spectrum you have photos like High Noon and Rio Bravo that are almost entirely in a settlement, which rarely falls into the right outdoors. On the other hand, you have Wagon Master, where there is almost a cottage in the middle of the desert. <br /> <br /> Director John Ford usually thrives on the "bit of both" Western and interiors with an emphasis on being small and intricate, and contrasting it with the wide open, exciting and exciting was dangerous. Wagon Master has a typical Frank Nugent script, with some interplay between seasoned parents and green youth, but it still offers Ford fresh challenges. In this picture, the dangers do not come from the hardness of the landscape, they come from the group in the form of the Cleggses. In addition, the absence of real indoor scenes means that the outdoors can lose its impact over time. <br /> <br /> But Ford was a real maestro when it had to manipulate space. He shoots screens from the camp or the wagons so that the frame is surrounded and we get the same envelope as we would in a real interior. Compared to its other Western, it does not open the space too much, because the wagon route turns its way through the canyons and passes, rather than crossing the sharp and empty plains. One of the few moments where he is throwing the landscape wide open is when the Indians are found and there is the possibility of an outside threat. <br /> <br /> Wagon Master offers some surprisingly effective moments of comic relief, and some great contributions from the peculiar cast. Harry Carey Jr. was forming a good actor like his father, and this is one of his better early roles. Joanne Dru was disappointing in She wore a Yellow Ribbon, but she looks more at ease than a character with a little sass, and is actually pretty good here. Jane Darwell, who won an Oscar in the John Ford-directed Grapes Wrath a decade earlier, appears here with the only function of performing a running gag in which she sounds a poor old horn. Yet, with her great timing and movement, she does the job. Francis Ford, in one of the dull dragon rolls he played in his little brother's photos, is at his best. <br /> <br /> Now we come to Ben Johnson. Although he was not a bad actor at all, he would never be a big star like John Wayne. And yet, with his effortless horse riding and easy going, he was one of the most authentic West players. And that brings me to my last point. It was apparently one of Ford's personal favorites, although it looks pretty unattractive. Wagon Master has no grand theme or dramatic intensity, it's just the genre that spells it out. I think that's what Ford loved about it. It's a picture for the Ben Johnsons and the Harry Carey Jrs, not John Waynes or the Henry Fondas. Small in size, but worthy of his class.
