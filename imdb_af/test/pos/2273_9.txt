I just saw "Everything is lit up" at the Telluride Film Festival. This is a remarkable movie. Very emotional, funny at times and heart warming. Bring your handkerchiefs! For those of you who enjoy a movie that brings tears to your eyes, I am reminded of the end of Babette's Feast and The Notebook. The stories were completely different, but had the same emotional power to bring tears into my eyes just as this movie did. <br /> <br /> No spoilers here. The summary is as described by IMDb, a young man's trip to Ukraine to follow his roots and find the town where his father grew up. <br /> <br /> The dialogue is in English and Ukrainian (and also Russian, I believe). It allows for some wonderful linguistic moments, as one character is more or less faithful to the English speaker in the group, depending on the circumstances. <br /> <br /> The scenery is wonderful and the musical score is a treat with wonderful Eastern European influences. Make sure you stay through the final tune credits. <br /> <br /> This is Lieve Schreiber's director debut and is well done. I give this movie a 9, one of the best movies I've seen long ago. I highly recommend it.
