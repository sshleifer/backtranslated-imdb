This movie is useless and will probably call children today, even though there is no Jedi in the whole thing. Of course, Elizabeth Taylor was the most beautiful child in the world and her acting is also wonderful. Even Mickey Rooney is good; so are Anne Revere and Angela Lansbury. The world was another place when this movie was released, and it's definitely a good place to visit.
