I'm a fan of Jeff Bridges, so I noticed it on DVD without seeing it before. I immediately became a fan of Kevin Spacey. <br /> <br /> My common plot of "alien human body" was killed after my experience, but I kept the approach taken in K-PAX. , which struck me so much different and much more sensitive than most. Bridges makes an excellent doctor (you want to * tell him what is in your mind) and Spacey's expressions and gestures are perfect in the role. <br /> <br /> The interaction between Prot and the completely human characters in the clinic is beautiful, especially the subtle manipulation of their behavior. <br /> <br /> The end is bittersweet. I like Prot's choice, but the final scenes (with Bridges) made me annoying.
