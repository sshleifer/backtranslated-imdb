15 PARK AVENUE is the address "Mithi / Mithali" (Konkona) is looking to start the movie. "Prof.Anu" (Shabhana Azmi) is Mithi's extremely caring and loving half-sister of Mithi's mother's earlier marriage. The film revolves around these characters and looks at the life of a schizophrenic patient (Mithi). The director tries to explain the imaginary world of Mithi to the viewer, through her continuous blabbering of Anu and others. <br /> <br /> Konkona doesn't earn one, but thousands of awards (I'm sure she'll get) for this version of Mithi in this movie. You can see the appearance of a patient written on her face through the hanging lips and sleeping eyes, from the first scene itself. Rahul Bose did a good job, but was reduced to half the film despite its importance in their lives. Watch out for intense relationships between the characters of the movie, Mithi & Anu, Anu & Anu's mother and between Anu & Sanjiv (Kanwaljit Singh). Shabhana Azmi, as usual, did a resounding performance to be remembered as the sister, who sacrificed her life for Mithi. <br /> <br /> The movie may not be your usual Hindi pot boiler, but can certainly make people look at the schizophrenic patients in a different light as a whole. <br /> <br /> As usual, Aparna Sen brings the movie to another endpoint rather than any clich√©, we may think. Beware of her, for this wonderful movie !!!
