OK, maybe it doesn't deserve an Oscar. Or a Golden Globe. Or any award, for that matter. The acting is not outstanding, there is no reason to give credits, and it is just another half-wave 21st-century pound that most people will consider properly. Or maybe even scary. But I think it's not a bit of a matter. And that's because I had a good time watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Sure, the first 40 minutes are pretty slow, but as the movie progresses, there will be something in you that you want, if you were like me, and anyone else should be if you watch this movie . And this is: looking for 2 hours of fun, senseless violence. Yes, there are many mistakes in this movie, but don't let the castel list on the cover cheat you. Hilton delivers a decent performance that no one has seen. Even her biggest haters like me and my friends had to agree that she surprised us very much with her scarce credible acting skills and a striptease that wasn't as nasty as her online pop-up would promise, but still not so unbearable to fast or turn off the DVD. <br /> <br /> The violence in this surprised me; no one at school or on the horror board talked about it, as they were about this new movie called 'Saw' and 'Hostel', but I could safely say that "Wax" was more graphical than Saw, and some deaths are actually much upsetting. <br /> <br /> Finally, I'm not surprised. House of Wax didn't make a place on the IMDb Top 250, but it's definitely worth a look.
