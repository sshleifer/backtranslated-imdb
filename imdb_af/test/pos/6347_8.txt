not a masterpiece of Larry Mcmurty, but it stands alone as a good western, one of the lonely pigeons. Who ever plays the role of Woodrow call is an excellent representation in their own style. It's also easy to see that they wanted to use it as a stepping stone for the V-series (both version) and that the authors knew how to keep the taste alive. William Peterson was wonderful in this, the geeky CSI man is not the character he plays in - this man can do everything it looks <br /> <br /> it is deserved to be enjoyed by those who enjoy Western <br> /> <br /> 4out5 stars
