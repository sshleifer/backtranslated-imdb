I loved this movie very much - not so much for the story (it was okay, but it was slightly slow in places), but the wonderful beautiful scenery of Greece and the Greek islands! Susan Sarandon is totally encouraging as the carefree love interest of John Cassavetes - a man "on the edge". But the scenery! Oh, oh oh!
