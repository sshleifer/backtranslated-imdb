Looking back at Alfred Hitchcock's career, it never gets surprising how such a brilliant and visionary man could be sufficiently recognized for how revolutionary he was for the film industry. This is probably a sign of how before his time Hitchcock was, always trying to print the envelope, and never with a movie made easy to entertain, but always with a deeper, more striking motive on his mind. Aliens on a train, one of Hitchcock's first and more underlined hits, is a perfect example of these features - an entertaining and exciting story, even though it was seen more than 50 years later. Yes, but so meticulously and intelligently built, it stands today as a masterpiece. in movie technique. <br /> <br /> Probably, one of the pioneering stressers, Strangers on a Train, may be slightly dated in some respects, but it both retains brand new tensions as it fell back in 1951. slightly less shocking). The brilliant use of cinematography and lighting, as well as fast, careful editing, really makes it a movie and captures every possible voltage spot and keeps the audience's focus even in slower scenes. If ever there was any doubt about what a simple masterpiece filmmaker Hitchcock was, it was just enough to watch five minutes of strangers on a train. Each shot is so carefully selected and erected, all of which serve to manage the storyline in a very innovative way. Unfortunately, there are certain moments in the story that are appropriate to keep our focus away from the excellent cinematography and editing. Bruno can reach to the bottom of a sewer. It's simply incredible, and the figure of a stereotypical old man crawling under a wild-out-of-the-wheel carousel offers unintentional comic relief intended to be the movie's most tense and enticing scene. It is only short moments, but they are enough to look as painfully weak in an otherwise star film. <br /> <br /> But what really stands out for a stranger on a train is the story prospect. Since Hollywood movies are running late, there is a risk of falling indefinitely into the fair of turgid cliché after cliché, it is wonderfully refreshing to see a 50-year-old movie featuring a performance that is so clever and original . Certainly, it's pretty simple, but the concept of "swapping murders" is simply one that wouldn't fly into movies of today's day and age. This makes it more and more entertaining to watch; The movie's brilliant screenplay keeps the action fast while we have been giving some wonderful memories. One cannot help seeing the deeper themes, but also Hitchcock, especially the concept of "darkness in man's heart," showed that elderly ladies are fascinated and excited about the prospect of murder, as well as Bruno's own cavalier attitude towards death. Hitch also works in many moments of dark humor (Bruno who strikes a child's balloon with his cigarette is valuable), and irony, shooting exciting scenes in happy, easy environments, such as the iconic carnival scenes, to an even more ominous create atmosphere. . It may be a tension player, yes, but hiding the brain is simply unacceptable. <br /> <br /> The antagonistic figure of Bruno (led by Robert Walker to perverse perfection, is unhappy in his last film role, but the film of his highly talented fellow cast members is easy to steal). On a train so memorable, because the character is a wonder to see. Here we just have a beautifully crafted villainous figure, the more intricate how easy and unattractive he looks. Instead of being crazy and stopping the hero at every possible moment, Bruno is a calm, controlled, psychotic mess. He speaks of murder in such an expectant tone, but retains a passionate glow in his eye when discussing various ways of killing people. Bruno can imagine the Id, as Freud would suggest, the inner, darker and unobstructed aspects of humanity. It makes an interesting contrast to hero figures, Guy Haines, and how blatantly and uninteresting he seems, almost as if to envision the evil being much more interesting and attractive than constantly striving to do the right thing. <br /> <br /> Despite this implied message, Hitch nevertheless turns our emotions enough to root Guy every time, and encourages every new obstacle he has forced to overcome. This is a will for the actor Farley Granger's talent, which despite Robert Walker's villain makes the performance easy to steal, Granger's hero still appears so sympathetic. We recommend our support even if we fall prey to a much less compelling character. Excellent support is provided by Ruth Roman, who manages to overcome the cliché and be a more innovative and complex romantic interest. Kasey Rogers gives a stunning performance as Guy's terribly manipulative and hedonistic first wife, and Patricia Hitchcock, proving that she is much more. talented as just being "the director's daughter". The excellent movie (led by a wonderful Walker) brings the film to life and adds so much value to the movie as just Hitchcock's breathtaking stylistics. <br /> <br /> Overall, aliens on a train can still appear to some viewers so slightly, but it is still a shock as modern and attractive to contemporary audiences as it is half a century ago. released. . Hitchcock once again proves his unparalleled mastery of excitement and filming. The surprisingly original and enjoyable presentation of the movie is worth the effort alone. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to undertake a brilliant but wonderfully entertaining movie experience! <br /> <br /> -9/10
