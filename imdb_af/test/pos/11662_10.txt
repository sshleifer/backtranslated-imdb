How do you know if a movie is good or not? This is the impact it has on you that makes the difference. "Dead Man Walking" upset me a lot. I watched it twice. I don't know if I will be strong enough to look at it again. No, I didn't feel at all when I looked at it, but the movie was as successful as it could be. <br /> <br /> Robbins did a good job of incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic. He avoided making an argument that could easily be considered biased or subjective. I hope many people will see "Dead Man Walking". I believe anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty should see the film so enthusiastically. <br /> <br /> I don't know what else can be to ultimately convince everyone that this ancient era is not a place in modern society. <br /> <br /> The movie itself does not make an argument for or against death penalty. It describes reality. The reality is the best argument against the death penalty. <br /> <br /> a great feature for great performances, good movies and the most important movie made in years. <br /> <br /> Thanks, Tim Robbins! <br /> <br />
