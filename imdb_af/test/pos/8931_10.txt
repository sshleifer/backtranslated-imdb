Well, my dad drove Lee Evans back and forth to see the hotels so I had to see something. It's a brilliant movie! Bob Pugh walked past a shed with a lawnmower and he accidentally let go and it went into a fence and he fell over. <br /> <br /> Lee Evans was funny as he saw me saying you were cold. I said yes and he said, throw your hands in your pockets! I think it was really funny and it would be a well-known comedy. Like every other Lee Evans movie! They were very good people. they were quite polite and funny. I want to meet them one day. Brenda Blethyn walked out of her caravan with blood under her and twigs in her messy hair and I was really scared because I didn't notice her until she was right behind me
