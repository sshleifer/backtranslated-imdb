"All men are guilty," said the head of police. "They were born innocent, but it didn't last." Add this little nihilism to Jean-Pierre Melville's fascination with the idea of ​​the scandal of honor and you have Le Cercle Rouge. However, this first code among crooks is not just a cliché; This is an imagination of the imagination, even when film-moralists - realistic moralists by their point of view, romantic moralists by most - begin to make movies about the subject. Their theme is that it is not what you do, but how you do it. We usually come up with stories about experienced men with their own honor, stories where fate, fatalism and code do. <br /> <br /> For most of mankind, except writers and film directors, it will seriously get in the way of living your life, raising your children, and being a good friend. This manipulated fatalism is something of a self-indulgent idea. Le Cercle Rouge is, in my opinion, a classic movie for people who can secretly enjoy the adventure of just missing the last bus house. But where Melville's Le Samourai criterion collection is, in my opinion, style-dominant storyline, Le Cercle Rouge manages the great combination of style with a strong story and compelling actors. The point of the movie is in my opinion nonsense ... but the movie itself is a first-rate experience. <br /> <br /> Melville's hopeless story of three crooks - Cory (Alain Delon), Bird (Gian-Maria Volonte) and Jansen (Yves Montand) - is based on a little bit of wisdom attributed to the Buddha : That all people who are destined to meet, want ... with their fate they can't change. Perhaps, because some believe Melville himself has sustained the wording, if not the thought. Anyway, we know right from the start that this movie will not end happily, will depend on the fate and coincidence to set things up for us and let us reveal the nihilistic philosophies that we discover and loved when we was in high school. Once Corey and Vogel meet and then gather in Jansen's unique talents, we are on a one-way trip to rob an exclusive, highly protected jewelery story at Place Vendome. The tension arises because we not only know that French police are after Vogel, we also realize that some determined crooks are after Corey. <br /> <br /> The great pleasure of the movie was the admiration of the work that Delon, Volonte and Montand brought to their characters, and the intelligent ruthlessness that Andre Bouvril brought to his character, Mattei police chief . Melville chopped me when he developed these characters and their own situations; He built me ​​emotionally and then released me when he brought me to appreciate their probable fate and let me see it happened. Melville establishes his set pieces - the escape from the train, the escape from the forest, the later shootings in the forest, the encounters with Mattei and a man who refuses to inform - with interesting possibilities. He builds tension in all these cases by taking his time; a rare feature in film making and an equally scarce feature now. And Melville takes the time to build Mattei as an individual. Mattei is a reasonable, experienced man. He is a loner. He has a fixed routine when he returns to his apartment. He greeted his three cats lovingly, he pulled his bath and while the bath was full, he gave them food. I don't know who Mattei is destined to meet, but I hope this is someone who loves cats. <br /> <br /> Nihilism is always fashionable among some creative people and some critics. In most cases, I think it is a much harder task to set aside nihilism and just to live one's life without harming too many people. (And it's even more challenging to show compelling in a movie.) Le Cercle Rouge is a movie that tells me little, but it's in its own way, a beautifully composed movie.
