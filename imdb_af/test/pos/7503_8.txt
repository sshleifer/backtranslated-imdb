George C. Scott also gives his best and funniest with wonderful drama in this Paddy Chayefsky script. Princess Rigg is attractive and quite the intricate young woman. This film hangs between the tragedy and chaos in a New York hospital in the late 60's with staggering effects. Barnard Hughes is also nice as always (also a big stage actor). <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10. Best Show = George C. Scott. Chayesfsky was a big hit when he was sitting Vanessa Redgrave at the 1978 Academy Award ceremony, but he is a good writer. A true ensemble role that works wonders, to the smallest role. It won the best script at Oscars and Scott was nominated. He had won it the previous year instead of PATTON (which he was also brilliant). Find it out!
