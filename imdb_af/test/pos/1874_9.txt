Now the sci-fi channel original company has made some nice crappy movies (House of the Dead 2, All Souls Day, etc.). But if you have left the job altogether, the frightened master actor / writer and now director, Bruce Campbell, gets you one of the best damn made for TV independent horror movies ever made! I usually hate these movies, in my previous review, House of the Dead 2, I couldn't believe how horrible the movie was! But somehow I have a nice feeling for this movie, a very good taste for this movie. The violence is good and so is the black comedy in the movie and I recommend you get it, a real Bruce Campbell masterpiece! Well, since there are only a few more lines left, I can say what I want about this movie: IJAJKASIF JHJDJ NXD FNEHSD FHNCFNFVHS DJKEALJWSNS.
