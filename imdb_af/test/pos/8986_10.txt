I caught it on TV several times in the late 1970s. It is only played late at night. </ P> <br /> <br /> Peter Lorre plays a kind, happy man whose face is defeated in a fire. He is rejected by his girlfriend and left alone and in despair. He turns into a life of crime and eventually becomes very successful. He makes a mask to hide his mutilated traits and falls in love with a beautiful girl (Evelyn Keyes) ... who's blind! He tried straight to her ... but he couldn't escape his life of crime or his hatred of his own colored face. <br /> <br /> No budget B movie. Very short (just a little more than an hour) but well made and wonderful by Lorre. It has much more depth than you would expect from a quick B picture. Anchors especially take the ungrateful "girl" role and make her character fresh and attractive. Unfortunately, it has disappeared from TV and has never been placed on video or DVD (as far as I know). TCM recently showed it and it was great to see the movie still stop. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
