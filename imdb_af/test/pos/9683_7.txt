Despite the apparent structural similarity to The Simpsons - Family Fat, housewife mom, 3 kids, a pet, typical suburban home, Family Guy is actually functional and stylistic towards The Simpsons. The keen use (and sometimes too much) of cutaway gags has been the main residence since its first season. While some hit the nail on the head (the Rhea Perlman and Danny Devito bit in Season 5 are disgusting), others are less successful. And they can be annoying, especially if they don't advance the story line. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Stewie and Brian Griffin lends itself to pure comedy gold, so much so that Chris and Meg can only fulfill the role of compulsory teens in the role of compulsory teens. Your typical dysfunctional family. <br /> <br /> The feature film, Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, is horrible. Thanks, it went straight to DVD. <br /> <br /> Unlike difficult comparisons with the perennial Simpsons, Seth Macfarlane's approach to Family Guy is actually very different - it is far more politically wrong and incredible, much more brazen. <br /> <br /> Creator of Ren and Stimpy, John Kricfalusi, criticized Family Guy for having "extremely low" graphic standards from a cartoonist's point of view. I don't think it looks so bad, but the detail and accuracy of some of the spoofs is quite successful. <br /> <br /> All in all, a huge range to deal with a big big bowl of chips that have thrashed Ranch sauce and ass jokes.
