It's a beautiful but simple movie about one man, driven to find an answer, an answer he doesn't necessarily need, but has structured his whole life. It's heartbreaking, it's hilarious, it's glorious, it's torment, it's delicate and dynamic. I say this is genius. <br /> <br /> I read Jonathan Safran Foer's book. Everything was relieved (mainly because I heard Elijah Wood was the lead in the movie adaptation), and I was only surprised by the characters. I laughed more than once aloud. And every time someone talks about what it's about, I hear the same crumpled response, almost like one big word: "It's a good thing to look for the future of the world." Yet this story is so philosophical; it goes deeper than that. That talk about the ring and "in case." It really gets one thought. Suddenly, this story coincides with a simple quest for inner metamorphosis, and I find myself a little different now. I recommend renting it before it is ever read, because the book has many obscene, straight-twisted stories not included in the movie, mainly the history of Jonathan's family that was not needed for the film. <br /> <br /> A little trivia, I heard, is that Wood's current friend has a cameo in this movie as the drummer in the band that Alex arranged to perform like Jonathan from the train in Ukraine. <br /> <br /> You spend half the movie trying to figure out what it's about, exactly, and what Jonathan is about, because his character is being pulled back like a turtle in a shell. <br /> <br /> is beautiful, and in my opinion, one of Elia Wood's best movies.
