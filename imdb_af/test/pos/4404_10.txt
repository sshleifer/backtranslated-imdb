Thank you for the Coen Brothers. Their success brought them bigger budgets, but didn't get rid of their creativity. I planned to see another movie, but it's sold out, so I went here earlier. By the time it started, I forgot what movie I was there to watch. I was surprised in more ways than one. This movie is hilarious, but they don't make cheap jokes just to get the laugh. The writing is brilliant, and George Clooney delivered with great skill. Then nobody can say he is just a pretty face and the rest of the role. It can be appreciated at many levels, whether you remember the Odyssey or not. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that was smart. I saw others who I would describe as beautiful, intriguing, funny and charming, also describing "O Brother", but this movie reminded me of older seinfeld episodes that all the subplots eventually came together. You can feel their journey build up to something, but you can't say what. And the Coen brothers fail us, the end is definitely not disappointing. It's amazing and neatly binds all the loose points without spreading the story.
