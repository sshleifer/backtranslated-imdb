Undoubtedly one of the best episodes ever, the balance of terror is 45 minutes of well-executed tension, with intelligent real-world parallels (the title refers to a situation very similar to what is going on between the US and the Soviet Union during the Cold War), spot-on characterization and the launch of Star Trek's second major hostile alien race to the Klingons: the Romulans. <br /> <br /> After receiving an emergency call from a Federation Outpost, the business is dangerously close to the Neutral Zone which, if crossed, would lead to open conflict with the Romulane, although no one actually saw them does not have the flesh Soon a Romulan vessel arrives, with a new weapon and a cover that makes it almost impossible to defeat.
