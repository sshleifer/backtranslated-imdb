OK, so this movie may not have won Oscars, but it is not a bad movie. The original "D.O.A." is undoubtedly a better movie, but that doesn't mean that this movie is bad. <br /> <br /> The movie stars Dennis Quaid in one of his early roles, when he first became famous, after "The Right Stuff" made him a star and a very beautiful Meg Ryan. she was still very well known. <br /> <br /> It's more of an "update" of the 1950 movie, rather than a remake, since the setting is different and the characters too, are different. The plot is almost the same. A man (this time an English professor at the University of Texas in Austin) is poisoned and has only 24 hours to find out who poisoned him and why. Meg Ryan plays a young college student trying to help him. Jane Kaczmarek plays Quaid's estranged wife, in a low key but intense performance; She steals every scene she is in. Daniel Stern (also in an early role, before "Home Alone" announced him) plays Quaid's colleague. Charlotte Rampling is also good at a supporting role. <br /> <br /> What's more, the whole role is. The film is stylish, with a quick fit that makes you guess until the end. <br /> <br /> I think it's a movie that's definitely worth watching as a thriller, and as a modern version of a classic movie.
