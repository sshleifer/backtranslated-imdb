The first time I saw this movie, I wanted so many reasons, but I simply didn't do it. It was just a little dull. But there was a little question I had about something I saw near the beginning of the movie, so I watched it again? and then it finally clicked for me. I watched the movie for the first time knowing the "surprising end" and I would definitely not recommend the end to you. I still enjoyed most of the movie and discovered the many seemingly insignificant events that unravel everyone to show on a very sinister scheme. <br /> <br /> I don't think everyone will love this movie, or even like that. If you like any of the actors, you will keep this movie, because the acting is pretty strong and they all get a lot of screen time. If you like mystery (namely Hitchcock), you'll love this movie. If you like independent or psychological movies, you'll love this movie. It really worked for me at all levels. If you don't like the actors, mysterious plots or psychological elements, you might not like this movie. But this is your loss. Personally, the only thing that irritated me a bit was the accent. Good try, Alan Rickman, on the American dialect, but it wasn't much improvement on the scene in Die Hard. (The wonderful voice, however, is for the strange accent.) The spectacle of accents in the movie was a bit strange, but it was not so distracting that it became difficult or particularly annoying. Also the camera changed from scene to scene was clear and can bother some people, but I actually think it's added to the scenes (or scene? I can only remember one scene where the change was very different, but it worked) . <br /> <br /> If you watch this movie, see it at least twice. The second time you see it, I hope you realize how complicated the plot really is. Every time I watch this movie (it's less than one and a half hours, so many views are not difficult). I look something else about it and find my wonder, "Why did it just happen?" or "Was it intentional?" I like movies that make me think. This one does. So it just doesn't. Two times.
