Human traffic is without a doubt the most original and compelling movie I have ever seen. It documents 2 days in the lives of a group of young people, bored with their everyday existence and dead-end work, and takes the ecstasy on the weekend. It is hilariously funny and extremely sad, and at times very sad. In the same genre as 'Trainspotting' it has a good soundtrack and is a hot, rising British star. The film was made on a minimal budget and I look forward to future presentations by writer / director Justin Kerrigan when his talent is discovered by the major filmmakers.
