"Jaded" should not be considered an erotic thriller, because the sex scene is not considered fun, as opposed to movies such as "Immature Behavior" or "Friend of the Family". <br /> <br /> "Jaded" is not an easy look, as this story is difficult to conceive and is not so common in society. From the start of the movie, with the first scene, you expect more powerful scenes. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the rape scene was not a well-created scene. I think the director didn't use proper camera techniques at all. Therefore, it sometimes seems boring and almost touches the end. <br /> <br /> The performances are extremely good for all five female characters. These women have strong, intense but credible actions that demonstrate the actress's dramatic abilities. <br /> <br /> The legal concepts helped a lot to understand the plot's problems because the legal term of sodomy differs from a simple rape. From the point of view of Meg's defense, sodomy must be penalized as a rape (a major crime grade B), although it is another crime. Pat and Alex's defense claims Meg enjoys and asked. This is where the movie becomes interesting to see who is trying to tell the truth. The only thing is sure that the sex scene fits into a legal definition of a crime. <br /> <br /> See "Jaded" if you like legal issues that aren't very common in your society. If not, try it, because it is a very good and strong drama.
