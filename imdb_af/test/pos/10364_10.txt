In my work with the only nationwide non-profit organization, Security On Campus, Inc. dedicated solely to the prevention of college campus crime prevention and student awareness, I too often see the kind of campus violence and "cover-up" by secrets campus courts depicted in the movie 'Silencing Mary.' In fact, every month we receive numerous calls and requests for information from campus reporters such as "Mary" who experience similar situations. <br /> <br /> The depiction of a campus rape and the subsequent crusade by Mary, the victim's roommate and a student journalist played very well by Melissa Joan Hart, because justice was done very well and accurately researched. <br /> <br /> It was the first television movie I ever saw that I really reflected and applied. All the various complex issues associated with how rape and other violent crimes are dealt with on our nation's college and university campuses. Although it would not be possible to handle all of these problems in depth for 2 hours, this movie came closer than anyone else I saw.
