I heard they will relive this French classical music in 2007 and I see it is in development for 2011. It will be a shame because Hollywood kicks author / director Jules Dassin out of the infamous blacklist. They should not have the right to recover any of their films. <br /> <br /> I love "caper" movies and "film noir", combining the best of both. <br /> <br /> Tony (Jean Servais) comes out for a nickel, and after beating his old friend Marie Sabouret, he plans a big score with his friends Mario (Robert Manuel) and Jo ( Carl MÃ¶hner). What makes it a great hairdresser Flick is paying attention to detail in planning the robbery. You see it reflected in the George Clooney Vegas hijackers. Nothing is left to chance. <br /> <br /> The captain goes well, but Grutter (Marcel Lupovici) sends his sons, Robert Hossein and Pierre Grasset to Tony and the gang. After blasting it with Mario, they kidnap Jo's son. Many bullets fly before it is over. <br /> <br /> A good movie by a good director. The standard by which other caper films are measured.
