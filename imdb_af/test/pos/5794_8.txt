Little Vera is the story of a Russian teenager, her family, and her efforts to find meaning and value in a lifelong decline. In her quest for meaning, she falls in love with a more intellectual and rebellious Sergei, whose hatred for her deeply defective parents is quickly out of control. <br /> <br /> Little Vera is shocking and upset at almost every way. The father's drinking, the empowerment and lack of understanding of the mother, the accidental lies and misdemeanor of the brother, and Vera herself forgiving all their mistakes, are all shocking and disturbing to look at. But the raw honesty of the movie somehow succeeds in becoming even more shocking than the plot or characters. Klein Vera has placed a very different view of Soviet life than has ever been seen, in tight spaces and great urban decay. In fact, Little Vera is a portrait of the collapse of Soviet society painted in shades of pain, despair and rust. It's the implosion of a family set against the implosion of a whole social order. <br /> <br /> Although painful and desperate is unsatisfactory, the movie itself is definitely worth seeing, rather than just understanding the feelings and cultures Russia is still changing. today.
