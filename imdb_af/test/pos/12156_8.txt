"More", perhaps, is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack created by Pink Floyd. In 1969 they were not superstars. Actually they made an album with the movie music, no fan can miss it! <br /> <br /> But it's also the first film by German-French director Barbet Schroeder: it's a cult movie. When released, censorship cuts a lot of sections and drugs everywhere. It is also one of the first films to explicitly treat the theme of drug slavery. <br /> <br /> A German boy travels to Paris and meets an American girl: they fall in love. Together they look for sun and exoticism. But it is too high a love: she puts him in drugs. <br /> <br /> In the Sixties anti-drug campaigns were not like today, there wasn't much information. On the contrary, in many millions who used drugs, it was a kind of spiritual experience. It is therefore surprising to see a film of that period describing a nightmare heroin experience. <br /> <br /> The movie is simple, not vulgar, and shoots in a "cinema verite" style. Actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Gr√ºnberg are very convincing. "More" is a document of the late sixties - and also a document of the end of the hippies illusions.
