I watched the show for about 6 months religiously (maybe longer but not much). I was very indignant with Olivia and I found Kevin to be very greasy and the repertoire between them very good. Lately it has started to be thin due to many factors for me. First, my favorite segment is the first 15 minutes called Around The Net, which shows 5 video clips that you find on a website like Youtube, which is generally funny or people are accidentally hurt. Umm, this time when I watched 4 to 5 times a week, I show the same things again, I really didn't see anything so good and I can just laugh at people, actually break their necks and get paralyzed. The show is like a late show / Colbert Report also wants to be with his politics, if you do not live in a blue state and are not an automatic liberal, this humor is also old, McCain is old, yes yes, whatever. Lips have no gap to entertain themselves, as they are not smart enough to realize that they will treat themselves as a sense of humor, so they can laugh at themselves, so it's almost every show bash McCain or Palin, SHEESH. So we get the same old vids of people who are hurt, what we are supposed to do and then some leftist political humor that never laughs at its own weakness. I'll keep looking as I look at work and that's all about, hoping I'll be entertained, but it's getting a bit old. I looked like the host of Chris and Alison had been completed, but they were actually a good fit. Maybe this display can do a rotating host. Olivia I thought at times at first was really funny, responding to this constant pouting and getting old, lol. 7 out of 10; It will keep you in a young mindset that is good if you are a younger Baby Boomer like me (mid 40's). Perhaps a cartoon of the day is another segment they have to do, there are a lot of stuff they can use.
