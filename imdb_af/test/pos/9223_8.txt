I only saw this movie when I was very little. I was born in 1985, so it was about the age when 80's cartoons were great. One day my mother tied it up and thought I might like it. I have never heard of the Rainbow Bright TV show before I was introduced to the movie. When I saw it (on one of those old BETA tapes ...) I loved it. I became addicted. There are people who say it is poorly written and everything, but it is a child's movie, and such things do not matter much to children. I loved the story and especially loved the songs and all the female characters. Of course, I pretended to be them, and in the scene where Rainbow first met Krys and they were apostate, they had to work with the opposite sex, I could totally relate. The story was the basic good vs. evil that children enjoy, and there were plenty of happy moments to balance the terrorists. The world is a fantastic place that will stimulate the imagination of a young child. I am very glad I had the opportunity to see this movie when I was little. It had a huge impact and now looks back on happy childhood memories. I would recommend to any parent with young children to rent this movie. This will activate their imagination and provide lots of entertainment. You are but one child once, don't let them miss this one!
