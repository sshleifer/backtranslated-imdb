Typically, I'm a comedy man. I rented it from the video store under comedy, and thought "Albert Brooks! Awesome!" and rent it. It looked like the romantic comedy, and I remembered hating it, and had the full mindset to hate this movie. <br /> <br /> Boy, was I wrong. <br /> <br /> While it's a romantic comedy, it's dealt with an incredible lead and supporting role (Brooks, Hunter, Cusack and Nicholson), and everything works well within itself. The script really sounds and not forced, as it can happen in the news station you are watching at night. It takes your emotions and makes you enjoy Hunter and Brooks, and makes a bit of Hurt, which makes the end a bit unappealing and fruitless, but it shows how you don't need a happy ending to end a movie no. You just need a true end. is what everyone has. Not everyone's life ends well, and it shows in Broadcast News. Maybe people don't like the end because it's not your typical happy ending associated with romantic comedies ... but it works, it's really, and it's genius. Broadcast News is a classic in time, and a fine romance movie out there with 'Casablanca'. Well, maybe not so high, but that's the only other romance I can think of. <br /> <br /> Broadcast News: 9/10.
