It's a funny movie and I love it a lot. Cary Elwes plays Robin Hood to a tea. This is, of course, the usual good against evil with Robin against the evil Sheriff of Nottingham. The humor is in your face for the most part, but still works well. A night-time comedy when you don't want to think much, it's worth it to win a rental!
