It was an excellent movie with good acting and it keeps your attention to the end. Maybe people are either tired or uncomfortable with the subject and that's why it's so much. It can also be too deep for many viewers out there who give higher ratings to movies like the US Pie Series. <br /> <br /> Jake Gyllenhaal is a CIA analyst, not an agent, questioning an Egyptian man by Morocco, not Egyptians. He is not supposed to be a tough agent and therefore comes out as naive of the interrogation techniques used. It's more credible than being an "old hat". <br /> <br /> The story goes a bit around and can be confusing, but it also keeps you focused on what's going on until the end when everything comes together as the puzzle falls into place. The supporting actors helped a good job wearing the movie. I found the movie powerful and thoughtful.
