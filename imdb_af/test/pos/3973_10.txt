In this thinking I went to another brutal movie with brutal humor. From my first sentence I don't tell that humor and this movie had moments, but I loved it. Justin Long never really did comedy like this, where he was sarcastic and clever and I loved it. Lewis Black .... said enough. I really loved the end because it had to take himself seriously. I mean how else would you end it? Yes, this is another story, but not in your typical format and the movie was not up and down. It was people who came together for one common purpose, to go to college where they were accepted. The role play was wonderful and yes, I laughed aloud when I didn't think I would and the laugh lasted longer than I thought. The parents and sisters played their roles well, but their characters are brought in when needed. The movie wasn't focused around them, but at the same time they arrived when they expected and didn't expect. They played very well, and I loved the famous faces Anthony Heald (Boston Public), Jeremy Howard (I) (Galaxy Quest with Justin Long), Ross Patterson (The New Guy) and Sam Horrigan (Brink). Blake Lively added her to the movie that made it even nicer, as well as B's friends. I recommend this movie to anyone who has hated the brutal comedies for the past 4 years and really wants something with humor and a real story line! ~!
