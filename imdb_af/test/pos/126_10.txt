Contains "SPOILER" INFORMATION. Look at these directors' other movie "Earth" at some point. It's a better movie, but this one is not bad just different. <br /> <br /> A rare feminist view of an Indian movie maker. Tradition, rituals, duties, secrets, and portrayal of strict gender roles make it an engaging and culturally dynamic film show experience. All the married characters lack the "fire" of the wedding bed with their respective spouses. One man is celibate and commits a form of spiritual "adultery" by giving all his love, honor, time and respect for his religious swami (guru). His wife is lonely and longs for intimacy and tenderness that she eventually finds with her cloned lesbian sister living in her home with her treacherous husband. This treacherous man is openly in love with his Chinese mistress, but was forced into marriage with a non-known reader. They only have sex once when their toddler lesbian loses her virginity. <br /> <br /> A servant lives in the house and he finally reveals the secret that the two women lovers are. Another important character is the elderly matriarch who cannot speak or care for herself because of a stroke. However, she uses a lazy clock to communicate her needs, as well as her dissatisfaction with the family. She lets them know by her bell or by beating her fist that she knows wonderfully what's going on in the house and how much she disapproves. <br /> <br /> In the end, the truth comes out about everyone and the two female lovers end up with each other. But not before is there an emotional scene between the swami-addicted man and his earlier straight wife. Her sari catches fire and initially we think she is going to die. However, we see the two women united in the last scene of the movie. <br /> <br /> The author / director of this film challenges her culture's traditions, but she shows us individual people trapped by their culture and gender. We really care about the characters and we don't see them as stereotypes. Everyone surprised us with their humanity, vulgarity, tenderness, anger and spirit.
