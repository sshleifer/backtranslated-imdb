Ernst Lubitsch has our great films such as Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop around the Corner, Being or not, and other great movies. But People usually put Bluebeard's eighth wife as one of Lubitsch's worst movies. <br /> <br /> But I see this movie as a major movie. This film began the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder, and Walter Reisch wrote the script for Ernst Lubitsch's Ninotchka. Of the course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the dissertation process. Then Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. Together they wrote the screenplay for famous films such as The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd. <br /> <br /> There are many funny moments in the movie. I thought "The Taming of the Shrew" was very funny. There is a well-known expression called "Movies Are Cuts of Life." And here's a good example of Bluebeard's eighth wife (1938). <br /> <br /> At the first session of the writing process, Lubitsch asked this question: how did the boy and girl come together? Billy Wilder immediately suggested that the opening tone be the department store's men's shop. "The boy is trying to buy a pajama," he made slippery. "But he only sleeps in the top. He is thrifty, so he insists on just buying the tops. The clerk says he must also buy the pants. It looks like a catastrophe. Then the girl comes in the store and buy the pants because she sleeps only in the pants. "Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were enchanted. It was not until months later that they discovered that Billy Wilder himself was a top-only sleeper and that he had waited for months to wait for a chance to use it. <br /> <br /> I have this information from a book. I think this film can be regarded as the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Just after this movie, he made and made wonderful movies like Ninotchka, The Shop around the Corner, or not. <br /> <br /> I thought Gary Cooper's performance was good. I think Lubitsch probably threw Gary Cooper because Gary Cooper played Long Fellow Deeds, who was the Frank Capra's fortune. Once inherited, going to the village. But that's just my opinion. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the movie. I rate this movie 9 out of 10. Lubitsch movies are different because his films are slices of life.
