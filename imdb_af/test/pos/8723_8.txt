As much as I love Walter Matthau, I felt that the majority of his roles were adapted to his personality. This role is one of the exceptions. He plays a dentist who is both charming and dishonest. This role requires much more acting than in most of its other roles. I like the fact that the film was honest about how a professional can be dishonest to avoid being involved in a relationship. His whole purpose was to find a way to be in a relationship with a much younger woman, but not to be committed in any way. The alibi - uses his secretary (Ingrid Bergman) to pretend he is his wife. At one stage in the movie, And Madam is really deceived into believing they were really married. The end was good, because a middle-aged man found that someone in his own age group was chasing, worth more. The movie was funny, entertaining, and not sold out by a minister.
