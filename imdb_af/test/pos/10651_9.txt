SPOILERS Every big regime uses the country's media for its own purpose. Whether the Nazi ban on certain pamphlets, or the television Chinese alternative of Tianamen Square, governments, tried to influence people through various media since the beginning of time. However, in 1925 the Russian Communist government celebrated the failure of the failed mutiny of 1905. The founding of this film, Battleship Potempkin, is supported. A great piece of film history, it remains powerful and beautiful to this day. <br /> <br /> On board the Battleship Potempkin, the crew is unhappy. In unfortunate living conditions and with moody food, they are angry with their upper class oppressors. But now, after the rotten food, enough is enough. Led by Grigory Vakulinchuk (Alexander Antonov), the crew turn their masters and fight for their freedom. <br /> <br /> As far as propaganda is concerned, "Battleship Potempkin" is perfect. A positive light on the first, unsuccessful communist mutiny, was the film a useful Soviet instrument. Eighty years after the film was released and the USSR completely disappeared from the map. The incredible thing about this movie, however, is that the country where the message was meant to disappear, the film remains a powerful and worthy piece of cinema. <br /> <br /> Written and directed by Sergei Eisenstein, the film is surprisingly a joy to watch. It is true that it is far from what we consider "entertainment" today, but the film is a beautiful art. <br /> <br /> Whether it's the scene aboard the boat or the scene that's often spoken about the scene. On the stairs of Odessa, everything about this film is made perfect. The music is powerful and dramatic, the lighting is flawless, even the play, while slightly exaggerated, is perfect for the piece. Basically, there is no way to mistake this end product of the movie. <br /> <br /> It is impossible to know how the Russian people received this movie on its release. To praise a country that has not existed for fifteen years is hard for us to know the full spirits that inspire the film. As a work of art it is wonderful. Beautiful from start to finish, it's far from an easy watch, but it's worth it.
