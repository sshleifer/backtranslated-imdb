MR. BASEBALL is a film of paradoxical. Written and filmed as a "light sports competition", it really has a heart-warming core as human and universal as some of Capra's best. On the plot level, you have turned the paradox of baseball, a fine old American game, as it is played in Japan - thrown away with American values ​​and Japanese values ​​that were at stake. (From the superficial "sports comedy" comes from Jack's incomprehensible disbelief about how "basa-boru" is played in Japan.) You also have a main character presented as a remaining aging baseball star, but who is pretty immature - pro ball allowed him to postpone. And you have a main character who is rude to the changes in his life that is being forced upon him, refusing to accept the cricket ball that gave him life, in the middle of a new country, a new manager, " a new team, and a new friend, who welcomed him and tried to accept him. Sounds like heavy stuff? Not really. It is a spectacular "clash of cultures" comedy that takes place at national, sports, romantic and professional levels. But if you look at it sensitively enough, you'll also find a wonderful story about a man who has to abandon his immaturity and grow late in life (it causes some personal pain) and finds success in places he never expected. . I love the story, but I also have great respect for Selleck's performance; He bursts his box (literally) to portray an ugly American abusive people and to throw tantrums in public, so we understand his distress within this character. It also doesn't hurt if you are a big fan of Takakura Ken as I am. MR. BASEBALL is a surprising "loss of innocence" story.
