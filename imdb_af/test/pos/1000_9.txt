I was fortunate to attend the London Premier of this movie. While not at all a fan of the British drama, I was deeply disturbed by the characters and the BATHS they made. I was in tears at the end of the film. Each scene was magical. The attention to detail and the excellent acting was pretty impressive. <br /> <br /> I will have to agree with some of the other comments as to why all these women throw themselves so contemptuously. <Br /> <br /> ******* SPOLIER ALERT ******** I also hoped that Dylan would be killed by William when he had the chance! **** END SPOILER ***** <br /> <br /> Keira Knightley did a good job and radiated beauty and innocence from the screen, but it was Sienna Miller's performance that was truly worthy of Oscar. <br /> <br /> I'm sure this production will be nominated for other awards.
