I felt so when I saw the episode in its original run and still agree if I look at it. You've totally spotted Colombo's perpetrators throughout the episode and treat him as if he had a syndrome. And in the end, you see their shock when Columbo gets them killed for rights and arrests them. You also get a realistic response from the arrogant preppy killers. They still can't give Columbo his props and say he's just been lucky. I like the formula where there is an extensive crime, the killer (s) totally underestimate Columbo, and then you realize that Columbo played the criminals completely. I remember in the first few episodes of the post-1989 episodes that they did not follow that formula and that was the first episode I was satisfied with.
