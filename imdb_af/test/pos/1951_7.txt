A teenage movie about anxiety, friendship, loyalty and growing up? but it is not a happy outing due to the circumstances and life-changing dilemmas surrounding the premise. What is possible is very numb, haunting and straight cold. However, I expected something slightly more powerful and effective, and while it was indifferent and unforgettable, it didn't stir much about emotions. The performances are pretty mixed, but there is a brutal honesty for them all. Dennis Hopper and especially Daniel Roebuck are wonderful ?? Crispin Glover's eccentricity seems to pay Keanu Reeves's death as a woodwind in his personal slacker role. Joshua John Millar is pretty good and so is Ione Skye. Jim Metzler knocks in with a short but highly engaging performance. The story was confronted dramatically, characteristically and harshly in the eventual break where it brought a fiery and painful punch. JÃ¼rgen Knieper's whirling music party haunts with anxiety, tension and wonder as the morals and duties are tested and taught.
