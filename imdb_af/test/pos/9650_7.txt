Seeing Les Amants Regulators calls immediately for comparison with Bertolucci's film 'The Dreamers', I think the best film about the 1968 uprising of students in Paris. Actually, director Philippe Garrel doesn't seem to compare to his well-known colleague, who shares the main actress, and even includes a direct replica eye-in-viewer view of an older movie by Bertolucci. And yet LAR is another movie, and an interesting one. <br /> <br /> The story line is also known. The movie starts with long scenes of the 1968 'emeutes', perhaps among the best done so far. The film is made in black and white, and the perspective of the static camera on one side or the other of the barricade reminds Eisenstein. Then, as in The Dreamers, the action moves in the Parisian apartment where the heroes of defeating revolt make art, smoke, dream and fall for another. There is no direct social commentary, no real explanation of the background of the rebellion. The film focuses on the psychology of the characters and on the love story between the main characters. It is like a preview of the transition process to the establishment that passed the 1968 generation. It's just that not all participants can adjust or survive. <br /> <br /> The movie is more about the characters than about the events. And it's just for the style it'll remember. The black and white theater is unforgettable, not only in the revolutionary screen, but also in the characters evolution. Many rows are enhanced by a technique derived from silent film films, with long tasks accompanied by a piano stamp. The effect is beautiful. However, the length of the film is scarcely justified, it lasts more than three hours and I doubt it would only cut two hours if it were missed. I am convinced that this is quite the opposite. <br /> <br /> Without increasing the depth and subtlety of Bertolucci's movie LAR is another perspective to remember about one of the most important years in the history of France and of the world in the 20th century.
