Animated shorts just don't get much better than this wonderful Canadian movie. This short feature drops with Canadian references, and so this movie is likely to be appreciated by Canadians most of all. But the basic story is universal, and it is lovingly told by author Roch Carrier. It's a hilarious story I've known a few times, and I was just happy to see it again, so I just had to write a warm recommendation for it. It's a masterpiece, and a must see if you're Canadian.
