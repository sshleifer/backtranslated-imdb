I have never been a big fan of Oliver Stone, often because I have found, forced, preachy and generally defective films. The two Stone movies I really want are JFK and Talk Radio, but Talk Radio takes the cake for Stone's best performance. Stone is a director through which you either are a fan or you are, it is safe to say it before watching Talk Radio. I didn't love the guy and considered one of the most over-rated directors in the film industry, but after watching Talk Radio some of my perceptions changed. Talk Radio is a disturbing and amusing attack that is now known as "reality TV". <br /> <br /> Talk Radio follows a self-indulgent, dysfunctional, determined, hysterical, cruel and confusing radio station, called Barry Champlain, offering a controversial late night radio program in Dallas. He is quickly becoming known for his daring and present air presence. He becomes a late-night sensation, ridiculing junkies, criminals, racists, sociopaths, sickos, perverts and morons in the air. The film shows the rise and fall of the man's career, and carefully accurately portrays freedom of speech. Originally adapted from a play, the film attaches to the theatrical theme it was originally built on and wonders the film's fiery nature. <br /> <br /> With the fiery energy and non-stereotypical air, Radio speaks all the hilarity behind crass media. It remains more gripping today than in the late 80's. The film goes in depth with arrogance, self-obedience, offensive behavior, controversy, hypocrisy and ignorance. The movie shows in a controlled way how good it is to have a personal opinion and freedom of speech, but it is something that should be used wisely rather than shamelessly. Steen tries to show how freedom of speech is crucial in life, but we must be careful and cautious. The film asks if "our main character is the same as the sad people calling the show?" <br /> <br /> Stone creates the film's key set (the radio station) with an ambition and cold atmosphere. He manages to capture the isolation, fear, ambiguity and the dangerous emotions built up at the radio station. Eric Bogosian is perfectly cast as the isolated, self-absorbed and complex genius, Barry Champlain. He fits in with the role of completely letting his lines out with so much enthusiasm, urgency, confusion, bustle and ultimately the brave hilarity of his offensive nature. The show battled with spark, apparently robbed of an Oscar nomination. His voice fits the character, namely that a primary element of a radio host and his power of acting alongside tragedy and comedy work brilliantly. <br /> <br /> There is a strong use of editing in Stone's films and Talk Radio boasts some of its cleanest, most rhythmic editing. He uses beautifully controlled camera techniques, which differ from calm to sudden turbulence. There is a lively energy behind the film, with its raw and wonderful wonderful screenplay, which is a focal point for the greatness of the film. The striking and virtuous cinematography comes out in the moments inside and outside the studio, which captures the night impressively. Ghost radio is an essential modern masterpiece. I'm sure you'll be amazed at how big it really is. . I recommend Talk Radio to anyone interested in media or film. Talk Radio is a great example of top-notch, intellectual and insightful entertainment, which is still a well-deserved wakeup call. Finally, if it wasn't for Eric Bogosian, the movie would not be the fun, wonderful and persistent masterpiece, it is today.
