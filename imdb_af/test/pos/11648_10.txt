After reading most of the comments, I feel I have a word to say. <br /> <br /> What bothers me most is that most people here think that this movie proves con to the subject of death and whether it worked with them. I remember reading an article in 1995 when the movie was published. (Yes, it has interested me so much since I heard it came to me that I didn't forget about the articles I read again) in which Tim Robbins said. that he did not want to make a movie convincing audiences of one or the other. <br /> <br /> And I think it's quite right. I have to admit that I believe he used a bit of anti-death sentence in the way he made this film, yet people can still make their own choice. And it's a very rare thing in American movies. <br /> <br /> I've shown this movie to many people since it came out and I've seen all kinds of reactions. Death penalty supporters have become adversaries or even stronger in their faith. And many death opponents (including me) have become stronger in their belief that death penalty should be abolished all over the world. But I've even seen opponents in supporters change. This and the fact that people here seem to be fighting show me that there are many ways to observe it. So, no matter how important it is to you, the important thing is that it reminds you. <br /> <br /> It is one of the few movies that really gives you the choice, which does not move away with a simple path by making the convicted person harmless or innocent. This can be a difficult thing for people who prefer to entertain or learn a lesson. There is no lesson here, but you have to find yourself. <br /> <br /> Everyone praises the acting, directing and music, but as it has been said so many times, I will not repeat it again. <Br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, do it - if you dare to be challenged!
