Wow, just caught this Blockbuster movie and I love to find jewelry. While it's definitely shot at a budget and a bit of clumsy editing (ie accident, hospital scenes, second to last end screens) miss, for a first try, I give these 10 stars! I absolutely loved the thoughtful concepts and if you are a free thinker and open to ideas outside the box, I strongly recommend this movie. I think director and writer Jay Floyd needs more attention and more opportunities in the film industry. Based on his credits, he can still be a Quentin Tarantino.
