Unlike Bond and other detective videos, Alfred Hitchcock's hero used to be a general man who would come in trouble and then come out with his mind and courage (and luck). Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and thus in a way it is Vijay Anand's tribute to the master of tension. The tribute as it may be, but it has its own grounds and establishes Vijay Anand as a great director himself. <br /> <br /> This is the story of an ordinary man, Vinay, who one day realized that he called a double Amar that is actually a jewel thief. Suddenly Vinay finds himself in the middle of a breeding scheme and to save himself, goes on a wild goose hunt to find Amar one step ahead of him. The tension is almost dead in the movie and when the plot is moved, you are struck by the brilliance of the scheme. Just like Hitchcock's movies, Jewel Thief boasts a great climax shot within the grand palace of Sikkim. <br /> <br /> Everyone and I mean everyone; Dev Anand, Vijay Anand, Ashok Kumar, Vajyanti Mala, Tanuja, SD Burman, Kishore Kumar, Majrooh Sultanpuri etc. Etc. Are in their top forms. It is one of the best thrillers ever made in India.
