A heartfelt sentimental story by The Waltons writer. If anyone were to upload the material to me, I would probably reject it as maudlin. But the dramatization here drives a tear without the expected embarrassment. No one in the 1950s was better with lovely hay seeds than Arthur Hunnicutt. His appeal here is fully used as a mountain man who is doggly loyal to a loyal hunting dog. Their fate is bound inextricably to any human bond. Good. I see a subtle environmental message here. All cattle go to heaven, because how can we condemn a poor devil who only follows instincts to stay alive. There is no deception in the kingdom of animals, and how cruel we often deal with them. An oddly satisfying episode that confirms this important message.
