They made me a crime, a reminder of an earlier Warner Brothers movie, The Life of Jimmy Dolan, who died Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., as the prize fighter for the lamb. <br /> <br /> Even with the restrictions now on production by the Hays office, this remake actually seems to be better than the original. Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., is terribly disgruntled as a pugilist. John Garfield with his background and style steps in a part he was born to play. <br /> <br /> They made me a Criminal by Busby Berkeley, who believed Jack Warner to keep music. Berkeley would soon leave Warner Brothers for MGM. <br /> <br /> Berkeley does a good job here, and keeps the action in good shape. I especially like the scene where four of the Dead End Kids and Garfield swim in a water tank and are stranded there as the water level runs out. They get it out of it very now and with some good skill. <br /> <br /> Other shows besides Garfield and the kids to remember are May Robson who runs the summer camp for kids and Claude Rains as the obsessed detective on Garfield's route.
