Although I totally agree with the previous commentary on the wonderful play of Toni Servillo and Titta Di Girolamo, I also want to add the beautiful filming and montage that makes this film virtually in a painting. Young director Paolo Sorrentino had the courage to experiment with different types of camera techniques that remind me of Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. They both filmed the same MTV style, combined with modern (alternative / techno) music, which made the film? Le Consequenze dell'Amore - separate from the other crime / mafia movies in his genre. Although the movie can start at a very slow pace almost "sec" compared to the faster Hollywood productions, it must be enjoyed because of its serenity, wonderful character depiction and wonderful ending. Definitely a must for people who enjoy European / Italian theater. PS Toni continues to act like this, we need an encore.
