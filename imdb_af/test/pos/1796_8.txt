The Four Seasons dealer is a film about a lack of love. The movie begins with the main character; Hans Epp, returning from a game in the strange legion. He returned to his mother, not to hear how much she loved him, or how much she had missed him; but to tell that he was worthless and even worse, she preferred the man he went with to return. It's the character's relationship with women making this movie so hateful; the fact that his wife is longer than he is symbolic of his relationship with the other sex; He is consistently humiliated by them, and it is through his relationships with them that his life is not as great as it could have been. This is also clearly shown by the way he treats his wife to a drink. He lost his job as a policeman by a desire for a wife and even his wife; A woman who is supposed to love him never really shows a love for him. Even at the end, his wife is more concerned about what her and her daughter will do than the condition of her husband. <br /> <br /> The Four Seasons Dealer is a very unpleasant movie. There is no scene in the movie where someone is happy, and not just that; but the movie seems cruelly happy to turn into the misery of its central characters. The movie is definitely not recommended for anyone currently having a hard time, that's for sure. Despite all the misery, the film never filmed the boundaries of reality; every event in this movie can - and probably also - have happened, and it only serves to make the movie more shocking. The film is of course helped by Rainer Werner Fassbinder; the cult German director who committed suicide in 1982. It's just my second taste of the man's work, but through just two movies it's easy to get an idea of ​​the kind of art he creates. Both films are concise and eager, but realistic artworks. His characterization in this movie is subtle; we only teach the characters by their destiny and not by their character. It's a very smart way to show the audience that it's their environment that defines the people in the film, not the people themselves - and, like almost everyone who sees the film, knows what's in an urban society, It's hard to get the majority of people involved. <br /> <br /> The Four Seasons Dealer is not a movie that can be easily forgotten; the movie is high on fabric and layers of style, and it makes for a very memorable picture and one that everyone sees as a fan of the theater. It is in my mind that I give this movie my highest recommendations; It's not nice and it's not nice, but you won't see a more realistic depiction of depression, and it's definitely a movie that's staying with you.
