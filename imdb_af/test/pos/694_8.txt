The submarine used was NOT Varangian! "It was actually two boats, P614 and P615, both built for Vickers Armstorng at Barrow-in-Furness for Turkey, but held by the Royal Navy for the duration of the war. P615 was sunk, but P614 was finally delivered in 1945. <br /> <br /> The confusion undoubtedly arose because someone looked at P61 (like me) and found Varangian! In fact, the last digit of both P614 and P615 is actually only painted out. <br /> <br /> There are some realistic moments in the movie. These Turkish boats were very similar to the S class. As no S-class submarines survive, their shots (as P61) and the depot ship "Forth" are now part of an interesting record as well as an excellent movie.
