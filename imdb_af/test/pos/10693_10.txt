There are few movies that feature the massive amount of non-stop ninja action as Ninja III: The Domination. It is a story of love, salvation and revenge, but it is mainly a story about how to knock people out without having any reason. If you're looking for a movie where a ninja is going to take nuts and all kinds of people to their graves, just because he's a ninja and he can do it, it's the movie for you. I can't think of any movies to compare, because no movie is this wonderful. Wait, oh, have you ever seen the thing with two heads? There is a role in the titular thing driving on a motorcycle and about a million policemen are driving it around, but they are stuck and not because you can't get the thing with two heads !!! Well, this is kind of what Ninja III is. I recommend this movie, especially if you want the following things: Ninjas, Swords, Lucinda Dickie from Breakin 'and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo, bouncer video games in a bar, ambiguous and underdeveloped love stories or good ninjas.
