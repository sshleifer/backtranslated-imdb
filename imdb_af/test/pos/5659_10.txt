Although it was a failure in the cinema, mainly Mylene Farmer, one of the 3 top stars in France, was not the first role. Fans then thought and waited on the DVD. When released on DVD, it has a tremendous success! The other failed was the slow pace and the incredible length (3h) then (1994) that made critics worse. But the melancholy story obliges slow pace and long time. The moral of the movie is that you cannot escape from the death you are intended for. It's the same theme as in the movie "Final Destination" and makes it a Gothic story. The atmosphere is very melancholy.
