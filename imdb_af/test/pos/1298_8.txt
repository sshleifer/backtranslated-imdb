I really like this movie. One thing I noticed is that Korean TV dramas are better, as it gives you the whole story. I watch movies when I don't have the time or want to go through 16-30 episodes. Movies seem to be rushing and if you don't look carefully, you can miss something. <br /> <br /> I feel this one is rushing and I had to rewind some parts to try to find what I missed, especially at the end. If you like lovely love stories, I still think it's cute, and if you have the extra time, I still think it's worth watching. <br /> <br /> It's always nice to go back, follow the actors in different movies, as we can't follow them when they start, as we do the actor producers and directors in our own countries.
