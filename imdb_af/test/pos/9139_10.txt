If we haven't seen this movie for a long time, we didn't catch it in the well-transferred Criterion DVD long ago. "Le cercle rouge" is a movie that owes much to other movies, as it reminds us of "Rififi", "The Asphalt Jungle" because they all handle hijackers playing the middle stage in the movie and portraying it in large detail. Unfortunately, one knows that the old saying doesn't pay that crime, and from the beginning these men are involved in death. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Melville was a director of few words. He didn't fill his pictures with a lot of dialogue, as is the case here. Yet, because they were not "talky", they had their own style as evidenced by Le Dolous, Le Samurai and his masterpiece, Bob Le Flambeur. Mr. Melville had a sense of style overwhelmed in everything he did. In this film, he, along with his film, Henri Decae, takes along for a ride through the streets of Paris which shows the lively city mainly at night and the dark winter in France. The score is by Eric Demarsan who highlights a jazz-like music that accompanies most of the action. <br /> <br /> Although the movie Alain Delon, as Corey, is in the midst of the action, it is the smart inspector. Mattei, who is the real hero of the movie. As played by the great Bourvil, he is a man who shows great patience because he figured out from the beginning to catch Vogel and in the process he becomes involved in the investigation of the jewel loft in which he knows the escaped man. he is big tissue behind him. Bourvil gives a very satisfying performance, as Mattei shows equal parts of determination and tenderness, as is the case with the three cats he worships. <br /> <br /> Alain Delon has always responded with interesting performances in Mellville's photos. Here he is Corey, the man who is seen for the first time, goes out of jail and promises himself, he won't go back, but he can't go well if he decides to continue and take part in the robbery. His connection with Vogel and Jansen paid in the way they did the job, but it would also be a mistake in the way they would not be able to sell the loot, as the fence on which they relied, " have a change of heart. <br /> <br /> Gian Maria Volonte and Yves Montand are considered Vogel and Jansen respectively. They were excellent actors who blended well into the action of the film. Both actors were at their best moment when they took the roles in the film and showed it. Mr. Montand has the more complex character to play as we see him in his first moment in front of the camera as a man with many demons in his head. <br /> <br /> Jean-Pierre Mellville has great results from his cast and crew in a movie, though feeling a little longer, but still manages his style in one of the most memorable photos of the director to show.
