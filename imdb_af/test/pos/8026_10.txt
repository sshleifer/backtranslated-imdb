This is the classic case of an excellent American movie, simply because it did not have Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenneger as the chief. Adrian Quinn has a better dual performance, it's right that you've heard it double. performance in this movie as one of them has ever moved into their careers! Well anyway, now to the review ... <br /> <br /> The Mission is loosely based on the story of Carlos the Jackal, a radical of 1970 that has terrorized Europe for many years before finally getting through French agents attacked. In this adaptation, an American naval officer (Adrian Quinn) is on leave in Israel, when he was arrested by Mossad (Isreal's crack intelligence / anti-terrorism agency) and he asked to question because he looked like The fox is the one extremely chaotic part of the film, but trust me that it does not detract from the great value of this film. When discovered, Mr. Ramirez not the Jackal, but he is named by a tough CIA agent by the name of Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland, who routinely spends his usual grizzled mysterious government authority figure in a wonderful way) on his jackal, And the series of events that follow will captivate anyone watching this movie - it is full of great acting, without all the usual action movie clips and one-liners, and a great plot that anyone will surprise. The three leading men - Quinn, Sutherland and Kingsley - carry this film far beyond his modest budget with anyone else who filled their shoes. Also, kudos to the director and his staff, the camera angles and cinematography are, especially in the action scenes. The command is better than anyone who can ever rent it, it is a pity that the movie did pretty badly in the box, otherwise we see a sequel to this wonderful spy thriller. 9/10 stars, this reviewer recommends it to all potential viewers!
