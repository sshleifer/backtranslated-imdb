I recently rented this video after seeing "Final Ascent" by the same author. I wasn't prepared for how intense this movie would be. I found it to be in touch from beginning to end, and was furious with the teenagers trying to get away with their crime. The end was definitely disturbing with some of his implied violence, but well done. I recommend this photo.
