I remember remembering this movie when it came out as a tsv. film of the week in the early 1970s. <br /> <br /> Although I haven't seen this movie in more than 30 years, I remember how scary it was ... the sister's dead body in the basement, the storm outraged, the creepy house with no electricity and a murderer still on site. <br /> <br /> They just don't make movies like this one anymore. Elizabeth Montgomery was a very underrated actress and I love her in not just "Betwitched" but several of her after-Bewitched roles, like this one and 1975's "The Legend of Lizzie Borden". <br /> <br /> I really wish someone would come up with a DVD that featured several of the 1970s television of the week on a DVD. Wouldn't it be great to watch Michael Calls, Bad Ronald, "Do not be the Dark of Dark," "Crowhaven Farm," etc. All on one DVD? I know there's a market for a DVD like this for all of our baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s. Perhaps, if we are happy, someone will ever bring us a DVD with a great variety movies like this.
