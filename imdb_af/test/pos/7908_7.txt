A hard life becomes harder when the three children of a single mother are scheduled to be sent to the dissolution of foster homes. <br /> <br /> To stay together, the older son plans a daring, high-risk escape to find a far-lost uncle - their only remaining relatives. <br /> <br /> They are pursuing the three terrible campaigns in the desert in a classical beetle, unashamed, hungry, desperate, terror by criminals and also young to drive, driven by ever-threatening civilian authorities . <br /> <br /> What the film does not have in reality and plot realism, makes it the honest human need to be part of a fulfilled and complete family - even if that family is with broken parts cut. <br /> <br /> Certainly, the end is forced and too dramatic for the critical filmmaker, but every heart beats the same cry for family attitudes and <br /> <br /> With all its weaknesses, I still give this movie ' A strong recommendation.
