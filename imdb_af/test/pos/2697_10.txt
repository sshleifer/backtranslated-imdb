I haven't seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for years. I rate it one of the best ever. I recently returned to Arizona from Arizona on American Airlines for a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did it. Thanks AA. The action of all the teams is first and foremost, especially of Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but of all the films the play is excellent. I love all the cast, they are so funny. There is a hard edge in the King of Queens that I love and rarely see in today's TV comedy. Both Leah and Kevin play so well that each situation is credible and hilariously funny. I just bought the 2nd season while I was in Az this week and I'm going to buy the full set the next time I'm in the US. My 20-year-old son also loves this show and his brilliance is that it has the magic to reach out to different generations. I want to thank all those involved in this amazing show - it is so appreciated to see this kind of TV show in what I think is an era of poor TV show in general, with the exception of Seinfeld's return and such like ... Thanks for a good show ..
