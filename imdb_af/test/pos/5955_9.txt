That's how I sum it up! There were others who said Naked Gun met James Bond. I think the mine is more accurate, but I'm not neutral at that time ...; o) <br /> <br /> This movie is kind of a blast from the past. It reminds you of the old movies (from the 50's and 60's) and it's not just because it plays in that time (1955 to be exact, with the Flashback exception), but it's the mood the movie is making. shows on the screen! The main actor here (who is like I am very popular in his homeland France) is perfect in his role here. He is the spy with the number 117 attached to him. There is one character who sums him up in the movie, asking a question whether he is good or not ... you'll see if you watch the movie! <br /> <br /> It's very funny and if you mix your spies with comedy with old school flags, but don't take themselves or anything else seriously, than you need to see it! : O)
