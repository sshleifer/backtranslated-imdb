I'm a 20 year old bloke from England. I don't cry at movies. But this one moved me. I cried like a girl! This is absolutely the most moving movie I've ever seen, even though the story was doubtful. Joseph Mazello's little face when he dreams to cry, sucked me every time. How can anyone treat such a lovely child? I'm going to cry now and just think about it! Remarkable.
