Wolfgang Petersen (Das Boot, Air Force One) gives us an exciting film where the awards go to supporting actor John Malkovich. His criminal attempt to kill the president was first-rate and credible. <br /> <br /> It is not to diminish the efforts of Clint Eastwood and Rene Russo, or even Fred Dalton Thompson, who is a real blow to a White House Head of State. Eastwood was fantastic, and I love any movie in which Russo is in. <br /> <br /> The movie features original music by five times Oscar winner (Mal√©na, Bugsy, The Untouchables, The Mission, Days of Heaven). Ennio Morricone. That alone makes it worth your time.
