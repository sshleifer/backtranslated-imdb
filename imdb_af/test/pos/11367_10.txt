It was so long ago (1960), but I never forgot this series and often wanted it to appear again. So with that, I went with Mr. Rathbun, then president of Standard Oil, stood sponsoring the offering on PBS. He sent me a photo of the tapestry (actually a charcoal version) used behind the credits. <br /> <br /> For the opening theme music of Bayco's "Elizabethan Masque" my family and I come to drink black and white TV in Shakespeare's words as spoken by a group of excellent but relatively unknown players ( at least to American audiences right now). <br /> <br /> We were introduced to such actors as Sean Connery, Dame Judi Dench, Tom Fleming, Patrick Garland, Julian Glover and Robert Hardy. I have since continued to enjoy their achievements. One of the most interesting things was the way in which the actors continued in their respective roles, as Shakespeare's "King" games were presented for the first time in chronological order. <br /> <br /> I wish I could just tell those actors how much that series meant to me. <br /> <br /> If "Age of Kings" can be revived on VHS and / or DVD, it will be those of us who would like to see again and those who missed it for the first time. <br /> <br /> GOOD NEWS! PBS just sent out a DVD of an old age! SEE YOUR JULY 2009 CATALOG, PAGE 19, OR BUY THEIR TOLL FREE. I just ordered ME!
