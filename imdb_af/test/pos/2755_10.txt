In my opinion, Flatley ruined the first show with his ridiculous ego. He was disrespectful to his partner, tried to get everyone up and did not know the spirit of Riverdance. It's good he left the show. Colin Dunne, the new male head, is wonderful, and when he and Jean Butler dance together, magic happens! Eileen Ivers fiddling is astonishing (like Noel Eccles 'percussion) and Maria Pages' Fire Dance is the admission price! When Pages and Ivers come together, near the end of the show for a musical duet, it's a real treasure. I agree, the editing is not complementary, but no technical flaw can explain this extraordinary tour de force. This is the one you can get. There has never been anything like River Dance! This is the real one!
