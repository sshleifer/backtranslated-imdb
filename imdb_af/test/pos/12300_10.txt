I first saw this movie in Austria when it first came out, and I was captivated by it. It is a passionate and immersive work that must be experienced by all connoisseurs of filmmaking. What a shame it has never been released in DVD format. Perhaps this is one of those days that will be rectified, as it would be a pity if one of the best films ever made is forgotten and fades forever in a movie safe. <br /> <br /> Why is it 'B movies like' American Wedding 'and' Eurotrip 'getting widescreen and fullscreen releases, and often a special edition with several commentaries and extras, while great artworks like' The Dead ' everything but forgotten?
