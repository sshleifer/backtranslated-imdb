In strangers on a train, it is obvious from the outset that playmaker Robert Walker has eliminated Farley Granger as a reluctant accomplice for a few murders. Granger is a semi-public figure, he is a tennis prof, but not a particularly high one. High enough for him to know that Granger is trapped in a loveless marriage and wants to be free to marry Ruth Roman. <br /> <br /> So when they meet for an afternoon as a stranger on a train, Walker knows enough. that Granger would at least be intrigued with the possibility that if the two of them completed strangers, murdered parties, the others would be announced by their interruption. Though Granger was fired by the idea, one of the great things about this movie is what you can see in the show he is giving, which Granger can only submit to temptation. <br /> <br /> In fact, as Walker killed Laura Elliot, Granger's wife, who had hit him twice and even conceived by another man, he expects Granger to kill Walker's father again so Walker walks inherit estate. Today, Walker will be called a trust fund baby and a bit malicious on it. <br /> <br /> Alfred Hitchcock ironically directed Walker his career role in his last full movie. Walker died the following year when most of my son John was done. Hitchcock doesn't do too badly by Farley Granger. <br /> <br /> Of course, when Granger forces him to murder people who have never done anything to him, the tension is. Aliens on a train are also characterized by great editing, only in the tennis match in which Granger has to finish the match and Walker has to go before he finds Granger's testimony to the crime scene. And also in the last climax with a fight on a runaway carousel between Walker and Granger. Aliens on a train are Hitchcock at its best, it should not be missed and should be required to watch movie classes study editing.
