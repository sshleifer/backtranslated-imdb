Okay, I admit it, I'm 40 and still poured a tear every time I watch Johnny call his robot. <br /> <br /> "Robot, stop now! Don't do that, stop the attack ... Robot, what are you doing, Robot ... Robot, where are you going? Robot, come back! Robot ... Robot please! Don't do this, you will die ... Robot. Robot, please come back! I need you here? Giant Robot ... Robot! Giant Robot? -Johnny Soccer, The Last Of Imperial Robot <br /> <br /> Of all the Tokusatsu out there, the Giant robot has a special place in my heart and will always be there.I admit it as if I was all in the sci-fi and anime when I was a kid. br /> <br /> LIFE ON GR!
