Despite later claims, this early-talkie melodrama had very little in common with "Citizen Kane": It is a biopic of a relentless but human fictional plutocrat, flashing back, but jumping around time. The scriptwriter, Preston Sturges, does not show any of his later gifts for a sparkling dialogue, and none of Kane's many film innovations is clear. Yet it is very viewable, with a young Spencer Tracy (his old male makeup making him look like an old Spencer Tracy) showing depth and authority, and Colleen Moore - a little past her first and not physically good match - play a polygonal woman behind the man. There is also Helen Vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes in the history of the film, sending the last third in ecstatic soap opera reverberations. The surviving picture is jumping and missing bits of sound, and a few plot holes have been left open (how would she know whose son it was when she was sleeping at both of them?), And the music is terribly hokey. For all this I was very fascinated.
