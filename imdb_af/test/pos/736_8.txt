Clearly, my appreciation would not suggest to me that it be compared to the classic horrors of Argento, but with another 70's low budget, in price driving and in that department it is truly a classic. The lack of money shows: (Is there anyone who cares too much?) The play is rather rather professional. (Does it make it realistic?) But unlike many other movies, not just low budget, it doesn't take a moment. Crap it can be, but don't stop shit, in your face crap and although inevitably a little campy at times, it's a must see for anyone with any idea I'm talking about. Sometimes it's crazy, this crazy little movie filled with characters is made clear for fun and fun, indeed, that is watching.
