Shame is rather unique as a war movie (or rather the anti-war film), as it not only focuses on the soldiers or politics (there is politics, but not how you think it will be shown), it is about its two majors as the only two creatures that could possibly be in the cruel, dilapidated society in which they live. Ingmar Bergman, in the midst of his first, and two other heavy psychological films, Persona and Hour of the Wolf, are much more interested in what has the effect of war on usually civilized beings, that it is the worst in them, and also in a cathartic way is a reminder of what is really necessary to live. His two major actors are regular collaborators and friends Max von Sydow and Liv Ullman (like the Rosenbergs strangely enough), who live musicians on a farm on an island (not too different from 'Wolf' if you think about it) . /> <br /> They see the tanks rolling through, and some old friends are already being cut down, but they don't try to take it too much; There is a lovely scene where the couple just talk, but honestly, but with the heart (though one shot, as repeated by the movie, may be a sense of challenge). Then comes the trouble, including a fake film of propaganda On the popularity of the Rosenbergs, the psychological turmoil in prisoners of war and the terror involved in a friend in the army (one of Gunnar Bjornstrand's most subtle works with Bergman). Needless to say, it is not one of the easier films to go in terms of Bergman's filmography, but for some it may be one of his more accessible works. His religious themes are kept very low this time, even because the idea of ​​maintaining a kind of faith permeates the atmosphere of the film. When there is war action, it is shot in unconventional, quick ways (via great amigo Sven Nykvist). <br /> <br /> And the deconstruction of the relationship between Jan and Eva is successfully consistent with the background of a chaotic type of war-ground where the lines are never drawn too sure. In a way, this film, shot right at the peak of the worst times in Vietnam, is even more relevant to today; I can't help but I see a compromise between Iraq and elsewhere, with Jan and Eva compromises, with the fighters or those in charge. The very last scene is one of Bergman's very best, everywhere (acting, directing, lighting). It's not the kind of war image (or, again, anti-war, I find little of the John Wayne spirit in this Swedish production) that I would recommend straight to the bat to save friends to save Private Ryan. It has a bit more in relation to paths of glory, look at the consequences of the hypocrisy of the war. But in fact, like any of Bergman's "genre" movies, it stands alone, but one that packs a wall-mount for the art house crowd.
