By age 20, Francis Ouimet (Shia Lebouf) as his whole life in front of him - in a way. The son of an immigrant family living in the late 19th to early 20th century United States was a very restrictive fact. If one is born poor, one remains poor; If one is born into the bourgeoisie, one has a small chance. If one is born in the rich class, they have made it in the shade. British gold champion Harry Vardon and Francis's golf idol (played by the criminally underlined Stephen Dillane) is the exception to the rule. Born and raised in a poor British family, his skillful golf skills allowed him to rise from the dirty rocks of the poorest slums to the lush vegetables of English country clubs. He did not forget this lesson. Francis wants to follow in Vardon's footsteps and also uses his great golf skills to get into the 1913 American Open at the age of 20. But a tough rate and formidable opponents (including Francis' idol Harry Vardon) are not all that Francis has to deal with, a less sensible father and cruel social framework in his way of experiencing his own dream. <br /> <br /> I know what you think - I thought too - a Walt Disney movie made over the 1913 American Open starring the thrilling Shia LaBeouf offers the possibility to be entertaining, but it can not be a good movie. Well, I'm here to encourage you to think again. Despite what it may look like on paper, the biggest game ever played is one of the best sports movies in creation. <br /> <br /> As with any major sports movie, the biggest game ever played includes many exciting sports scenes, but it's not a movie about golf. It's a character-centered film about the use of talents, one's dreams and the outbreak of classroom. Where the greatest game ever played works perfectly as a themed sports movie it also works just as well as a period movie - the movie's favorite costumes and sets are the next best thing to travel the real time. The movie also looks simple * big and virtually unknown music composer Brian Tyler made the movie a great piece of music. The movie is also good with a subtle but powerful Stephen Dillane as British golf champion, Harry Vardon, a hilarious Stephen Marcus as the man's golfer Ted Ray, a hammy Josh Flitter as Francis's pre-teenage adam Eddie and a surprisingly good Shia LaBeouf starring as Francis. Actor Bill Paxton (Apollo 13, Titanic) is named for the second time as a director (a full-length feature) in the biggest game ever played. He produces a fine product - with lots of heart, ingenuity and attention to detail in making the film.
