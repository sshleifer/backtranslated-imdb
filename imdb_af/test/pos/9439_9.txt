What is the most violent movie of all time? Rambo III? Commando? Robocop? Add these three very violently, and you will still not be equal to the massacre in The Stabilizer, the wildest, silliest, craziest action movie I have ever seen. For a hundred minutes things are blowing up and people are dying in dozens of strange ways. It will make you laugh and brave, and when it's over, you'll be exhausted a little. The movie is a buried gem, a cult class that unfortunately has a cult. <br /> <br /> The Stabilizer is the nickname of our hero Peter Goldson (Peter O'Brian), a great oily man with curly mullet. He arrives in Indonesia on the trail of the villainous and average Greg Rainmaker. We know that he is angry because he is only referred to by his full name ("I hate SCUM like Greg RAINmaker!") And use a method to kill it so much that I can't even explain it. Wait, yes, I can. He steps over people in thin shoes. Greg Rainmaker: Cleat Killer. <br /> <br /> When Greg Rainmaker does not pour out alcohol on women for their sexual pleasure, he kidnapped important professors and led by a great underworld empire. It is up to Goldson (a Jewish action hero!) And his motivated sidekicks crew to stabilize the situation by killing everyone and blowing it up very well. Perhaps "meaning" has a different meaning in Indonesia. <br /> <br /> Violence, oh violence. It's a movie that is unwilling, no, impossible to run five minutes of screen time without interrupting a kind of explosion, blast, car crash or squib. The violence is extreme; Not graphic and bloody, just very funny. For example, the Stabilizer and company are entering one of Rainmaker's warehouses (of course by driving a solid concrete wall on a motorcycle). When it sits on the balcony, with a heavy fire coming from below, the Stabilizer does the one thing he can do. He drove off the balcony to the man's head, his front band reflecting it like a basketball. Surprisingly. Of the excessive love shows (both great female characters jumping in the bag with the hero of their choice, not two minutes after they first talked to them for the first time) to the poorly-baptized dialogue ("Victor, your talented bastard!") ) The Stabilizer has it all. It's a movie for centuries, there with Citizen Kane and Gymkata. It is not widely available in release. If you find it anywhere for any price, buy it and enjoy the madness. <br /> <br />
