Although it has been out of the air for 6 years, Promised Land was one of those shows that come together once or twice in a generation. Good throwing, supporting role (among them, Richard Thomas and Ossie Davis) and crew. The plot is credible with McRaney packing his family and just saying "to hell with everything" after years of so many disappointments and incidents. I think many Vietnam-era veterans, which I included, can really relate to McRaney's thinking process to finally decide on his actions. Many of us did exactly the same thing in real life, after the return of that war and to find that America was not the same place. The show not only gives values ​​but a look at what happened in one veteran's life. In these two respects alone, I think this is one of the more gripping TV series of our time. Why this program only runs for 3 years is beyond me.
