I'm a big fan of the spy genre and it's one of the best of these movies. The command is based on a true story that is slightly decorated for the big screen, and it really takes you on a fun ride. The film plays a good role, with Aidan Quinn, Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley. <br /> <br /> Navigating Quinn is reluctantly recruited by Sutherland after a casual encounter with Kingsley, who believes Quinn is the famous terrorist Carlos the Jackal. Because Quinn looks so close to Carlos, Sutherland stops nothing from recruiting him because Sutherland is catching or killing the terrorists. <br /> <br /> The training series are great. Quinn is really tested by Kingsley and Sutherland, who have to withstand remote snowmobile attacks, to eat the same food every day, to be dried with a hallucinogen. He even had to learn how to love a woman like Carlos would. <br /> <br /> The movie has some great action scenes with Quinn who dodges alliances because they believe he is Carlos and in his final mission when he is killing the fox. During the film, Quinn has to struggle with the new personality he has achieved against his own. Will he remain so merciless and free as Carlos or will he return to his good husband and father's life? <br /> <br /> If you like the spy genre, it's a must see. The action is only used to move the story of this thriller forward; no gratuitous explosions or fighting scenes. Rating 10 out of 10 stars.
