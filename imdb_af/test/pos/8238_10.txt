A light, exciting and engaging film. Look at Irene Dunne is a pleasure! As you see her, she stops to become Irene Dunne and becomes Paula Wharton in every respect. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed Irene Dunne in every movie I saw and that would be almost all of them. What a shame that most of her movies have to be repaired so badly. I hope Irene Dunne movie is recovered before it's too late, it's such treasures. Thank you, this is not the case with more than 21. <br /> <br /> It's a must see if you want a great acting and humorous comedy. serious overtones. I agree with a previous comment on the speech "The World and Apple Pie" it was one of the many highlights of the movie. I read somewhere that Irene Dunne helped the speech with Director Vidor (Irene Dunne was a very good and charitable person in private life) and it seems to be in her movies!
