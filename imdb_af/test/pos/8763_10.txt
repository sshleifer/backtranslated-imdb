It is difficult to put the devastating beauty of Traffik into words, partly because I still grab it to understand it myself, a few hours after my second viewing. First, Traffik contains some of the most incomparable and unforgettable spectacular scenes I have seen in a film or television production. The play is excellent, especially that of Bill Paterson as a British minister who is struggling with his heroin-addicted daughter and holding a relief agreement to Pakistan that is on drug issues. Another plot line describes these drug issues at ground level in Pakistan and revolves around a struggling opium poppy farmer and his interaction with a successful heroin smuggler. The third main story deals with the prosecution of a drug importer in Hamburg, and the contradictory efforts of his wife and two German detectives while under trial. It is a great thing that the interaction between these stories is natural and exceeds the forced plot twist that often occurs in Hollywood movies. It's a bigger achievement that a job spreads across three countries and half a dozen main characters can be so focused and surprising, without being overweight. It is devastating - dark and brutal, but never apathetic. In short, Traffik is a rare film work that handles challenging subjects with unparalleled compassion and clarity.
