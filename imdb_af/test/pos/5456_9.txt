The directing is brilliant, the casting is remarkable (although I liked seeing a little more from Aaron Lustig (from Y & R), who played Paul Shaffer, I have only two smaller quips about the movie, as subtle as One-Roebuck's Leno is excellent, but she is raising her presence (that is, predicting one of his late-stage episodes) is a bit subversive, two-spreading the dirty language. tolerate dirty language as long as it is not used for free, and to some extent the film is free, the language is used as a tool to reduce the pathos of Bates' otherwise well-depicted Kushnick by its regular use, and has served to make Roebuck's Leno a good thing by using his lack of it (of course, if the characters really behave this way, kudos to everyone). Nevertheless, that piece is an excellent one, as far as television and video are concerned The film I feel has potential all for the big screen, but would have needed to repeat the pieces, and probably also another director. (The aesthetic feeling is that of the Larry Sanders show, good for HBO, mediocre for film purposes).
