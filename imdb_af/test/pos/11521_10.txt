I have to say that this movie had a good role, place, music and camera work. Cameron Diaz was wonderful, she had a very exciting role, very excited, while Jordana Brewster had a serious role but one of the one. for my Jordana's very nostalgic, she reminds me of a female classmate! What I have in this movie now is the very capable camera work and the choice of places. The story is many written. it is a must see one. The one in the mysterious movies should look at this one, I guarantee you everything it will keep you up to the end of your seats.
