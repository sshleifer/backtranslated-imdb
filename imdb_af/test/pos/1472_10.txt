Okay, when I rented it a few years ago, I had the worst expectations. Yes, the acting is not good, and the picture itself seems dated, but when I sat there, a strange thing happened. I started to enjoy it. The action is great and there are few scenes that let you jump. Brion James, perhaps one of the best B-grade actors next to Bruce Campbell, is fantastic as always. The story is not bad either. Now I will not be in a hurry and buy it, but you will not waste your time, at least look at this good B grade post-apocalyptic Western.
