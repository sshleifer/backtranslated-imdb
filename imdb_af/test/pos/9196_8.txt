1st watched 10/28/2007, 8 out of 10 (Dir-Jesus Ponce): Simple, lovely story of a homeless couple and their daily adventures that survive in the everyday world without a roof over their heads. The film started with the woman in the story (played by Isabel Ampudia) released from prison, but we don't know what she was in or how long she was there. She walks over the anti-hero of the story and her boyfriend, played by Sebastian Haro, as he is changing cars. They sit together under an old dilapidated building with nothing but each other's warmth and a small mattress to their possession. He is a drug addict just trying to make it from one solution to another, but she has a strange, obsessive appeal to him as a person we eventually accept. He also has some kind of sexually transmitted disease, so sex for them is out of the question, but it doesn't seem to be a problem for one of them. She loves this man as he is, without a doubt, and without having to change what is a rare place anywhere. She deserves her by wearing a bucket and washing shop windows. They eat a bakery roll every day and consider it a feast. Isabel's character dreams of a normal life, but doesn't expect it to happen and doesn't expect to fit into that role, and that doesn't mean much about it. Both characters come from extremely broken homes and therefore the audience has sympathy for them despite their imperfections. Without giving up much of the story, Isabel's character continues to persist as the man gets worse and worse in his drug addiction. There is a nice melodramatic conclusion to the story it brings to the masses, but it is generally a wonderful independent film about a relationship between worldly misfits that impresses you to the end.
