I only saw the movie when I was about 6 - my grandmother thought it would be a nice kiddie movie to entertain me and keep me busy. But every time I looked at it, I had the same nightmares. Yes, it surprised as a children's movie, but even now I find it very dark in places, especially the ghostly music played every time the guardian is on the screen, and her rather hypnotic eyes and voice. The real "bad things" of the film, that is, the sharks, Grimes, etc. Don't scare me at all. I've always found the whole movie rather slim and dark. This is of course something I can appreciate now that I am 21, but from experience I cannot show it to my children!
