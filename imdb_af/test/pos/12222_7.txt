This DVD series is the complete 15-episode series of "Surface", a television program made by Universal in 2006. The full run time is 10 hours and 34 minutes plus some bonus features (deleted scenes, played interviews, special effects featurette). It was a relatively high budget watch and much of the budget made it on the screen in terms of quality production design and special effects. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, 10+ hours of time and as usual with this kind of thing, the overall quality starts in later deviations. I found the first 7 episodes (CDs 1 and 2), and the rest is a disappointment. "Surface" was produced, written and directed by Josh and Jonas Pate; And it seemed that they were surprised at the success of the series and could not link enough good stuff while rushing to fill the order for additional episodes. Even more authors seem to have been introduced to the later episodes because the characters (already the worst part of the series) lack the consistency with the way they were played in the early episodes. The series has been canceled and although the last episode contains a variety of sorts, there are still many things to hang on. <br /> <br /> It's basically a science fiction story about genetically created dragons; kind of a television mix of "Jurassic Park" and "ET". The story begins as a puzzle, as a crewless Navy sub is found on the sea, boaters on a Texas lake are sucked into the whirlpool, a lighthouse in Africa becomes a huge monster, and so on. Destroy. And as long as things keep this vague there is a fair amount of tension and tension. A human element is set up in the form of three American families, one on each coast and one on the Gulf of Mexico. Laura Daughterty (Lake Bell) is a biological biologist in California who discovered a strange creature emerging from a submarine thermal outlet on the ocean floor. Rich Connelly (Jay R. Ferguson) dives with his younger brother in the wave when similar creatures break his brother (never to be seen again). <br /> <br /> Miles Bennett (Carter Jenkins) is a Wilmington teenager who finds some odd eggs floating in the ocean. He takes one home where it breeds in an "ET" type dragon. He will spend the rest of the series hiding his strange pet from his family and local authorities. These dragons can look like lizards, but they are more like indestructible electric poles, burn off electromagnetic pulses, cause attacks, leave the sea from fish, and reproduce like a bunch of brimming rabbits when they get an undersea thermal exhaust. As long as it is uncertain whether they are intelligent, alien or harmless, the point of departure is interesting. Once you suspect their origin, it becomes very tired and predictable. <br /> <br /> Jay R. Ferguson (a surprisingly bad actor in the tradition of David Hasselhoff) essentially plays the Richard Dreyfuss character from Close Encounters of the Third Child, so you know it with a Better actor and better director, it could have been an interesting character. You will grow to hate this character more in every episode. Unfortunately, starting as three parallel story lines, soon split into two, as Ferguson and Bell (a low-budget version of Sandra Bullock) are coming together soon to engage in a series of moronic adventures that are almost unlikely than things "Jason Bourne" gets himself into. You expect plot holes and the need to suspend unbelief in this type of performance (it can even be part of the fun), but their adventures are not only completely flawless, they are completely and completely boring. There are three consecutive episodes that Ferguson and Bell work together in a dump, which you crave for the excitement of an everyday actuarial conference. <br /> <br /> Jenkins (Miles) is the strongest member of the cast and the segments with his pet dragon (Nimrod) are often aimed at the cuts with the boring Ferguson-Bell stuff to make you look. And these segments benefit from the presence of beautiful Leighton Master (of the recent "Gossip Girl" fame) as his sister Savannah. Apparently the producers have their importance for their "teenage boy" target audience and the one positive thing they did with the later deliveries of the series was to put Linsey Godrey (Caitlin) as a "first love" interest for Miles set. As soon as Savannah's screenplay decreases, Catlin is gradually phased in. <br /> <br /> In retrospect, they need a third storyline to keep the viewers adequately engaged and it would have been better to have the adult melodrama in favor of a second group of young actors. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
