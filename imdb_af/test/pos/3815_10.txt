It's amazing what you can do with little money. DEAD SILENT is a low-budget movie that delivers its promises. <br /> <br /> Too bad, we no longer see Rob Lowe on the silver screen. Lowe is at his best in this sounding thriller. No wonder he went from DEAD SILENT directly to the TV mega hit The West Wing. <br /> <br /> DEAD SILENT 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Sputtosi Toronto.
