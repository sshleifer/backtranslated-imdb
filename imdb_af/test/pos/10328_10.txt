For those who do not know what or who is buggy, it was a children's reality show about real children living in the summer camp. Bugsap is the show that inspired me to go camping. It was full of romance, friendships, battles, overcoming your fears and dealing with the struggle to live from home for 2 months. It was a wonderful show that was no longer on tsv. shown. regularly, but is incredibly non-the-less. The show was never sowing and always attracted my attention. It's really great for kids who have never been in a summer camp to really see how it used to be. Plus Disney had a very good job of choosing squatter camps because they wanted to see a show just for a week at a camp. The length of the camps was perfect for this show, and the area they were in was fantastic. They where camping across the US, each providing unique activities for the campers. It was an incredible, uncritical performance.
