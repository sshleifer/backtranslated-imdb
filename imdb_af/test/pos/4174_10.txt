What can I say about this movie that has not been said by all the other comments here, summarizing them all, the people who love it, cherish it, the people who hate it ... well, they make it scary. This is Marmite's film equivalent. <br /> <br /> I personally reminded it every second, it's cyclical, claustrophobic, introspective, magical and one of the most unique movies ever made. Despite what many have said, I believe it is truly a cult movie, it's a diamond in the rough just waiting to be discovered. Once unearthed, this fantastic psychedelic visual and incredible soundtrack will be unforgettable. This is an achievement in itself. One of my friends who watched it compares it more to a musical and in many ways to those who do not fully appreciate the context in which this film is made, it will probably be more appropriate to regard Head as such. <Br /> <br /> I always loved the Monkeys, especially the TV show back when it was repeated in the 80s. My mom recorded Head for me when it was shown on television late at night, as she knew I liked them. I watched it a day later and it happened in my memory until I could find a copy on DVD about two decades later, What I love now is a special edition, it would be fascinating to get a better one gain insight into making this masterpiece. We can only hope.
