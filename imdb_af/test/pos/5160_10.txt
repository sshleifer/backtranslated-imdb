I really didn't see it. Roy Andersson exhausted me, I'm the perfect sucker for a static camera (long life King Borowczyk!) And I laughed hysterically for the first fifteen minutes of the film, he hit me straight in the eyes. You have to be a brilliant man to be self-sufficient hilaries. Andersson reminds me of the third mate at the Pequod in Moby Dick, Flask, a man who has taken his whole life to be a practical joke that the good Lord himself plays on us. And the web of selfishness in this movie is really hilarious. <br /> <br /> The level of satire is on chorus, you have one deceitful self-pampering dream heart over the cruelty of the world and then completely ignore a spiritual self-reflection that calls in fear. The many depths of egoism are plowed. I really never thought it was possible to go beyond Bergman's "The Silence" in this regard. But the grotesque of self-love and self-respect, through every single character in this film, is staggering. We show a existence where the unloved and idle track against a world they believe is unfair to them, they are truly legend in their own living rooms. Man in this movie makes self-deception and self-deception a good art form! <br /> <br /> Just one woman in the movie has some kind of understanding of what's going on. An old woman who refuses to leave a chapel called to pray for the forgiveness of all mankind. Her speech is the most electrifying condemnation of the modern world I have ever heard. She reveals through her prayers that what is wrong with the world should not be determined by mere determination, there are not only a few mistakes, there is an abyss of corruption that can only be applied by illegality and judgment day. Watching this movie puts me in the mind of a naked monk, standing deep in a cold river at midnight and shouting a thousand Kyrie eleisons for the sins of mankind. Another big thing is that it is clear that her prayers are useless and that they are all actually stopping at home at closing time. <br /> <br /> It is not a film for the alley, no one is spared, No idols are left on the altar, none of the groups are harassed at the glory of another group. There has never been a bigger, more transcendent, more amazingly beautiful summary of our sins. It's a movie for the end of the world, it's the big ones, the great, terrifying joke of human life! <br /> <br /> It is too difficult to choose a favorite from the catalog of images, I slapped my thigh and almost fell off my seat in the theater and shouted with a laugh while a man tried to the tablecloth under a set of service. I won't spoil what happens, but the tension builds up and something truly unexpected occurs. It's probably the funniest thing I've ever seen in a theater. I am reasonably reserved and I could not control myself: this is the measure of the greatness of this film. <br /> <br /> The shooting of "You, the Living" is immaculately formalistic. We show the palette of an artist, brown-brown, yellow, gray and air-blue, alive with the shock of light copper structures. There's never a tone, it's like an hour and a half of the symphonic Whistlerian color report. The obsession that must be used to have the color scheme in place is extraordinary. And there is no lap of rubbish, as with all big movies, there is no extra thumb celluloid. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the best movie I've ever seen is.
