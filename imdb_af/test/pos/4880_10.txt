Supernanny Jo Frost, in every episode, gives a family the benefit of her hard-earned experience. But if she is gone, they will succeed in adhering to her tough disciplinary rules, or they will have a life dominated by unrighteous children. <br /> <br /> In the evenings of the British documentary "Wife Swap" and "How Clean is Your Home" Supernanny takes a deep look at the private family life of average people but with the added benefit of practical advice on ways to increase your children. <br /> <br /> You are calling for a tough love style of childcare and the now infamous "naughty step" has come into the popular people in many British homes. <br /> <br /> In just three short weeks, the families appeared that were turned away from a disorganized home; sibling rivalry, shouting, kicking, biting children and fighting parents, to a tranquil calm oasis of family love. <br /> <br /> The series in the air has increased major ratings and critical praise and is currently in talks to be overturned for America. .
