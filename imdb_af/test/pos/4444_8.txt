I'm not a big fan of Lucio Fulci's movies. Most of his 80-year-old films had their moments, but often appeared as two-day Dario Argento imitations. With the exception of the entertaining "Zombi" (who was a George Romero imitation), I didn't really enjoy it. I know that Italian horror often ignores the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just to thread, even according to the standards. That's why "Do not abuse a duck" surprises me. This is actually a very well-made movie with an invading murder mystery. It may have been the best ever made, just serious about Dario Argento's entries in the genre. And unlike Fulci's previous giallo "A Lizard in a Woman's Skin", never pull it. <br /> <br /> Fulci's direction here is pretty good. He keeps the story in good stead and keeps the viewer's interest throughout. Also, the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience. In addition, he adds some clever touches, such as the exciting soul music during a particularly disturbing cemetery. Overall, the violence is limited here and is only used when needed for the story. The acting is also good for the most part, full of familiar faces from the 70-year-old Italian exploitation cinema. Both Thomas Milian and Barbara Bouchet are cool throughout. The only weak link is Florinda Bolkan, whose performance is just too high. This is the only laughing aspect of the movie. "Don't torture a duck" definitely comes with my recommendation and can be a good introduction to the giallo subgenre as a whole. (8/10)
