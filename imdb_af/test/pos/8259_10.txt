Beautifully adapted to the screen and very true to Mary Webb's period novel, this film is a true masterpiece. Apart from the exceptionally talented rising star, Janet Mcteer as head and one or two established actors, the film mostly used little known names. Yet the drama was increasingly convincing. The social and personal tensions are almost tangible and I felt as if the actor reacted to each other's character as if they were in real life. I saw one commentator asked if Janet McTeer really had a rabbit, a testimony to how well her characterization was. I saw it on TV when it was first shown, pasted it, and later the band was unfortunately lost. But it remains clear as anything in my mind. If you love the social period at all, it must be an absolute must.
