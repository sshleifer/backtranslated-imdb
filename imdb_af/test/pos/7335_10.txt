Wow what can I say it was a good movie, very different from all the boring remake, we see lately the only thing I would like to see more of when Jane left her husband. I think she's going to cause Serena. She fell for her, not just her, but all she was. I wish it. Producers would actually show that kind of end instead of letting your imagination go. I really hate it if they do. The airplanes look like fun, but I think you should be light and muscular, I would like to see more movies like this, maybe it could be a kind of sequel to Jane and Serena. If I was in Jane's shoes, I would also have gone to the girl she was attractive.
