This is one of the great modern kung fu movies. Many of the reviews seem to miss the point that the comedy is sometimes on a fairly subtle basis (at other times in your face) contrast between old and new China. For example, Kara Hui is called a agricultural pot and gets in trouble when she tries to adapt to the new, but ultimately, to save her families fair dresses as an old-fashioned heroine, unlike the modern military style of Hsiao Ho. Gordon Liu apparently played his part in the fun of his serious, monk person with dull wigs and a guitar. The final is simply fantastic and ends in a defeat for Johnny Wang rather than death. Kwan Yung Moon must be named for his great play of a thug with 'invincible armor' - just great. And Kara Hui does some great acting and fighting. A good movie.
