Symbolically large, big songs, this film no longer broke their "expectations of the target audience". These monks and the naturally selected members of the group were a subtle witness in your face, goodbye to one another. The message today is true, the loft you escape and the bridge from which you want to jump is the next generations' own disappointments. There will always be new kids on the block replacing those who break free from the chains. The movie can sometimes be frustrating, because the themes that the film attacks are so blatant of the American way of life cannot help a thinking and reasoned person, but look at their own reflection in the minds of Head and not just their personal questioning questions. motives for continuing the madness of everyday American life, but the motives of those who want it to go on for the sake of madness. The final scene, similar to Don Quixote's knightly courage from the caged tiger to come out for the battle, represents just how cruel and impossible most dreams are.
