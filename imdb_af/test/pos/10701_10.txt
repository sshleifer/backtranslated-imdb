Sam Firstenberg's "Ninja 3: The Domination" combines martial arts with "The Exorcist" as horror. The horror elements thrown on the screen are simply laughable, but the movie works as a ceaseless action / fighting artist. The scenes are well choreographed and exciting, and the movie is never boring. So dull dialogue, lame acting and annoying soundtrack are forgotten. Grab beer and watch this one! Highly recommended!
