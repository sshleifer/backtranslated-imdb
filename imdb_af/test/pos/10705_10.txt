Producer Matt Mochary stumbled upon the film's subject, Anderson Sa (leader of the AfroReggae music movement) when he was on a Hewlett Foundation's trip to Rio de Janeiro. Mochary was so devastated by Sa's story that he invited his friend, NYC filmmaker Jim Zimbalist. He left his job and joined Mochary in Brazil to work on a documentary about Sa, Rio's favelas and the culture of violence. <br /> <br /> The first part of the film shows you the culture of violence in Rio's favelas (shantytowns where the poor live) via footage of police attacks and attacks on residents. The visuals are graphic and shocking. <br /> <br /> Due to the negativity of the favelas, charismatic Anderson Sa, who has conquered a possible career in drug trafficking to begin the AfroReggae movement, combines elements of Afro-Brazilian culture. , Reggae, ska and other elements in a fast, percussion heavy musical style that have since spread to other parts of the world. You can't help but get carried away by the music, especially if you see local children getting involved in Sa's school, which he founded to keep children out of drugs. The rest of the movie follows Sa's meteoric rise and its positivity changes many of the children's lives to seek out a life outside of drugs. SPOILER: Just when the filmmakers thought they were filmed, an incredible life-changing event happened, the resolution of which had to be seen to be believed. The movie then continues and you are grabbed in your seat until the end. <br /> <br /> This movie is a reaction to 'City of God' and a worthy one. The dark situation portrayed in the movie is counteracted by a real-life example of how favela residents can overcome the difficult situation in which they are involved and use their resources for constructive ends. You can't help pass Anderson Sa. <br /> <br /> This movie is shot great, fast and very absorbent. Due to the overwhelming response of the audience on last night's SilverDocs performance, the film needs to get domestic distribution in the US and the soundtrack should also be released. Keep an eye out for this superlative documentary - it's great!
