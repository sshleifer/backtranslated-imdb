Let's look at it. <br /> <br /> This movie is incredibly clich√©, such as Korean romance plays and movies. First, there are some lost brothers and sisters, one of whom falls in love with another. Secondly, there is a not-so-popular girl and two beautiful, popular guys who fall and fight over her. Thirdly, one of the characters suffers from a tragic illness, which eventually takes its life. <br /> <br /> Still, I like this movie. <br /> <br /> Without the right actors, this movie would probably have disappointed fans of the novel. But because the actors fit the roles perfectly, the movie is watching. I honestly can't stop looking. Kang Dong Won, despite his pretty face, gives a tremendous, heartbreaking performance, not to mention Lee Chung Ah and Jo Han Sun, plus all the supporting actors. <br /> <br /> I absolutely recommend this movie to everyone. .
