It brings back so many children's memories. (I'm not old, I'm 19) It's glasses. The trains, the old house, the fallen runner, the terrifying landslide (well when you're 6), the drama if the kids can stop the train or will it crash? It is a child's film without a doubt, but it does not offer much harmless blood / gut / guns etc. to children. And this has Bernard Cribbins in it, which is cool. 8/10
