I love the shepherd! Probably the acting wasn't good, but the scenes were nice. Van Damme throws some good kicks and so does adkins. The story was average. A Texas police are fighting smugglers. This movie has done everything a movie of Damme has to do that is martial arts and action. Van Damme was never a good actor. I think this movie is better than Van Dammmes last 2. If you're looking for an Oscar winning performance, you won't get it here, but if you're looking for action and martial arts, this movie is for you. Scott Adkins is a great martial artist and unfortunately the public has become tired of martial arts superstars, but his movies in this movie are wonderful. Van Damme gives strong kicks and it is good to see him again doing his martial arts since he was not in his last 4 or 5 films. This movie is definitely worth checking out if you are a van Damme fan.
