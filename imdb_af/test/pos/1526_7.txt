The Good News: The director is reportedly committed to the cause of Amnesty International and is keen to deliver a solid message on the freedom of expression and the evil of oppression. The plot is clearly original and the actors are two of my absolute favorites. The not-so-good news: "original" is not everyone's buzz when you visit the movies or video stores. Also listed critics like Mr. Maltin and Roger Ebert dismissed the film as a truly failed attempt to turn a stage play into film form. If I remember correctly, the title was taken from the fairy tale. Stowe's character wrote and it made her a possible subversive and suspicious person in the fictional place where the story takes place. Her dreams are dangerous to the government, represented here by Rickman as the intense manipulative interrogator. As these two people are virtually the only one to appear in the film, the director is in a real challenge to keep the viewer attention. In the end I found the whole thing fascinating. Not flawless and certainly not for everyone, but rewarding. It is nowhere near a masterpiece such as Kieslowski's "a short film about killing" or as explanatory as "Dead Man Walking". But if you are in the movies or any of Costa-Gavras' political exciters, you can also appreciate this one. Just don't expect any prior sermons or sequential action sequences to take place.
