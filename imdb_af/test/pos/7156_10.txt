the most "spiritual" movie I've seen long ago. maybe ever. Also one scene around the dining room table, a piece of comic perfection. I understand that a release date is coming in the fall. If it comes to your town and you want to see a movie that reminds you, this is it. Aviva is big in it and she is definitely a future star - (Superbad is now what she's in) - even though the actors look perfectly calibrated. There is a tone used by this movie to surprise you. I won't know what to call it - it's comedy, but the suppression message is so fierce and straightforward that "comedy" isn't a big enough word for it. I love this movie. It's a thinker's comedy. But even that phrase is not really good enough. FTF does have a message and the message should now be heard
