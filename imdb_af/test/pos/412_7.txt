Look, this movie is obscure, brilliant, and a classic that needs in any way. I suppose the powers that have been decided will be transferred to the bakkie forever; Yet we can only pray for the chance to see this one on DVD. I'll say it's even beating the big Phatasm. If you like a dark movie, with many ghostly images, watch this one and watch an 80-year-old horror movie supposed to be.
