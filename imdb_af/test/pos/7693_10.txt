It was an amazing movie, with incredible movie, music, song, story, etc. It is a tragedy that some arrogant families (the Gerswhins or Premingers) make it available from generation to generation. I've seen it all my life again. I just found this site and read why it wasn't available. Sorry for these families for their pettiness. My wife is from Germany and she has never seen the movie. Also my stepchildren or my grandchildren do not have. It is very sad that a film of this depth and quality is not available to them to watch. Where do these families come from, such a sensible, self-evident, selfish, derogatory decision to ban generations from enjoying this movie, these stars, these performances, this music! Release the video and let their world judge and enjoy!
