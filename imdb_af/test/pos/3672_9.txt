My friend and I have never heard of this movie and decided to give it a shot that chose the title from a list of movies on the cable without knowing one thing. As it opened and revealed the throw, we thought, now, how bad can it be? - Kathy Bates, Jonathan Pryce, Rupert Everett, Lynn Redgrave, Dan Akroyd and more. As the story unfolded, we were more and more annoyed with our choice, and the movie soon laughed us aloud. This is not a "big" movie, but it is one of those rare movies that has such a good combination of memorable characters that are "strange to fiction", kind of surreal events I couldn't help but love it. I didn't have a problem suspending my unbelief at some of the wackier story elements, because the intentions of the filmmakers are so sad while still having fun for everyone involved. As others said on IMDb, it's a comfort movie and I won't be surprised if it has become a cult classic.
