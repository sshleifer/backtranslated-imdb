I watched this movie a week ago and I had to convince my friend to come with me because this movie looks like such bad reviews. Sure, it's not a 'Human Traffic' or 'Lock, Stock ...', but it's not a flop at all. I think the fact that there are so many big budget movies right now means it's been ignored, but it shouldn't be. I guess it does to do what it wants to do - we entertain ourselves for an hour and a half and make us feel happy and content. I'd rather go and see it as 'The Mummy', which looks boring. And no, I'm not a teenager. Don't listen to the critics, the Star Wars fans have. This movie is worth seeing, but just seeing the beautiful Luke de Lacey and Rupert Penry-Jones. Go see it!
