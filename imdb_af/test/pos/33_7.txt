Lackawanna Blues is a drama through and through. It describes the life of a strong woman named Rachel Crosby (S. Epatha Merkerson). Rachel is referred to as Nanny by everyone who knows her, but she can easily be called Wonder Woman. She embodied power, willpower, confidence and solution. She had a house she used to house, about every type of person who would reject society. Her tenants consisted of a lesbian, a psychotic war veteran, an official and a host of other vagrants who made the house's miles away from ordinary. Every successive event Rachel handled flawlessly. She was not a dictator without compassion, but she was quite the opposite. She spent compassion, shelter and refuge as much as she overheated herself. <br /> <br /> Merkerson did a good job, but I believe this role was anyway throughout her alley. The movie had a tickle that never ran away from Rachel. Of course, there were dramatic moments, but they had to be expected. Nothing was ever shocking or deeply different from Rachel himself.
