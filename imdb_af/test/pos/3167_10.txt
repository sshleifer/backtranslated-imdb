Initially, I couldn't know if it was an art film or a documentary. The next day I had a unique movie to taste experience or perhaps a revelation. The film is a human quest to destroy everything that exists, including life on earth. That lead is clueless and cold. He is like us all, he wants to get rich, laugh, travel, eat and be entertained. He moves from one place to another in a giant RV without direction or motive to just pass time and entertain himself. By the end it's too late. Since my first view of the US, it has grown on me like a custom dream where life on earth is nothing but a strange experience. I am an artist and a Buddhist and this film communicated my senses. It was an ideal embodiment of inexperience. It may sound strange, but somehow this film could touch me in a profound way like no other. I recommend it.
