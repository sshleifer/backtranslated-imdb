I really have nothing to add to all the other comments except this: For me, the movie looks like a silent movie that is slowly adapted to sound. The text boards that strengthened the story together, the impression I suppose. Along the way, the actors were allowed to leave the stylized, scenic play; Marguerite Churchill looks much like a typical early silent movie heroine at the beginning of the movie, but in the end finer expressions are allowed. Gus, the Sweden ?, reminded me of the comic characters of Shakespeare plays, and Windy sounded to me like an early Donald Duck. <br /> <br /> It really surprised me that it was all filmed out, in place, and although the dust of all the wagons, horses and cattle hid the view, it really had to be so for the real settlers ! It was also clear to me that many of the Indians really should have been, and I didn't notice any unwavering racism towards them. And John Wayne looks so incredibly young! As someone who became a true Wayne fan by John Ford, and thought Stage Coach Wayne was the first to be a leading star, this film was a revelation. The plot is very simple, reminds me of a silent movie, but the shit is indeed very real! A wonderful film made with the technique and under the circumstances in 1930.
