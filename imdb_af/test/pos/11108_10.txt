I really fell in love with the characters. They were many on earth, but each one had a hidden dark side. Kind of a mystery. David Graysmark, himself, was a mystery. The secret fears and only secrets in general he had. There was a whole side of him that the other characters didn't know anything and it left the audience either wondering or accepting. There was always a part of this man that he would stay hidden, but he would also share a bit of himself. He was the strong male main character and I admire that kind of character. Billy Moses himself is an amazing actor who can do just about any part! He is a wonderful talent and a good man. His fans love, respect and support him infinitely. <br /> <br /> Since this performance he has gone on many other projects and has stretched his acting ability a little more and very well. Kudos to him and all the other actors of this show for such an excellent job! I wish them all well. I wish the series would continue! It's so sorry that it didn't!
