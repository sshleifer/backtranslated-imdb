As a fan of the old Doctor Who, and after the mediocre Fox movie, I was doubtful about this new series of Doctor Who. I've already given it a chance, and I'm so glad I have. <br /> <br /> Yes, some episodes are not as brilliant as others, but they are all nice and yes, Eccleston's doctor is far from any we have before, but ... Eccleston's doctor is not about the best there is. His appearance is sometimes comical, with others dramatic, sometimes quite crazy, but always fantastic. <br /> <br /> These, and Bille Piper as Rose, make this series a cut above the rest (Camille Coduri is also fantastic as Rose's mother), and there is a depth to this series that is not yet present was not. This series is incredibly powerful, especially in light of its Sci-Fi. I mean who would have thought that you could ever feel like a Dalek or even called out for a Dalek, how many times in the history of this series we had moments like those with Rose's father, the Emergency Doctor and the " You were fantastic ... so was I a final speech? I advise anyone, or a fan of Doctor Who or even TV drama to buy this set on DVD, really "Fantastic!". <br /> <br /> Only 4 episodes of the latest series (and looking forward to the new Cybermen). I have to say that David Tennant's doctor is just not that good, of course you can't agree, but I don't think his doctor can see those emotional moments in the previous series. I also have to say that this series is not as good as the last, but Sarah Jane & K9's return was a fantastic episode, a real gem. Not to mention this series is not good, just not quite as good. <br /> <br /> So whether you like it or not, and whether you prefer Tennant or Eccleston, the doctor is back and he's here to stay. "Fantastic!" - Almost as much "Fantastic!" Is like the doctor! -
