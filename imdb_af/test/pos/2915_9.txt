This is not what you would call a happy story. The titled main character (Edmund Purdom as the Egyptian) does not get the bile - although he (?) Apparently gets the 'last' word, does the otherwise faithful figure (Michael Wilding as well as the politically-myopic pharaoh) tragically come before the wrong guy? Even though it is older-grown, it is won-all marbles. Peter Ustinov may have been the best part (Kafka) and may have probably stole some if it wasn't most of the movie, except for Jean Simmons, a bit better than an average barmaid (earnings) just on ball ?? intellectually and spiritually, as the rest of them are composed. <br /> <br /> The breeding and pessimistic Sinuhe, the doctor (? It's Purdom) is portrayed as a dark, cynical, tortured soul who spends the whole plot ?? his lifetime, seek the meaning of "life". (VAT, and to paraphrase John Lennon, is 'Life' what happens when you make other plans.) Forget about the lack of philosophical depth in the previous legal commentary, but eventually the plot is unfolded to reveal it! <br /> <br /> And if we don't talk philosophically, as if it's not mean and negative enough, John Carradine (as the unnamed grave robber) appears in a como role in the middle of the movie that 'life 'is basically meaningless and is worth living as a poor alternative to the ultimate eventual disappointment. <br /> <br /> So here are more than 200 words in it and I didn't really have a friendly word, so why did I assess it so high? Well, there are many Shakespeare tragedies and a lot of moral value in it. There are ethical contrasts, true friendships, true and pristine (almost) love, and - despite the limitations of the production capabilities of the 50's, it is very good (healthy), satisfying both the eye and the ear, and many good / equally strong. For the most part, the acting is uniformly very good? as it is a 50-year-old costume drama, and the interactions are credible to the characters' fatal mistakes - which are abundant and do justice to the best of the Greek tragedy. <br /> <br /> There is some redemption, Sinuhe discovers and embraces his son ?? played by Tommy Retigg who, in spite of Ustinov's best efforts, really needed Lassie to pull it off. A few other 'deceived' souls get their just desserts ?? the 'strange' meatball Nefer (Bella Darvi) ?? apparently in Egypt on a carnal exploitation work study visa, which was previously cruelly even ruthlessly pronounced Sinuhe - and the wandering Princess Baketamon (Gene Tierney as Pharoah Wilding's sister), who knew a deep dark secret of Sinuhe's ancestry tried to use it to put him against his friend, her brother, Pharaoh? nice people, huh. <br /> <br /> Purdom's performance is actually something to see. He carries the good enough that somewhere before the end of the pix you want to hit him over the pillow, grab him with the patches and say, "Look dummy pull yourself together, the glass is not half empty, it's half full!" ?? And then you find yourself personally disappointed in Horemheb - truly Sinuhe's best friend (Victor Mature as Pharoah's Top Soldier) for himself who has the flaw in his character that prevents him from doing anything positive. <br /> <br /> I wonder if the secret to the whole movie is that it reaches very fast and then maintains the necessary "suspension of unbelief" and gets you understanding and worry about the characters, caring to the point that you feel really sorry for them and they missed chances of happiness; a happiness that was otherwise not so far off their grasp. <br /> <br /> I can't understand why this one is not already on DVD and hope it will be fixed soon.
