It's been a long time since such an original, rather funny, black comedy arrived. If "Eating Raoul" is on your top 100 list, do yourself a favor and immediately find "Undertaking Betty". The subject of death is funny has previously been attempted (see Paul Bartel and Mary Woronov in "Mortuary Academy"). While that movie has some brilliant moments of black comedy, "Undertaking Betty" is much more stable, with a better role. Who can think that the enterprise industry can be fruitful for an original, uplifting and hearty comedy? I was surprised and you will be too. I recommend seeing "Undertaking Betty" - NOTE
