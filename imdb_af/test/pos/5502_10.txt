For some inexplicable reason, Jerry's movies often appeared in certain sections for diatribes, although they were rarely cashed. This is one of life's great mysteries to me because his films always had a good feeling about them for me. But this movie is not only bad: it is a very good and clever comedy. For those who can be cheated with a modern "rude or cruel humor, don't see this movie: there's nothing in it and you'll waste your time. <br /> <br /> I just saw this movie once I have been waiting for it to be seen again and it was quite a few years ago. You would think of the idea of ​​an arrogant millionaire businessman on the road to winning the Nazi war with his own small private army Well, just Jerry Lewis will try such a plot for an out and out comedy and it works, I have to say brilliantly. <br /> <br /> I think it, like 'The Nutty Professor' and most of his Other Movies, this movie is testimony to his comic genius, both in concept and performance. I think Buddy Love might have said, "You know, true comedy can't just make a six-year hysterical, it will do it for his dad too. "Perhaps a couple of naughty Nazi generals with monks and a limp will make this movie honest be. If you only see one comedy in your life, see this one. Be careful though, you may die. And I'm not joking!
