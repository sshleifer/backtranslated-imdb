I only saw the movie in the theater two years ago and fell in love with this dark story of two breeding teenage sister who handles with their father and stepmother at home in their large mansion. Their relationship with their stepmother is the least tense, with the stepmother becoming increasingly unstable in her struggle with the younger girls. However, the film shifts with Oriental-style ghost effects and horror, adding a strange and disturbing aspect to the story, which is not clear at first sight, but is becoming more intriguing. <br /> <br /> The direction is incredibly good. , and the play is beautiful, with the stepmother in particular amazing stuff swinging from one voice style to another in the movie. The big house adds honesty, and there are plenty of points in the movie where you will jump out of your seat. This film for me clearly shows why Korean cinema is possibly the best original in the world. You simply can't find anything in the Western world, unfortunately and I can really influence it in the next decade on filmmakers around the world. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended look to me, a real joy and scare ...
