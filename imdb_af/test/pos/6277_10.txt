To be honest, it's probably the best version in my book as a sound movie version of the Jazz Singer. The 1927 version is really a quiet movie despite its build up as the first talkie. <br /> <br /> Danny Thomas is a good comedian, and he sings very well. He is feeling the Jewish things. Peggy Lee is wonderful and any movie she has is always entertaining. Allan Joslyn is not entertaining and we could have done without him. One question: Since when did Cantors live in such luxury homes ???
