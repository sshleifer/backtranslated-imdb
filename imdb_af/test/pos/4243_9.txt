Chucky's bride starts late one night as officer Bob Bailey (Vince Corazza) sneaks into the witness room at his police station and, under all the horror film in joke jokes, he steals the remnants of the Chucky doll who owned Charles Lee Ray's ceremony back in the original Child's Play (1988). He drives the remains to a remote area where Ray's ex girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) cuts Bailey's throat and takes the remains back to her trailer. There Tiffany stitches and hooks Chucky (pronounced by Brad Dourif) again and using a 'voodoo for dummies' book brings him back to the murderous life. Thing is not going to be like Tiffany hoped and Chucky seems to be not the man of her dreams. She joins him in a toy, where Chucky is less than happy. While Tiffany takes a bath, Chucky escapes her, deploys her, and uses the book. Bring her back to life in the form of a female doll dressed as a bride. Also, do not want to stick in plastic bodies and have to work together to get to a cemetery in New Jersey where Ray's natural body is buried with the amulet needed to return their spirits to human bodies. The bodies of Tiffany's neighbor Jesse (Nick Stabile) and his girlfriend Jade (Katherine Heigl), who are both underway from Jade's corrupt uncle, police chief Warren Kincaid (John Ritter) will do well. . <br /> <Br /> Targeted by Ronny Yu I love Chucky bride. Don Mancini's script is very fun, very fast moving, highly entertaining and refers to many other horror movies of good love. From the opening sequence where our Jason Voorhees hockey mask sees the Friday's 13th film, Freddy Krueger's razor glove is from the A Nightmare on Elm Street series and Michael Myers mask from the Halloween franchise. At the cuts used by Bride or Frankenstein (1935) when it recreates almost the same scene. Chucky's bride never takes himself seriously, just as well, there are many one liners, self-referring gags that Scream (1996) made a few years earlier and it doesn't seem scary to make fun on itself and the horror -genre in general. I love the scene if Jesse and Jade have a rocky, romantic conversation that Chucky hears and he makes funny derogatory comments and gestures throughout. It is not to say that there is not a damn good movie in it either, because it certainly does. Director Yu manages to create good atmosphere and a real sense of fun, both human and plastic sets of characters are likeable and shine because each pair suffers from their own sets of household problems that will naturally cause the path of bodies they leave behind. Chucky Technical Bride is great for the most part and has that great budget polish about it and at about $ 25,000,000 I have to hope so. The only thing I will say is that some of the doll effects by Kevin Yagher are a bit stiff and unconvincing, nor can I remember any CGI scenes in Chucky's Bride. Fortunately, the film does not forget the blood and gore with a cool slit throat, nails in someone's face presumably a Hellraiser (1987) tribute, people being placed on glass bottles, one wiped out by a large truck, lip piercing & various stabbings & gunshots. The acting is pretty good and Dourif as Chucky is very funny, because he spins one liners out. I also like the scenes with Tiffany at the beginning and find her very sexy when wearing all the fetish equipment, I can't be the only one? I personally think Bride of Chucky is a fantastic movie, total entertainment from start to finish, good humor and horror in equal measure and in just 85 minutes it's never boring or sowing. A personal favorite of mine, watch it as soon as you can!
