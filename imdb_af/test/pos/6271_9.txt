This movie, Blade Master, can be inexpensive, clumsy in appearance and sometimes it is just a matter of problems beyond the era this film is set. Ator is the elect who must protect the earth from a terrible weapon, which is compared to the atomic weapon in an unforgettable and unpredictable way. He goes through stumbling blocks as a shiny character who is more than muscular, though he is a lot. I would say this aspect of the movie makes a movie like Conan outdo the barbarian, which is the least I can say, totally brainless. This in no way diminishes the great adventure movie Conan is, but it does give Ator his health he doesn't share with the barbarian. For a lower budget movie, this movie is good in terms of the environment and the battles are credible most of the time. Zor, the villain, is one of the most interesting psychological confrontations in the film that gives the movie a thrill, even though Ator seems to be losing the job. <br /> <br /> What gives this movie that little extra is those scenes that may seem strange but worth mentioning. The battle with the snake god, even though he is a giant puppet, is well handled because the snake, with good lightning, remains a silhouette and the battle is pretty convincing. The movie climbs in a very unusual way, quite anachronically but breathtaking: the deltaplane sequence. The scene itself is not properly introduced, after which Ator got the machine, it is pretty unconvincing, but it leads to a very poetic and beautiful middle row, which is stand alone, is the highlight of the movie, which Ator raised. a place where little human fantasy was heroes. <br /> <br /> If Blade Master isn't one of the fantastic fantastic movies of all time, it's not a surprise because of its lack, it's a bigger surprise, considering the philosophical way what he chooses on the confrontation between good and evil, the truth it speaks and the heart it shows, that this movie is so uncomfortable. I propose it to every fan of the genre and try to take it seriously as an intelligent movie that needs to be taken more seriously than it seems.
