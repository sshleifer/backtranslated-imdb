Michael is probably too cuddly for most action movie lovers and Hollywood for the intellectual crowd, but I have both been very funny and touching, despite being both cuddly and formative. <br /> <br /> When three skeptics are sent for investigation, a man claiming to be an angel who eventually accompanies them on a large tour of the Midwestern countryside, just to find that their own hearts are in need of investigation. <br /> <br /> When taken film apart, as with most movies today, there is not much new material, but if taken as a whole, it has a refreshingly original approach and that is enough to entertain one throughout. <br /> <br /> Although not a "family" movie, it is suitable for all ages and a good movie to share with the whole family or that special person. <br /> <br /> "Michael" is not a good movie, but definitely a good movie, a touch movie, and worth seeing. <br /> <br /> KWC
