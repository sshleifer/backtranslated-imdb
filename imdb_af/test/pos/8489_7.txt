Ray lives on <br /> <br /> Ray-Taylor Hackford Cast-Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Regina King, Clifton Powell, Curtis Armstrong and Sharon Warren. Written by- Taylor Hackford and James L. White. Rating- *** <br /> "Hit the road Jack, and don't come back anymore, no more, no more, NO MORE!" Who would have thought that this immortal line that has almost become a remedial mantra for broken relationships in popular culture originated from a lover's fate! Ray Charles was a genius. And if there was one thing he knew, breathing and living; it was music. So in a lifetime of acute poverty, a desperate struggle with darkness, guilt, drugs and painful affairs; Ray still had moments when inspiration struck him from nowhere and words and notes took their own form to form an immediate eternal classic! <br /> <br /> There are a few lives that deserve to be transformed into the silver screen. Ray Charles's life was one of them. It is almost a shock to learn that this project had no studio support until it was completed! And the background probably came after the initial performances where Jamie Foxx's performance was praised and predicted as a surest Oscar winner in silence. Jamie Foxx as Ray almost convinces us that it is indeed Ray Charles acting on the screen and not an actor who embodies! From the crooked, all-knowing smile to the curved passage of not so many disabled people, but a man dancing through his demons, Foxx captures every essence of the real Ray Charles. Ray was a complicated man. He never demanded sympathy and seldom showed it. A smart businessman, he has secured his success at any price, sometimes at the price of his loved ones. He never apologized for his ways and always insisted that he loved his family, which we believe he did. He likes sex; it was as simple as that! But underneath there was also a Ray who was afraid of the darkness. Imagine the abominations of a blind man who is afraid of darkness! His fear was because of his guilt. Ray was convinced that he was the reason for his brother's death, and his whole life was spent delivering himself. Ray was a maverick that fuses the gospel with jazz, an unprecedented blasphemy in the 50's. But his intentions were not to encourage. He was just practicing the only way he knew to be near God! <br /> <br /> It is difficult to capture such an eventful life as Ray, and that's where the movie fails. We are never really allowed to come to Ray as a person. We know him as much as we see him. His relationships, especially with Margie Hendricks (Regina King), are not extensively investigated. And the script barely goes over Della Bea (Kerry Washington), Ray's wife, who knows everyone, was a rock at his side. And the biggest blunder of all is the hectic, almost abrupt climax. It's as if the director suddenly realized he was out of stock and asked for a parcel! Nevertheless, Ray is definitely recommended for a flawless performance by Jamie Foxx and a capable star ensemble. The songs and age create a sense of nostalgia, and we get a sincere feeling that the film is made with sincerity. <br /> <br /> - Abhishek Bandekar <br /> <br /> Note: "Ray" is nominated in six categories at this year's Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor (Jamie Foxx) . <br /> <br /> Rating - *** <br /> <br /> * Poor ** Average *** Good **** Very Good ***** Excellent <br /> <br /> February 19, 2005
