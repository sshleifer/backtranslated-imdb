This Fox spectacle was a big hit when it was released in 1954. It is badly produced, with good music and sets, intriguing, but moving slowly but interestingly. Edmund Purdom is remarkably attractive as an Egyptian who becomes a well-known doctor. He wears three beautiful women: a handmaiden Jean Simmons who sees him passively, a seductive Bella Darvi who evades him, and a Pharoah's sister, Gene Tieney, who wants him as her Pharoah. The movie's popularity has not diminished, as it is displayed again on AMC (preferably in widescreen). Purdom is extremely good, apparently knocking out his character with the women, and never ends up married and a "thinker". Darvi is incredible and seductive in her femme fatal role. Victor Adult, Michael Wilding, co-founder Peter Ustinov. Look at that.
