Man and woman doctors team Carole and Niles Nelson do modestly in their careers, but Niles has a gambling problem. His luck changes when he (unwittingly) saves the life of a Joe Gurney gang's gangster, and he gets a huge bonus from the gang leader himself. Niles still likes his changes of fortune (and snazzy new apartment), still paying for the injury of other injured gang members. Unfortunately, his shadow comes to light in a police attack, which is also a shadow of his wife's career. <br /> <br /> At this point, the plot comes into focus, as Carole Nelson has to save her career before her license is suspended. This means that the gang is regularly performed more or less one-handedly. <br /> <br /> It's not a hard-earned gangster picture, but a plot that might have been comfortable on a show like MATLOCK or MURDER SHE WROTE. There is tension, but the mood is glowing through Bogart's tongue-in-cheek display of a stupid gangster who presents him as the "Napoleon of Crime". His other gang members also function more than stooges as capital letters. And there's a funny dialogue between Bogart and Francis, especially when she deals with his injuries at his hideout. Of course, as in all gangster flashes, there is a big shooting, but with a humorous twist. It's a good short film that shows Bogart on his rise to stars.
