"Home Calls" is a wonderful romantic comedy that can best be described as "how they used it." It stares Walter Matthau (in one of his best roles) as a recent widowed doctor who goes out again on the dating scene and hits payee as he has another wife every night. He then met hospital patient Glenda Jackson and soon developed a relationship with her. But it is one that will be severely tested as she informs him that she is a one-man woman and expects him to be a one-man. <br /> <br /> It's a lovely, very funny movie that also starred Art Carney. senile hospital administrator and Richard Benjamin as Matthau's friend and fellow doctor. It's a must have for any Matthau fan or any fan of light comedy. <br /> <br /> You won't be disappointed.
