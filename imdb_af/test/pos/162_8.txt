Three children were born exactly the same during a lunar eclipse. Just before their 10th birthday, they start with a deadly spree. "Bloody Birthday" is a typical treasure from the early 80's. It's a pretty average stuff with lots of nudity. evil children never cause any threat and there is almost no tension. There is also no gore or scares in "Bloody Birthday", but the movie is generously entertained. Unfortunately, there is no real explanation for the children who are suddenly murdered. The murder tones are totally horrible, for example, we have death with handgun, baseball bat, skipping rope and kick. So if you're a fan of the early 80's movie films, give this one a look.
