I find it hard to believe that this movie has such a low rating. It is probably one of the best comedies ever made, and definitely the best Bollywood comedy of the 90's. The film didn't do too well on the box and people had diametrically opposed reactions after seeing it. My guess is that most people don't expect it to be an all-out comedy and expect a regular movie. If you like comedies, it's a must-see. And Aamir Khan is outstanding.
