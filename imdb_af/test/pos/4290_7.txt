Separate LIES changed my life. Actually, the Q&A did. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS BELOW. Just read if you're looking at trailers or if you've seen them: <br /> <br /> The Emily Watson character cheats on the Tom Wilkonson character. My first reaction to the puppy-eye Emily was "It's over. Dump her. Bad riddance." For some reason he was trapped. Not in a pathetic way. He just listened. And try to accept her needs. Sometimes he had to leave. But he held her and let her live. But I still wanted to see her <br /> <br /> Then the writer and director Julian talked about the movie. I'm glad he did, because honestly I'm for you and was too immature to get the point before breaking it down for me. <br /> <br /> Tom's character loved her, and no matter how much her quest for her needs differs from what he wants, he will always love her. The relationship and love they shared was not suddenly a lie, just because she wanted to be with someone else. The fact that she wanted to be with someone else didn't make her what she was. If you are over fifty, there is a strong chance that the love of your life will not come again, so you cannot be as intense as you were when you were younger. You have to try to make things work, because the alternative can be much worse. <br /> <br /> She needs what she needs, and she can't help it. He had to learn to let go of her if he were the full man he could be. He helped her in pursuit of her lover, even when it hurt him. <br /> <br /> Another thing: Julian said the strongest tool of a controller is debt. <br /> <br /> Weather: The strongest instrument of a controller is debt. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, Tom released her burden. He had a need to let her know that he loved her, but not to get her back; he wanted to let her know that she should not be convicted or bad about the relationship, just because it ended in such a terrible way. <br /> <br /> It's not my way to review a movie based on The Message, rather than the performance, especially if I understand the message better if explained to me by the director. but I make an exception here because I feel one more mature than I will benefit from the movie. <br /> <br /> Performing the movie was a nice, British fit. Rupert was smart and rebellious. Tom and Emily were their regular, real characters.
