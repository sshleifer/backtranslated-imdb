Spoilers !!! To understand what really happened, you must first be a warrior to stay in the right war, to think off-line, analytically, critically and not linearly. Otherwise, you will make false conclusions that Maj.Gray was stupid or unstable. Truth is something completely different. He was a solid hardened veteran and the only way he could be killed by Capt. O'Malley is wanting him to kill him. It was his way out. He chooses it. He was not a man to retire. If you've never been to a first line, you can't understand it. He deliberately committed his own suicide. First, he seduced Maria Jane, intentionally regarded as a stupid, as he did - an incident closed to witnesses (to protect her later after she did what he wanted when she came to the trial) , as her son has a bullet. assured that he could later load her rifle), came the night, loaded her rifle, woke her up, put her gun in her hands, acted as he attacked her, after she first shot and killed one. shot him again and died before death, he cut down the knife, because he wanted to jump him back after the first shot. He also gave her a message with his last cry. "After the first death, everything will change your mind and destroy your life. This is the only way I can die as a man, but to be killed by someone I love is my choice and my only privilege, war and army is not What you have thought so far, eventually grows and saves your life until you can. "At the end she left military life. She understood him. And he did not die in vain. The man who helped him to prepare it all and then conducted the trial and the outcome of the trial was spotlight. Sam Doran with the help of Lt. Tim Macy. Macy didn't know what was really going on and what would be the outcome but did what he expected to do. He took photos of Mary Jane and Maj.Gray on the order of Kol. Sam Doran who gave that order because Maj.Gray asked him to do so. After she refused to leave the army (which Col.Doran had asked her to do), Doran convinced the prosecutor to charge her with a premeditated murder (he knew she couldn't be found illegally) instead of killings (there was a possibility of being illegal) with photos taken. Col.Doran also suppresses an incident to prevent the prosecutor from having any doubts about the premeditated murder charge, but let it be made public at the hearing, which has significantly influenced the jury. I have no doubt about the outcome of that trial. Why has charcoal. Doran did that? Because he'll do something. Maj.Gray asks him to do. Why? Because he saved his life on a battlefield. Why Mary Jane Chooses to Trial? Because she is a person who has integrity, a principle. And therefore Maj.Gray choose her. It must earn someone, someone honorable. To keep his secret about what really happened that night, she also proves her honor. <br /> <br /> Miroslav
