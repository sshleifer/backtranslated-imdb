Looking at the Wagonmaster, unlikely to lead to deep thoughts, unlike many other great Ford movies, such as The Searchers, My Darling Clementine, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance and The Drues of Wrath, gives a sense of awe and depth of satisfaction. The story is very simple: two cowboys decide to help a Mormone wagon train to go to California. Along the way they walk into a medicine man whose mules ran away, a group of bank robbers, and some Navajos. There is plenty of adventure and excitement on the trail, and the movie is full of fun and beauty. The music is absolutely beautiful. The scenery, again from Monument Valley, is as beautiful as ever. Plus, how can you go wrong with James Arness? The Wagonmaster may not be one of John Ford's better-known films, but it's a must-see if you get the chance. 9/10.
