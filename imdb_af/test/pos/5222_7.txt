"Father Hood" is a leftover jewel of a "road movie". Fine performances by Halle Berry, Sabina Lloyd and Brian Bonsall, two very fun top-up games by Diane Ladd and Michael Ironside, <br /> <br /> and a straight-forward one by Patrick Swayze. The movie is helped by an unconventional storyline, but badly interrupted by the backlash of the flash, resulting in a formal, abrupt end. "Father Hood" would have worked much better without these "books". Nonetheless, the film brings important issues of "family responsibilities" and the consequences of state interference. As long as the foster system rewards state institutions to NOT place children, such offenses will exist. <br /> <br /> Select this one. This is worth the trip.
