Offspring are about a man and woman who experience loss of time while making love. Completely unaware of what this bizarre experience means they are trying to continue with their lives. The hubby begins to question the bizarre event and gets help from a very annoying psychiatrist. He believes strangers are responsible for this decay in time and that the unborn baby he once thought she and his wife actually belong to the strangers. <br /> <br /> If you ask me, it's a good scifi / horror story. Taking a highly dubious real-life scenario involving alien abduction and hybrid breeding is definite thumbs of this guy. I love all things related to strangers and this story has certainly delivered good ideas. So if you also share an interest in things alien, you should be very happy with the offspring. At least story-wise anyway. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the movie is generally quite average. With average action by all actors. Yes, even by the consistently immense Mr. Dourif, who is still performing the best. Although the blackhead doctor, his lines do very well. There are a few points in the movie where some of the delivery is circular or laudable, which is good in my book. I like them cheesy and it had a little nice stinky cheese, and I mean it in a good way. <br /> <br /> Anyway, with an inferior script, you can't really blame all actors. . I especially didn't mind the mother hysteria where the movie was playing. She wanted a baby so bad that she would neglect and dismiss everything her lovely husband (doctor!) Told her. It almost reached a point where you didn't really care what happened to her. <br /> <br /> The progeny are another movie by Brian Yuzna of the icky-sticky film, Society. Again, he delivers a slender effect, and again he delivers a very unique story of horror. If you're in scifi / horror or a fan of Dourif and Yuzna movies, there's no real reason not to watch this movie if you get the chance. A friendly 7 out of 10.
