Never played kisses yet. Drew Barymore as Reporter Josie Gellar is a lovely, extremely juicy and sometimes painful story of a crook, called Josie Gellar, who is both brilliantly quiet and ashamed and never kissed by a man. She is dedicated to her first major news story for the newspaper that she is working to host as a high school student with the popular cool kids, and gets an overview of what's really going on in the world of high school. Only problem is Josie has never been popular. High school was actually a traumatizing experience for her, as she was the recipient of many harassment and cruel jokes. Josie grabs this command so much to finally fit in to get a kick. What she finds is the main point of the story. <br /> <br /> Never kissing is one of those movies that is so juicy and Schmaltzy at times, especially in a few scenes at the end that the limits of credibility have been tested a lot and a lot of cynic power not this movie. However, this was done very well. Drew Barymore is perfect like the clumsy, but lovely Josie she blows a fresh air into the character and makes her look perfectly realistic. I also enjoyed Leelee Sobiesky as the intellectual student Josie enjoys on her first day at school. <br /> <br /> Never kissed, has some very funny moments like Josie moving in her painful attempts to be cool. Example-the reggae bar scene. I also have the look of Josie's brother Rob, who is also going back and reporting as a high school student, the way he helps Josie's dream of finally fit in, just hilaries. At the same time, as Josie's unfortunate story of her original years at high school being shown in flashback, it's very painful. You don't have to have similar experience at high school to Josie to be affected by her story. Drew is wonderful to have her character a personal relationship with the audience and we have been worshiping Josie from the beginning. <br /> <br /> There are a lot of "common girls" a 2004 edition, in this movie, but average girls were honestly more reason. Never kiss, get very romantic, because Josie develops feelings for a certain man and the question will come together. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. It was really done beautifully in some areas. The movie is in some places, yes, the last scene-realistic - no way - does this movie manipulate your emotions in the obvious Hollywood way? Oh yeah yeah, baby! But it manipulates beautifully, there are a few lessons to be learned here. The film never preaches but drives an accurate picture of what high school was for some selection. I actually met people who had similar experiences with Josie. I met a lot of people like all these characters. I think many people simply know or cannot conceive of the cruelty that can exist in the world. of high school, and how hurt it can be, but it is there. Not unrealistic. What struck me was Drew's speech at the prom because she shows the "sheep mentality" that is so common, such as Hollywood and manufactures so much thought it might be, it was well done and very true. <br /> <br /> I never kiss, sound much heavier than it is, in fact, it's a perfect movie to choose from when you want a nice, light, heart-warming image. It is endearing, lovely and just Rufus. I want to say, check it out. 8 out of 10.
