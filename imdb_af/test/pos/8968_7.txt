Consistency may be the biggest problem with this movie. The movie starts out as a fast, attractive and just fun political satire, but in the second half the role in a nearly Oliver Stone is similar. This, of course, is also a very serious topic, but I would say the movie would have been better and more effective if it was done in the same style as the first half of the movie being shot. <br /> <br /> For a movie and a movie about the subject of this movie, the movie is also pretty short with just 102 minutes of running. The movie because it feels it doesn't tell the whole story. Of course, the events following the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan are being revamped in the movie, but the film does not go deeper and it does not explain much about it, which feels like a cheap way to glorify Charlie. Wilson, without showing the other side of the medal. The actual events in the movie itself are also simplified, although the story is sometimes (unnecessarily) complex at times. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie would have been better if it didn't. Be so serious at times and overall more light with its style and atmosphere. For example, the movie should have been more like "Wag the Dog", which has found a real combination of satire and sensitive political issues. <br /> <br /> Due to this incoherent style and way of storytelling, the theater shows are also mixed. When Tom Hanks plays his character more playfully and in a more comical way, he is just excellent. But it just makes it difficult to take his character seriously in the more serious and sensitive / shocking moments of the movie. Philip Seymour Hoffman is always excellent because he is in any movie he plays. He also received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. Most of the other actors just seem to be walking around in this movie, just to be in the movie. It's mostly for Julia Roberts, whose character I just found too secretive to have a clear purpose for the movie. She made an excess impression on me and is therefore really forgotten in this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not that the movie is a bad watch, it's actually pretty good and also enjoyable, but if the movie would have dared to be a little more edgy, the movie would be a better and most effective one than it has naturally achieved. <br /> <br /> 7/10
