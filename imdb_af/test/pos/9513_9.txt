As a spectacle it is difficult to blame Nihon chinbotsu. The Japanese people benefited from their intimate relationship with the sea and the concept of the film implies that a whole world and lifestyle is in danger - thanks to its volcanic heritage. From the point of view of reality, it is quite silly to have a drama in which all of Japan disappears under the waves; why only Japan? <br /> <br /> Rather, suppose we have cinematic reality, fueled by spectacle (and popcorn), and some can affect it very much. Compared to adventures with Japanese radioactive monsters, it comes down to more mature and better pace. The emotional element is underplayed, and it really works. (However, it loses a bit with the remaining theme song at the climax.) <br /> <br /> Is Nihon chinbotsu credible? Probably not, but the exciting outbursts, and the relaxed pacing make a pleasurable one-night entertainment.
