I can't say this movie was a hilarious, but I had to have a smile on my face all the time. I like this darker kind of comedy; "very bad things", "8 heads in a duffel bag" or "cold-blooded" <br /> <br /> The way the main character tries to get away with murder is fun to watch. To me it wasn't much of a surprise that would end, but the way the end came was. Another thing that stands out is the way they managed to engage the audience. The way Terry looks at us is hilarious, you can almost do as if you were his accomplice.
