"Pink Flamingos" is a cult classic. The plot of this movie revolves around the throwing challenge after Divine's rule as the dirtiest person alive. "Pink Flamingos" contains some memorably repulsive scenes such as a sex scene with a chicken and the scene where divine eating fresh dog feces. Yes, the movie is shocking and funny at the same time, but the biggest laugh comes from the actors' lines. Look especially at this line of Divine: "Kill everyone! Condone first-degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat! S! Dirty is my politics! Dirt is my life!". Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. His tagline "An Exercise in Bad Taste" must be taken to heart. movies today can find this jewelery difficult to stomach. highly recommended.
