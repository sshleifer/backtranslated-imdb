Despite the title and unlike other stories about love and war, this film is not too tough and pink, because love is like a rose: With thorns, that is. The four leading actors set their characters realistic and with a good sense and balance between the tragic and the abyss. <br /> <br /> The music and lyrics of the cabaret / chanson-esquire songs (sung B Keira Knightley himself) drag the viewer deeper and deeper into the film, from one place to another, between the cruel war and beneath the peaceful love. Some people find it too much biopsy, but it is mostly a romantic story, although it follows the life of Dylan Thomas and the triangular relationship that comes through joy and jealousy. <br /> <br /> Once, London is visualized from a different angle. The bohemian life of Dylan during the bombing of the Germans sits in a swinging atmosphere of small bedrooms, bars and bars. The independent women, the soldier and the charismatic poet are constantly swept into both feelings of love and anger. <br /> <br /> Maybe the end is turning and hanging slightly loose on the rest of the movie, but it's all a wonderful romantic story.
