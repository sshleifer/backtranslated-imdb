Extremely entertaining mid-1950s western packed much in a 96 minute time. Most viewers will be drawn into this story quickly and will find the experience very enjoyable. More than just a B-West, but not actually an epic, the budget was modest and the price was payable despite several big names. Glenn Ford was the only flyhalf at the time. Edward G. Robinson and Barbara Stanwyck were beyond their primes and looking for work, Stanwyck was 10 years away from a new popularity in "The Big Valley". Brian Keith and Dianne Foster just started. <br /> <br /> Ford plays John Parrish, a small farmer who decides to sell out when the sympathetic sheriff is murdered by the farmer's (Robinson) hired armed man. Parrish is a former Confederate official who has just left for health reasons. <br /> <br /> Robinson plays Lee Wilkison, who already owns most of the valley and intends to acquire the rest. He made a promise to his wife Martha (Stanwyck). Lee was lame in a land war he fought 12 years ago; his brother Cole (Keith) came from Texas to help him run the huge spread. Lee watched a blind eye to the obvious connection between Stanwyck and Keith, but sensitive daughter Judith (Foster) is understandably upset about what's going on in their home. <br /> <br /> John Parrish promised his fianc√©e Caroline (May Winn) that he would move east. Caroline, who is modeled on Grace Kelly's "High Noon" character, breaks down the losing at the first sign of trouble and just disappears from the movie. It opens the way for a John and Judith romance to develop. <br /> <br /> The violence starts early and lasts throughout the film. Parrish can apply military tactics to an enemy who underestimates his ability and determination. He has a very original confrontation with the main camp fighter about halfway through the film. Ford plays one of his standard characters; the modest man who disarms everyone in a self-defeating manner, who is slowly but brutally offended, but eventually challenged (much like his role in The Sheepman). <br /> <br /> Robinson is also excellent as a man who maintains his personal integrity, though physically just a shadow of his former self. And he gets enough lines and screen time to properly develop his character. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck has the most difficult role and she is simply not convincing as the classic two-face woman, a seemingly loyal woman who plans to replace her husband with his brother. In part this is because she did not have enough time to do anything more than to convey the side of the character superficially. That said, even with these restrictions, a talented actress could have done a much better job. <br /> <br /> Dianne Foster is a pleasant surprise. She has to remind viewers a lot of Carroll Baker, both physically and in acting. Although it is necessary to play Judith according to the 1950 convention, it may be difficult, but then he must break into hysteria after every major confrontation. Foster shows a good series. She gives Parrish a growing appeal, but makes it so subtle that it is just behind the clues that click into place. <br /> <br /> The real problem with "The Violent Men" is that it is an action western and a character study morality game. Because so much has to happen on the screen, a lot of the action is rushed and many characters only get a smooth treatment. It's not a fatal mistake or a reason to avoid the movie, but it could have been much better with another 20 minutes of running time or the absence of unnecessary characters like Caroline. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
