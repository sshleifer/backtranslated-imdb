It was a very good 1950s western, one of the better ones I saw in a decade that appeared on the screen and on TV. It certainly had three major actors on the market: Glenn Ford, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. It seems that Ford was the star of this movie, while the other two stars were in roles. Ford had the bulk of the dialogue. He was also the "good guy" while Robinson was the "bad guy" and Stanwyck was twice as bad as Robinson. She played the real hard in this movie and the character she played was sometimes too contradictory. <br /> <br /> Ford has treated its lead role very ably, as it usually did - especially in the West. He had a nice old game that didn't want to fight, was a peaceful man ...... but if you pushed him ..... look out! <br /> <br /> The story had a nice mix of action and lulls, not overdo it. It had a vast western environment well used with the CineamaScope widescreen. It also showed realistic people in a realistic environment. That credibility with the characters, especially the supporting players, was the most impressive. The men's road shone the women in this movie, acting and acting. Dianne Foster and May Wynn were weak - the only negative of the production. It's easy to see why these two actresses never starred. <br /> <br /> Although it's more than 50 years old, this western one you still find fast enough to enjoy no matter how old you are. is or what you are used to seeing. For classic movie performers it is almost a must with this role and good story. Highly recommended.
