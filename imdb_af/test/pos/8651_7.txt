A man comes in a strange, beautiful, sterile city where nobody, instead of emotion and obsession, feels about interior design. The essential togetherness of his days is reminiscent of 'Groundhog Day'; The strange parts in and out of this world are reminiscent of 'John Malkovich'. But that's really, it's a Scandanavian movie, a piece of self-satire that is also Scandanavian in style: the tone is tough and even the fantastic scenes are played straight, and you dare to laugh at the absurdity. In my mind, the combination is not entirely successful: there is not enough sincere laugh to compensate for the problems of taking the piece as pure drama. This is definitely original; Perhaps my problem is that the world it is satirizing is not one I recognize. Maybe I should go to Scandanavia!
