This TV adaptation of Sarah Waters's novel was so lovingly done. I can hardly find the words to appreciate it. Not since the "Tipping the Velvet" (also highly recommended) I saw such a show through the lead roles, this time by Sally Hawkins and Elaine Cassidy. They acted with their souls, and that is what is conveyed to the audience! The supporting actors were well chosen, and they made a big ensemble. <br /> <br /> For those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship - no, it's just one part. The other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love. And the plot still has some surprising twists. So the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me too.
