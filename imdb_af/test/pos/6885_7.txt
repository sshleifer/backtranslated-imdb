I walked into Blockbuster with a friend, the other night decided that we were broke and too lazy to be active. She decided she wanted to watch Closer, who looked like a disapproving idea that I had to rent another movie once, she went to bed. Looking around, I didn't see much interest in me, but see The Doll Master in the new release section. Just based on the cover sleeves (a woman with a pop-like face that cries bloody tears) I thought it would be interesting enough to rent. <br /> <br /> As for the movie itself, it looks in an almost empty house, with all the lights off, it was scary. I have to admit that I've always had a phobia of dolls, since I was a kid (and watching a horrible movie called Asylum, one of the stories in which it was involved, was a spiritual patient who was a doll created what killed people Lame, but scary then) and the first three quarters of this movie really hit me. The first half hour was especially wonderful. The creepy, prone atmosphere set the scene well, and without moving, the dolls really threatened. But unfortunately, as soon as they started moving, everyone became a little cheese, I was a little disappointed when moments that might have been really scared made me laugh because they were filmed. <br /> <br /> If For the characters, this is a horror movie, you don't expect anything memorable. I found that I remember the names and faces better than most Asian horror movies I saw, suggesting some hidden character development that I didn't consciously notice. The typical stereotypes are powerful in this movie. Everyone has some kind of character, which separates them from the others, from shy and quiet Yeong-ha and her doll Damien, to the outgoing bimbo Seon-yeong. <br /> <br /> The plot itself was pretty cool, though the end, which bought many of the loose parts of the plot, was a bit confused and didn't really do anything for me, though it did very cool. plot-twists that I will not ruin here. The basic plot is a lot of kids who are invited to be modeled as dolls by a well-known, old-fashioned popmaker. They have to stay in the creepy house (decorated with scary dolls, some big little ones) and things start to happen when our heroine Hae-mi starts exploring areas of the house and things start with the other residents. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would definitely recommend the movie, not to look with too many people, as some of the moments would probably make you laugh when surrounded by friends, but as something in the dark on your own, with the windows and doors just a little open, only if any dolls like to look with you. It really doesn't make you guess for most of the movies, so you can go on wild conspiracy theories to destroy it only later. If you really succeed and ignore it, I can guarantee that you will look under your bed before going to bed and maybe even turning on the lights. <br /> <br /> Or maybe it's just me: P Like Closer, it was OK, but I chose it.
