"The Bridge of the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul" is one of the best music documentaries I've seen lately and is more than a movie about music. It is also a musical love affair about a wonderful city, one of the largest cities in Europe and the world, one of the major cities for the history of Europe and for Islam, the city that will be Europe and the Middle East in the future. East can bridge or reflect again, as has happened in history, the abyss between two worlds. <br /> <br /> Then there's the music. The interesting approach to the music film is that it starts from modern music, and we hear a lot (good) rock and rap in the first third of the movie. And then, like a decline in time, the soundtrack takes us to the roots, Turkish traditional music, commercial romance and the exotic instruments that are basic elements in the landscape of Turkish music. In such a complex and conflict-ridden country as Turkey, the film does not avoid any political aspects, such as censorship implemented by military rule in the 80s or the relevance of the minority songs, especially the Kurdish one. One of the best musical moments is actually presented by a Kurdish singer, with a fantastic voice in a cathedral-shaped hammam (Turkish bath). <br /> <br /> One touches the city and its music at the end of viewing and hearing this movie. I've never been to Istanbul, but after watching this movie, I'm sure I want to visit this place soon.
