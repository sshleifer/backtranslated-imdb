One of the best and most exciting of all conspirators, (there were a number of such films in the 1970s). This one is about an accident at a nuclear reactor and some attempts to cover it. Jack Lemmon is the employee who realizes how dangerous the plant is and Jane Fonda is the crawling television reporter who takes the story on board and both players are at their best. <br /> <br /> The events depicted in the film are, of course, frightening and not least overlooked (much of what happened here happened in real life on the Three Miles Island ) and although it looks like something is a period, it emphasizes how fragile and dangerous a world we have created for ourselves. Expect a number of similar movies about the effects of global warming anytime soon (and not garbage like "The Day After Tomorrow").
