Gulliver's Travels was initially a satirical novel written by a great misanthrope called Jonathan Swift. Therefore, it is not recommended to judge from this movie, by itself. We need to get deeper into human conscience to reach the point where Swift would lead us. Gulliver lived a journey of truth, of loneliness, of fear that could be his true life. We can't just watch that movie and say it's so sweet or so boring. The case is far above that and I would like everyone to expect it. It's the biggest movie ever, as you can feel the truths that come from Ted Danson's character: the memorable Lemuel Gulliver.
