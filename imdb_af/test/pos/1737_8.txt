It was September 2003 that I heard that the BBC would raise DOCTOR WHO and make it "Bigger and Better", but I heard all these rumors in the press and thought it was all they were. Rumors. But it was mentioned that Russell T Davies would produce and write the show extensively and then one Saturday afternoon in March 2004, Channel 4 news maintained the actor in the title role - Christopher Eccleston. Yes, Christopher Eccleston, an actor, I have always been impressed by watching his film debut in LAT HOM. If he had to be interviewed on television, it had to be true. As the months are over, more information is leaked, Billie Piper is thrown, the Daleks will return, and The Mill, the FX for GLADIATOR FX Hollywood company, has been contracted to do the special effects for the show. A few weeks before the first broadcast trailers, the return of the new series announced yesterday, massive billboards in London informed the public about the return of the show. The papers featured massive photos of the strangers and Christopher Eccleston appeared on such diverse programs BLUE PETER, MASTERMIND (which had a special DOCTOR WHO night edition), THIS MORNING AND Friday night with Johnathan ROSS. In fact, this new series of doctors who had to be the most outdated program in the history of British television was better to be bloody. <br /> <br /> So was it bloody good? It's undoubtedly a huge success with almost every episode that made the top ten shows in the TV charts. To give you an idea of ​​his rating success, only one episode (The Ark In Space episode two - February 1975) of the old series made it into the top five TV cards. The episode of the opening series made number three with two more episodes that hit or level the previous record. It is in an era where there is much more competition in terms of TV stations and choices. Let's laugh and cheer on the fact. Doctor who filled, HIT ME BABY A MORE TIME, EARLY WILDING AND ANSWER AND DAYS SATURDAY AFTER TAKEAWAY. Of course, much of the success is the breathtaking footage and the decisive role of a well-known actor in the role. Generally speaking, everything you see on the screen is similar to everything you'll see in a Spielberg / Hollywood movie. There is a Dalek jack-up force calling tens of thousands, exotic aliens, a 19th century Cardiff, which resembles a 19th-century Cardiff and night movie that is actually night movie and is not done by putting a dark filter over the screen no. I promise you will hear much more about the directors working in this series. Joe Ahearne will one day be in the Hollywood A list. <br /> <br /> There are some flaws to the new series of doctors and everyone should be laid at the door of Russell T Davies. It can be controversial whether the soap operation and postmodernist elements are successful or not (in my opinion it is not), but what is not in dispute is that the weakest scripts are all written by RTD. As I mentioned in my review of CASANOVA, he deceived the audience and he does the same thing here: when the armed soldiers show their guns on them. The doctor's call "attack plan delta" that makes no sense to the audience, but allows him to escape from a stiff place, a mere captain Jack suddenly shoots a laser, he is hiding and RTD scripts are full of these kind of cheats and deus ex machina type endings. In fact, the last episode is much wasted by the ridiculous concept of what the "Bad Wolf" is, which looks like RTD from a solid place more than the doctor. And from the end I'm trying to remember if any of them were actually the doctor? More often than it is a supportive character or the doctor's companion who saves the day. The show is called Doctor who is not ROSE TYLER, can we see the title character except the day, just as he did in the classic series? One final point about doctoral portrayal is the way he was written as a smile. Eccleston is especially known for his serious and gloomy roles and he is absolutely breathtaking when he shows grief, like the tear that ends his face in the end of the world, but more often than not, he is written as "Tom Baker on speed "character. It's clear why Eccleston didn't do much in his career. He is not very good at it. <br /> <br /> Do I start to sound like I hate this show? Sorry I didn't mean, but it's just that while some expectations are met or exceeded, some others don't and they are almost all to Russell T Davies who gratefully contributes to writing scripts in the next series of DOCTOR WHO. Let's see more traditional stories of a human outpost threatened by monsters as we saw in the 1960s and 70s. Suggest a story like The Sea Devils with a massive budget directed by Joe Ahearne! O and one last request - Can we see that these "NEXT TIME" trailers have been deleted? They reveal all the best pieces of next week's episode
