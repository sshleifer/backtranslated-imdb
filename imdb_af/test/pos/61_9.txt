The centerpiece of Lackawanna Blues is Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a boarding house character, and unconditional support for a young boy, Ruben, the narrator of the movie. Based on the experiences of writer actor Ruben Santiago-Hudson, the film lovingly creates the upstate New York boarding house and calls on the cultural climate of a world in transition in the 1960s. <br /> <br /> The first half of the movie is virtually non-stop music. In the second half, the different characters in the residence are described more fully. Nanny's ability to "make fragments and make them completely" influences everyone within her sphere. A special lively scene is when she confronts an abusive man and tells him firmly: "If you ever touch that child again, we're going to dance!" As provided by actress S. Epatha Merkerson, the line is so steely and filled with such a solution that the man with the hair trigger hearing in his tracks is frozen. <br /> <br /> From start to finish, Merkerson delivers a commanding presence. Her character ties the diverse lives of the borders in her home. It was a pleasant, hearty movie with a wonderful role. As played by Merkerson, the character of Nanny only radiates love. It's a movie experience I will remember for a long time.
