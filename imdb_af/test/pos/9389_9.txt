I like B-horror movies. However, I'm generally not a big fan of "so stupidly funny" movies. I had to judge it so highly, just because Death Bed: the bed that is eating is one of a kind, and so original. There are many questions, many plot holes, and the WTF factor is shaken up to 11, but I wasn't really bored for a moment. I really couldn't call it dirty. Every minute I said to myself, "What the hell is this bed / movie going to do next!" I watched it with a friend who was by no means a fan of horror or B-movie, and even she was beautiful in it. the effects were really inventive and the colors and atmosphere were pretty good. It has a very consistent and even tone in most of the movie (although it is incredibly ridiculous) and the play is not terrible. I can see from the point that there are certain discrepancies in the operations of the bed that condemn the suspension of faith, but the film itself was such a unique and bizarre concept that it didn't really bother me. seriously, for me, this movie hit that rich of one that i will not only forget but i guarantee that i will think of myself in future about certain scenes. Know someone else from any other movies in the ominous objects people eat genre? absolutely fantastic.
