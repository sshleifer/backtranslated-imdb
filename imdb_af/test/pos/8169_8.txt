Last days is the best gay movie of the gay genre. Most of the movies include juicy stories, one night stand, and don't let us forget infamous baseball teams? Last days, in fact, male love is out of the shore in the dark, and lots of graphic material makes me wonder if the movie belongs to Blockbuster or badpuppy.com. The movie's emotional journey is what sets it above the rest of the genre. Not to this movie I saw a story of such an intense passion and love and the torture it can bring. I think when people are crying during movies, they have to be beaten, but I played through several screens because of the realistic nature of the world we live in. I suggest every gay man sees this movie, and if you have a boyfriend, thank him ...
