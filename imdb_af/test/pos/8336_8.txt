SPOILERS AHEAD ?? For the first ten minutes or so of the Starwatches we are introduced to a quote of typical urban American family unquote in an unnamed city, which is another way of saying Warner Brothers' version of NYC. Except for the young ones, including the beautiful Dickie Moore and Sally Blane, they are a very urgent fate, and their dinner table conversation is annoying and we wish the story would move and bring star Walter Huston. But wait, people, wait. All of a sudden, serious gangster filming breaks out, pulls the family against their will, and then this baby never leaves. There is tension, an Oscar-nominated script, good acting; everything you want old movies to be? it's here. I set a wonderful sales performance; He must be a taste of taste, but his presence is very important to the plot. He was treated to special status in the credits, so Warner Bros. Must have been really high on Sale, but how his older male routine fits in with the public is lost to me. Perhaps it's lost for time, an unknowable factor that you had to be a 1931 filmmaker to understand. The climax is also typically melodramatic. Yet it is now the best release of the studio that year I have seen. (However, I only saw eight, so maybe it's an inconspicuous view). Don't miss out if TCM shows it. 8 out of 10.
