I originally saw this movie as a Blockbuster VHS rental. It was quite a while ago, but remember. Blockbuster no longer has it. Netflix didn't have it and there weren't many copies on the web - just a few steady VHS copies. Recently it was available in a DVD format on eBay at a fair price (in PAL format, but our DVD player will play PAL slides on our NTSC TV.) <br /> <br /> Woman and I both enjoyed it. The style of the movie is a bit strong, and many, if not most, of the parts are played rather strongly as if they were the amateurs (especially the children), but it is not troublesome. The contrast of societies is emphasized in the overlapping. <br /> <br /> There is some political preaching in terms of the fact that young people in Russia should not try to escape their not-so-great life, but at least try to make things better. . But it's not dominant. It's pretty humorous most of the time. <br /> <br /> Some expectation of the West being led by others is not that it is with all IMOs, I take it as a comment on the expectations of the Russian characters. At least when taken from my Western standpoint. Perhaps it is a decline of the west from a Russian point of view (which it literally says by the characters). <br /> <br /> I can't say how literally the movie is in English, but I can say that the captions were done very well, full of English idioms as if it were done by a native English speaker - complete with " a colorful language.
