I saw this television version of a Christie secret story when it was shown on Channel 5 in New York City in 1980. When I was amazed, it wasn't on Channel 13, the public television station that showed most of the masterpiece theater, shows, but (apart from some Dorothy Sayers "Lord Peter Wimsey" stores, and THE MOONSTONE), the BBC productions seldom paid attention to British detectives. Another series, THE RIVALS OF SHERLOCK HOLMES, dealt with stories that were in Victorian and Edwardian times. Such a period's charm was involved in the stories on Channel 13. <br /> <br /> The plot of why didn't they ask EVANS? deals with a young couple stumbling upon a dying man who is the only last word in the title of the story. (The novel was originally mentioned. Why didn't they ask EVANS, but then they set off the BOOMERANG CLUE). The young couple start investigating the murder and trace the crime to a set of people who surround a dubious doctor (Eric Porter). Despite the warnings of the father of the hero (John Gielgud), the hero (James Warwick) and the heroine (Francesca Annis) are following their investigation - even if it becomes milder and more dangerous. The death of another suspect through suicide raises the apparent dangers, as the killer starts looking to bump the two amateur detectives. <br /> <br /> It's not a bad movie, although I agree it was a bit too long for a single night of entertainment (if done like that later, Miss Marple has episodes with Joan Hickson, whether the Hercule Poirot episodes would be better in two parts). But it has its strengths. One is the proper use of Porter as the main suspect, and a clever scene later in the film where he apparently is spying on the young couple investigating the mystery. If you stick to the movie, you'll be a surprise later. <br /> <br /> But this one has failed. When dealing with a Christie novel, the figures in the story must be in a rigid schedule of movements so that the reader can find out what the secret of the plot is. I would just add it if you heard the dialogue at one point and how a little boy was almost murdered (but not), then you will gather all the parts of the story and what the motive of the villain was. <br /> <br /> Apart from that and the long time the phone call takes to tell it, it's quite a good movie, and worthy of one of the best apps based on a Christie story in the period when they were suddenly renaissance in films based on her novels.
