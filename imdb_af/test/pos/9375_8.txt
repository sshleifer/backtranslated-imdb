A great soldier killed a man because he is Jewish and tries to fix it on a fellow soldier. Not as good as the novel on which it was based ('The Brick Foxhole') in which it was a gay man killed ... but Hollywood won't touch it in 1947. It's said, it's still a very good movie. The anti-Semitism is handled very well, but it is hammered into the hearing that the coercion is bad. Well you! But it was 1947. The picture was well-handled by the entire cast (especially Robert Young and Robert Ryan) and the tone is very dark ... as it should be. Very atmospheric too. A great big hit in his day ... well worth seeing.
