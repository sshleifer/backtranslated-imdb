I am a sociologist / anthropologist specializing in symbolic interactionism, and I have to say that this movie shows high quality in the symbolic context throughout the film. For anyone who hasn't seen it yet, I recommend reading "Man's Search for Ultimate Meaning" by Victor E. Frankl. I think you can draw wonderful correlations. <br /> <br /> That being said, I want to say it, despite the fact that the main characters are gay, it's not a gay story. It is a story about searching and finding meaning in life, despite the problems and challenges, the pain and terror that stands in your way. It is a story of search and find balance and wholeness and happiness.
