watch this movie. It's really a good ride through the trouble of making an indie movie, and what happens when it blows into the movie maker's face. There are many things about punk rock, and the philosophy behind the movement, and it is related to this project. so if you're in old punk, American punk, you'll dig it. But beware, there are a lot of bad-acting bits of the failed project that has been recorded. Yet sometimes they become funny. . And actually, some of the best parts are listening to people who have never been involved in making pontificates and what they've accomplished in the three years it took to compile them. Someone who is there to make a movie, especially if you haven't been to the film school or worked in the field, should you see it and learn from the filmmaker's mistakes.
