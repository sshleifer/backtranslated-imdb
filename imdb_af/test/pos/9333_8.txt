Although I'm not a Michael Jackson fan, I love his early songs and Jackson 5 too. "Thriller" is one of his great songs and comes from the best selling album ever with the same title. As far as the video is concerned, it is wonderful, one of Michael's best, but also very eccentric and strange. <br /> <br /> There's a story behind this video, but it's so complex that I can't fully understand it. . It's freaky. The freakiest thing is Jackson's transformation in a werewolf, his evil red eyes at the end (like a werewolf) and the dead people dancing. <br /> <br /> The video is very dark, exciting, cold and original. There are great scenery and settings. The music itself is full of life and rhythm, characteristic of the good old doll from the 80's. <br /> <br /> I like Vincent Price's soliloquy. He does a great story with his distinctive and unique voice and his evil laugh at the end is wonderful! My favorite videos of the 'King of Pop' are 'Billie Jean' and 'Don't Stop' until you get enough '(both of his best songs).
