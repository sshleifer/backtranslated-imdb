One of the previous reviews of this movie ends with "Only great fans of the protagonists or fans of Exotic Romance / Adventure Holywood movies ..." as if it were not enough to love it! Anyone watching the movie complains about Connery's accent, or the lack of historical veracity, or the realism of political motivation, or any other out-of-movie issues, simply doesn't like movies. See it and be upset about the power of the two leaders, the exotic, romantic, photography and music, and the daring adventure of a real escapist movie. This is proof that Hollywood can do as they used to when it really wants to. A solid 8/10.
