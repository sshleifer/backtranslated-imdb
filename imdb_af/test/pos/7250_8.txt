Plunkett and Macleane are an entertaining, fast and refreshing movie. Refreshing as it does not, in contrast to most other period films, attempt to give the audience a history lesson or preach. Indeed, historical accuracy is anything but ignored. This movie does not take up too much, and rather tries to entertain rather than enlighten. Plunkett and Macleane were introduced in the 18th century, but director Jake Scott offers a thorough 90's. There is action, sex and curse, and in the inevitable collage, the aristocracy dances to disco beats. Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are brilliant as always, and the rest of the cast, especially Alan Cumming as a flirtatious joke, is also very entertaining. The film is visually spectacular and is a mix of comedy, action and drama, with a love interest provided by Liv Tyler with a shaky English accent. In short, if you are looking for an entertaining few hours, this is the movie for you. It won't make you think, but it can put a smile on your face.
