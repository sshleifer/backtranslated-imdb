It's a silent movie. It is a simple story about a writer who cannot return his story to his hometown, but instead becomes involved in a friendship with a foreign elder whose life externally represents the internal state of the author - it is a museum of unfinished ideas, outdated equipment and "useless" people. <br /> <br /> There are no exceptional circumstances or any large movements in the plot. This is a movie about internal changes. To hold on to their lives that do not develop very much, the main characters help each other to transform, stop dreaming and achieve something or at least get a change and their lives the desired and long-awaited new direction to give. /> <br /> In the movie, I can only think of one weakness, which can also be considered a feature. We don't get much character description or inner world insights. It is very narrative on the side of thoughts and events and we have to guess about their true feelings that are quite hidden, but you can still see them, and that is what your own thoughts are, trying to figure them out, the impressions understood by those people, and it is not empty - the actors certainly hold a few inner conditions that keep their characters properly. It is close to real life where you usually never know anyone well enough to understand them completely, and it turns us around and puts in front of our own feelings and choices. <br /> <br /> What is important to me is that this simple, almost flat story reminds you of your own life, your own dreams and achievements, is there any or we are trapped in the routine and enjoyment , Leaving 100% or just dreaming, we can do more and move somewhere we'd rather be than just leaving ourselves and others, the stories like "I'll do it someday" - don't move one finger to actually leave it doesn't happen, or "I'm good where I am" because it's easier to go through the habits than to really make a change? At least it's the impression it left me and it was very timely for me, which adds to my appreciation for this far-known movie. I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes the movies meant for the heart, but those who need events and actions should stay away.
