Kahin Pyaar After Ho Jaaye is a great family movie. Salman Khan looks beautiful and wonderful! There is even a scene where he takes off his shirt! What a surprise !!! Rani Mukherjee is also good. Pooja Batra has very few lines to say, but I'm glad she was acknowledged for her role because she definitely has potential. <br /> <br /> It's about Prem (Salman Khan) and he's a wedding singer. He is going to marry Nisha (Raveena Tandon), but is raised. Prem goes to Nisha's home and asks her why he was fired and that is because her brother is sick and she must marry a NRI, Rahul (Inder Kumar), to get the money to treat him. Prem moves up and in comes Priya (Rani Mukherjee). Prem falls in <br /> <br /> love Priya, but it's a pity she's going to marry a NRI! Who can be this NRI? Priya also falls in love with Prem while Rahul is with her. Prem gives Priya an abusive comment one day and she goes down and goes down to Agra for the wedding with Rahul. Will Prem stop her? See KPNHJ to find out! <br /> <br /> The movie was very funny! The songs were great, especially the song "O Priya O Priya". It is a pity that the film in India has lapsed and I do not know why? Every movie in India is going to flop these days !! This movie deserves a hit. The only problem I got with the movie was that they had an obsession with NRIs! They think all the NRIs are rich! The movie deserves a 9/10!
