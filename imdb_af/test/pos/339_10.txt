This movie was amazing how good it was! The plot is extraordinary and dramatic. Initially I thought it would not be as good as a summary, but after the first five or ten minutes of the movie it struck me that I was dead wrong. I literally cried four or five times in this movie, and in spite of that I have to see the same screens again and again over thirty times. No, the song screens were not as nice as they could have been, but the plot is what really gets you. American or Asain, I would recommend it to anyone - and now I have. I guarantee that after seeing this one you will get the best of it and its plot. I hope you feel the same, and also write a rave review!
