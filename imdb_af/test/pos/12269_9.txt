For me, this wonderful roller coaster of a movie bear has repeated pleasant views. It's about the tangled lives of three very different people. Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer. Albert Brookes plays the unbeatable but brilliant journalist. William Hurt is the pleasant but dumb new kid on the block, news anchor. <br /> <br /> The classic love triangle comes out with the incredible, witty and self-defeating Brookes who fall in love with Hunter, but she is naturally attracted to Hurt. <br /> <br /> This movie works on many levels. At the very least, it's a brilliant comedy with the one linen so thick and fast flying that every view carries a new crop of the one you've missed the last time. It is also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance. <br /> <br /> But perhaps the film is especially the modern obsession with physical appearance and the ultimate victory over intellect as a valued human attribute. It is personalized by the meteoric career success of the Hurt character as opposed to Brookes' relative decline. <br /> <br /> Despite fifteen years, the film has initial relevant messages about modern news values ​​and the continuing decline in journalistic standards. <br /> <br /> This movie is a classic in every respect and it's hard to understand why it's so neglected
