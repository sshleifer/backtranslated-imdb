I can't believe anyone gave this movie a 1 rating !!! and it's just a 3 average ... What doesn't love this movie? It's original, it has many scare scenes that really made me jump out of my seat, and it has some special special effects. The story is fresh, there is a little nudity, and it's a lot of champion. The killer was in his own crazy way and the end was very unexpected. I must admit that I really love this movie, one of Spain's best horror movies ever. If you consider yourself a real horror fan, you have to get there and try to find this movie. You will be pleasantly surprised to do so.
