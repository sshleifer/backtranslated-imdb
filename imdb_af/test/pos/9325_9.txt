When it was announced, the "King of Pop" was dead at the age of 50, a month before launching a series of live return programs in London's O2 Arena. It was a huge shock to millions of people around the world. He was, and will forever be one of the most talented voices and dancers in the music industry, and he will be terribly missed. I decided to remind myself how wonderful he was by watching what many are considered to be not just Jackson's best video (and possibly song), but the biggest music video ever made by director John Landis (' a US Werewolf in London). The movie opens with Michael and his girlfriend (Ola Ray) with their car breakdown, and after giving her a ring, the moon comes out and he becomes a werewolf. We see Michael and his girl watching this horror movie in the theater, she is scared and out, and Michael follows her quickly and sings the iconic song. Soon, Vincent Price's voice arrives, and zombies start to crawl out the earth and open up coffins from the graveyard and Michael and the girl are naturally surrounded. She turns away, and Michael himself became a zombie, and with all the other creatures they do the iconic dance before returning to his normal self, at least for the choir. The girl walks in the nearby cottage, blocking the doorway, but the zombie Michael still manages to break through, and when he touches her, she screams to see ordinary Michael say, "What's the problem?" The film ends with him and takes her home and looks at us with evil eyes. Michael Jackson was number 14 on the 100 largest Pop Culture icons, and he was number 6 on The Ultimate Pop Star. The Thriller album was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Albums and this video was number 71 on The 100 Great Scary Moments. It was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Pop Videos. Very good!
