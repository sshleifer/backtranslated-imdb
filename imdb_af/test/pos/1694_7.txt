In Landscape after the Battle, Andrzej Wajda in the second era of his film character, emotional and psychological confusion is depicted in a former Nazi prison in Poland, immediately after World War II. <br /> <br /> A hand-held camera examines many extreme close-ups and bright colors. The final credit as graffiti on sides of goods train cars symbolizes the film. The soundtrack is wonderful, except Vivaldi, who sounds smaller in pop art, in the opening sequence.
