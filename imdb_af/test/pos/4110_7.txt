Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's managing bestseller, was almost immediately written off by critics and audiences. He has had a bad reputation in Hollywood for years. Group of diverse British and American individuals flee from a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and collapsed in a snowy mountain area. A rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun always shines and most of the residents are youthful and happy. Some of the performances of the classic movie are not that nice (the vibrant mood of the piece, the rolling Burt Bacharach-Hal David songs, as well as the lightweight direction all the conspiracy to make the artists look a little stupid) . Peter Finch is the international peacekeeper involved in a somewhat clogged romance with resident Liv Ullmann; Sally Kellerman is a crazy content that stretches like: "I got tired of blowing pictures of people with their heads so people with their heads still - and usually among hairdressers - can get another last kick before heading to the latest recipe "; John Gieguld "as Chang", an Asian who learned English while attending Oxford, is humorous self-entertainment (but why is there no song for Chang?). Hal David's dull lyrics are sometimes jaw ("On the Good Lips Cup / how did Christopher Columbus / sail over the sea?") And the pacing is cut off with everything that talks about the outside world and how nothing more vain. . However, the production is well-balanced and the general handling is particularly negative. The two-dimensional characters are so serious that they actually become intrusive, and the film's folly is contagious. It finally gets a lot of fun. *** of ****
