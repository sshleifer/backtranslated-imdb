Nothing better than an android with 80's technology and an outdated story to pull your mind out of the depths of your mind and center to be captured by a beautiful love role. Growing up in the 80s gave me the invaluable opportunity to look back from "not quite human" at many special occasions. As my parents never attended the view, I would guess I would not enjoy as much as I did as a child. So maybe it's a movie to dig out your VHS collection and hand to your kids. It can be found on the same band as "The Apple Dumpling Gang" and an episode of "Tournament", which is when you are recorded in LP mode of course.
