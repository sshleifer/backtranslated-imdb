I believe John Houston's "The Dead" is a true classic. Not only was it Houston's final movie, but he quoted: "All I know about making movies is in this movie." The story, now adapted from "Dubliners" by James Joyce, is a great ensemble of star performances by Angelica Houston, John's daughter, and a role player of English and Irish actors who bring the story to life. It is a movie that must be part of any serious collection, not only because it is visually elegant, but because the story is timeless and very attractive. The movie is not in a hurry, nor is it expected of action. On the contrary, the story unfolds within the characters, bringing light and meaning to the dialogue. The end of the movie is stunning, poetic and haunting. I recommend "The Dead" without reservation as one of the best films ever made.
