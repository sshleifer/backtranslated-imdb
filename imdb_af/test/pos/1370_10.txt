Mad Scottish Road, stranded deep in outer space, low on food and free of budgets, starts ten now to three, which will help these guys with half-sucking visual effects, but I like the freaky being, if I met one, then I would flee, but not if I had Scottish friends, we did not want to swing and avoid the lot. In the end it wasn't broken. It's a DVD I'm happy with. but if they ever make a successor, some actors dump, not everyone was right, some were good, with eager acting, some were wood and might have to pack, but the action made me watch everything, the shooting, , did not stop, I would tell friends not to fear, and look again in another year.
