Love the shots of airports - Dallas, Phoenix, Fresno, etc., just a few buildings named in print on the roof. And the tri-cars, and the well-dressed passengers. Fast forward 75 years .... <br /> <br /> But what I really was was the hammer and sickle emblem and apparently a Chinese ideogram next to the logo, behind the pilot's seat on the starboard side of the hull. Remember when the acquaintance with Neil and Jill says Jim has become a general in a Chinese rebel army? That, based on the hammer and sickle, could only have been the people's revolutionary army of Mao Tse Dung !!! Never keep in mind the discomfort and unwashed twist in bed - would that logo and reference survive during the Cold War? <br /> <br /> Additional observation 12/27: This film of the 30s with the Soviet emblem can / should also reflect the influence and charm of communism in Hollywood and much of America during the Depression. Add to the historical value of this awesome movie. <br /> <br /> I also liked the American Dream aspects of two Winnemucca guys, who at least part of the world with a storm, Red-Blooded (literally and predominantly in Jim's case) American Boys had. <br /> <br /> Others commented more on aerobatics, and so on. I love it all. <br /> <br /> This gemstone earns more than the mere 1.5 stars Osborne and Co. rated on TCM, if only for recording parts of the American history of the early 30s.
