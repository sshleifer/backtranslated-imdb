In 1983, two Bond films were made. One was the official Bond movie Octopussy with Roger Moore who first died in Live and Let The Death as James Bond and the other was the unofficial Bond movie Never Say Never Again with Sean Connery who played the role of James Bond for the first time in Dr. No, that movie was also the first 007 James Bond movie to be made. Never say Never again is unofficially named because the company that made the other James Bond movies did not make this one. Never Say Never Again is also a remake of the 1965 007 movie Thunderball, there are several differences in Never Say Never Again that let you know it's not made by EON. One thing is that the opening is different, there is no rifle sequence and no pre-credit order, another difference is the music score. Some things in this movie feel like a James Bond movie like the gadgets and cars, and James Bond always does it with the ladies and the movie does have an opening credit song. Sean Connery still plays a good role in playing Bond, but the other stars are also good. <br /> <br /> Never say never again is a good movie that just like the official James Bond movies.
