Kannathil Muthamittal is definitely a good movie. I have to give it to Mani Ratnam for a good direction and A.R. Rahman for good songs. The camera work is just excellent and is similar to Black Hawk Down and Saving Private Ryan. I will be shocked if this movie does not win an Oscar for best foreign film or even best camera work.
