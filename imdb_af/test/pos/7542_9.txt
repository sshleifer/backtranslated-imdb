A very funny British comedy from the mid-1950s about a school for girls. The girls are all involved in mischief and abuse, making badgin, smoking and gambling. Alastair Sim plays Headmistress Millicent in a glorious role and plays Millicent's brother. A female police officer goes to the school to see what is going on. This movie is funny, with a good point of view and Alastair Sim is great. Just a classic Britsh comedy, fun and not crushing. Joan Sims ans Sid James, stars of many Carry On movies, play small roles, but this movie is about the girls. It created 3 successors and a recent re-production. Watch and enjoy where it all started.
