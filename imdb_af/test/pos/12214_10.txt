I do not believe that sixty percent of voters voted this show if ten now that hell is the score five point eight it impossible, I do not get it, it is completely pathetic, I mean how. anyway the show is wonderful, the story is wonderful and the characters are interesting, definitely a ten out of ten of me. I think the creatures are cool. They look good and I wish I had a nyrod big show. Cgi hope there is a second series as a lot has become unanswered in the first season and when will nyrod grow larger than the rest of the creatures, again why is the score so low as the voices were so high? <br /> <br /> 10/10
