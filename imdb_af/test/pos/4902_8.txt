One of Warner Brothers' best and highest gross films during the Thirties was this beautiful family drama about a widower who, with his girlfriend's sister, attends four daughters. But don't celebrate, daughters challenge every day. Everyone is trained by their musician dad on instruments and one as singer. They make beautiful music together, even if it's for the long haired couple. <br /> <br /> You can see and still marvel at the infinite variety of roles Claude Rains has played over the years as he shows you another aspect. of his creative personality. The opportunist Vichy captain in Casablanca is as different as the scientist in the Invisible Man has been angry, as the patient and wise man work in Mr. Skeffington. All the same man and everything so incredibly different. <br /> <br /> Here he brings love to the four girls, with a little greeting, on their willingness to accept modern music. The Lane Sisters and Gale Page can know Beethoven, but they are also hepats and can beat dad every day eight in the bar. And if Rains gets a little too testy as an aunt, Robson can put him in his place. <br /> <br /> With Four Daughters unmarried at the time you know it's going to change. All sisters develop romantic interests in Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn and John Garfield. Of course, the mating process is a bit complicated and one of the sisters suffers from a tragedy, but it promises to work out as the film ends. <br /> <br /> Four Daughters is also known as John Garfield's debut film. Unlike a little bit of footlight parade years earlier, Garfield had no other role to play. But he was known for the New York stage for his performance in Golden Boy and Warner Brothers signed him and found the perfect movie debut role as the cynical musician who just can't really get a decent break in life. In 1938 he named him a best supporting actor, but he lost to Walter Brennan for Kentucky. <br /> <br /> This movie was so popular that it created a small home business for Jack Warner. Successors with members such as Girls Courageous, Four Mothers, Four Women, all cleared the box office before World War II. And Warner Brothers made it again with Frank Sinatra and Doris Day playing the parts that John Garfield and Priscilla Lane created. Now the two have made beautiful music. <br /> <br /> Another timeless form has been created in Four Daughters and the film is 70 years after it was first seen.
