Best of all. What's the best of all? This is different for everyone, but for most of us it is love. But everyone does not know where or what they should look for true love. This story goes to the whole gambit to seek love. Sometimes in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons. But as the saying goes, "we are the heads of our own ships", and so it is for our lives. We are responsible for the choices we make in our lives. Once we make those choices, we have to live with them. As we see this story and as we see these women making choices that are likely to change their lives forever, we wonder, will we make the same choices as these women or will we be wiser? Who knows?
