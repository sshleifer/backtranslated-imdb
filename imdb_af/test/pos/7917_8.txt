"Alexander Nevsky" marked director Sergei Eisenstein's return to filmmaking after an era of exile, and what he produced is a bare-faced propaganda film that reveals Russia's superiority over Germany. <br /> <br /> There is very little plot: Russians unite to fight Germans; Russia wins. The movie is really an elaborate montage of mostly battle scenes, mixed with a few moments of German brutality (such as a shocking scene that points to German soldiers throwing Russian children on a fierce fire). It was Eisenstein's first sound movie, and it is clear that he had no idea what to do with the medium. Indeed, this movie really looks more like a silent movie with some sound added. There are some dialogue scenes, but they are quite lifeless on the screen, and the pacing is all over, as if the actors were not actually on the set when they filmed them. Eisenstein mostly uses sound as an excuse to convey an exciting Prokofiev score on the proceedings. It's actually one of the movie's greatest assets. <br /> <br /> Say what you want about Eisenstein's ability (or lack of) to tell actors or his film in a more narrative format, he certainly knows how to collaborate on images and music for maximum effect , and "Alexander Nevsky" about everything shines through its shortcomings. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
