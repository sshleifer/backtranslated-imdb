Man, I have my doubts. I love Kathy Bates, but I thought, how good it can be, I've never heard of this thing ...! You know, it was one of those things, we gave it "20 minutes and we'll shut it down if it sucks" and we were locked out of the room. It's a very popular, fun movie. It's strange, you know? I mean, you have a lounge singer, a killer (and a credible one), you have a farce, then Kathy Bates has in all her actor Rupert Everett, ultimately its real potential, Dan Ackroyd, and a Dwarf that will make you laugh out loud. I tell you, you will laugh / you will cry. <br /> <br /> Perhaps I had a strange week, but I think this movie is on the level of Fried Green Tomatoes. If you don't like that movie, you may not like this movie, but I think it was a good movie. I went out and bought the DVD.
