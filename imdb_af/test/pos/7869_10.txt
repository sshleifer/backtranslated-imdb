"The Beguiled" is one of my favorite Clint Eastwood movies, and a departure from his typical early roles. Targeted by Don Siegel, with whom Eastwood worked on various films, it was a year before Eastwood's legal counsel was made with "Play Misty For Me". An alternative title considered for the film was "Pussy-Footing Down At The Old Plantation", which was unfortunately not used, otherwise I am definitely jealous of the fact that it is happening at a girls' school, difficult to avoid. I only saw the movie in one of my college film classes in the mid-1970s, and was taken with them immediately. I just had an old VHS tape of it until I recently bought the widescreen DVD. It also includes the hilarious, horrible trailer that crosses the film as a "Peyton Place" soap opera, and doesn't carry any of the film's creepiness. . <br /> <br /> Interesting notes: Eastwood and Siegel had to fight with Universal Pictures to keep the original end, and they won; And the film was announced as a standard Eastwood West, which it certainly isn't. This is a gothic story of deception and horror that occurred during the Civil War, with an underlying tone of erotic and sexual tensions running throughout. <br /> <br /> I don't spoil this review, and if you want to see the movie as it should be, be careful to see it on the internet, as spoiler reviews are abundant. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood portrays John McBurney, a Union soldier shot on the Confederate land and discovered by a young girl from a nearby girl's school. She rescues him and brings him back to school, but instead of informing the local patrol of his presence so that he is imprisoned, master Martha (Geraldine Page), her assistant Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman) , their black servant Hallie (Mae Mercer), and mostly teenage girls take him in, heal him and fall under his spell. The film sets its tone of creepiness and gothic horror right out of the titles, as it shows true battlefield shots from the war, while Eastwood's voice quietly sings a funeral song of the time. <br /> <br /> The opening scene From his encounter with the girl who saves him, sets the tone of his character, and the tone of the whole movie. To say more than that would spoil the surprises in that first scene. To say more about the movie itself, it can ruin anyone who hasn't seen it. If you are in creepy, gothic stories, find it and rent it. Eastwood is excellent in the film, and it is interesting to see him in an early role or role, depicting a character that is mostly very unsympathetic. <br /> <br /> Geraldine Page plays a prime role in the movie as the mainstay, and I cannot imagine that another actress is in the role of being so good at the moment; a long shot could have been Piper Laurie, but I don't think Laurie could figure out the role in the same way as Geraldine Page. <br /> <br /> Elizabeth Hartman (whose wonderful performance in the movie "A Patch of Blue" as a blind girl who falls in love with Sidney Poiter's character, is yet another highlight in her short career). Unfortunately her delicacy on film was also part of her real life; She committed suicide at the age of 45. <br /> <br /> I end this review with this observation: one manipulative, empty Yankee man is not a game for a domestic fraudulent and libidinous Southern belle.
