Meant to be a social commentary on how our lives were out of control in the 1970s, this movie plays more like Mr Schlesinger threw along after having had a bad day on the highway. A mish-mash of snippets over the nuts along the highway in Florida, and along the highway of life, the cast is mostly wasted and has probably landed on the cutter floor. The problem is that what has not landed on the cutter floor is probably not! Now available on DVD, it's a pleasure to see a comedy that cost $ 100m to produce when made in 2004. It rolls together and is not too difficult to go through, and strangely, in 2004 we are all quite reasonable just <br /> <br /> jumping into our cars and going faster and faster, heading nowhere.
