I wasn't sure how to get this movie on DVD, because I really have something against people who make black and white movies in the 21st century, but I eventually bought it. I still don't understand why it should be black and white, but it's the only negativity I can see from the movie, and it's certainly a perfect example to see the definite rise of Brazilian theater. Not everyone can understand a movie like this, but it is pretty rewarding for those who do it. Unlike O Homem Que Copiava, surrealism fits this movie well and the play is at least as good as that, or other successful Brazilian movies such as Bicho de sete cabeÃ§as, Cidade De Deus, Brava Gente Brasileira, etc. br /> <br /> My only hope is that this jewel is not insulted and raped by a crappy Hollywood remake. It's amazing to see how these guys spend zillion dollars and can't make a movie that is 1% as good as this potentially low budget. <br /> <br /> Bravo to the whole crew! 10/10
