Hardware Wars is a hilarious, 12-minute short film parody of the original Star Wars movie released just a few months after Star Wars in 1977. This movie uses household appliances as spacecraft and Star Wars viewers roll around on the floor in uncontrollable robes. This film has won numerous awards at film festivals and was the movie Mel Brooks inspired to write his Star Wars parody film called "Spaceballs". <br /> <br /> This is my favorite parody movie and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humor. <br /> <br />
