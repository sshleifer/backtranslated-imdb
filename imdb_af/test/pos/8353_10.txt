I thought it was a wonderful written film. I love Little Scamp, and the Street-Wise Angel. This movie is very easy for small children to understand, but also a good movie for adults. I like this movie because it continues the original Lady and the Tramp, and that movie is a classic. Lady and the Tramp 2 Scamp's Adventure was filled with new characters, catchy songs, brilliant animation and unforgettable classic characters. I loved the movie since I first saw it. I also loved how they showed the different personalities of each character. It also shows the apostates and good things to make new friends with which you can connect. My favorite song in the movie was always there because it showed the different characters to share their views on how they feel. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who was a fan of the original Lady and the Tramp.
