James Joyce is likely to write some of the best English language sentences, and include his short story, The Dead, which ends with his collection The Dubliners. In his final? Perhaps the most perfect paragraph in the English language. It is fitting that John Huston, who has withheld the attempt to film this story, concluded his career with it. As with the red weapon of courage and the man who would be king, Huston respected the literary source but made the adaptation of the film. And with "The Dead" (completed after Huston's death by his son, Tony Huston), we get something almost perfect in the marriage of literature and theater. <br /> <br /> Appreciate everything the cinema can do, as one of the commentators points out that it's not the African Queen (it doesn't have to be), it's the kind of movie that's for a hearing is uncompromising. All of us, by Portrait of an Artist, hit the school, and we need to bring the maturity to appreciate how words and images within and from them can affect us. As with silent movies, Huston looks for something pure here, and works with the trust of his years and leaves the world a masterpiece that is similar to Joyce's original. <br /> <br /> Many veterans of the Irish theater world are recruited to bring the story of a self-fulfilled man (and mock confidence) by the hosts of an annual party on the eve of the Feast of the Epiphany is strengthened. What is in store for Gabriel Conroy is an evening of celebration, song, dance, poetry where he is asked to give the annual toast to the two sisters and their cousin offering the feast. He is distracted by the task of rising to the occasion, and this distraction makes him vulnerable to an earthquake experience handed to him by his wife. While his ego is shaken when he hears a story from his wife's past, it is also a gift where everything that is apparently made important by the evening is taken away by the realization of imminent deaths for all who are alive. <br /> <br /> And rather than trying to make the last known paragraph of the story 'cinematic', Huston brings a voice over and we hear the amazing words quoted when we look: "the snow fall badly through the universe and fall falling. " This is the perfect solution for customizing a movie maker. <br /> <br /> The role play is everything we will hope for. As it is basically evidence of the power of the written word and how it brings us through common experience, every artist seems to be elevated by their role. Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy has a wide variety to play, and her account of a young boy who once loved her is not just Gabriel Conroy, but also the audience. <br /> <br /> If I think of Anjelica Huston, it's the transformation she makes in this movie; And when I think of her dad, this movie I remember first.
