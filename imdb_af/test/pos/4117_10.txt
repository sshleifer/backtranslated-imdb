It was a great movie! I like to watch again and again. The actors were wonderful. The movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Lifetime will place this movie on DVD. I will definitely buy a copy. This movie just proves that you have to be very careful about who you are being addressed. You may think you know someone, but you never know. My daughter watched the movie with me. She thought it was wonderful. All I know is, I'll watch this movie every time, lifetime it. This is the kind of movie that holds you fast. I wish Lifetime will persuade the movie, but use the same actors and bring it to the big screen.
