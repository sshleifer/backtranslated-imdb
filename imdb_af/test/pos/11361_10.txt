I tried to encourage the age of kings for many, many years. My theater life was filled with the actors in this series. When I couldn't follow it in 1960, I was very active in the theater. Now in retirement I long for it and keep it to myself. Please, please don't be released on DVD, I won't mind what it costs. I see there are others who feel the same. What can we do to do this? Something as big as this should not be sent into oblivion. I still have to write two lines. OK, I can do that by saying I want this series more than anything in the world. Just to watch the best actor of our time playing the best words of our wonderful Shakespeare. Not enough! An oath
