I've watched the movie several times over the years and always find it an entertaining experience. As a retired pilot, I'm interested in most aviation movies and it's one of the better ones. I know Lindbergh was only 25 years old at the time of his historic solo flight to Paris and that James Stewart was almost 50 when he made this film, but I can overlook it because Stewart has always been one of my everyday favorites actors were doing one of his usual outstanding performances as the "lonely eagle". <br /> <br /> There is a good mix of comedy and drama throughout the film and a good use of flashbacks. It also helps James Stewart be a real-life pilot, both in military and civilian life.
