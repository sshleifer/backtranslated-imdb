What do people expect when they watch an All Adamson movie? Are they expecting their classic cinema that is amazing and will leave them with lasting memories? You will think it through some of the reviews. All Adamson's movies are trashy and messy and cheesy, not much more, so if you go in them, you know it's already helping, and they shouldn't necessarily be taken on face value, especially if they have so much unintentional entertainment value. First, it begins with the finishing touches to the theme-themed music of the extreme limits, so you know that things look promising. This is the story of some Wacko cults living in the hills and while trying to collect a dead body, the leader suffers a heart attack and ends in hospital. Of course, Nurse Sherri is prone to his needs and everything, and when an operation is needed, it just happens that she hangs in the operating room when the man goes, so that his spirit penetrates her. And Nurse Sherri begins to change. No longer the beautiful nurse, she develops a taste for blood and sharp objects. There are a few small side stories going on, as people try to burn the body of the dead cult leader and a blind soccer star who have become the love object of one of Sherri's co-workers who are also in voodoo in the walked. It's not bad if you're a cult movie fan, but it might be bad if you're a "Spiderman" fan because you don't like it. Sometimes it actually goes to "respect" (for Adamson, anyway), but then it is "withdrawn: itself with a ridiculous event. If you enjoy Adamson's movies and similar trash, you might like it for anyone Otherwise, maybe looking for a lost treasure, keep digging out of 10.
