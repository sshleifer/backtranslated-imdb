I remember watching the Police team! When it first came to ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show, thanks to the many giggles, non-successors and scriptures filled with word games. In one episode there was a line where a man named One was shot once. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, ABC canceled the show after only six episodes. I felt it had a much longer run, but a network manager thought the show had been paying too much attention to the viewer because of all the gags in each episode. One I remember was in the opening where the title of the episode differs from the one shown on the screen. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen's depiction of Frank Drebin was deadpan, yet very funny and his role was in the storyline of Jack Webb van Dragnet. Alan North did well and Peter Lupus, in one of his few roles since Mission: Impossible, was not bad as Norberg. But the one character who stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy, played by William Duell. After advising Dr. Drina, was there comics from dick clark, dr. Joyce brothers and then dodger driver tommy la sorda. <br /> <br /> Although Police Group! had a short life on ABC, the Zucker Brothers did not give up the concept that was even more successful in the Naked Gun film franchise. I will close with a regular closing stop. Freeze the end here.
