We only completed the performance of El Padrino in Australia. A phenomenal piece of film work. We are looking forward to many more movies by Mr. See Chapa in the future. It was great to watch such a good movie with such tension and a story that is an immediate classic. Watching a good-quality movie sets Chapa's serious potential and skill as a writer, actor, director, and filmmaker. Chapa has been very impressed with his triumphant performance in "blood in and blood out" and now he has proven that anyone who has seen his work is his potential to become a critically-known movie maker with real artistic control. With his lead role, Kilo Vasquez, is a perfect combination of Milo Velka from Blood in Blood Out and Al Pacino from Scarface. The film will do miracles here in Australia.
