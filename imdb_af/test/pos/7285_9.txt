I was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was. Whether you're a gore or a voltage fan; you will like it. I used horror movies, and they were stupid. But anyway, I happen to make exceptions. I find something really extraordinary in this movie. Rarely have I ever seen a movie that frightens my shit, but I tell you the truth, this movie rolled me into my neck. Unlike most horror movies, it is about developing the characters. I recommend this movie and I'm glad that Asylum eventually brings good horror movies. <br /> <br /> I recommend! Enjoy it!
