Warning - this movie has amazing graphics and should never be seen by children. <br /> <br /> The artist about this story was indeed a good Korean painter who rose from the lower depths to becoming them. greatest painter. Unfortunately, in so many ways, this man was so many ways. Of this was the artistic temperament and what seemed to be annoying was just his demanding nature when it came to art. But other times he was just a drunk jerk - especially when he was on his way to becoming a great artist. Late in the film she was annoying, shabby and unnecessarily cruel. While this didn't make him a very nice man, it is important to capture the film so we understand a lot about the nature of the artist. <br /> <br /> I really found the movie fascinating and loved how the Artists showed real works throughout the film (as in LUST FOR LIFE). I really wish I could prove it to my students (I learn from a school for the arts), but can't because there is just too much adult material. Yes, there is nudity, but even more problematic for any audience (especially younger people) is when he .... hmmm ... I don't think IMDb will even let me know what happened, but it was very graphical and involved body fluids. Not just a nasty and disgusting scene that didn't need to be seen, but a reason to keep junior watching this great movie. It's a real shame.
