To tell the story would not be the point, would it? Barnens ö, spelled almost like 'boone aww', is the title for that brilliant novel of the late seventies that many people have shocked, including myself. <br /> <br /> Children's Island is the title and what an island. In the book, Raine, the main character is the Guinness World Record Book as his own Bible. And he is eager to break new records himself. Especially the youngest person underwater for three minutes. <br /> <br /> The story, like most Swedish films and books of the time, is deep, consciously challenging and awesome. Bergman started his final movie and Cries and Whispers was scarce. expectations for any Swedish movie were quite high. They taught us when those great theater, great actors, excellent writers and talented directors made a real team of perfection in the theater. <br /> <br /> All this said, Barnens Ö is a discovery story. It is also a story of alienation: alienating cities and living in one of them makes us strangers to most residents. It is a story of revelations and sudden encounters with our own destiny. It's a movie of overwhelming hope and despair. From feelings buried under low and low isolation and isolation from a world that could not care less. <br /> <br /> This approach is in itself a fairly difficult way to weave a compelling story. Here, the masterful guidance of Kay Pollak on Ola Olsson's script of PC Jersilds novel, not only changes it into a possibility, but into one of the masterpieces of the theater. <br /> <br /> I might disagree with someone who said this work was all but forgotten. It's not. Even as I wrote it in 2009, discussions on P C Jersild's story are being done around the world, and the film is shown at many movie schools and small theaters. <br /> <br /> Why? It will be difficult to be philosophical, and many have already learned it through writing and lectures. The reason why Barnens Ö was and IS a special story is the cozy feeling you get from the beginning when you discover that everything is being told by a small child. And that's where it ends. Perhaps this is a clinical view, as someone else pointed out. But deeply disturbing, moving and satisfying. The concept is deep: as long as we have no hair we can live another day as an angel. Then, what Raine reflects on is the colophon of his experiences: "Men are pigs". He finds his fears when he is fearless. He finds love when the world around him crumbles. He discovers a reason not to act like adults because he refuses to commit crimes. He leaves his inner purity and confidence in others unconditionally, only to learn how far the soul of a man can be. <br /> <br /> When love is expected, he finds hate. Where compassion is needed, he finds suspicion and cold hearts. This is a film of metaphors. A movie to think and ask questions that are difficult to ask, but more difficult to answer. <br /> <br /> In the end, the satisfaction of experiencing such a beautiful work (it really has the ante for any other Swedish movie) is a ride of joy and hope. Be aware that this is a movie full of the dark side of our nature. But, unfortunately, a movie of hope and deep joy. Reine will still be an island in Stockholm, but there is the great hope of living completely today, even when we found our first signs of sexual maturity.
