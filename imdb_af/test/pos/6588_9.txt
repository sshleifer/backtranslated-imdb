This film came as a gift - a late night presentation from the blue - so unlike other reviewers I had no prejudices. I glued myself to my seat while the film slowly dictated its own rhythm, unfolding its own. I was determined to admit my own deep love and humanity, because I wanted to be "good" to conquer - but also forced to admit that I was sometimes on the side of the "bad" guys. The movie is pretty pretty. The word "elegiac" comes in mind, and it's more than just because the movie starts and ends in an elegy. The movie does not emphasize me much of depression or confrontation - and then, by its cyclical nature - with the births and rebirths as well as the deaths - the film celebrates the fact that an Aussie poet is quoted, there is "sometimes joy . " Oh gods, I feel like I just wrote a love letter to this movie - but there it is. Hola!
