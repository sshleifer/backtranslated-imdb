Although it doesn't really matter to the movie, it's a creative mite. God (a convulsive bloody figure in a chair) cuts out his organs with a straight razor and dies in his own garbage. Mother Earth rises from his body and satisfies herself with his seed, which gives birth to man. However, it is highly unlikely that you read any of these things without first reading a summary, and it is not very important for the movie you are doing, as it is more of a surreal art house, all in inky, processing black and white. A sick, dark atmosphere is created with the sharp photography and minimal sounds (mostly water drop, groaning, scratching, etc.), but each scene goes a little too long and the film as a whole. It could have been good as a short movie, and the God who killed himself was excellent and extremely creepy. This is especially the first thing you see, but it's hard to be patient when it's so long and you don't even know what you see for many of the time. <br /> <br /> Another great movie for the original style, images, atmosphere and content.
