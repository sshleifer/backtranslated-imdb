I attacked this movie on TV after 30 years or more. Various aspects of the movie were even made so many years after. <br /> <br /> The story of little-known C Virgil Georghiu is remarkable, which almost looks like a Tolstoy-like story of a buffered man. through a cosmic scheme he cannot understand. Compare this movie with better-known contemporary works such as Spelberg's "Schindler's List" and you begin to realize that the trauma of World War II must be seen against the greater canvas of racism above the simplistic Nazi idea of ​​Aryan vs Jews. This film touches the Hungarians who are not Romans, the Romanian do not like the Russians, and so on. They also touch the Jews' dubious relationships with their Christian-Romanian friends while they are under stress. <br /> <br /> Like I didn't read the book, it's hard to see how much has been changed by the director and screenwriters. For example, it is interesting to study the Romanian farmer's view of emigration to the USA with the aim of making money just to return to Romania and invest his earnings there. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, Johann Moritz's character was probably one of the best roles Anthony Quinn played alongside his work in "La Strada", "Zorba the Greek" and "Barabbas". <br /> <br /> The final and most memorable sequence in the film is the last one with Anthony Quinn and Virna Lisi trying to smile. The father who brought a daughter with his wife's rape by the Russians is a story in itself, but the director can show the reconciliation with a simple gesture - the act of carrying the child without having to go into melodramatic imagery. slipping. <br /> <br /> Today, after Diana Diana's death, we regularly notice the insensitive paparazzi. The final order is a charge of the paparazzi and the insensitive media (director Verneuil also makes a similar comment during the court zone if the cameramen prepare to hit Moritz). <br /> <br /> The interaction between church and state was so beautifully summed up in the orthodox priest's laconic statement "I pray to God that He leads those who have the power to use them well." <br /> <br /> Some of the short shots, such as those of a minister of a minister who died while listening to a petition, said so much in so few footage. The direction was so impressive that the editing went back. <br /> <br /> Finally, what struck me the most was the beautiful rich texture of colors provided by cameraman Andreas Winding - from the brilliant credit ranges to the end. I remembered he was the cameraman of another favorite French movie of mine called "Ramparts of Clay" directed by Jean-Louis Bertucelli. For a long time I haven't seen such a use of color, except for the David Lean epics. <br /> <br /> There were bugs: I wish Virna Lisi's character was lost. I could never understand the Serge Reggiani character - the only intellectual in the whole movie. The railway station at the end seems to highlight Sergio Leone westerns. Finally, the film is essentially built around a love story, which unfortunately takes a seat. <br /> <br /> In the summary, this movie impressed me in more sections than one. The story is relevant today as it was when it was made.
