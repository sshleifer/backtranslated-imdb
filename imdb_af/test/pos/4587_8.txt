You can read all sorts of references to the world of Idiocracy. A futuristic world populated by wilted, self-sufficient moron spoon fed by the technology of an earlier era: this idea has its precedent in HG Wells' "The Time Machine" and Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" among others satires. /> <br /> Early in the film, a narrator explains the rapid decline of humankind in five hundred years, but does not fill the gaps from where all futuristic technology comes from. Most of the criticism of this very fun (and funny) movie seems to surround this omission, and the consequent complaint that the world is not "realistic". As if "realism" ever was a required quality of satire. Is "Brazil" realistic? How about "Futurama" or "Transmetropolitan"? Hell, how about "Gulliver's Travels"? I didn't think. "Idiocracy", while perhaps not as marked as the best of the genre, does not take the same notes and do so in general. <br /> <br /> I didn't regard futuristic technology as a problem. It's pretty easy to find out that Mike Judge satirises the current trend toward automation and simple product interfaces so even overall idiots can use them. As in "Brave New World", the film community at some point in the past seems to have reached a point of automated self-sufficiency (apparently created by the now-extinct "smart people" to satisfy an increasingly stupid population), And let the rest of mankind be free to exchange and even get all the worst, most selfish impulses they can do. The movie just happens during the last flight of mankind, because everything starts to fall well apart. It may still be unrealistic, but if so, it is a remarkable, well-presented brand of unrealistic. <br /> <br /> Of course, the stupid people take most of the screen time, but they are just the victims - they don't know better. Mike Judge saves his true hatred for the intelligent people in power who are dead by the time the movie starts, but which is now very lively in the 21st century. People like scientists chasing "hair growth and prolonged erections" for no other reason than the possibility of making a profit on their snake oil treatments. People like politicians that make companies buy just buy the FDA and FCC. People like media managers and their yuppie stools that promote stupidity - that make the destruction of all culture, morality and health possible to make quick money. <br /> <br /> After all, who is really the debt, the Morlocks or the Eloi? The Paris Hiltons of the world, or the brilliant managers and advertisers who put her on TV and lowered our cultural standards to leave her there? This is all implicit in "Idiocracy". A line here, a hint there (testify to the hilarious auto-doctor who literally does all the work in the healthcare system). This is one of the few aspects of the movie that is NOT collided with the unnecessary narrator. It's just for the viewer to pick up or not, but it's one of the most interesting themes in a movie that is much smarter than any other comedy of the year. Too bad that so many people will let the movie think it's just an excuse to show that backs are over and people in the groin are hit. Not that those things aren't funny either, and maybe it's a little pandering. But in "Idiocracy" it just isn't as simple as it seems.
