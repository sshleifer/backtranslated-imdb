The biggest tragedy of man faces is that, as often as divine, he can establish himself for the banal. There is so much tragedy in this fact. Death in Venice is one of very few films with the patience and courage to tackle this fact. It confronts the human eye with beauty and inspiration in their two most inevitable human forms - self denial and decay. It is undoubtedly the largest movie that has no distinctive influence on mainstream theater. Its sleek refined look, echoey sound, mix of unsubtitled languages, and highly challenging themes is impossible to copy: so much an accident of its own production as of its director's vision. The central achievement, once awakened, and vulnerable in the face of expression and decadence, emphasizes Bogarde as though not the best British actor of his generation, certainly the most adventurous. Able to sympathize if his desires take him over and are interesting despite the endless close-ups and Mahler score that plays above him. Not one for a Friday night with your girlfriend, but definitely OK if you want to explore the boundaries of human mental disability.
