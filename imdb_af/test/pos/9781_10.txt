My family and I enjoy this show and find it a fairy tale sketch of what people have gone through. <br /> <br /> My own dad spent time in Changi before he was in "F" power on the Thailand-Burma railway. Many who were told about the treatment received by the POW, I would just say my dad was 6 feet 1 inch and 196 pounds when Singapore fell. By the end of the war he was 5 feet 11 cm long and 91 pounds. <Br /> <br /> No show could actually convey what the POWs went through, but it comes closer than most. <br /> <br /> As the Ex-POWs say, "If you didn't have friends, you didn't survive." This performance succeeds in getting this message across.
