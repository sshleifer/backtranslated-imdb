This movie is one of my favorite Christmas classics. Certainly, it's fluff, it's not "relevant", but when did movies just become entertaining and fun become a bad thing? No, this movie is definitely a good thing, "as Martha Stewart would say! Barbara Stanwyck is so attractive in this movie and Dennis Morgan complimented her perfectly. Both have charm and warmth to save. They are assisted by a crew of those incredible character characters who have apparently disappeared since the 40's and 50's - Sydney Green Street, S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall, Reginald Gardiner and Una O'Connor among them. Where are characters like this today? No role could be thrown better. Fortunately, Bette Davis declined this role as under her and she had the right to refuse it. She would have tried to steam over everyone and everything around her and completely destroy the film. Stanwyck was a strong actress, but has the wisdom to play it lightly. She is rarely more attractive and perfect. Morgan is the essence of the nice guy. Because his part is the least spattered, there is a tendency to reflect on his skill. Just the fact that he can be surrounded by such distinct character characters is an achievement in itself, but he is also perfect as Jefferson Jones. Skip the bad, advised (and useless) 1992 remake and watch this shining sparkling holiday gift!
