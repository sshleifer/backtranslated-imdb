A truly creepy ghost story, full of chills and sensuality, this movie just falls short of what it promises. It is apparently based on an old ghost story, and perhaps a little too much resides in a simple foreground. For the most part, she's imaginative and truly gripping, but in the end it almost like Oshima just lost interest in it, and brought it to a quick end. <br /> <br /> The story is simple - a woman and her younger lover murder her husband so they can be together. But their failure of the nerve and its return haunted them to madness. Beautifully handled, with imaginative sets of scenes, the love passion is beautifully portrayed. But too often, the film fails to deliver its promise, almost as if Oshima lost his nerve in the same way as the lovers do. <br /> <br /> Just look at how Oshima combines his great combination. skill as a filmmaker with a few exploit slips to pull the audience together, but unfortunately it is not a true classic in the form of films such as Onibaba or Woman of the Dunes.
