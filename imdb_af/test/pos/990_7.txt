Although I am very familiar with poet Dylan Thomas, I don't know anything about his life. Regarding his life and specifically his marriage, I would suggest that the edge of love (based on the novel) manipulates things a little, but if you are not a historian or poet, who cares. <br /> <br /> The movie is less about Thomas and more focused on the two most important women in his life. One is his wife, Kathrine, and the other is Vera who was his first love. One romantic night on the beach as youths is something that both tried to put behind them, but can't, they're big now, they are good friends. I forgot to mention that it is being put to war during the war. Vera gets involved with Captain Will Kill who gets pregnant and goes to war. As he left, Vera began to fall back to Thomas, and Kathrine fell in love with him. She also carries another man's child. Things get even more emotionally complex when Capt Killig returns <br /> <br /> As you can see, it is a very soap opera plot, and it takes a slow form in a fairy tale, with perhaps one too. lots of ripe juicy dialogue. But everything is not lost yet. For a non-Hollywood production, I think the Rand of Love is as stylish as one can get. It's definitely more dimensional and intelligent than about 90% of contemporary romance, Hollywood production or not. Some of this has to do with the fact that it was instituted during the war, setting up emotional conflict that feels more convincing and less artificial, much like Reconciliation. This one functions as acting and cinematography of equal talent to Joe Wright's Oscar nominee, but is in much greater need of stable pacing and progression. Things are good at the beginning and end, but the middle section is where your attention span can be tested unless you are deeply and deeply rooted in the story. <br /> <br /> I doubt The Edge of Love will have that kind of effect on the viewer, but it's a good movie to watch. It can even make a good date night movie, as it's so much smarter than the chick flames being forced to endure today.
