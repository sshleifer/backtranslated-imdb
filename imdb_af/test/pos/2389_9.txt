I was at a Thanksgiving friend's house and watch a movie from the movie, Eddie Monroe. I have been a fan of Indie Films for almost 20 years (I loved the McMullen Brothers), and was impressed by how good this movie is. My friend, who works at Magno Sound, told us that this movie was shot at Super 16. The photography was so good, it looked like it was a 35mm shoot. Furthermore, the music was combined with Fred Carpenter's direction, art. The storyline was original and led to an end that surprised us all, look ... very cool. Acting role players were good, especially the actor who played, Uncle Benny. He was wonderful. This movie was a nice holiday entertainment and I was delighted to be one of the first to see a movie that will look great in the future.
