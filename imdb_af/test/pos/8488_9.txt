A few days ago, I saw the wonderful "House of Sand and Fog" and I was impressed by Ben Kingsley's immense performance. I decided to see "Ray" and try to understand how and why Ben Kingsley did not win the Best Lead Actor Oscar. Looking at Jamie Foxx in the role of Ray Charles, I agree with the Academy: he really deserved to be awarded. I love Ray Charles, I was not his fan, but it is incredibly the parable of Jamie Foxx with him. The film is fully supported by Jamie Foxx, who participates in most of the shooting ranges, and his movements on stage seem like he was a reincarnation of Ray Charles. As far as the story is concerned, I saw the extensive version on DVD, too long but also very enjoyable, with many beautiful songs and scenes that mainly show a junkie Ray Charles. My biggest surprise was finding Ray Ray an addict and how he treated his own family. The portrayal of his childhood through fragmented flashbacks was the boring part of the movie. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Ray"
