Satisfactory fantasy with ships sailing through clouds with cannons, evil plotters, weird landscapes, time constraints, huge sets, reality obstacles, perhaps like Never Ending Story or some Merlin goods. If you like it, you'll like it. Christine Taylor is beautiful. Heavy fighting is nice. Music is wonderful. Good luck out, they kiss, everything is fine, and the cook is happy.
