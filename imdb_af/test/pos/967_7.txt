Big fat liar is a pretty funny movie. But when I watched it, I thought of something. Some of the events that occur in this movie are incredible. So really, the movie is kind of a big fat lie. There is no way he could get away with all these things. Here are all the amazing things. <br /> <br /> 1. When he was false, his father cooked a meatball and acted like he was the father. Jason (Frankie Munez) couldn't get away with it. Well, happy for us, he didn't. So it didn't go with it. The excessive. <br /> <br /> 2.As if the Granny was blind, she could still find out that it was not her granddaughter. <br /> <br /> 3. They couldn't get on the plane, flew to LA, acted like they were jacket sellers, sneaked into the studio, and then, and then ... Well, some of those movie is a bit incredible. But it doesn't hurt to tell a little white lie. Believe me, I do it all the time. <br /> <br /> Big fat liar, though incredibly sometimes, is fun. It's also very funny. But let me just say one thing before I continue this review. If Paul Giamatti wasn't in this movie, it would really suck. It will be terrible. Big fat liars are also pretty funny, though corny at times. I give it a thumbs up. <br /> <br /> Big fat liar: *** / ****
