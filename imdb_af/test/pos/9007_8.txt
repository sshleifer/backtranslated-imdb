The new voices scare me! Kuzco does not have to pass a few academic academies to become emperor again! It's the same thing over and over, isn't it? It's a children's show, right? Yzma turns Kuzco into something silly, like an animal. He teaches a lesson. Everything is the same !! David Spade and John Goodman never returned ... * sniffle *! Nothing changes because Disney won't do anything. This is probably one of the most delayed shows ever! The first movie was so damn better! Malina is probably the only person I want. Kuzco is such a crybaby! Kronk is delayed! And Yzma's delayed-ER (if it's even a word)! What I meant is ... How can you, Disney ... why?
