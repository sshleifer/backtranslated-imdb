I love this movie a lot. The actors were great, especially Potent, which is different in every role; FÃ¼rmann, who can also play someone; and Loos, who spends it (she is also a talented singer - she sings the song "My Truth", heard when one character raised the stereo in the laboratory). <br /> <br /> Anatomy is a good horror flick, paying attention to its characters. It's also very fad at times, and the set design is innovative. It's too bad for them to make a successor, who is nowhere near the original. <br /> <br /> Two other things are definitely worth mentioning on a lace note. The DVD is not baptized, resulting in a better movie experience. Also, make sure to keep an eye out for the final credits.
