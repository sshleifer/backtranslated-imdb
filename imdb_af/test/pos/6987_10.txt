I saw "In Pitch Black" at t.v. and so I had to see it. I must say, I was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Not only did David Twohy's style improve as he wrote "Critters 2", this movie Vin Diesel brought to my attention. Sure, he was there in "In Pitch Black", but here he was cruel, scary and intense. I have not seen such charisma since Schwarzenegger in the 80's. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough, but it's the characters that make this movie interesting. Then there was what happened to the female lead. Unexpected. The dark humor helps the movie move, the effects are not great, but when Riddick fights the stranger, it has blown all my complaints. <br /> <br /> Ever since this movie I was caring about, Diesel didn't do much, but I look forward to the sequel.
