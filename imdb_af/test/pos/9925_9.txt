I consider myself a casual fan of Dario Argento. For every very good movie by him (such as "Deep Red" and "Tenebre"), it seems one is equally uninspired (its output since "Opera" tends to disappoint). Yet, there is no denial that when he is at his best, there are few horror directors who can persuade him. I see "Opera" as Argento's best work. <br /> <br /> It's definitely the movie where all its brands are present. There are no well-developed characters and the plot makes very little sense when you start investigating. Still, think of Argento as a European equivalent of Brian DePalma - the style is everything that matters here, so much so. Typically for Argento, there are beautifully filmed murder sequences. Those who are unfamiliar with the man's work may regard it as a sadistic comment (and may be, taking into account their frequent abilities), but this is really true. Argento stages murdered with complexity to obvious visual details. He really makes graphic violence an art form. Plus, its direction and the appearance of its films is impeccable. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, "Opera" is one of its frightening products. Argento is the only director I feel is exciting rock music, works well for horror sequences (when others try to pull it off, it comes across as cheesy). The acting varies, with Cristina Marsillach playing a beautiful and fairly sympathetic but never very pleasant young opera player. The rest of the actors are man-made and get the job done, but again, with Argento, the play is never the point. These are the beautiful colors, the frightening violence, and the overall fever dream / nightmare atmosphere. (9/10)
