Rebellious D: in the Pick of Destiny tells the fictional story of the formation of the band Tenacious D and their quest for the Pick of Destiny, a guitar peak with supernatural powers played out of Satan's teeth (played by Dave Grohl) . JB (Jack Black) and KG (Kyle Gass), who are linked by the lot, must travel to the Rock N 'Roll Museum and steal the Pick of Destiny to become the biggest bond on earth. The movie is hilarious and delivers incessant laughter. Jack Black and Kyle Gass work together perfectly, for over 20 years real friends and co-workers. The film is partly, a musical. All (or most) of the music is written and performed by The D. All songs are new material and many are classic. The soundtrack is definitely worth checking out. This movie will mostly be appreciated by fans of Tenacious D, but if you're not a fan of The D, I still think you'll enjoy the movie. If you are a fan of the D, you should see this movie. The acting is not as bad as you might think, and the laughter and roughness never comes to an end. I recommend this movie to anyone to cut off their socks and laugh as loudly as they have been laughing. Watch out for cameos by Dave Grohl, Ronnie James Dio, Meatloaf, Ben Stiller, Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, John C. Reilly and Neil Hamburger. Also keep an extra scene after the credits.
