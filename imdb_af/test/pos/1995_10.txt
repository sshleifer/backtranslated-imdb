Everyone looks similar to The Matrix and The 13th Floor, and when I first saw it, I agreed. I expected the Matrix and was a little disappointed. But with repeated views, my respect for this movie has grown tremendously. <br /> <br /> The thing to keep in mind is that the Matrix is ​​a good action movie with a philosophical mumbo jumbo being thrown in. The 13th floor is a passionate action movie with a bit more interesting philosophical mumbo jumbo being thrown in. Existenz is not an action movie at all, and is not (as much seems to believe) about "reality" or a "deep" concept. It's about the human tendency to deliberately replace reality with an artificial (both in its origin and its behavior) world of imagination. <br /> <br /> The most cold moment in the movie is when Allegra Geller arranges her "writing". At that point, you realize that the people in the game voluntarily surrendered their free will to participate in a story. It is even more frightening in the end when D'Arcy Nader (or rather his player) commented on the possibility of spending his life in the game. I fully believe in the realistic philosophy that providing interesting worlds in which people find the right predetermined path to the ultimate goal is ultimately a recipe for a lively existence. Life "in the game" doesn't live at all, but is a tempting way to spend your time on earth. As Allegra comments on the real world, there's nothing going on here. "Maybe also in someone else's imagination, and pretend that something is interesting. (Although I have to ask if Cronenberg regards it as a self-appeal, considering the fact that he exchanges himself worldwide in 90 minutes.) <Br / > <br /> When leaving the theater after I first watched this movie, I think it's one of those movies that was only visible to see how it ended, but I've seen it several times ( thank you SciFi Channel) I realized how much deeper it is, seriously, once you have seen it, it still deserves another view.
