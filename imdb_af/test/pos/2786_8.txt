Surprisingly, witty, funny and completely encouraging, the film grabs a little known reality: that of the student studying in an Erasmus program. The start is wonderful, as the story begins, of course it has a few lulls on the middle section, and the story sometimes drifts away from the main character, but the viewer won't bother. The film is young, fresh and light-hearted, though I disagree with the idea that when you do Erasmus and you come back, you no longer part of the universe. But that's just me. The film is deep and at the same time very light. Cool and recommended.
