A widely unknown, strange, small western, with sensible colors (probably the same material used in "Johnny Guitar", I think, "Trucolor" or something that looks like drops of blood), almost surreal scenes with twisted action and characters. Something different, far from being a masterpiece, but more attention should be paid to this little jewel in Western encyclopedias.
