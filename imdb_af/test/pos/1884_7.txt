It was a funny movie. Just after I saw the Evil Dead trilogy a week ago, and I had as many Bruce Campbell movies as I could, including really bad people. This one is funny, without exception, but as sure as hell original. <br /> <br /> I mean you have crazy scientists, superhuman cyborgs, half-brain reactions, cigars, ex KGB drivers, jealousy, passion murders, love, romance, sex, action and more, all with the same 6 actors :) <br /> <br /> You really should see and enjoy it, I can't explain it in a text box. I think it's not so much a cult movie as Evil Dead was, but it certainly has Bruce Campbell touching, I love. Ted Raimi lends a hand, Tamara Gorski looks both handsome and interesting (she watched the 13th away from the hooker on Friday) and Vladimir Kolev also shows a lot of promise as an actor, although he will probably be thrown as secondary character in Hollywood movies his entire career. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: funny movie. If you liked Evil Dead, you'll love it too.
