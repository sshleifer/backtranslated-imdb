I was a Mario fan for as long as I can remember. I have many memories to play Super Mario World as a child. This game brought back many of the memories while adding something new. Super Mario Galaxy is the latest installment in the marvelous Mario franchise. There is much different about this game from any other Mario before it, while still retaining the greatest elements of Mario, the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space. <br /> <br /> The story starts a lot Like any other Mario game, Mario receives a letter from Princess Peach inviting him to a festival at her castle in the Mushroom Kingdom. On arrival at the peach's castle, Mario Bowser and his son (Bowser Jr.) attack the castle with their airships. Bowser kidnapped Princess Peach and then raised her castle into space. In the middle of the castle is lifted into space. Mario falls down and lands on an unknown planet. Mario is found by a talkster named Luma and gets back to the Luma's house, a floating space station, here Mario meets many other Lumas and also meets their leader, a woman named Rosalina. Rosalina tells Mario that Bowser took away the power stations' power stations and spread them across the universe. It is Mario's job to help the Lumas find them and save Peach. The adventure therefore begins. <br /> <br /> The way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies, each galaxy consists of multiple planets where Mario moves through these shooting stars in these levels to fetch the Power Stars . Mario can walk around planets many times without losing gravity, some planets are small and others are large, many planets are similar to classic Mario environments. The best thing about the game is the controls, all the stuff like jumping and so is still the same, but the pennant is used in many unique ways in this game. You shake off the remote Mario will be a spin used as the primary attack in the game, and it will also trigger the shooting stars. You can also show the remote control on the screen and use the pointer to burn starbursts to enemies or objects in the area. Then there's the graphics, it's by far the best graphics on the Wii, it's just as hard to describe how good this game looks, you can probably almost say it looks as good as 360 games. <br /> <br /> My only slight grip is that the upward effect is getting used to, and the story is pretty poor too. The worst part is that you lose all your lives when you turn off the game, no matter how much you did when you quit resuming on 4 lives. Yet these little problems are aside, this is an excellent game that is very entertaining and challenging. This is the type of game we've been waiting for on the Wii. <br /> <br /> A perfect 10 out of 10!
