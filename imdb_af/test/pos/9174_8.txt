Hitch is a light-hearted comedy that will entertain you with fine performances. Will Smith transforms into a credible performance as a cloak and dagger Date Doctor who must remain invisible to protect his clients and his profession. Smith was excellent and never melted too much. <br /> <br /> The best play goes to the actor (don't know the name) playing this accountant who fell for this woman who is out of his league. This actor has done an excellent work of character development as he listens to Smith's directions, but eventually he can't help who he really is. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's the main message of this movie. Be who you fall in love with, and you'll be fine. <br /> <br /> At the same time, Will Smith meets this attractive lady and the Date Doctor gets a taste of his own medicine, as he slowly falls to it. woman. Don't know her name, but she was also very good. <br /> <br /> Overall, it was a beautiful, lightweight movie that is definitely worth seeing.
