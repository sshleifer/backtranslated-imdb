No real plot, no character development, no Scorcese level direction, but seriously, did you really expect it? The only thing that matters is that this movie is absolutely hilarious, almost on the same level as Borat. Certainly, the end draws a little, but if Borat's cameo didn't crash you should be the worst batty boy in the history of batty boys. Sacha Baron Cohen may be the biggest comedian, ALIVE, and here he gets more laughter than Jude Law on a nude beach. I dare not laugh at you. <br /> <br /> If you can pull the ten-footer out of your back for an hour and a half, and just enjoy a few good-timed and extremely stupid jokes in a stupid story about a stupid character , see this silly movie. You'll be glad you did. Be real!
