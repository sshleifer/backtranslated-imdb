This is a very strange movie for Harold Lloyd - at least with regard to the sweet character he played in movies in the 1920s and 30s. Instead of a good guy, he and Snib Pollard are with people to rob everyone. In a particularly successful match, Chester suggests that he lost a "very valuable ring" and a little later Harold finds it a joke, also looking for the ring. The ring is, of course, a cheap one that has dropped and then been found by Harold, but the greed of the sting is so great, he "convinces" Harold not to say anything and sells him the "valuable" ring and then they run away to enjoy their happiness (?). Over and over they get patties until they meet with a woman who is herself as a woman (with a fake man). She arranges a fine concentration and takes all the money they have stolen - and has a police spokesperson to make sure they give her the money. <br /> <br /> As luck would have, the two men stumble into the lady's shady business when nobody is at home. Soon the woman comes back and wipes their minds - releasing many dirty tricks to punish them for their bad ways. <br /> <br /> Though it is a totally strange and confronted movie, it is also very funny, because the jokes work very well and Lloyd and Pollard make an excellent team. Plus, while I was creepy and weird, I liked to see Pollard dressed like a lady.
