I just saw the movie for the first time (although I watched some parts when it was first shown in Britain in the mid-90s), I believe it is a masterpiece of the late twentieth century bio scope. Undoubtedly, a film of this magnitude raises many questions, such as why there are some narrative differences between the 60s Hermann in 'Heimat' and Hermann in this movie? For example, in the first film, Hermann has a fairly meaningful relationship with his stepfather (he finances Hermann's electronic music), while in "Die Zweite ..." little mention is made of his father until the final episode. <br /> Another point is of interest to me; I read on Edgar Reitz. I am struck by historical similarities between him and the Stefan character (spoiler). The last episode reveals that Stefan won a prize at the Venice Film Festival. (Reitz won a prize for best debut work there for his film "Mahlzeiten"); Reitz's film company is called 'Edgar Reitz Film Production' and Stefan's name is also mentioned. I'm interested in Stefan to be an autobiographical character, because besides Helga he is probably the smallest of the friends. <br /> <br /> Perhaps Stefan is a red herring, I don't know, what I know is that I loved this movie and wish more like that, except Michael Haneke's "Cache" and Werner Herzog "Grizzly Man" is not enough ambition, foolishness and passion of this kind in modern theater. I can't wait to see number 3 now.
