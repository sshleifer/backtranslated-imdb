Octavio Paz, Mexican poet, writer and diplomat, who received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990, said about Nazarin: "Nazarin follows the great tradition of the mad Spaniards created by Cervantes. take seriously good ideas and try to live accordingly ". A humble and spiritual priest (Francisco Rabal in a wonderful show) tries to live according to the principles of Christianity, but is thrown out of his church to help a local prostitute by giving her shelter after she has committed a murder has. Nazarin walks the country roads of the turn of the 20th century Mexico, which offers help to the poor and begs for food. His two followers, a murderous prostitute Andara and her sister Beatriz, who is a failed suicide who urgently seek love, regard him as saint, but it does not prevent him from hate and humiliation of both the church and the people he is meet the road. He ends up in jail and begins to question his faith because he cannot forgive his attacker. <br /> <br /> Bunuel tells the story in a way of a Christian parable that combines mastery and uniqueness with admiration and irony for the main character and strong criticism of formal religion and hypocrisy. The film is simple and deep, as well as beautiful, ironic and heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I see Bunuel as one of the best movie makers ever. I watched twenty of his films and everyone belongs to the different periods of his life, but they mean his magical touch, the masterful combination of eager realism and surrealism, his curiosity, his curious mind, his sense of humor and his darkness and bright fantasies. With great pleasure I add a little and almost unknown but incredibly open and touching surrealistic tragic comedy "Nazarin" to the list of my favorite movies.
