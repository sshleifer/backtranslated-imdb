Square landed this one really. They did not try to please everyone and focused exclusively on Final Fantasy 7 fans. And boy, would it be happy fans if they saw this movie! The story may not be as interesting or credible, but it is neatly related to the story of the game and has several honest-to-god funny moments! There is a total surprise there and also welcome. <br /> <br /> There are also many comos and funny references to the game. And most important of all: The fighting tones are so hard that they can cut through diamonds! They are truly the total awesomeness and would have made the movie worthwhile, even if everything else sucked. I mean, they are the best ever created PERIOD. <br /> <br /> See this movie. Gone. <br /> <br /> PS: I know my review sounds like the ravages of a teenage girl. It was, like, quite what I meant.
