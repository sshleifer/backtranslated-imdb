I only saw "Night of the Demons 2" before I saw "Night of the Demons". Unfortunately, my old Blockbuster thought it was a good idea to have the successor, but not the first. Looney, huh? Now, I think all horror fans need this movie. It's like McDonald's, you know it's bad for you and you'd rather have the Cheesecake Facotory (or a better residence you prefer), but you can't help but just want the cheap stuff. <br /> <br /> Night of the demons has it all: your innocent, sexy, go according to chicka-rules, your token black man, who is not surprisingly killed. You're a sleazy girl, you're an old man, you're a dark girl or guy, the goofball, the haunted house cheesy, bad acting, and very unnecessary nudity. Are these things not good? I mean, I know deeply in my heart of movies that it was very bad, but it was good for horror movies. Horror fans should enjoy and dig in! <br /> <br /> 8/10
