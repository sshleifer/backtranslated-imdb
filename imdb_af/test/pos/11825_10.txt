The Cure is an excellent real drama that deals with a very sensitive subject. This is the story of the profound and dear friendship between two sons, Eric and Dexter. The latter has acquired AIDS from a blood transfusion. So he and his mother (Annabella Sciorra) were wiped out, avoided by the public and labeled as a dangerous company, mainly due to a general lack of public knowledge of the disease. <br /> <br /> When Eric (Brad Renfro, known from 'The Client' and 'Apt pupil') and his mother move home next door, he has to deal with public insults and the fear of catching AIDS himself . However, Eric overcame his fear and ventures everything. Initially he starts talking to Dexter, but eventually he climbs over the fence and joins the funny boy (played by Jurassic Park's Joseph Mazzello) and his games. Very quickly, he develops a true friendship with Dexter, who, due to his condition, is fine and weak. <br /> <br /> The central theme of the movie ?? the theme that makes it equally authentic and tragic at the same time ?? is how Eric and Dexter try to find the ultimate cure. Initially they experiment with all kinds of plants and leaves? It is very naive, but at the same time sincere, as it shows how young children deal with such horrible diseases and how strongly they still believe in the magic of the world. When they hear of an alleged healing developed in the South, they do not hesitate and take them off for an adventure that even brings them closer and symbolizes the ultimate quest for hope. <br /> <br /> So they float a raft and south on the Mississippi River. What starts out as a true adventure becomes a dangerous venture that is simultaneously emotional and educational. The scene when Dexter reveals his fears and talks about the end of the universe, where everything is dark and cold, gives Eric his shoes, a symbol Eric will always be with him where the boy should go. He will never be alone. This sequence, which is one of the most compelling of the movie, contains a very convincing interaction between the two actors, avoiding uncomfortable and crowny dialogues and delivering a very real performance that eventually breaks out in its softness and honesty. br /> <br /> I will not go further in the plot of the plot as I do not intend to provide too much information. However, the end is emotionally tough and makes the audience so much of the tragedy that anyone watching the movie will be personally affected. This aspect makes this movie so strong, so outstanding and so convincing. The emotional burden on each character is so real and so cast that even the harder members of the audience may need a few grabs. <br /> <br /> A 10 is right on this movie and is not too high. There is hardly any other movie I've seen so far in my life, dealing with so many emotional issues with so much white and sensitivity. This is the story of how two boys make each other's life richer and how they learn each other's lessons from life. So Dexter overcomes his isolation and sadness, and Eric learns what really counts in life; and both realize how much of a gift is true friendship when it comes to the most difficult moments of life. <br /> <br /> This movie is tragic ?? but his message is mere inspiration.
