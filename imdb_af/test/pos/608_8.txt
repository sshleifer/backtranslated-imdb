Naruse is typically regarded as one of the 3 master founders of Japanese film, the other two being Ozu and Mizoguchi. It's an interesting and honest movie about the lives of retired people. Whatever happens when such a woman ages and loses her charm and mysticism? Well, for those interested, watch this movie. One: Okin is successful as a lender, but the other two must borrow from her and is cruel. Okin has no children, but the others do. Okin finds out that her old love is coming to visit her, and is excited. Naruse is a master of subtle studies of his female protagonists' characters. Bangiku eventually draws the viewer into the study of the questions of happiness and the value of life. Very good movie indeed.
