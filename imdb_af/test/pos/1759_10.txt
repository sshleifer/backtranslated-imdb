I only watched it in black and white in the early sixties, about Christmas, when it was shown on British television. I was absolutely addicted and watched it again when it was repeated on TV (possibly only two or three times, as it happens - if we only had video recordings!). As set out. By other contributors, the plot describes the return of Hoppity the Grasshopper to a time spent, to a forty American city. He finds that everything is not as he left it, and his good insect friends (who live in the 'lowlands' just outside the garden belonging to a songwriter and his wife) are now being threatened by the "people" trampling by the broken fence that prescribes the property and uses it as a short cut. <br /> <br /> Insect houses are thrown by their feet, and are also often burned by throwing away cigar stubs and matches. Old Mr Bumble and his lovely daughter, Honey (Hoppity's childhood sweetheart), have a serious danger of losing their honey shop to this threat. <br /> <br /> To solve their problems, the devastating insect has "property magnates" C. Bagley Beetle romantic designs on Honey Bee himself, and hopes with the help of his henchmen Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito. Forcing Bumble to give her hand in marriage. <br /> <br /> Will the heroic and fearless Hoppity win the day, and manage to save the insect community from their turbulent destiny, and especially its precious Honey from her? Enjoy the classic songs ("Katy Did, Katy Did not" is a wonderful, swaying, good example), and the colorful visual art as the story unfolds. <br /> <br /> Time has not pushed my fascination with this. masterpiece of animation and storytelling, and I was delighted to find that it was released to video, although I later discovered that it was in NTSC PAL format. I never thought, I immediately sent to the video and first bought a portable TV / video combination (complete with NTSC playback). <br /> <br /> Since then I have enjoyed many nostalgic views and even discovered that TV rights have been turned off from the BBC (which told me they will never see the movie on any of their stations) FilmFour, who finally showed it to their digital stations early in 2007. <br /> <br /> My granddaughter (three-year-old) was absolutely enchanted while we watched it - and this is a child who is influenced by the digital era and the resulting computer-generated productions! <br /> <br /> I would thoroughly recommend this movie for any age, and especially the latest viewers. <br /> <br /> Give Max Fleischer a Posthumous Oscar!
