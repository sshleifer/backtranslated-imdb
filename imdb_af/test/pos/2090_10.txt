Highly recommended to anyone who appreciates watching movies. Great play, perfect surreal uncomfortable humor, required prison, t-accurate portrayal of the masculine condition. Music is also spot-on. I think the artist is "Dip", but not sure. The short loop of the title credit song on the DVD menu is well timed, and sounds like Slint. (One thing to know is that IMDb maintains a ridiculous policy of a MINIMUM comment length based on, not CHARACTERS, not WORDS, but rather LINES. Measuring quality and quantity based on LINES in the brave era of UNICODE and flexible , web-based typography is like smoke poles.)!
