Unconditional Love is one of the best movies I've seen for a while. It's an emotional roller coaster. One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene. When Dirk told Grace he didn't want to go to the bar, because the villagers didn't like him, you expect the worst. When the old woman stops her glass and says, "In the memory of Victor Fox and follows the whole bar, I want to cry. The funeral scene is hysterical! July does it in her typical Julie Andrews style. Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor Grace is one of Kathy Bates's best roles Meredith Eaton steals about every scene she's in. Rupert Everett does his best work in unconditionally than Dirk.The kiss between Rupert and Meredith took me to another little bit hysterically In this day and age of Gay rights are being questioned, I think this movie should be seen by everyone.As a gay man in my late 40s, I saw people losing everything as a loved one, kudos for everyone involved is making this movie.
