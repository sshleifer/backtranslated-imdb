As already mentioned, the short film "Every Sunday" (1936) can be considered the first music video. It was a happy accident due to MGM's need to eliminate a variety of short films for exhibit with its featured material. They have some fresh young singing talents (Judy Garland and Deanna Durbin) available and put a mix of musical styles in a Norman Rockwell concert in the park. <br /> <br /> Who would have dreamed when capturing the best collection of images since Eisenstein's "Odessa Steps" series. <br /> <br /> It is Sunday with a few inattentive people sitting around a small wooden band cap in the park, while Strauss plays a tired search ensemble. Events unfold and next day Judy and Deanna will save the day. The operative Deanna sings "Il Bacio" (The Kiss) and Garland follows with the contrasting "Wals with a Swing". The climax blends the two styles well into a duet of "Americana". <br /> <br /> a must see. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
