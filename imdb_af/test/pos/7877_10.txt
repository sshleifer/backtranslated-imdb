Oh, man, this movie is wonderful. It's very good, it's a story about a man who doesn't accept black people. He sits on a bar for drinks on his evening and he walks on hippies who are counter-war and how blacks and hippies do not earn welfare tests. This movie is very realistic, as it depicts an old "Joe" who represented a lot of guys, and now too. The story goes as follows .... Joe is in a bar and he rubs shoulders with a rich man who accidentally killed his daughter's hippie boyfriend. And this empire goes to the pub to reconsider what he just did, and while he does, Joe is in the bar over hippies and people who are against the war. The rich man accidentally tells Joe he killed a hippie; and of course joe cheers the rich man because Joe hates hippies, Amazing movie watches it to see what happens next. I like this movie because it was reminiscent of those days in the early 70's, I like the way movies are shot again, in those days, very good things, it's not like today's movies. Basically, the movie gives you a glimpse into the thought of the main character "Joe". I like the theme of the movie ....... about the working man whose ass breaks to try to live
