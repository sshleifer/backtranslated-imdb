All in all, Big Bad John was a hilarious and touching movie. If you want romance, tragedy and humor, this movie has it. If you're a fan of the song (like me), you know pretty much how it ends. But if you don't, or want to, I strongly recommend it. Jack Elam and Jimmy Dean are a hilarious couple with good chemistry. However, I would not recommend this movie to strict urban people. You must understand where these people are supposed to come from, and only a handful of us are left. But even a few urban peoples can understand and appreciate what it is: a good home movie that makes you laugh, cry, and be inspired.
