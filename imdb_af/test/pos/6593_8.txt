I also looked at junior school in Petersfield Hampshire about 1975. The strange thing is that I think about it from time to time (I'm 40 now). The big question runs through the length of the series (no idea how many episodes 6 ??) was the identity of the person riding the motorcycle! "I asked friends about this series earlier and they have no idea what I'm talking about and think it's a strange dream I have. I have never understood the educational benefit of this, but thought when it was wonderful, but slightly scary. I seem to remember that there was a break in the middle of each episode. No idea why. Would love to see it again. Get a short clip via the BBC cult site.
