This story of a teacher who has a relationship with a student is subtly told, something that distinguishes it from most movies with this plot. Mr. Lamb (Jacky Cheung) has a relationship with Choy (Karena Lam, who was also so good at "Koma") that initially seems to be an inexplicable situation. He's been married to Ching (the great Anita Mui, in her last role before she was cruelly taken) for 20 years, and it seems to be a loving relationship. When Ching offers to take care of her and Mr. Lam's former teacher, Choy and Mr Lam have the opportunity to be together. What makes the film so good is the director Ann Hui's pacing. It takes a while to expose the secrets of the Lamsm and it makes all sense. The movie is very dramatic and touching. You don't feel disgusted with the teacher / student situation, something this movie elevates above many with the same plot. It moves slowly but stays with it. Also enjoy Mrs. Mui's wonderful, ominous but beautiful show. She was and is someone special and in this movie you fall in love with her one last time. It's the time to testify and is right there with her.
