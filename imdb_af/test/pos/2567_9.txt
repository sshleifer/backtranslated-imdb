I must admit, I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I also didn't expect Samuel L. Jackson to play chips and also sing blue. <br /> <br /> Cinemark from Beaver County PA does it regularly. They advertise movies in the lobby, get you all excited to see it and don't disappoint you by showing it. <br /> <br /> I was expecting it with such a big player from Jackson and Ricci and even a former N'Syncer (Timberlake) that this movie showed at least a week. But no, at that point when I remember correctly, MI3 was on 3 screens (that or another kind of supposed blockbuster). <br /> <br /> Like Blues Brothers, and Crossroads, does this movie include the mystical and legend of what blues music is about? Passion and difficult times. Religion and sex. Hell Dogs of the past. Salvation. I mean so many elements go into the blues to make it work. <br /> <br /> It was just a good whole story. Of course, not many people will see it because it does not have pirates or swinging spiders. But it does have Samuel L. Jackson ... Think of what happened to Jackson's character of pulp fiction after he walked the earth and sat down and it essentially describes him as a "T". <Br /> <br /> Big and underestimated, but isn't all the stuff anyway?
