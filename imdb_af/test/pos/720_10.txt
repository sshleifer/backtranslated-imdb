If you enjoy riddles and tensions, you'll enjoy this movie. Truth is told that it was mostly the Adrian Paul part that got me to pick it up. I knew almost nothing about the movie. Plot is: Sarah (Carly Pope), a student of philosophy and metaphysics, starts with a mysterious puzzle game that tries to figure out the "reason" and becomes involved in the game by solving puzzles. Vern (Adrian Paul) is a shop owner, also a mystery fanatic, and also gets caught in the game. Myth has it that if you solve the game, the meaning of existence (known as "The Design") is revealed. Brendan Fehr's character is a "village idiot" that hangs around the shop, which seems to be more than he looks. All in all, I thought the movie was pretty good. And this is definitely an original concept, a rare find today! I personally like riddles and words, as most of them were not very difficult, but it was still a fun movie. Well the rent was. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, get it! :-D <br /> <br />
