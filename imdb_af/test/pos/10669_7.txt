This movie is a gem ... an undiscovered Gerry Anderson classic. <br /> <br /> The origin of both "UFO" and "Space 1999" is obvious from this movie, including the castlist that includes the late Ed Bishop and George Sewell, both of whom went on "UFO" . <br /> <br /> It is a pity that Anderson, despite his many TV successes, did not get the chance to develop his talent on the big screen. Just think what he did with the movie version of Thunderbirds (which he also withdrew!). <br /> <br /> I'm sure if you 'JTTFSOTS' / 'Doppleganger' a fair chance you'll appreciate it's good features.
