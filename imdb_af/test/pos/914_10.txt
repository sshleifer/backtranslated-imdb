Irene Jacob is fascinating in this latest installment of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy and the story is infinitely satisfying as it manages to tie all three films together. I am simply in the awe of the amount of talent it has taken to do one of these stories, let alone three. Everything looks so precise that all the elements of movies are so eloquently executed, and the end result is so much larger than the sum of the individual parts. Trois Couleurs is epic in nature and belongs to any list of major film performances. Simply brilliant!
