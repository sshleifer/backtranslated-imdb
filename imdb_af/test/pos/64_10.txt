Darling Lili is a blend of Perfection and Magic! The stars; Julie Andrews & Rock Hudson couldn't have done better if they tried. It's full of all the magic a young lady wants and it all seems to happen to you. The Glow of the Director; Blake Edwards seems to be at his best. He captured the woman he loved! <br /> <br /> The blend of every song went perfectly with the moment in the movie. The film opened with Julie Andrews who sang Whistling Away In The Dark and closed with the same song by Andrews. <br /> <br /> For a film of this excellence, such a failure when released was a total shock ... <br /> <br /> As is: "Inspiring ... Pure .... Inspiring! " ~ One Of Andrews Most Memorable Lines In This Movie!
