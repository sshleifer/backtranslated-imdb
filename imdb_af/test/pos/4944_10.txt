Soul Calibur has always been my favorite fighting game series of all time. And SCIII is my favorite one of the series. <br /> <br /> The graphics are very well done. Much greater improvement over the high-angle polygons in Soul Edge / Soul Blade. The characters have facial expressions, hair blows in the breeze and they even shine. <br /> <br /> Soul Calibur has always been known for interesting characters and characters, and SCIII is no exception. Each character has his / her background story that is detailed and well done. My favorite character is Chai Xianghua. She is cute, she is funny and she is a strong female character. Yes, I know she is wearing pink and has a boyfriend (which she eventually saves on VAT), but there seems to be more to her than that. Xianghua, like all the other characters, has mistakes and up to their personalities, so no character is perfect, not even the good guys. <br /> <br /> The music is beautifully crafted for a fighting game series. It doesn't sound kitchy (the Vampire series) and doesn't sound like the old school porno soundtrack (Mortal Kombat). The characters have their own themes and many of the themes are done to suit the culture of that particular part of the world. I don't think there's a song on this soundtrack that I don't like. <br /> <br /> Another cool thing about this game is to create your own anime-like character (create a soul). You can look like cute or sexy or even ugly if you like. However, if you found a character adjustment that you want, remember to make notes, otherwise you won't remember how you created that character. I found myself very addicted to CaS. <br /> Overall, I think Soul Calibur is my number one fighting game series of all time. It has everything I asked for. What else can I have?
