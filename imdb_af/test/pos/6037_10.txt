Alex Benedictus (John Cassavetes) is an orchestra conductor who has a secret relationship with his pianist. When she threatens to expose him and create a scandal if he does not leave his wife, he sees that he has no choice but to kill her and seem to have committed suicide. Bad to him is our crazy detective, Lt. Columbo (Peter Falk), on the case. <br /> <br /> Stephen Bochco has written another sharp episode for the series, followed by wonderful details with wonderful details. We watch the villain commit his murder and set up his alibi for about twenty-five minutes, and we're completely worried. When Columbo appeared on the scene, it got even better. <br /> <br /> We first see Columbo after the murder (as usual). This time he is at the vet with his new dog. Scenes of pure comic relief are usually the worst in the show (think Columbo's discomfort over the naked model in "Suitable for Framing"). Columbo is hilarious if he deliberately dithering or bumbling to pull up his quarry; but too many writers make the mistake of pointing him in a ridiculous light when he is with non-suspects. Bochco, on the other hand, points out that Columbo is a little uncomfortable with his new pet in a handful of low-key scenes that are funny and artfully integrated into the story. (And I'm grateful that he didn't have a punchline for Columbo's quest to name the dog. As far as we're learning, the dog is nameless.) Bochco gives Columbo some of his best moments in this episode , and Petrus Falk makes the most of them. He is exceptionally good at a monologue where he expresses unbelief that someone can kill herself, much less this brilliant and beautiful young pianist. And he is even better in his scenes that play cat-and-mouse with Cassavetes. To expect these two long-term friends and associates to play brilliantly each other; And that's what we get. Notice how Alex Benedict cannot help the fraudulent Columbo, just as the brilliant detective pushes the nose around his neck. <br /> <br /> Bochco writes most of every situation in his writing. When Columbo Benedict's snooty mechanic asks, of course? Of course! ?? He asked the man to look at his own beating pile. And when Benedict finds Columbo at the Hollywood Bowl for rehearsal, of course? Of course! ?? He is on the piano game "Chopsticks." And what should our lazy lieutenant bring with him, but the victim's typewriter with the suicide note still in the roller. <br /> <br /> Columbo also has good scenes with a cheerful girl (Dawn Frame) and the beautiful Blythe Danner, who plays Cassavetes's wife. It's nice to see Myrna Loy acting as Danner's mother, although she does little with her little role. <br /> <br /> The director Nicholas Colasanto (who also acted, especially as Coach in Cheers) is creditworthy, although he follows the lead of almost every other "Columbo" director by adding one or two fools. Scenes end by out of focus and begin by coming in focus. Then there's that little bit where Cassavetes sees the carnation he dropped on the scene of the crime? and we see a lap of what is reflected in his sunglasses. There is also one play with Myrna Loy and a group of old fogies who are diligently performed by all but Cassavetes. <br /> <br /> However, this is a concern. It's a wonderfully entertaining episode, the kind that made me a "Columbo" fan.
