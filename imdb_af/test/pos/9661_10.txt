My teacher did this movie. It's a new beginning. Look at it and you won't notice it's a Romanian movie. The old boring style has gone. Now it's something else. A post-revolutionary film. It uses the latest imaging technology and mostly unknown artists. They are unique. You won't even know you're looking, you'll just be transferred across the screen and you'll feel every frame. Don't miss it, note the plot, but don't ignore the details. They make the difference between this movie and the other Romanian films. You will hear music at one time or another. It is representative of a part of us, but it does not represent us. Please keep your head straight and free your body.
