I saw it a week or so ago at a test screen in Chatsworth and went with a bunch of my girlfriends. we all loved it very much. James Franco is wonderful and so hot, I'll just see it for him !!!!!!! but Sienna Miller is also very good and plays a southern girl who loves him so much that she can't leave. David Caradine, who was in Kill Bill, plays a cowboy and he is perfect for it. The story is kind of strange, but if you believe in the power of love and magical things, you'll love it! It is really original and it is also very funny and everyone laughed a lot, but by the end it became more and more serious and we all cried. I'll see it again with my friends once it comes out, it's really good !!!!!!!
