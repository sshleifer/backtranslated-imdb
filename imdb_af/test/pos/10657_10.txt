The Battleship Potemkin is now the oldest movie I've ever seen and it's also the first silent movie I've seen. I heard many good things about this movie, so I got the tape home and I watched it. When it ended, I just thought it was a classic masterpiece. The story is based on the actual Russian Battleship Potemkin. You won't think so, but some of it was sad and disgusting. Unfortunately, the mother dies and the baby wrap rolls and disgusting, they must eat rotten flesh with virgins in it. <br /> <br /> Today, it is still considered one of the best quiet and Russian films ever made. I think everyone should see it (if they can.) You will be surprised at how good it is at the moment. It's a must see classic. 5/5.
