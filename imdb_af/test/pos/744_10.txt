"Don't look in the basement" is so easy to beat, but the truth is simply that Brownrigg is one of the Horror-true underground stars and IMHO is a much-overdue proper recognition. "Don't" is his undisputed masterpiece. This terrifying psychodrama at night, the viewer immediately in such a strange, unfounded, claustrophobic world of sweating madness, you have no real idea what hell is going on. It manages to make you feel dirty, just uncomfortable, because Brownrigg's world is this crazy, unwashed, rogue prison cell of rations, obsessions, and all shades of mental illness. And he uses his low budget palette to turn his big blanket around you like a bad memory. There is just as beautiful a strange thing about the whole damn thing. In a word, classic .... Once you don't "look", you'll have an idea of ​​the insane psychodramastyl that Brownrigg's other films indicate. In summary, they really no longer come as esoteric as this - well, they actually do Brownrigg's 'Keep My Grave Open'. Mad genius. Don't accept a replacement.
