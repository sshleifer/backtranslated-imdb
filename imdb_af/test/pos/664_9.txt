STMD! is one of the most beautiful and enjoyable low-budget movies I've seen for some time. Director Jeff Smith (who also served as co-author, cinematographer and editor) certainly shows his love for undervalued 80's horror movies with this movie! Anyone who loves the fake, turbulent situations, wacky and stereotypical characters of 80's horror movies, will definitely love this very tongue-in-white tribute to the past. <br /> <br /> STMD! definitely live by the features described in the poster and then some. It has all the "excessive violence" and "gratuitous nudity" reminiscent of the 80-year-old horror movies that we all love. I watched an explosion of STMD! Out of the 80's outfits that carry the stereotypical characters to the blood, the goofy splashes, I just couldn't get enough!
