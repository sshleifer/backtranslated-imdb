A bitter, self-centered Army cadet arrives at WEST-POINT with a dangerous manner of masculine attitude towards the Corps. <br /> <br /> In a role that obviously suits him, William Haines appears in this highly pleasing tale of honor. & friendship. In the first half of the film, a Grade A playmaker, Haines, is busy with his usual Silly Billy behavior, which, under normal circumstances, had to limit himself to the guardhouse. However, the latter half becomes very serious and leads to Haines' moral redemption and gives him a good opportunity to portray his acting talents. If WEST POINT does not reach the caliber of Haines's previous TELL IT TO THE MARINES (1926), it is undoubtedly due to the lack of a charisma and quality suit for Lon Chaney for Haines to work with. However, this tribute to the army is very effective entertainment and should be appreciated on its own merits. <br /> <br /> Joan Crawford appears as Haines love affair and plays the virgin daughter of the local innkeeper. Joan is beautiful and beautiful and especially shining in her first scenes, when she meets Haines on a Hudson River ferry and is subject to his usual immature antiques. Haines & Crawford made five quiet movies and were many friends for life. He was the much larger celebrity in this period and gave her many tips to continue in Hollywood. A superstar himself in the early 1930s, she returned from MGM after 1940 by promoting his career change to interior decoration. <br /> <br /> Little William Bakewell is effectively thrown as a Plebe humbling Haines; their relationship actually becomes more of a sentimental treatment than that of Haines & Crawford. <br /> <br /> The film was made with the full cooperation of the War Department. Extensive film shooting at the Academy greatly helps with the atmosphere of the production, given by MGM excellent production values. <br /> <br /> WEST POINT was recently restored and released an exciting new score by David Davidson.
