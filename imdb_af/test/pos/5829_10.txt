One of the best TV shows out there, if not the best. Why? Simple: It's fun to show our real life in jail, without any clicks and predictable twists. It's not Prison Break or any other show, actually comparing to Oz's show Sopranos looks like a story for kids. Profanity, curse, shots of explicit violence and the use of drugs, disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes ... all this and more in Oz. But that's not the best part of Oz; the characters are the strongest point of this show; They are all excellent and not annoying, despite the fact that we look at brutal criminals. The actors are excellent, my favorite is the actors playing Ryan O'Reilly and Tobias Beecher, because they are so unique and completely change their behavior. And above all ... they have no regrets for their actions. Overall ... Oz is a wonderful show, the best one out there. Forget about CSI and point out stupid doctors ... this is the deal ... OZ!
