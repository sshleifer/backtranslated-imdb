I must honestly say that a CAT IN THE BRAIN is one of the most fun and unceasingly hilarious movies I've ever seen. This film is full of silly dialogue, ridiculous scenes and a self-plot that captivates legendary horror director Lucio Fulci himself. <br /> <br /> The twisted story line is about an aging director (Fulci, who is also called Lucio Fulci in the movie ...) who begins to nut and hallucinate because of all the evil things he in film in the past few years. He goes on to shrink which Fulci hypnotizes, telling him he will believe himself as a murderer, but that shrinking will be the real murder. The rest of the film consists of shots from the "film" that Fulci regulates during all of this action, scenes of the shrinking people who grab such a fiction moron, and some of Fulci's hallucination sequences. Oh, and also some tits that are well thrown in. <br /> <br /> A CAT IN THE BRAIN is completely exaggerated and ridiculous in every way. The gore is classic Fulci - and strong with many fair scenes. The chain saw cut of a female body is pretty cool, just like the chain saw of a little boy. Many hikes, goggles and other cool screens make this one a beautiful non-stop massacre. The ridiculous dialogue (LIKE IT! LIKE IT !!!), as well as some of the crazy scenes (the Nazi orgy, the opera singing and the culmination of an innocent hippie come in easy mind ...) make this a fun like hell. Not as dark as some of Fulci's other films - CAT is more of a self-supporting horror / comedy, if it's not meant to be funny, it's actually a sadness. I say to grab and settle a fifth of cheap bourbon in this one. I watched CAT with some friends and we laughed all the time. THIS is the good movie of the summer ... Recommended 8/10
