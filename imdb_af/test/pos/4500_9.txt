It's a movie that left me breathless ....... that wants to learn more about Afghan history and traditions. With today's "murderous" mantra cloud reality, it was inspiring to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs. <br /> <br /> Casting was impeccable, the scenery was wonderful. The play was the first time and the fact that the Academy overlooked it (except it is music) is unforgivable. <br /> <br /> The writing is wonderful and such and emotional journey. An "ugly cry" from this viewer. <br /> <br /> A movie worth watching a second and third time.
