Of course, being a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's Clockwork Orange was "no problem" about seeing this one. But I have postponed it for too long because some of my friends discarded it with comments such as "extremely boring", or "nothing happened" "a total waste of time". But when I saw images on the internet of the mysterious black monolith, I could see a glimpse of the wonderful experience of 2001: a Space Odyssey. There was no doubt in my mind that I would rent the same night that night. <br /> <br /> It was the greatest visual experience of my life. Of course, looking at a very good picture or picture can be wonderful, but looking at a movie with the same kind of virtuosity built into each frame, adding a whole new dimension to it. My god ... I love my friends a lot, but it's a pity I can't share the thing that excites my heart with excitement and lets my spirit fly like a bird in the air. That thing, my friends, is beauty. As this film is going to show, beauty is terribly underestimated in our technologically advanced, intellectually-level, consumer-driven fast-food western societies. However, this does not mean that I am rejecting these fast-paced societies or looking down on them (and also not Kubrick), but only that they can be so much more than just stopping people for a while and taking a moment to absorb the mere beauty of the world we live in. And what better opportunity is there to do that, then slowing down to the elegant fit of this movie and waking yourself to that place between waking and dreaming. <br /> <br /> Going to this place, it's possible to get a so-called "natural high". This is something our spirit can do when we meet pure and unlimited beauty. And never in my life did this "natural high" or "spiritual orgasm" as it is called by some or "samaddhi" by others. Yes, it is more intense than regular orgasm ... a few times more intense actually. Many religions have claimed that this particular feeling has proven right. Are they right? For me, a straightforward answer to such a question will only detract from the impenetrable stunning mystery of the universe. In my opinion, the film tries to give the same secret through the portrayal of the black monolith and by saying: "Apart from a single very powerful radio emission aimed at Jupiter, the four million-year-old black monolith has been completely inert. The origin and purpose of it is still a complete secret. "The trance that Bowman experiences is the same thing I experience when I look at those beautiful visuals. <br /> <br /> I can imagine that mystery may be frustrating for those who need straightforward fast answers to great ontological questions. But instead of comforting us, we are constantly annoyed by the awareness of the simplifications found in these responses. The doubt and discomfort followed will point us to the fact that all this trouble is experiencing the deepest intellectual activity as a source of all these problems, but we have only our easy answers to blame. But this film shows us that when rapid ontological statements give rise to nothing but doubt, we can always rely on phenomena to make the world sense. From the moment you realize that beauty is something that can really only be presented to us as a phenomenon, and never as a thing in itself, the mysterious black monolith is no longer disturbing, frightening or annoying, but it becomes fascinating, enchanting and perhaps even comforting. We do not need an answer that is really there to be in touch with one of the greatest forces in our lives. When we can allow mystery what it is to even embrace it ... we can finally rest our souls. I'm pretty sure a movie that contains so much beauty and so much philosophical and artistic depth can never really be surpassed. Especially now that the greatest director who ever lived is no longer with us.
