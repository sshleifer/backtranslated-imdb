This movie is definitely well built, starting and ending in the dark, focusing on Lili Smith / Schmidt, Julie Andrews, initially the singer's "angel" later the infamous spy. <br /> <br /> It's beautiful! I saw the movie about 15 years ago and watched it recently. While being criticized by critics in the 70s, dismissing 'cinema vulgaris' and lacking the structure, the time proved wrong. Blake Edwards definitely made a film that is almost lyrical. <br /> <br /> The movie pushes and turns (aerial photography, Julie Andrews in motion) and captivates. One should only buy in the assumption that Julie Andrews is a spy whose mission went wrong. With light chemistry between Julie Andrews and Rock Hudson, one has to believe that they are lovers - who fall in love with each other. And in the end, love is much more important than wars. And so we keep innocence. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of subtle acting, and the film certainly reaches emotional depths that are often not seen in comedies. There are wonderful comic elements (the French goons in Victor / Victoria), interesting diplomatic types (remind me of the Tamarind Seed, seen about 18 years ago) and a general sense of goodwill. <br /> <br /> Turn off all unbelief and this movie will carry you away. Julie Andrews's ringing from war songs and the haunting "Whistling Away the Dark" are enough to turn on the TV just for the soundtrack. And the striptease number, like the 'Jenny' number in Star! work. <br /> <br /> Like a good champagne, this movie ate well. Paramount should bring it to the DVD as soon as possible. The same goes for starring the laser disk of Star! to DVD. These are both interesting pieces by Julie Andrews's meticulous and then understated works.
