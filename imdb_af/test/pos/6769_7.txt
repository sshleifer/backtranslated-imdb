Send it to the freezer. This is the solution that two butchers find after selling the popularity of human flesh. An amazing story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror movie. The complex characters reject superficial classification and make the story interesting and worthwhile - if you can stand it. Definitely a dark movie, but also a bit redemptive.
