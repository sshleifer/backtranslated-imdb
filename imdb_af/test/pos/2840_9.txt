This movie can only make you cooooo. The movie was worth the dark trip to town. Betty (Renee Zellweger) is the only "acceptable" group out there. Her character is so charming and so convincing that you find yourself in forgiveness if she is such a fool. I can even let myself be lost in Betty's adoring fantasy, if not for the fact that dr. Ravell's real name is George. And speak of the devil; "viewer" Greg Kinnear fills his role very well. While Charlie (Morgan Freeman) desires you to wish her out, Wesley (Chris Rock), you want to tie him to a chair. And Rosa (Tia Texada) takes you back to the light grade school friendships. The sheriff encourages you to feed him donuts and lose his name. The rest of the casting fits well. Never one to do the same movie twice, Nurse Betty is the exception. One of these long, cold, smiles over something winter days.
