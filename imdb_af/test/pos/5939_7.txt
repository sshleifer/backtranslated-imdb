This was essentially a remake of "Diagnosis Murder" minus Victoria Rowell, Scott Baio and Charlie Schlatter. Dick plays a college professor who teaches Criminology 101 and can't even find his own classroom. Barry is now a private eye, not related to Dick. That lets Barry shoot at guys who are playing away from him, which a policeman can't do. Barry still gets the girl. Tracey Needham depicts the girl. She is the main suspect and Dick and Barry believe she is innocent and proves it. It's all the spoiler you get. The end is sufficiently unexpected that you don't know it halfway through the movie. <br /> <br /> Don't take it seriously. Don't criticize it. Just sit back and enjoy Dick and Barry Van Dyke.
