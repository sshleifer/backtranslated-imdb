Although not the most technically advanced movie I saw, it was a fun and fun few hours. The main characters are sweet and you really get them, and feel something when Susie Q. needs to go, but feel good again when she returns as Maggie. <br /> <br /> Lots of dialogue and a confronted plot line, but most of all, great fun.
