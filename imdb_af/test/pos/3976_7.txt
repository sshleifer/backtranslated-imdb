I saw the trailer and read some reviews, and I had low expectations for this movie. I was pleasantly surprised. While the plot is a bit off-beat, everyone in this movie is drawn to a nice flick for many a laugh. The writing and jokes are much more literate than I expected. Better still, they are rendered aplomb by unknown actors who do all well. <br /> <br /> The main reasons I wanted to see this movie were Justin Long and Lewis Black. Lang is from "Ed" and the new Apple computer ads. He just came into his own as an actor in "Ed" and he was excellent here. He is of course in front of the camera. Lewis Black is a social commentator who does not pull. He is once every two weeks on the Daily Show at Comedy Central, but he really appears in HBO's "Red, White, and Screwed." I regularly find him on XM Radio's uncensored comedy channel. Give Swart an idea and let him improvise. Whether its rants and lines are written or improvised here doesn't matter. He is invaluable in delivering his thoughts on middle-class anxiety. One thing about Black's delivery, his hand gestures is not that of a comedian. It just seems he has a conversation with you, and I think it makes him unconsciously more effective.
