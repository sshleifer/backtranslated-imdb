This often malignant movie is a must for fans of Blake Edwards, Julie Andrews, Henry Mancini, or Hollywood musicals. Other writers commented on the shifts in tone, confusion of plot, etc., but the film has many things to recommend. The score is one of Henry Mancini's best (and he wrote a lot of wonderful), several songs are perfectly sung by Andrews. Julie's performance is nuanced and she is poured into beautiful clothes. She's absolutely loved her here. , the on-site shots are breathtaking, and there are a few funny inspector Clouseau-type siggats to start. Rock Hudson phoned basically in his show, but he's passably good. A true curiosity item in what it was the last big movie Julie has for about 10 years and in many ways, is a forerunner to Victor / Victoria. It is nice to watch and listen to. When will it be available on DVD ??? If so, I want one of both versions - the longer and shorter, the director's track. Since it is in S.O.B. , they will make a good two-pack!
