A slight case of murder is an excellent TV movie, which is worth the price of a rent. William H. Macy is wonderful as a film critic who accidentally kills his mistress and then tries to hide the crime. Although it may look dark, the movie is pretty light and funny, with many unforgettable lines. "I believe I owe Bill FRESH an excuse, and my personal favorite". Next week, answer these two questions about film noir, What do these people do during the day? And why does it always rain?). The film has a major supporting role, including Macy's real wife, Felcity Huffman, James Cromwell and Adam Arkin. must see Macy fans!
