It's a very dark movie, somewhat better than the average Asylum movie. It was much better than I thought it would be, a combination of a psychological thriller and a horror movie. <br /> <br /> The voice on the phone is very creepy - this voice without face, this unknown and threatening voice works really well in the movie, as we never see the murderer's face, become the imagination of the spectator left. <br /> <br /> The action and tension never get lost and after the first half of the movie it becomes vertiginous; There is not much in this movie, just enough to serve the story and the director also does a good job of keeping your attention. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie an 8/10 because some clich√©s.
