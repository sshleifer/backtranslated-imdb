Fans of Gerry Anderson's productions will recognize various actors and vehicles from UFO (made to Doppelg채nger) - as well as sound effects from various Anderson series. Barry Gray's excellent music (mostly unique to this movie) adds to the sense of fame. For these reasons alone, I think any Gerry Anderson fan Doppelg채nger will be worth it. <br /> <br /> Justified as a movie, it should be said that Doppelg채nger is wrong. It is known that there were major problems during the production, and I suspect that is why there is a time consuming plot that suddenly ends and apparently has no relevance to the rest of the story. Presumably, time / budget constraints prevented the relevance of budding! <br /> <br /> Distractingly, the special effects range from outstanding good - better than any 1960 movie I know of - disappointingly bad. <br /> <br /> However, even with these errors, Doppelg채nger's main story is well told and the viewer (or at least this viewer) is involved throughout. Perhaps the end is not what one expects from Anderson, but at the same time it is typical of Anderson, and that is certainly appropriate. To find out what I mean, you should see it for yourself. :)
