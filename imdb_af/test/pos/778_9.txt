I caught the first show of rylesses at the Tribeca Film Festival. Rupert Grint shows he can act against Harry Potter. Laura Linney is wonderful as the excessive mother. Julie Walters is hilarious as Lady Evie Walton, with a mouth worse than a sailor. I hope this movie is picked up by an American distributor so everyone can see it. This movie is not just about driving lessons, but lessons for life. Ben (Rupert Grint) is torn between his over-abusive mother and father wanting to obey and want to lead his own life. It's an amazing movie, from an amazing director whose own life has been taken and put on the screen so everyone can see, and everyone who can, must.
