I've seen it on television more years ago than I can remember, but never forgot Sammy Davis, Jr.'s performance. I just thought of looking for video. This version of Porgy and Bess is a treasure. I'd love to see it again and introduce my son to it as well. I just can't think of why it was announced as one of the greatest performances, Sammy Davis, Jr. every time. Whoever is responsible for not bringing it to audiences should be ashamed of his / her ignorance. However, I will continue to search for it. Perhaps the executives responsible for such things will realize the forgotten work of so many African American actors.
