It occurred to me as I watched Imaginary Heroes that a writer trying to make a family relationship drama should seriously consider descending a child or two into the opening pool as a way to open his characters and reveal themselves. There must be something about this storyline, as every other family drama in the pike seems to be using this device in some form ("Paradise" and "Moonlight Mile" are just two of the more recent examples that start immediately. jumping To remember, although one can come back to a golden cute like "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?" to make the point too). It's not that the death of a child is an illegal subject for serious movies to explore. Far from it. Just like any subject, it can be so overused that it's just another movie clique, a convenient narration card hand to make the ball roll and to give the characters something to struggle with the rest of the time we reach spend with them. <br /> <br /> The latest kind of work is 'Imaginary Heroes', a movie that is heavily lent to being one of the earliest and perhaps best-known examples of the "family dealing with the death of a child" genre. the Oscar-winning "Ordinary People". Like the characters in the previous movie, the Travises on the surface seem to be the ideal suburban family, one fatal day, their eldest son, Matt, who is the "golden boy" athlete and therefore the apple of his father's eye, murdered himself without explanation (one small difference is that the boy dies in "Ordinary People" because of an accident, not a suicide). It is Matt's younger brother, Tim, who is excited to find the body, and accepts the role of protagonist in the film. Each of the remaining relatives deals with the tragedy in his or her own way. Matt, who has always lived in the shade of his older brother, is increasingly alienated from the father who has virtually ignored his entire life and is beginning to weaken into drugs. Ben, the father, is swallowed up by feelings of repentance and guilt, which turn away from his work and his family. His wife, Sandy, is the most complex character in the film, a generous child of the '60s who feels strange in the role of mother and wife, as she endures a basically loveless marriage in sterile suburbs. She spent most of her time after the tragedy was trying to get past her poke. <br /> <br /> As written and directed by Dan Harris, "Imaginary Heroes" appears as a very uneven film. For every scene that feels real and authentic, there is another that appears as arbitrary and uncomfortable. One sometimes has the sense that Harris may be an admirable purpose for every possible life situation he can see in his screenplay, but one that unnecessarily makes the movie melodramatic. Instead of identifying with the characters and being caught up in their fate, we often find ourselves thinking, "Oh, come on, now what?" For teen suicide is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the hot-button topics covered in this movie; The script also touches on drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse, sexual identity conflict, life-threatening illness, even unintentional gay invasion. This is the "all but kitchen sink" center in writing that robs the film of much of the credibility we really have to take care of. <br /> <br /> Not to say that "Imaginary Heroes" is not a bad or unfair movie. Much of what it has to say about family relationships and values ​​in the 21st century is insightful, original, sharp and deep. First credit for his success goes to the actors, Emile Hirsch, Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels, who deliver sharply sensitive performances in their respective roles. It is they who triumph over the narrative victories to stimulate our brain and touch our hearts. In addition, Harris reaches an effective melancholic tone throughout, but one that is frequently increased by a bad need for brave dark comedy. <br /> <br /> "Imaginary Heroes" may be unfocused and distracted at times, but its fine performances and subtle moods make it a movie worthy look.
