Original movie lovers may actually like this show if they just stop complaining all the time. <br /> <br /> The Emperor's New School brings old jokes from the movie, such as pulling the lever to Yzma's lab and pausing Kuzco. episode. But as it is a children's show, it's just classic and is in their right places. Although the style is much easier, the animation and characters keep their personalities very good and it really surprised me. Eartha Kitt makes excellent voice work for Yzma and J.P Manoux does a wonderful job for Kuzco's voice instead of David Spade, who played Kuzco in the movie. Great plots, hilarious moments and Kuzco's incredible look make this show worth watching. (Just stop complaining about everything!)
