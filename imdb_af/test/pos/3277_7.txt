A good old-fashioned flight and revenge vest, with a twist and a touch of gravitas, by injecting a little black social history into its plot. Lead by Mario Van Peebles, who does well, the gang of misfits on the run of Billy Zane's (seemingly unstoppable) army is big-witted, relaxing themselves well, their adventures are probably quite fun and exciting. There are some nice moody flashback scenes that set the hero's character and background, a great shootout that ends as our heroes defend the city from greedy white land grabbers. And even Stephen Baldwin is not bad at this enjoyable yet powerful Western.
