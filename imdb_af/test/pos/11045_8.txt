Watching both these movies simultaneously is not a bad idea to get a feel for early movie production and respond to camera styles. I nod to Garbo (but not much) to her naturalness. Robeson is majestic. But his performance is aimed at a large proscenium theater. Something else that struck me was the movie themes of empowerment for women and minorities. There were no films that came out of Hollywood, but it allowed the voices of marginal characters like Anna and Brutus to take the foreground. These were many progressive movies for their time. It is quite likely that O'Neill saw the writing on the wall before everyone else did about America's future.
