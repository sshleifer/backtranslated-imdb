It was a very nice soft film for men and women. Much nudity / gender, but without the overall raunch you usually find. They couldn't have done better work because the whole ensemble was stunning. Trust my guys, if you want to get your wife in the mood, get something with Bobby Johnston in it! And I'm sure beautiful Monique Parent, Samantha McConnell and the rest of the ladies will do it for any heterosexual man. Unfortunately, Bobby and Monique do not share a scene and if you are aware of a movie where they do, please please please! I'd like to know. Photography was much better than usual. So was the story. Predictable, but nice, lovely and romantic. At least it wasn't one of those annoyingly predictable murder mysteries full of blonde women with big fake breasts. I give this 7/10!
