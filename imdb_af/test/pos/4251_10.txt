This movie improved in time. I can't believe it was forty years ago when I saw it at age 15. Yes, that's right. Movie ratings were not yet a reality, so any teenager could walk in any movie. Imagine what it was like for a child to see both Midnight Cowboy and Putney Swope in the same year. Imagine the time. Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King have just been killed, but the next summer, a man on the moon and Woodstock walked. Putney Swope was the Woodstock nation's chance to keep it to the man. You'll see where Robert Downey, Jr., has his sardonic sheen. His old man was a direct hero to children like me. No bumps are drawn in these classics, and obsolete hippies will be happy when they revive this era. Hopefully, new flower children will be increased by this, and this present era of fascism will come under the same investigation that my era is subject to.
