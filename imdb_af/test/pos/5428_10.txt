This is a masterpiece. "The Big Snit" is a crazy, strange, hilarious and finally vivid look at an old couple and their quiet life, arguing over the saw and scraping while a nuclear war is raging offshore. Everything in this great animated short is unforgettable. The eyeshadow of the woman, the vacuum cleaner, the man's fetish (keep an eye on the backgrounds!), The very verbal cat, the demented game show, the "informative" news anchor, the "beautiful" accordion serenade and the moving and memorable end. I'm so glad I found The Big Snit, which is one of the greatest works of film ever made.
