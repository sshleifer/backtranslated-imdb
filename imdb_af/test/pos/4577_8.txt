This movie deserves better. Mike Judge's satirical white revealed too much in this country trying to deny ... we become thinner than a society. <br /> <br /> Can the 24-hour Anna Nicole cover be any further proof? Mike Judge paints a frightening future, where the stupor survives and thrives. Get up and think and laugh. Can you look at the world and not ask, do we become thinner? Are we moving through the human trash and our own trash? (Beware of landslides). <br /> <br /> The movie is really funny. I'll tell you more about the plot, but I don't want to spoil it. <br /> <br /> So why release this movie with ZERO promotion? Could it be that the stupid people are already taking over?
