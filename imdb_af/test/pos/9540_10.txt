The Railway Children may be my favorite movie of all time, just for the brilliant play, the warm, human interaction of the 3 kids and the people they meet, near the railway in the beautiful English countryside. Jenny Augutter is especially credible in her role as 'Bobbie' the older brother or sister of her sister Phyllis and brother Peter. The adventures they discover and relationships formed in their new home and surrounding area are very real and fascinating. The scenery is beautiful, the trains are part of Britain's great history and the soundtrack moves a lot. This heart-warming film never fails to bring tears into my eyes every time and I make my homesick. I often wonder if I should have been born in that era, as I think I would just fit if people treated each other. with so much chivalry and decency. <br /> <br /> In short, I consider this movie a bit of a masterpiece and a must see for anyone who considers themselves a "sensitive or caring type". Edith Nesbit has this story in the early 1900s and is a wonderful story. More kids should read it today or watch the movie instead of violent video games. If we had more movies of this nature, the world would be a better place.
