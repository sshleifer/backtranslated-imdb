Or maybe not. Whatever anyone thinks of "Broadcast News," good or bad, is almost all the credit for that "thinking" of writer-producer director James L. Brooks. As a screenwriter (of which he has long been one of the best), it is not easy to destroy a whole business - in this case the "business" is television news - but to do it with a smile, " a wink, a knowing nod and a laugh almost every step of the way. To do everything about real talent, J. Brooks in abundance. <br /> <br /> In his summary, one user on this site asked the musical question: "Did Walter Cronkite act like this?" Answerve: No! Of course not! And the reason for that is in Walter's - Mr. Cronkite's day - the only thing that mattered was to bring the news to the people. The same goes for John Chancellor and Chet and David and Douglas Edwards and Howard K. Smith. Sure, they had to pay lip service to pay attention to their ratings, if they just wanted their bosses. But all they really care about was THE NEWS SELF. <br /> <br /> Now, of course, everything that has changed. For the past 25-30 years in the network news business, the only thing that really matters is ratings, ratings, ratings. The bottom line. How much money will our news department make for the network? Don't believe it? <br /> <br /> Let's look at the "Big Three": Tom Brokaw, Dan Earl and Peter Jennings (also known as Stanley Stunning). All three have been working at their respective anchor banks for the past 15-20 years. (Peter actually got his first shot at the national anchor bank, but was completely unprepared in the 1960s.) Of the three, Dan is the one with the largest in-field training as a reporter. Personally, I believe all three good jobs as news anchors and earn their positions. All that has nothing to do with why all three are actually in those posts. All three are now in their 60's (Then push the big 7-0) and all three still look very good. And if you think they're still looking for, imagine how good they seem to be in their 40's, when all three were hired for (let's say, "sit in") their current job. But do you honestly believe any of these three would have been 'broken in' if he looked, let's say, Fred Gwynne ("Herman Munster"). Or love - deviate from the sky - ME !!! Not only when Dan retired tomorrow is a younger (if he is today) Walter Cronkite unable to get his old job back. Why? Not pretty enough. And it won't matter that he, or once, was "the most trusted man in America." <br /> <br /> That's what Broadcast News is about. Tom Grunnick (William Hurt), the next beautiful-boy-national-news-anchor-to-who's having trouble with a few little things, like thinking for himself, writing things, and knowing. Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the brilliant news producer with news industry standards and ethics, all thrown into the wind, even when she falls for beautiful-son-Tom. And Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks, no relationship with James L.), a top news writer and field reporter who has no hope of a national job, because he "flop-sweat" behind the anchor. And many other such flawed characters you really know exist in the news sections of the various networks. <br /> <br /> "Network" has blown the route. Eleven years later, Broadcast News carried the torch as a worthy successor. In the new millennium, which will be the next film to abuse the business of the network "news you can use". Or maybe not.
