Accept is a 2006 teenage movie starring the Mac and PC ads. The movie is about Bartelby. B. If a man who rejected all the colleges he applied for, he decides to make his own college and invite all other people who have not. There are hundreds of people reporting to his school. The movie is hilarious and I was fortunate to buy it for $ 5.00 for a purchase and I always watched it. Overall this movie is a must see for fans of all comedy, as it is funny, witty and just a good movie. I rate this movie a very fair 78%. GO TO ACCEPT DO A SEQUEL GUYS BUT SEE IT IS NOT CRAFT.
