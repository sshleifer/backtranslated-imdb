Want to know if "The Outsiders" (Australian TV series) will ever be released on DVD in the future? And is the music (Title Theme) available on CD? <br /> <br /> There was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and had to go a total of at least three or even four series. <Br /> <br /> The young German actor in the series was also in a German TV series called "Black Forest Clinic" which was sown here in the UK with English dialogue that exceeded lip sync. <br /> <br /> I am looking forward to hearing any comments from TV industry staff on the above questions, thanks in advance.
