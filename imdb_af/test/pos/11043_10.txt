The beautiful Greta Garbo is in top form in this, her first talkie. She gets good support from the rest of the role that Charles Bickford includes the rugged sailor who catches her heart. Me. Garbo gives a good performance as she usually does as the estranged daughter of a sea captain who returns after fifteen years. Also in the movie is that great actress Marie Dressler. A great movie!
