Last Days is a very, very independent movie. And compared to many of today's more modern films, it lacks in many parts. The shootings sometimes look amateurish, the dialogues can be a little choppy and the characters are not impressive. So, don't have too much hope for this movie, because as I said, it's very independent. But whatever is lacking in the concrete aspects of the movie can be overlooked because of the charm of the story! I can't say the plot is outstandingly original, but the story is still very beautiful and heartwarming! It's not about gay versus straight, it's about faith and how you decide to run your own life! It's a stupid story that lets you both cry and smile at the same time! To be honest, Last Days is far from perfect, but I really loved the movie and I highly recommend it! It is very critical of the religious aspects of our society, and there is homosexuality involved - but approaching it with an open mind, and I'm pretty sure most people will enjoy as much as I do!
