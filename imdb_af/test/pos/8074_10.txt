I watched this movie twice at the Transilvania International Film Festival (TIFF), the movie is in competition and I really hope Esteban Sapir will receive one of the awards (at least the best picture prize). <br /> <br /> As a silent movie fan, I am interested in contemporary movies that cite or recreate the language of the Yester Year Theater. The previous reviewer highlights the quotes from Fritz Lang and Fr. W. Murnau. As I see it, the film directly refers to Lang's Metropole, and the allegorical-parabolic character of its plots. But I didn't see Murnau in it. However, there is a more obvious Melies tribute: the Moon with a human face (here cigar smoke) and the paper-made, painted mountains and city landscapes. I enjoyed the movie especially for his visual images, and in the meantime I found the story of fatigue and the creative communication methods used by the inhabitants of the voiceless city very interesting. From this perspective, this movie is a unique reflection on the fatigue of the silent theater, because in the silence's films one can hardly find stories with dumb characters. In this case, it can be questioned whether the story about the stolen voices was the motivation for the silent film form, or there is an intention to play on the fatigue of silent movies. Another example of this kind of reflection I found in Guy Maddin's Careful, where the residents of a mountain village have limitations in using their voices. I am planning to write a paper on it, if you have movies related to this topic please let me know !!! <br /> <br /> I recommend Esteban Sapir's movie to every movie creator. (One of the critics mentioned it: the jewel of the festival.) <br /> <br /> PS: Winners were announced and the movie won the Best Cinematography Award!
