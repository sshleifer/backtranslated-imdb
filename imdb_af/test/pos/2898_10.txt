How are these guys going? They are about 50 years old and act as if they were only 30. They play 3 hours of music at each concert, and barely break a sweat. This DVD is their first concert in Rio, Brazil. Although people do not speak English, they try to memorize the words to the most famous Rush songs and try to sing a foreign language at the concert with their best friends. <br /> <br /> From Tom Sawyer to The Spirit of Radio, this concert DVD will keep you in the chair not to break or move away from the classic you listened to when you were young. This is their 30th reunion tour (beginning in 1974). I went to their Scranton PA concert, and it was just as well, but in PA they didn't play voluntarily, so I was upset. <br /> <br /> They volunteered, they have the trees, they have YYZ, The Pass, Driven, Dream Line, Red Sector A, Limelight, Roll the Legs, 2112, and more. 10 out of 10 because nothing else compares. If you're never going to a Rush concert, then at least buy this DVD.
