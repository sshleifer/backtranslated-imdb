Otto Preminger's "The Man with the Golden Arm" is a reference to heroin addiction - something that should be quite risky to film in 1955, fifty years ago (the sensors today have a problem with drug content in movies!). <br /> <br /> The lead role was initially presented to Marlon Brando, and then cut by Frank Sinatra before Brando responded. Sinatra convincingly depicts a pro-card dealer and ex-heroin addict returning to the city to stop himself from the temptations of the temptations. <br /> <br /> Preminger is one of my favorite directors (his "Anatomy of a Murder" James Stewart's lead is a brilliant and revolutionary courtroom drama). Preminger helped a lot to change the face of the theater in the 50's - "Anatomy of a Murder" was extremely controversial when it challenged because of its plot and content (references to rape, women's panties, seduction, etc.) . and "The Man with the Golden Arm" deals with a topic that is equally volatile. <br /> <br /> Preminger, however, pulls it off without becoming exploitable. It is like a forerunner of "The Panic in Needle Park" (1971) and has more than a few similarities in terms of general motifs for the classic Billy Wilder movie Lost Weekend, with Ray Milland. These three films are probably the best films about alcoholism that predict the 1980s and remain relevant today.
