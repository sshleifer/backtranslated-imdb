Recovery is a well-judged and balanced drama of a sensitive subject that does not sentimentalize the main characters. David Tennant and Sarah Parish face the complex and contradictory emotions of some deeply in love with the personality changes they both endure and also have to survive a tragic accident. <br /> <br /> Tennant, like Alan, brings humor as well as a dangerous lecherousness, as an engineer recovering from a memory loss caused by a road accident. Alan is not merely portrayed as a victim, but as one with feelings does what he can best to make sense of his new life. Sarah Parish's Tricia is not a cut housewife who will do anything to support her husband. She struggles to fall in love with Alan, because the man she is once new and loved is now a completely different person - a stranger to her. <br /> <br /> Contrary to some opinions, it makes me see perfect Sunday night. Too often, our family dramas or detectives, such as Heartbeat, are shown to rot and abandon the brain. Program commissioners seem to think that the traditional day of rest is also a day when our thoughts go to sleep. More challenging and thoughtful drama such as Recovery will seriously change the situation.
