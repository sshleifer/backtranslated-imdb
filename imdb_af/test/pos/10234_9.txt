By adapting his own novel "Cabal" for the screen, writer / screenwriter / director, Clive Barker, adapted this wonderful story of outra horror and fantasy. Craig Sheffer plays Boone, a young man suspected of being a serial killer. Police hit him in front of Midian, on the surface a cemetery, but it is actually a haven for monsters that have been avoided by society. When they claim Boone and make him one of them, it causes consequences for everyone, including Boone's dearest friend (the very cute Anne Bobby) and dubious psychiatrist (a pleasant David Cronenberg). <br /> <br /> "Nightbreed" shows the kind of wild and twisted imagination I don't often see in movies. For one thing, Ralph McQuarrie, an old hand to conceptual art who has worked on such films as the initial three Star Wars entries, helps Barker create great "Nightbreed" footage, which immediately starts with the opening credit line. The visual and makeup effects are comprehensive, and production design and cinematography are very impressive. Barker and crew are doing a wonderful job creating this whole world with compelling characters. It is colorful and flamboyant entertainment and is a pleasure to take. And, of course, there is the strong sense of social commentary on intolerance and dwarfism, not to mention the heavy consequences of a person's actions. <br /> <br /> Great supportive action adds to the fun. Cronenberg eats a lot of malicious intent and is a real gas as the bad doctor, while Charles Haid is a fine love-hate type antagonist, a rather nasty police captain. Doug "Pinhead" Bradley is again buried under heavy makeup than the tired Lylesberg, and is solid like a rock. Hugh Ross is a lot of fun like Narcisse, like Catherine Chevalier as Rachel (as a bonus, she breasts her breasts in one order). Simon Bamford, who played the "Butterball Cenobite" in the first two "Hellraiser" pictures, is also featured here. There is even a cool cameo by the 50's and the 60-year-old sci-fi star, John Agar. <br /> <br /> Danny Elfman gives another of his fantastic scores, and Barker slowly leads us through the intriguing story to a tremendous apocalyptic action. /> "Nightbreed" is an excellent genre movie worth checking out for anyone who hasn't seen it. I give it a good recommendation. <br /> <br /> 9/10
