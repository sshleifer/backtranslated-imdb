If you are going to watch this movie, because Michael Caine or Michael Gambon is on it, don't bother it, it's not their typical role, although I found Gambon fantastic. Rather look at Dylan Moran. I'm a fan of everything I've seen him and it's no exception, I didn't even realize he could act, but even the characters he had to leave himself, because I found it totally credible. is impressive, as the audience knows they are fake. <br /> <br /> The plot is genius and although not constant, all the way through it has many other charms. A great movie for people with a sense of humor.
