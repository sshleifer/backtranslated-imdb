From the eastern PA, right on the border of North New Jersey, I still get a feeling like this is a documentary more than a movie. I have friends from New York and New Jersey and this film represents the kind of lifestyle that still exists in the lower income area outside the Big City lifestyle. If you haven't seen this movie and have ever wondered what is really going on in the urban jungle, look at this movie. No really big names actors, it's as if they just pulled these guys off the street and said, adding the realism of the movie, the shows are fantastic! SEE THIS MOVIE!
