I saw the movie for the first time when Quentin Tarantino showed it to some of us at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin. He pretended how freaking he thought he was and how funny it was and in the context of his explanation it was HILARIEUS. I can see how it would be harmful for some audiences, and the subject is not funny, but there are at least three lines in the movie that make me laugh so hard, I thought I'd beep. They don't even come to the halfway, but when they do, oh God ... you'll die. Oh, and Jim Brown is brilliant. He is not in much of the movie, but when he is there, you know whose movie it is. Of course, the best rule in the movie (and the funniest) she is; You will know it if you hear it.
