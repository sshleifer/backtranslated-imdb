Joline (Heather Graham) married Carl (Luke Wilson) and about five hundred and a few days later, Carl is very depressed and leaves her and expects to make the fog in their lives. Joline sees her marriage as an important commitment to the end of her life, and decides to search for Carl in Texas. She is greatly supported by her brother Jay (Casey Affleck), who meets her in the Mexico border. There, Joline meets the confused Carl and realizes she can't change his decision, while Jay Carmen (Patricia Velasquez) knows and starts to meet her and eventually life goes on. This movie is very unpredictable, with a completely different story. I believe this is an independent production. In some areas it is a bit slow and boring, but there are some dialogues that make this movie worthwhile. I liked it, and my voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Rebel's At√© Fim (`Rebels Until the End ') <br /> <br />
