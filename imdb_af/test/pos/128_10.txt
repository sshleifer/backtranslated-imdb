It is worth hiding on the Hindu pantheon before watching this movie. Three main female deities - wise Sita, who encourage Lakshmi and Kali the Transformer - as well as three main male gods - grave Rama, playful Krishna and Shiva the Ender - are all indicated. To know the folklore so surely, every Indian member of the audience knows a wealth of telling the contemporary story. In fact, a folk tale is only adopted on stage, as part of a lesson in spirituality, and then in the film's "real life." "Fire" speaks against the misogyny and homophobia in society to which producers are indigenous. It does so with a beauty that reflects the message in various levels of viewer's awareness, making it a deeply satisfying presentation. This is the best movie I've seen in the last ten years; highly recommended!
