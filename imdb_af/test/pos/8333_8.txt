In World War II, America developed a brand new BIG Bomber plane. Lois Lane and Clark Kent are going to cover the story when the plane goes on its first mission. Lois pushes away on the plane before it declines. There are also some Japanese saboteurs aboard who have every intention of flying the bomber to Tokyo. Will Lois Superman Warn? What do you think? <br /> <br /> Fast moving, colorful cartoon. The animation is a bit jerky, but much better than what we see today. The color and sound are beautifully restored. Just two problems - the bad music score and the racism (especially in the title). It's pretty good at the same time. An 8.
