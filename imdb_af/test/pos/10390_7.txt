Even though the story is light, the movie is so beautiful and its visuals so peaceful and poetic that it can carry almost the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The movie consists of four related stories, all about different aspects of attraction between man and / or woman and how it is often ethical. Their true desire always seems to be something they can't keep. It will flow like a handful of sand. <br /> <br /> I thought the most interesting story was the last one, where the more unattainable woman was, the more the man wanted her. It is parallel to her deep love for God, which is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to her heart. <br /> <br /> A very good movie. 10/07
