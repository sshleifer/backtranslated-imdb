I just wanted to say that I watch National Velvet on TV, it's now Feb. 2006 and I checked on dates, etc. Surprising to see it was made in 1944 and Rooney was 24 years old, while Liz Taylor only 12, who is a completed English actress she is. <br /> <br /> To correct some Americans contributors: There are no Irish towns in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing to do with the English countryside. The scenes shown are thought to have been taken on the South Coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (County of Sussex). Unfortunately, no such scene exists. Like many places, roads and buildings are built on the hills and beaches. <br /> <br /> So, please, all your lovely Americans, don't confuse Ireland with England! we make a great exception. Like Texas confused with Coney Island.
