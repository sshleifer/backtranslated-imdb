In the early mid-1970s, a rogue bunch of young Venice, California adolescents from broken homes and the bad side of the town, known as the Z-Boys, had turned their formerly contested world of professional skateboarders on their ear. fiery punk attitude, radical unconventional driving style and unbridled spirit of purity in your face aggression, revolutionizing the sport in the process and paving the way for the very extreme variations on sports that aroused in their influential wake. Director Stacy Peralta, who is one of the legendary Z-Boys himself, tells the incredible benefits of this wonderful power-of-crew in a terrible punchy and visceral way, which is both informative and entertaining: the funny quick fire editing, unceasing fast pace and raw, eager photography delivers a hell of an infectious kinetic buzz, depicting a sense of pure joy and persistent vibrant energy, which is a total pleasure to see. Better yet, this documentary does not sanitize or romanticize its subjects: These villainous boys were so extremely competitive and to themselves that they all had their own ways when the trap of fame and happiness manifested in their lives. The ultimate fate of some guys is offensive and heartbreaking, with a gifted and spontaneous bait-skateboard gear Jay Adams rating as the heartfelt and most tragic: he blasted his chances of the big time and left in jail. The other dudes are also very colorful and personal; Charismatic ball of a hateful and challenging fire Tony Alva is especially present as an arrogant but impressive piece of furious assertive work. Wonderfully told by Sean Penn, with a delicious, easy, nasal nasal nonchalance. The awesome rock soundtrack also smokes seriously. But what really makes this documentary is such a winner, its refreshing, complete lack of pretense. It is just as dynamic, exuberant and extraordinarily extraordinary as the glorious Z-Boys themselves.
