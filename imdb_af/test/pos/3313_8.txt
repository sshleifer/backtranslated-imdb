This 1959 soap opera movie takes us into the lives and loves of three young women in publishing as secretaries. It follows the same idea a few years earlier than THREE Coins in an object. It takes place in New York while MUNTS takes place in Rome, Italy. Our three beauties are Hope Lange, in her first starring role, Suzy Parker and Diane Baker. Long does well and keeps her own opposite a few strong veterans in the business, Joan Crawford. Suzy plays an obsessive woman who hardly loses her baby. Hard to believe that anyone can reject this beauty for any reason, but Louis Jourdan, beating her heart, just does it. Sort takes you back to Paul Neuman who rejects beautiful Elizabth Taylor in the CAT on a hot tin valve or not? Diane Baker, the third girl in distress, meets and dates Robert Evans, before becoming the manufacturer, and man at Ali MacGraw, for which he is known. Hope's boyfriend from home, played by newcomer Brett Halsey, is promising to marry her. She also meets Stephen Boyd, an associate, who has interests in our Hope. All three ladies have their drama ahead of them. Crawford almost steals the film. Her presence and her usual strong bitchy herself are fun to watch. Veteran actor Brian Aherne plays one of the bosses with a jen to pinch our front ladies back. He is delightfully charming. Also in the cast, Martha Hyer, wasted in an ungrateful role, was never really investigated. It is a pity that I like this actress who never wants one role to distinguish her abilities. She played a beloved man in the office by Donald Harron, whom I had the pleasure of working together in a few Shakespeare plays in NYC. He is also a leading actor who is also wasted in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is fun, in Technicolor and cinemascope, led by Jean Negulesco.
