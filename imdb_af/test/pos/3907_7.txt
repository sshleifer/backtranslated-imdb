I believe it is one of Elizabeth Montgomery's best performances in a movie, and I've seen most of her movies. I saw it on television for the first time when I was about fourteen, and I was so scared. I watch this movie every time. now and then and I still enjoy it a lot. I know this movie probably won't scare too many people. It's just about showing that the public has seen too much graphic violence in the past thirty. years or so. I like movies that don't show the graphics, you make your imagination work for you. In addition, the film in this movie was. Jess Walton, who played the sister in the story, was very good, although her part was rather small. She also played in a fantastic television excitement game called The Same Time You Will Never See Me Again With David Hartman. I have the biggest kick from Eileen Heckart's performance as the housekeeper. Eileen was as good as a lady with a very bad attitude. George Maharis, who played the man, was quite effective. Of course, this story had many so-called errors in the plot, but I like the movie anyway. I recommend this movie to people who love a good thriller without graphical violence. I gave this movie a voice of seven.
