Best years of our lives is a movie that has slipped under my radar for years - I heard about it but never had the opportunity to see it. Thanks to TCM On Demand I could see it uncut and commercially free. <br /> <br /> What surprised me about this movie was how quickly it was made after the war. The film is honest with the people who were physically and spiritually wounded in the war. It neatly manages to include almost all races of war experience within three characters. <br /> <br /> We were the Air Force Officer, who was a veteran of the early European bombardment campaign. Due to the horrendous easing rate among the bombers' teams, the Air Force had a reputation for exchanging officers who quickly rose from the ranks. It was so with this man who went from a low drink in civilian life to a Captain and bomber of his B-17. He also suffers from PTSD, then "combat fatigue". <br /> <br /> We had the Army non-com serving in the Pacific and suffered from the horrors of the campaign. His story is beyond that of the Air Force, going from a sought-after job as a banker to a low grunt in the army and rising to the rank of sergeant. Of the stripes on his sleeve it is clear that he is the highest level of sergeant, but he is still on the front line. <br /> <br /> Finally, we have the Marine Seaman, which is part of the faceless support staff. , commonly referred to as REMFs (Back Echelon MFers) by the fellows on the line. Ironically, he suffers the worst physical wounds when working as a mechanic on a naval ship. His ship was hit, presumably by a kamikaze and sank with loss of 400 lives. He is pulled out of the water, but his heavy burnt hands are amputated and replaced with prosthetic hooks. <br /> <br /> TELL the story of how these three meet at a haulage company that comes home and how they fix it. in civil society. <br /> <br /> What impressed me most about this movie is that it never descends into the melodrama despite the obvious problems facing the three main players. The Marine Child, played by a real official, is placed in situations where we can feel sorry for him, but the scripture never lets us feel that emotion. The army sergeant is clearly an alcoholic, and the story points out that he never stays with it. The Air Force captain is struggling with the loss of status when forced to return to the drug store where he has penetrated a soft drink (now bought out by a large chain) and takes a humiliating job to get his thankless and unbelieving wife. support. <br /> <br /> The writing allows many opportunities for all these characters to gain some dramatic highlights about their interests, but it avoids it neatly. But for the excessive dramatic score, the director is worth exploring the obvious. <br /> <br /> In one scene representing the whole movie, the daughter of the army officer (Frederic March) is talking to her father and mother about the air force captain. Despite their marriage, they fell in love, and she is determined to break out the marriage that is apparently upset. Now we have seen thousands of scenes typical of this, where the father is terribly upset and the girl ends with tears in her room, hitting the door and falling on the bed. Later, Ma shows up, consults daughter and offers words of maternal wisdom, and everyone lives happily ever after. <br /> <br /> In BYOOL, this scene is quite different from the cliché I described above. Certainly, the conversation is heated, but all parties are reasonable and there is a serious and timeless discussion of the nature of relationships that are the best dialogue I have seen. <br /> <br /> Ultimately, BYOOL is a highly satisfying film, with honest performances from the whole role. Technically, it's well shot, editing and cinematography frame, but never overshadows the gripping story. Despite the score, which is cliché and dramatic, I give this movie the highest score it deserves
