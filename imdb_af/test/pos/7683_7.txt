I've been waiting for 30 years to watch this movie. I played the soundtrack album as a teen and by my 20s. Recently, I found a reasonable price DVDr and I watched it this morning. It was in wide screen, probably even a 70mm print, stereo, the colors were pretty good, very faded, probably not remastered, but I'm very happy with this clean copy. <br /> <br /> Now for the movie. It's pretty good. I won't say it's great even though there are big scenes in it. Perhaps Premminger may not be the right director for that, but I will say it. For me, the middle piece of the movie was the hurricane scene. Stunningly performed by Premminger. One of the wonderful weather screens of all time. <br /> <br /> In fact, I'm going so far to say that the acting is better than the musical scenes, not that the musical sequences are bad. Not at all. They lacked ... something already. Perhaps it is the fact that there are no close ups and very few medium shots. It was almost like a filming of a stage production. Perhaps it was the feeling Premminger had gone to. In the end it might not be the right choice, but so it goes. It is far from a devastated movie. <br /> <br /> Having said that, not everyone likes the singers on the soundtrack. I always have. They're perfect for this movie. I love the singing voices. The actors' lip-sinking is excellent for the most part. I just wish the songs were staged more imaginatively. Sportin 'Life's two numbers are good, but the intimate numbers do not even feel intimate. They just feel ... far away. Despite this, you can't deny the power of the music. And in the end, that's what comes out loud and clear. Again, perhaps what Premminger was trying to do was to stay out of the way of the incredible music he worked with. I believe he had the right idea, but may have gone too far in the direction. <br /> <br /> The acting is great. Top kudos goes to the big Brock Peters who is acting and singing the part of Crown. He is the ultimate master. We just want him to leave poor Bess alone, and he doesn't. As pride, arrogant and nasty as he is, Sammy Davis Jr.'s classic version of Sportin 'Life is the smooth devil himself and a very charismatic one. Probably, Davis's best movie show. Poor Bess just can't handle two bad men. I'm glad Hermes Pan gives Davis a tap dance number to do. <br /> <br /> Dandridge and Poitier, who are reportedly not impressed by the fact that they are in the movie, are really very sweet. I don't know about chemistry ... there was more chemistry between Dandridge and Peters than there was between Dandridge and Poitier. Yet it worked well for Dorothy and Sidney. <br /> <br /> However, I think they should be proud of the work they did on this movie. They both managed to bring more than one tear to my eye. Their characteristics are very 3D and credible. However, Sidney Poitier's Porgy is almost out of place in catfish. I couldn't help thinking he was Mr. Braithwaite in "To Mr with Love", very educated and well-mannered and spoken, falls at difficult times. He probably wouldn't have been my first choice for the part of Porgy, but hey, he was a big star at the time, so why not? Dorothy's Bess was as perfect as her Carmen Jones, and even more vulnerable this time around. Carmen was probably the flashlight for her to do. <br /> <br /> A very good movie, indeed, these are two sticks short of what I would call a classic. It just doesn't make the ultimate classical degree. Yet there is no reason for the earth why the Gershwin estate has decided to keep this beautiful movie, even though its flaws are hidden from the public as they have. Premminger may have made some strange choices as a director, but the film is nothing to be ashamed of and embarrassed by anyone involved. This is what it is and there are far worse movies than that which is embarrassing on DVD and in the theaters today. Porgy and Bess are not one of them.
