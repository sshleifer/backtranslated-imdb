It is very difficult to find new information about JFK Jr. to get. This fine film had very little of it, but it was a pleasure to watch. The casting was very good and the screenplay, while somewhat like a documentary, was also good. My only complaint was that it wasn't long enough. Perhaps a two-part film might have told us more about his "pre-George" days and his relationships with his mother, sister and other relatives. Some of the material in the book, "American Son" by Richard Blow, would have greatly improved the film. WTBS should be welcomed for producing such an entertaining movie.
