*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** It's easy to see why the script for this movie won an Oscar. At least during the first half. My head was spinning all the funny lines that were confused. Noel Coward plays a publisher in New York ("Why don't you publish books you want?" "What? And the public damages?") What manipulates many hangers. Then he dies in a plane crash and the story becomes a bizarre Flying Dutchman take-off, in which Coward has to find someone who really grieves him before his soul can rest in peace. Very pleasant until it gets bizarre. See in Cinefest in Siracusa in March 2003.
