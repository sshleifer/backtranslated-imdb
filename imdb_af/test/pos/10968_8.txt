I have never seen a film by John Cassavetes two years ago when I saw the death of a Chinese BOOKIE in a Berlin cinema, which I found interesting to make it diplomatic, but not so special. I wanted to see more of his work immediately. Since then I have tried - with the emphasis on trying - to look at his other work, especially SHADOWS. I must admit, it took me a while before I really enjoyed the movie. Initially, the unpolished, raw and improvised way Cassavetes was shot, turned me off a little and I thought of it as an original - absolute - but erroneous and dated experiment. But now, at the review, these little imperfections make it look so fresh, even today. <br /> <br /> Shooting at a minimal budget of $ 40,000 with a skeleton six staff, SHADOWS offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three brothers and sisters in an African-American family in which two out of three brothers and sisters, Ben (Ben Carruthers) and Lelia (Lelia Goldoni), light skin and able to pass for white. Cassavetes asked the actors to retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group, but saw the film as concerned about human problems, as opposed to the racist. Cassavetes shot the film in ten minutes and unfinished editing, a response to 'seamless' Hollywood production values. Cassavete's main inspiration - at least in the movie style shot of the film - was the Italian neo-realist while also emphasizing admiration for Welles' pioneering spirit. The use of amateurs and improvisation may look like some of the Italian neo-realistic directors, but with his bebop score by Charles Mingus and Shafi Hadi, the film feels very different, very American, unlike anything previously made. <br /> <br /> The song with the feathered girls, "I feel like a lolly pop" (or something) feels like light years back to my, ancient history. But no matter how dated it seems, it still makes for a delightful time capsule of the late fifties New York today. I think it is one of the first films made by aspiring filmmakers, realizing that they have improvised an independent film, without Hollywood, and can shoot without a real budget. Seymour Cassel, who acted and was involved in SHADOWS, claims it was Jules Dassin's THE NAKED CITY (1948), who was the first to inspire them, but I think it was the one who saw the eyes of aspiring independent US filmmakers really opened up. br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
