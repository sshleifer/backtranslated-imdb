This movie is like a dirge. Until it comes to musical numbers that are like MIND F * CK, but softer, like a mindset. MIND FOREPLAY. The impressive atmosphere of the speed and desperation of the characters may well be Death-Self-Awesome until you get to the musical numbers. It's a good movie. Optimistic. Strange. Manic-depressive (Bipolar). That's it! THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME. see it anyway. It's a MUSIC !!! WITH DEEP !!!! If you enjoy the existential foam like The Stranger, or Wag for Godot, you probably get a real kick from this one. I had to get the DVD through Amazon.com for $ 12. OH & rock the songs. Well, they rock, but they're not rock, like Calypso, Jazz, Broadway, but by Grace Chung, and I can't find the soundtrack NOW. But I want the songs to be good, and the dances are so nice.
