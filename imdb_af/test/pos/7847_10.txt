During the Civil War, a wounded trade unionist hides in an isolated Confederate women's school; where the principal and the school teacher decide to take care of him and keep him until the problems break between the lonely and sexually frustrated women and girls. The soldier decides to take advantage of this situation, but it eventually comes to a price. <br /> <br /> "Dirty Harry (1971)" (made about the same time from "The Beguiled") can be my favorite collaboration between Eastwood and Siegel, but I tend to think about it. be the couple's best work together. A very atypical, skilled and attractive vehicle for Eastwood is always on its way with a richly controlled direction by Don Siegel and a ghostly music play by Lalo Schifrin. Strongly stretched is the sultrily lurid and pale nature that is intrusive in the psychological composition of the film and the manipulative stranglehold in sexual depravity. It is indifferent and makes it more devastating and entangled when those random shocks and bad intentions grab hold of thrilling tension. The way Siegel illustrates John B Sherry and Grimes Grice's attractive, fat-burning, long-fledged script (taken from Thomas Cullinan's novel) is effectively done by strong emotions and the tight lyrical context of writing. Siegel's strong direction captures the idyllic southern Victorian environment with such a strongly garnished photograph and he clears some strange pervasive images. <br /> <br /> While performances are truly commendable and of high quality. Clint Eastwood as the fluffy suave, sweet talk chameleon union soldier is very impressive and wonderfully assured. A prominent Geraldine Page steals the image as the hardened chieftain and the elegant Elizabeth Hartman adds a delicate sincerity to her innocent character. Mae Mercer is highly adapted to the black girl and Jo Ann Harris is choosing the young pupils' crop with her seductive, cunning person. <br /> <br /> Honestly, while Eastwood's charismatic character is playing the field for its own selfish needs, there are still mixed intentions where one is played (where rivalry between women moves in) is not Better than their gas at the end. Throughout, there is a perverse dark sense of humor and ironic touch in the material. What is demonstrated here is simply more than your basic little-hearted shocker, but one that is thick with intrigue and a sense of realism that is hard to shake. It is also for his utterly ominous title and closing song. <br /> <br /> A staggering, low-key item that's hard to be tempted by its swaying hospitality.
