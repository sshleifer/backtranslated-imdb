This show came to Canada via PBS in the mid 90's and I really loved it. Even 10 years later, looking at the different news networks, but I can't help but think about the cynical manipulation that takes place in the name of ratings and the various "show ponies" we all see on TV as portrayed in various Frontline episodes . The scripts have been written tightly and the actors all have impeccable comic timings and none of them are delivered by an idiotic laugh. There is a lot of funny stuff here very well done and we don't have to tell when to laugh and what to laugh at. I don't understand why this show never went down in North America because it's actually a gem! I was very excited to see the DVDs, even though they are PAL format. I thought I'd rip them to my computer and then look at the converted files. I took a chance and ordered it from ABC? 6 to 8 weeks later I had 3 seasons. Even better, it works on my NTSC DVD player. I suspect any player who bought the last 2 years will play xvid / divx. Good stuff! 10 years later, the episodes are very good! You don't need to know anything about Australian politics to get the humor, because it will all be known to Western audiences. My wife and I had a 10-day Frontline party and are still awake weeks later after watching all 39 episodes
