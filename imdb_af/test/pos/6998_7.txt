This movie goes out to a bad start. An incredible corny monologue is immediately followed by a brilliant, truly incredible spacecraft accident. Then things go downhill again, because you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (apart from the doctor and the psychopath) and b) almost all fit too well into the role of sample food. Hell, half do not even speak English, and prevent the audience from knowing the characters. You feel like you are watching "Deep Blue Sea", meet "Silence of the Lambs", minus the good bits. And unfortunately, the whole thing is trying to get stuck in the daylight screens "On a desert plan with Hannibal Lecter". Vin Diesel is a good actor - but he's not Anthony Hopkins, and he's honest as the smart, hyper cool psig. There is at least one very good scene in which an unexpected survivor is involved - but in addition, you can only eliminate the first thirty minutes or so ... <br /> <br /> But then things are turning. I can't determine exactly the moment, but soon the movie gets much better. It also feels less choppy - the scenes actually follow each other with a consistent story, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a showcase. By the time the first monsters appear, the movie is really nice. By the time the night falls, it's wonderful. Exciting, terrible and exciting. And even the character development of most main characters is well done. If you can just sit at the poor bits, you're at the start for some great entertainment. <br /> <br /> Besides, the visual art bags, and I honestly admit: I love the color and tone of this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10 (could have been 9/10 if but ....)
