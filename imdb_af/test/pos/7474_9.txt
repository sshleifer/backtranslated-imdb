I saw this movie by accident in Paris. I accidentally went to the wrong theater and by the time I realized it wasn't a preview or a short movie, I was addicted. <br /> <br /> Paulina does a phenomenal job keeping your attention to her acting. I can't say enough how impressed I was with her portrayal of this real femme deadly. The rest of the role play also plays very well. Don't get me wrong, it's not the biggest movie ever made, but since I didn't know anything, I left a lasting and very positive impression. <br /> <br /> Finally, don't speak French in France paid off once! I didn't stop talking about this movie for 3 weeks after I saw it.
