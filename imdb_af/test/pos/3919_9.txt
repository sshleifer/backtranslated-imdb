I usually give about 6/10 horror movies, but this one caught my eye. House of Wax was by far the best horror movie I saw ... Even better than the Amityville Horror. <br /> <br /> Paris Hilton was pretty good at this and I have to say, has a good future. Her death scene was probably the coolest. I'll just say how she dies ... <br /> <br /> She gets a huge pole right in her eyes and they put everything up and everything. Gory, eh? Brian Van Holt was very good as both the killers, Bo and Vincent (Vincent has the long hair). He usually plays an average cop or soldier, but he did very well. <br /> <br /> Eliza Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray also performed very well like Carly and Nick Jones. Nick took the spotlight in the first half of the movie, when Eliza drove it back by holding a lot of pain in the second half, such as cutting off the finger, breaking her lips after gluing them together and straightening got punched forward. in the face of Bo. <br /> Overall, I give this movie an 8/10. Fans of horror movies MUST see this.
