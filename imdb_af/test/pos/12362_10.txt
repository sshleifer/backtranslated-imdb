This remarkable film can now be seen in two different versions on the Grapevine Video release which also contains the English translation of Selma Lagerlof's novel which she has based on a Swedish folk tale. The first version is the Swedish amendments under the title THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. The second version is a reconstruction of the way it was shown in the United States under the title THE THE MID-LIGHT, as released by Metro (before it was M-G-M). The real US edition has long since disappeared, but a detailed review in The New York Times tells us how the screens are arranged for domestic release - and both are fascinating to watch. Each version of this film is presented at The Organ Loft in Salt Lake City with live theater organs provided by artist Blaine Gale. A lively recording was made of these performances and was included on the Grapevine Video DVD along with the novel and two-version notes. While the PHANTOM CARRIAGE follows the order of Lagerlof's novel, the STROKE OF MIDNIGHT is easier to follow in some ways. To see the two different changes is an education in how silent movies can be effectively changed for release in different countries. <br /> <br /> Some viewers watch this movie as a horror movie that's definitely not. It is a morality team with shades of supernatural that hit the sharp message of the house. The direct and major performance of the great Victor Sjostrom was far from their time. It's easy to see why M-G-M brought him to Hollywood to make such films like Lillian Gish in THE SCARLET LETTER and THE WIND, as well as Lon Chaney in HIM. In America he was known as Victor Seastrom. He will also star in Ingmar Bergman's WILD BREEDERS, giving a masterful performance. Bergman was heavily influenced in his previous days by KORKARLEN or THE PHANTOM CARRIAGE. <br /> <br /> It's a powerful movie worth taking time to discover and study. The Grapevine Video Release is a great way to do this.
