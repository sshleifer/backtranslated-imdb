There is a version of "Nevsky" shown with a live symphony orchestra, choir, soloist and the movie. If it's ever done within a day's journey, you'll see "Nevsky" done so. The Oklahoma City Philharmonic did it a few years ago with the OKC Canterbury Choir (one of the best places). I think I cried the whole thing, it was one of the most emotionally powerful movie experiences of my life. I'm listening to "Nevsky" on the radio and it still breaks me. There are movies I love, and classic music I love, but there is no combination I can think of, it comes close to the impact of "real-time" Nevsky.
