10 respected directors each shot a short film with operational arias as inspiration (and music). I'll do each one separately: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Roeg (dir) - Giuseppe Verdi (music). A story about a murder attempt in 1931 Vienna. Theresa Russell (Roegs wife) plays a man! Not bad - very nice and exotic. Russell is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Charles Sturridge - Value. No story, but there are some ghostly black and white images that fit the music perfectly. <br /> <br /> Jean-Luc Godard - Jean Baptiste Lully. Horrible. Pointless, boring, no plot, nothing. Filled with gratuitous female nudity. The worst! <br /> <br /> Julien Temple - Value. Buck Henry, Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris star in this funny, obvious, story about a fraudster. Pretty good. <br /> <br /> Bruce Beresford - Erich Korngold. Short, lazy and romantic. Very good. <br /> <br /> Robert Altman - Jean-Philippe Rameau. Dull. A Yawner. <br /> <br /> From Roddam - Richard Wagner. This has Bridget Fonda in her film debut. Beautifully done love story with a fairly explicit sex scene. <br /> <br /> Ken Russell - Giacomo Puccini. Really strange, but OK. <br /> <br /> Derek Jarman - Gustave Chapentier. Lyrical look at youth and age. Very sweet. <br /> <br /> The last is by Bill Bryden to do "I Pagliacci". He has John Hurt (!) Dressed as a clown lip-sincing to Caruso (!!!). <br /> <br /> When it came out, it almost got an X score (for the abundant nudity and the sex scene). It's a R given with a strict warning attached, saying the R rating will be heavily applied. After the film bombarded, the warning disappeared. <br /> <br /> The idea is not bad and 6 out of 10 segments were worth it. Except to see if you don't like opera. Just avoid the Godard segment. I give it a 8.
