Good to see I'm not the only person to remember this wonderful movie. I have very good memories of this movie - seems to me vaguely remember when I was about 8 and I watch the children's TV shows after school (Broom Cupboard somebody?). It was the first and last movie that scared me - and the images of the boy surrounded by the mist on a hill will stay with me forever! Like most movies of this era, it has a happy ending - aimed at children, but with a definite ability to catch an adult's attention. The beautiful Cornish scenery really sets the film apart - and the "ghostly" scenes are simple but very, very effective! I'd like to try to find this movie again - see if it is still at home!
