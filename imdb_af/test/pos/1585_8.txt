After the death of all senior officers, Commander Craig-Scott of the Laundry and Moral Corps finds himself in charge of an intergalactic spacecraft owned by Starcups Corporation. His main mission is to search for habitable planets and, of course, long-term coffee markets. <br /> <br /> Craig-Scott and his second in command, Chief Blather, are unprepared for commission except in view of keeping the staff's parts clean - which should not reduce the importance of clean parts not particularly when unauthorized commanders cause the same subjects to get dirty regularly. <br /> <br /> The episodes are presented as a series of short, 2-3 minute reports from the commander to Earth. The humor is a mixture of cruel deadpan and outrageous physical comedy. Think Yes Minister meets Red Dwarf, but on a shoe-string budget. All the common sci-fi plot devices are here - aliens, nuclear weapons, computer malfunctions - but each one is enhanced by the fresh-smelling odor of high-grade detergent. <br /> <br /> Commander's Log is definitely a low budget, but the somewhat cute effects and props fit the absurd view of the show. Remember the hilarious hockey helmets they wore on the old Battlestar Galactica? With the "Jofa" brand name still visible? Okay, there's a lot of it in Commander's Log, but it's cute. <br /> <br /> Commander's Log isn't great art, but it's not what it's trying to be. It's just a little off-kilter fun. It's a good job to be.
