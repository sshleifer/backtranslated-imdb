The people who don't like this movie seem to be an academic vendetta - those of us who don't like the original can enjoy it completely. <br /> <br /> My husband who had never seen the original said, "I don't want to see a girly movie." I assured him that "the women" are just a good movie, not a girl movie. He had a good time. He was delighted to enjoy it and enjoyed it more than the "boy" movie we saw the day before "burning after reading". <br /> <br /> SPOILER: I think even the new end is better. Maybe not so nice, but it was beautiful. Initially I couldn't understand why they made certain changes to the plot <br /> <br /> but when I got the end and gave birth to Debra Messing and brought the first man into the movie, I cried. It's one thing to love for men ?? they are our sons.
