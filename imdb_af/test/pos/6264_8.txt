A beautiful film about the arrival of early silent cinema to China. SHADOW MAGIC combines a love story with the drama of the cultural clash between China's ancient traditions and modern Western culture in the form of film. A wonderful first film by Chinese director Ann Hu. Having properly understood Mrs Hu's comments at the 2000 Sundance Festival, this film was produced as a US film co-financed by the Chinese government and shot in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of movies like IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO - not necessarily in the theme or plot, but it has a similar feel.
