For unknown reasons, this beautiful masterpiece has not been well-deserved and many American film critics are greatly appreciated. So it's easy to understand that I've had a lot of trouble finding this movie. Eventually I watched it and it was so beautiful, sincere and enjoyable that for the first time in my life I watched it once in a movie five times. The story is focused on the friendship between two young boys Erik and Dexter, eleven and twelve, who are very different, but they become the best (and only) friends. The beauty and sincerity of their friendship has been shown in the Cure as sincerely and naturally as it has never been before. There are so many beautiful, warm and gripping scenes (especially on the river) that hit the heart and leave no one indifferent to them. The movie is also full of incredible powerful and emotional symbolism (especially strong with Erik's shoe) which also significantly enhances the visual impression of such a beautiful work. The story, written by Robert Kuhn, is well-written and, unlike the vast majority of modern Hollywood products, virtually every scene, phrase and sentence in the movie is significant and brings something important to characters and relationships between them. Peter Horton, who, as I knew, had no great film experience, showed his great abilities and talents in this sphere. The cinematography is also excellent with perfectly chosen movie locations, but most importantly perfect, which with all of the above makes The Cure one of the best movies ever. Both Brad Renfro and Erik and Joseph Mazello as Dexter have created a wonderful atmosphere of genuine friendship and beautiful chemistry between two main characters. Just one of these movies (I haven't seen most of their other works) is enough to call them one of the best actors of their generation. Annabelle Sciorra also gives a tremendous performance as Dexter's mother. It is terribly sad that such talented actors have not received widespread recognition, while many overstated stars enjoy a lot of publicity and great salaries. Lastly, it would be unfair not to mention the wonderful soundtrack written by David Grusin and Mark Cohn's song (one of the best songs I've ever heard in the movies). My Great Escape. So all I can say about The Cure is a simple word ?? great. At any stage, this movie is a beautiful, sincere and inspirational work of all people involved in making this masterpiece. I have to give credit to all the people who put their hearts and souls in the movie and Universal Pictures, which found a way to make such a beautiful film under many formal commercial projects. But such a movie so rarely comes to movie theaters that many studios do not realize what jewelery they made that they cannot offer the respective marketing campaign. The only slight downside to The Cure for me is its short length (only 97 minutes). <br /> <br /> I don't want to write about the movie anymore, because it's simply impossible to put its beauty and sincerity into words. So if you have the opportunity to watch The Cure, rent it or buy it and you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Sorry for my bad English.
