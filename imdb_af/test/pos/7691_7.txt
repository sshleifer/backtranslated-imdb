For the first time I saw the opening of Otto Preminger's "Porgy and Bess" on TV, probably a few times in the early 80's, and my younger self found it a little slow, despite the timeless music. I switched it off <br /> <br /> Last night, a very rare, cobbled cobbled at the L.A. Cinematheque was watched and it was a bit of a revelation. The performances are strong and memorable. Dorothy Dandridge shares her vulnerability, strength and subtle (at least today's standards) with her eroticism. Sidney Poitier is uncomfortable with the movie, but his performance is fantastic, like Pearl Bailey. Better still is Sammy Davis as the amorous, cat-like Sportin 'Life and Brock Peters as the willing Bully Crown. <br /> <br /> Still, I'm not a fan of Preminger's earlier, led - and much easier to see - "Carmen Jones." Porgy and Bess "are much better than this less controversial movie - although it may be related to the fact that the source material is also much better. <br /> <br /> As seen last night, it's a solid but far-off Of perfect work, not all of the moments come alive, and there is an uneasiness in the way the movie mixes the openly styled Catfish Row set (beautifully by Oliver Smith) with real-life locations, even with me , rather untrained, some short parts of the score seem unnecessarily popular. <br /> <br /> While not detracting from the performance of the movie makers, Preminger's decision to film almost completely in shots, With no close-ups and sometimes medium shots, it has undoubtedly made the TV "stuck and scanned" and can even do it on widescreen DVDs if it earns the recovery it deserves. can make many details that are of cardinal importance important to the way Preminger played the movie. <br /> <br /> The mi x heard last night was strange. Many of the fever, especially at the opening of the "Summertime" was unnecessarily soft and was overwhelmed by instrumental music. Maybe it can be restored in a repair. <br /> <br /> There is the problem of the film's racial politics. Personally, I see nothing wrong with it, at least in a contemporary context. In the time when so few films depicted strong African-American characters, it might have been an unfortunate choice for a big-budget Hollywood movie. And although there aren't many "empowering" here, it's recognizable people who aren't racist stereotypes. These are operative characters that make poor choices because they are what tragic characters do. It has already made it a huge advance. <br /> <br /> In a modern context where strong and heroic black-American characters are less scarce (though not common enough), these characters look nothing more or less. as human. They can be truly poor and oppressed people of any ethnic background. <br /> <br /> Silly politics aside, the original work is undoubtedly one of the truly great achievements of American music and (secondary) theater. Poitier, Davis, Dandridge, Peters and yes, Pearl Bailey, were all amazing artists we will never see again from the containers. This less than perfect but still solid film deserves to be seen and appreciated.
