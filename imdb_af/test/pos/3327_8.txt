"Side Show" is one of the strangest Horror movies ever made by Full Moon Pictures. Many in some places, but not as shocking as the Trailer does. (The Trailer for this movie shows all the evil parts). Also the acting and visual effects are well done. I will attack this movie on all horror fans. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 <br /> <br /> Fans of Horror Movies like this should check out Puppet Master, Skinned Alive, Slumber Party Massacre, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
