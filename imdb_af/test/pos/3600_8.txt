"Capt. Corelli's Mandolin" is an old-fashioned Hollywood war romance but with sex and nudity, and probably no Americans. The story takes place during World War II on a Greek island. The Italians come to take over the island, but with German oversight. There is a romantic triangle made up of a Greek couple and the Italian captain. Fun performances by all the actors; Penelope Cruz's best work yet.
