Bluff I really think this movie is very good. <br /> <br /> Basically another kind of Colombian movie. Are hilarious and the actors use local expressions that are so much money to listen to. <br /> <br /> It shows a different face o Bogot√° and I think it is very important because Colombia is a diverse country and we have to show it to the world This is the first film by director Felipe Martinez and I is really except this movie is the start of a good career as a film director. <br /> <br /> We must continue to support the Colombian filming industry because it is film and other great films starting from something big.
