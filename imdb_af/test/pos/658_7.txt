** SPOILERS ** Beautifully photographed cut of the life of the world's WWII love story with Norman Rockwell paintings at the beginning and end of the film about how a "war hero" is not just a killer for his country but also someone is thinking for himself and is not damaged by the war propaganda that is constantly in his head. Washing out of the Marine Corps Marion "Hedg" Hedgepeth, Jan Michael-Vincent, is kicked out of the boat camp after five weeks and forced to wear a Baby Blue Marine uniform showing that he did not need to make the corps . Destroy and despise wherever he went when he went home to St Louis and feared what his family, who was his father in the Marine Corps in WWI, would think of him by not cutting the Mustard as a American Navy. <br /> <br /> Attaching a bar to a bar next to it, is a marine member of the fearless and deadly Marine Raiders Richard Gere, who buys an admiring Hedge beer. To make a conversation with Richard Hedge is shocked to find that he is not only sent back to the Pacific Theater after all the fighting he fought and medals fought, but the completely gray hair and remedy thirty look Richard will be 21 next month! This is what has been done to him in the Marine Corps and World War II! Buy Hedge a number of drinks Richard takes out the drunk Baby Blue and knocks him out with his Baby Blues and leaves his impressive US Marine uniform with a little money in it for Hedge to true. <br /> <br /> Once Hedge fits Richard's uniform, it fits perfectly with him. He is confronted by this huge drunk American paratrooper, who calls him Cement-Head who wants a fist fight with the Marine Raider. Attach everything he can do to avoid the trouble, is forced by Cement-Head to call him after he himself crashed two beer bottles over his cement head to warm himself up for the big bolt between Marine, Heg and Paratrooper, Cement head. Attach amazing floors to the huge cement-head buffoon that beats him cold with a punch! "I suspect the trick does not hit him on top of his head" a stunned Hedge tells his Cement-Heads, fellow G.I's. <br /> <br /> Hitch walks to this small town of Bidwell Hedge notices this American military internment camp for Japanese Americans there because they are a threat to US security. It is later in the film that Hedge shows everyone what a true hero is, and not what the people in town think he is, by risking his life to save one of the hated "Japs", what without problems with two of his friends escaped from the interment camp, where the hell did they think they were going anyway? Hedge made his life dangerous by killing Japanese Americans who drowned in the dangerous rapids outside the town. Hedging in his actions taught the people of Bidwell that not all "Japs", even those who are American citizens, are bad and treacherous, thinking through the newspapers magazines and movies to think they were. <br /> <br /> Hedge has a conversation with the very nice and beautiful waitress at the local dinner. Rose Hudkins, Glynnis O'Connor, who's just mad about him even entrenched in the first think it's his uniform, he didn't impress her. Later when Hedge admits that Rose does not know what she and her parents think, an American Marine Raider, that he is Rose, he got the sweet and well-groomed little boy so well that it didn't matter to her. All he was supposed to be, a Marine potato or a post office worker, was what was really in his heart. <br /> <br /> The movie has a number of touches and beautiful scenes in it between Hedge and Rose showing how films were made years ago without all the sex and curse we saw and heard in movies today. with two people who fell in love with each other. <br /> <br /> The way the movie is accurate. , not bad, shows the true feelings of average Americans, then in 1943, about the war in general and especially Japanese could not be done in more authentic and accurate as well as good taste. "Baby Blur Marine" is best not to be politically correct not to show the hero's or premier actors and actresses in the movie having the same feelings and ideas as during World War II as most people now have, as a three dollar bill, to those watching the movie that lived during the historic and exciting times when the film took place.
