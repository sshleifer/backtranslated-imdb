It's a nice silly movie, which can be the least erotic ever to make it on the big screen (the heroine throws V-8 all over herself and invites the hero to lick it - yuck!). And yet it also features the glamorous Lucinda Dickey who is by far her most erotic achievement. In those years, women - even action heroes - had a rarity with real muscles, and I still remember my jaw dropping when Dickey pulled out her shirt and revealed the strongest female back and biceps. ever seen. Dickey's beauty and vitality carry the movie: she could have been a female Schwarzenegger if someone had the vision to promote her.
