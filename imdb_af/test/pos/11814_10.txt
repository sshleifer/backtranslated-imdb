When the movie "The Cure" starts, we find a young man named Erik (Brad Renfro). Erik is a teenager who lives with his paranoid mother and lives with him, is a young boy named Dexter (Joseph Mazello). One day Erik and Dexter join and go to the supermarket, where Dexter gets his first taste of Butterfinger. When Erik finds out that Dexter has AIDS, he tries to make tea and water tea better. But when the cover of the National Enquirer says a New Orleans doctor has found the drug for AIDS, the two boys will stop at nothing to come to New Orleans for healing. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, The Cure "is easily one of the best friendships ever made. It shows unconditional love between a boy, his (new) best friend and his best friend's mother. is done so well, nothing needs to be changed, not only do I give it a 10/10 because it is a fantastic friendship movie, but it is also a sad but humorous and fun AIDS movie, and the tragic The final with Dexter's contraction of AIDS is enough to make me tear, much done.
