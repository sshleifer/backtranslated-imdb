I think this movie should be one of the most moving and heartbreaking movies of the past. <br /> <br /> The movie basically starts with a suicide in a school toilet. You don't see who it is, then it goes to the beginning of the day, and we get to know 6 characters, and they go through some pretty heavy stuff, but eventually one of them will commit suicide. /> <br /> I've been teaching Physical Education in schools for 8 years, and never in a movie have I seen such an accurate portrayal of what really happens in school life. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully shot and sounds amazing. <br /> <br /> The end is so shocking, and so what one wouldn't expect, that's something that will haunt me for the coming days. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one to watch. <br /> <br /> I think the fact that the Director / Writer was just a few years ago was a major contributor to the raw honesty expressed. in the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is shot in two separate 'fashions' as you like. First, there is the smooth perception style where we get to know the characters in their school environment while going through their drama, but the beautiful part of the movie is in the maintenance departments, where we get to know the characters and their deepest darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> You still wonder who will be (who commits suicide) and as the drama unfolds, keep your mind shut, it will face you in the last five minutes. I'm generally in my writing, but I've just seen it at a media performance in Australia, and I'm still in a little shock. <br /> <br /> This is one of the best Australian movies I've seen in the past year.
