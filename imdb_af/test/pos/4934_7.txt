It's a great movie! It's fun for everyone, even adults. We have Jason Voorhees / Leatherface as a killer in it, along with other wacky characters. Very funny movie, for kids of all ages. Have rented it every time we go to the video store! Buster and Babs make a good pair and love the duck. He's probably my favorite character! I was never big on the TV show, but this movie brings back just as many good memories. Must see for families, fans of the show or anyone! Enjoyable, no matter how small or old you are! RENT NOW IN YOUR LOCAL VIDEO SHOP! <br /> <br /> P.S. Needs a DVD release!
