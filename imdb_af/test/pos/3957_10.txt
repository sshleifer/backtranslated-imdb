"Blind Spot" one of my festival favorites. I was totally intrigued by the idea of ​​three strangers looking for a mysterious man who loved and betrayed each one in different ways. The throw is great. James Franco is exceptional as the broken heart of Los Angeles. His journal entries, which we hear in voice-over-narration, work well with the footage and are very intense. The movie has a powerful style. It pushes elements like the road movie and revenge drama in new directions. It also plays with time and perspective in ways in which the frightening atmosphere of lost love is captured. There is a dream quality on several rows and the images are saturated with a terrible sense of tension. Strange. Stressful. Nice to look at. Definitely worth seeing. I really wanted to see it again. Periodically I see if Blind Spot is spread. I can't wait to see the movie in the movie or on DVD again. <br /> <br /> Davide Pepe 13/08/2005 Bologna - Italy
