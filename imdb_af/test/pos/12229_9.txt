A soft film that represents how our daily life is a catalyst that causes us to change our minds, behaviors and emotions into people we are not. This story is a love story where true emotions arise. I earn Malcolm Jamal Warner (Win) and Challen Cates for outstanding achievements. A movie that is definitely worth watching, a holiday road trip that is emotionally turned around. I suggest seeing it.
