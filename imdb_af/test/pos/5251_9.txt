While reading some of the other comments, I have to agree that some (very few) shortcomings in this brilliant documentary document on one of the 20th century divas (along with Billie Holliday, Bessie Smith, Edith Piaf, Judy Garland and Mercedes de Sosa) is justified. For initially it was a 6-hour plus-TV documentary on her career ("ESTRANHA FORMA DE VIDA" (F) 1995/1999). Much more comprehensive and with greater insight into Amalia's inner world. Regarding the subtitles of her songs, I'm all there! Although the music, the voice and the performance may be - is! - Universal, there is so much poetry in the words that are only translated. I think it was a conscious choice by the producers. They were aimed at the 200 million Portuguese speakers in Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, France, East Timor, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Canada, the USA, South Africa, St. Tome and Principle, Goa, Daman, Diu, Venezuela, Luxembourg, Germany and the rest of the Portuguese-speaking diaspora worldwide. Regarding the woman herself, she did not see this particular shortened DVD version of the documentary version, but she provided a preview of Estranha Forma de Vida. And it seems to her willingness. So much.
