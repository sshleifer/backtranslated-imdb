I love this movie! I know some people may say that this was not a good movie, but I disagree completely. The comedy is classic Mel Brooks style and the actors are excellently chosen. It was my first exposure to Cary Elwes, and Dave Chappelle, and a first impression they made. Cary Elwes shines as Robin Hood, the only British Robin Hood thinks you are. He has great comic timing and the right attitude for this type of movie. Dave Chappelle is of course much bigger, but then it was his first movie and he did an excellent job as Achoo. The characters were all very well planned and everyone added their own little features to the movie. I recommend renting this movie and enjoying it with a nice bowl of popcorn and some good friends!
