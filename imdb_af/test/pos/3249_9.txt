Two hands have restored my faith in Aussie films. It took an old approach and made it fresh. I didn't enjoy this movie at any end. I recommend it to the people who love Guy Ritchie movies. Bryan Brown was fantastic and just perfect in a role created for him. Ledger was adecutely stupid and his performance anchored me a very satisfying movie.
