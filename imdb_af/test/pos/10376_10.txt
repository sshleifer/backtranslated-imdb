I was surprised that I liked this movie. But it reminded me of a 2004 version of the first Friday the 13th. There were a number of casey elements, but at the same time there were many cools. The story line was good - predictable if you saw more than one or two horror movies, but full of one-liners to make it worthwhile. There are some unforgettable scenes worth watching. A few problems I had with the plot were related to the continuity of the characters. For example, in the opening scene, the scarecrows (people at risk, whose blood was drained to grow the crops) looked very much, but later in the film they looked more like fake scarecrows wearing blue-colored masks. There were more than a few gaps in the plot, and the acting was mediocre, but it seemed as if real people were talking, as opposed to Hollywood movies, where the dialogue sounds really fake when you think about it. The highlight of the last scene, when the main character says, "I'm not a Baker, I'm a Connell!" and lops the head of the scarecrow is satisfying, because his friends were mostly killed by these creatures at that time.
