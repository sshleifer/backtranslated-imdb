Just watching the movie, it's actually pretty good. The trailers gave me an impression of either another Dujardin one-man movie (Ã  la _Brice de Nice_) or an expensive, silly French comedy. Surprisingly, it is not. Secret agent OSS 117 is stupid, but at least he knows it while I always found that James Bond was stupid, but acted like a smart ass. Dialogue is witty with a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor that one can expect from a British rather than a French movie. The women and the music are beautiful. A refreshing trip to the past, when the bad guys were former Nazis or Soviet brutes, were motorcycles, and France had colonies!
