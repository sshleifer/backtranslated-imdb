Christopher Nolan's first film is a black and white film without a budget for an unemployed writer who begins with strangers, which in turn causes rape and also violence. It's very good. <br /> <br /> As in his later film 'Memento', he does not present the story in a linear way. Instead, it jumps around a bit so you end up sucking it all together and tasting it, apparently random, shots taking meaning as the movie progresses. This style also means that the dots are much more effective. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance (especially if you like his later work and / or Film Noir)
