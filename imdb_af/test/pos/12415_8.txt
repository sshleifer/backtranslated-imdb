Two college friends - one unceasing nerd, the other a rude slab - start with a road trip across the country. Along the way they meet a vicious vehicle that looks like a lower tank combined with a monster truck, trying to run their car. They escape it, but surprise only the mysterious and dangerous driver more than one of them takes a leak in the top hatch while stopping at a standstill. Later they get a sexy hitchhiker who eventually gets involved in their life-threatening situation. MONSTER MAN is a very entertaining horror comedy that has a few good exciting moments as well as some good guys. The two main characters and their ongoing balls are fun to watch everything on their own and the end takes a very good TCM turn. Definitely worth checking out.
