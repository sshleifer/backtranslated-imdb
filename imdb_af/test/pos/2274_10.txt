In everything is relieved, Elijah Wood plays Jonathan Foer, a Jewish American looking for the woman who saved his grandfather during World War II. In a sense, the woman who saved his whole family. <br /> <br /> It's a sad story about someone who is on a seemingly hopeless journey. A stranger in a foreign country so to speak. Jonathan is not fully prepared for this adventure, he sticks out like a sore thumb in Ukraine (he'll probably stick out like a sore thumb everywhere). But what he discovered is more, much more than he expected. This movie will make you laugh and make you cry. Elijah Wood is really good at this movie, based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer. <br /> <br /> This movie is slightly different from the one I spoke to. A book I meet is really good. Yet it is a good movie, it has something for everyone and I really enjoyed it. Can anyone say Oscar?
