Saboteur is a 1942 film, partly aimed at getting US support for the war against Nazi Germany. Propaganda or not, it's great entertainment. The leading actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck in the roles, which would have the film more structured. Anyway, it's a good movie with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane bringing their own style to the characters. As in other Hitchcock movies, we see the director's negligence for the social suave and the benevolent. He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as a nice high school people who were convicted at the same time of democratic values ​​and concepts until found guilty. These top crushers are the last thing the police pursue or even suspect. Hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police. He wanted to raise the ordinary man, the bungler and the fellow who did not take himself seriously. One can see him as Gary Cooper as an icon in the Frank Capra form. Nevertheless, Bob Cummings puts his own seal on the boy-side door and works well in the role. Priscilla Lane, like the female female head, comes down as the all-American girl who can handle her very well when tested. Robert Cummings, as defense plant worker Barry Kane, is designed for a bombing that kills his best friend. This leads to a nationwide racing scene reminiscent of other Hitchcock heroes. Hitchcock repeats some of the established formulas from previous films - the reluctant woman being drawn into the action, eg. Madeleine Carroll in the 39 Steps, and risking his life to evade the authorities on his heels. We see scenes from America as Kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he is accused of. We see rivers, bridges, baking huts, truck drivers, the Hoover Dam and finally, New York City. New York is an appropriate backdrop for the climax as we go from Rockefeller Center to the ocean liners (with a cut in Normandy) and the grand finale on the Statue of Liberty. Big movie with uninterrupted action. Don't miss it.
