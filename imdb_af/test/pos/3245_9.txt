A gritty Australian movie, with all the elements for success. Two Hands represent the ability of Australian filmmakers and players to produce top quality, popular material. The film has a new angle and features drama, tension and comedy. <br /> <br /> I found this movie enjoyable at so many different levels - but can also appreciate that it may not be everyone's cup of tea. . The film carries a clear Aussie humor, depicting the tough underworld of Sydney, exploring the lives of a young man (Ledger) and young woman (Byrne), who are pounded into the local crime scene. <br /> <br /> Two hands deal with the theme of good and evil, both at the interpersonal and personal level, and look at the issue of the consequences for "our" actions. <br /> <br /> The camera work is snazzy and the dialogue humorous. With Bryan Brown playing Pando and Heath Ledger as Jimmy and arguing in the most bizarre situations on the screen, this Aussie movie is definitely not short of acting talent. <br /> <br /> This subtle action / comedy has become somewhat of a cult favorite, and also one of me.
