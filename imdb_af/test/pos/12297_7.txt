Sometimes I really wonder? If I look at the comment, most people seem to have seen a completely different movie than I have. I just saw it ... and liked it. Not in the way that it made me happy, but in the way I saw a good movie! <br /> <br /> The movie needs patience, yes. And yes, the main character is VERY annoying, but it certainly is going. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it makes a difference if you watch this movie in a theater or at home. Most people watch movies at home as they listen to elevator music. This movie is definitely not as background noise. <br /> <br /> No. Good guidelines don't mean you have five laughs or explosions a second. Good direction means following your topic and keeping the story and actors together. And while it doesn't work out perfectly, at least I think it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> I liked the photography and the sets, even if they burnt on the surrealists. The opening scene is really special. <br /> <br /> I also watched the scene? Guillaume Depardieu does not play Pierre. He plays the role of a Pierre who plays a role himself! Pierre is not the romantic hero he tries so hard to be, he is an exaggerated and self-righteous idiot, a straight-down weakness that damages all the people he claims. The fact that even his love for the truth is merely an attitude has been beautifully demonstrated by his current lie and not even once to ask questions or explain himself. People wonder where this or that person comes from and other things: No character seen for more than two scenes is left inexplicable. There is enough information about everyone spread. <br /> <br /> And even the strange building starts making sense as soon as the target practice is seen: Remember that Isabelle fled from a war zone - and that is of course a refuge for fighters in a civil war, probably Bosnia (what was still in progress when the film was made). Isabelle tells at least that Pierre meets him for the first time and at the later stage where Pierre Isabelle shows the book with his father on the cover, which is surrounded by books about Bosnia.
