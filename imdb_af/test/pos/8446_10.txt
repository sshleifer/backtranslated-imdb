If the reactor failure had occurred and radioactive waste leaked, it could burn directly to China through the earth. Many people enjoyed it and if the filmmakers were serious about it, then yes, it should be fun. The spill will not make it near the center of the earth or even the molten rock. Even if it made it in the middle of the Earth, how would it come out in China? This will have to drive the rest of the way against gravity! Also China is not the opposite of the world, the Indian Ocean is. <<<<< ......... ......... ........... ............. ... ............. ..................... ................ .. .............. ............ ...... .......... <br /> <br /> This point is raised by the characters of the film, and it says of course that this cannot happen, since the core will hit groundwater and a radio-releasing cloud that rains on the population. <br /> <br /> Before you try to find a weak spot in the movie, first see it! Don't judge a book about its title ...
