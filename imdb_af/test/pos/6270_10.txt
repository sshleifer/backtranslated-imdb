The Ator series is a shining example of what B-movies should be. They fail in every way, but in such a hilarious way that they are funny rather than sad. "Ator l'invincibile 2" aka "The Blade Master" aka "Cave Dwellers" shows us Europe's favorite Conan clone, Ator, where we left him in the first movie - after a long overview of all the events of had the first movie. This time, the world must be saved from "The Nucleus", a kind of bomb, which appears on the screen as a bright light (I think they couldn't afford a prop). This one has invisible attackers and samurai. As with the first movie, a lot of inventory is used (including an obvious bit of "Star Wars"). Thoroughly laugh and unforgettably bad - this is an exception B-movie.
