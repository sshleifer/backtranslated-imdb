Sadness and nostalgia penetrate Late Chrysanthemums, a 1954 film by Japanese author Mikio Naruse, which undergoes retrospective of its long-available films, thanks to James Quandt of Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation. Based on three stories by Fumiko Hayashi, the Late Chrysanthemums tell the story of four retired geysers, now the middle-aged, whose lives were full of disappointment and regret. Performance is uniformly outstanding, especially that of Haruko Sugimura, which has been featured in Ozu's Late Spring, Floating Weeds, and Tokyo Story. Sugimura portrays Kin, a former Geisha who has no children and lives with her young girl who can't speak. <br /> <br /> She became cynical about men and paid her attention to money, especially property speculation and lending money to her friends, Nobu (Sadako Sawamura), Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa), and Tomi (Yuko Mochizuki), though the former geishas. Kin's friends live in difficult conditions and complain about how Kin has become greedy and Tomi spends a lot of time trying to end. Both Tomi and Tamae are losing their children. Tamae's son left to work in the coal mines in Hokkaido, and Tomi's daughter decided to accept an older man's marriage proposal. Both resist the change in their circumstances, but come to accept it as inevitable. <br /> <br /> Two male friends visit Kin, Seki, a former lover with whom she once committed suicide, and Tabe (Ken Uehara), another lover who sees her again after many years . Her mood is optimistic, but soon becomes furious when she discovers that the two men are only interested in borrowing money. Nasty cuts between two elaborate empires seamless as Kin confront Tabe and Tomi and Tamae consoles about the loss of their children. The dialogue is extremely natural and the characters are women of strength who, although their future does not look bright, refuse to see themselves as mere victims. Let Chrysanthemums have the simplicity, humor and stoic acceptance of life that is prominent in the films of Ozu and is a bittersweet reminder of the slow passage of time and the comfort that memory and companionship can bring.
