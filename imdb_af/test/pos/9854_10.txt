This documentary is not just one of the best documentaries I have ever seen, but also one of the most moving and silent movies I've seen. It follows the lives of two Sudanese young men, Peter and Santino, as they try to make their way into American culture. Peter and Santino are first friends, but they are gradually becoming more and more different, as Peter goes to Kansas City, and Santino lives in Houston (a country called Houston). Santino's beauty is in his eyes. He takes people on his back, he supports an apartment full of other Sudanese, pays the rent, does everything for others. He is a silent sufferer. Peter looks out for himself, gets a high school education while playing basketball and making Christian friends. It seems to me. Megan Mylan, director, did not know what she had entered into with the beauty of this story. Peter and Santino are wonderful characters who move you. But the real strength in this movie lies in his commentary on American society. It doesn't judge. It shows the strengths and weaknesses of our world, and how difficult it can be for outside people. I suggest you find this movie, and look at America through the lives of these two fascinating and beautiful people. <br /> <br /> My grade: 10/10
