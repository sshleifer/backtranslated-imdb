Ahhh ... the '80s. 1982 reminds me of the crazy time we had in America. Fresh from the "Do What Feels Good" 70s, "The Last American Virgin" comes like a wolf in sheep's clothing as another teen sex comedy from the glory days. Oh, sure, there is sex, but I can't think of another movie - OK, this and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" - which didn't really kill the time between topless teenage screens - there were some good things here under the fission. <br /> <br /> The movie follows three hormonal friends. Gary (who wants to lose his virginity), Rick (stud enataren) and David (overweight, but not inexperienced), because they are desperately trying to make sure Gary joins the world of masculinity. But a funny thing happens on the way to the kegger - Gary falls to Karen (pretty brunette who loves the bad boys) and can't seem to be through any sexual conquest that David and Rick can facilitate. Only trouble is, Rick and Karen get hot and heavy and Karen beats a time. It's Gary who's with her while she's going to get her abortion, and that's Gary who really cares. But, who is Karen doing the end of the movie? Rick. Subtract the "R" and add a "D" as needed. <br /> <br /> What separates this movie from the 80's that we think is that they, by God, are trying a real drama here and not of "my parents just drew in the rampage variety." And, you know what? I bought it. <br /> <br /> It wasn't messy. It wasn't far-fetched. And when Gary Rick sees Karen dancing at the home party at the end of the movie, I really felt sorry for the man. Our teenager Romeo actually believed in uninvolved love - and when his heart was finally broken, it touched me so. <br /> <br /> So, all the T & A aside, there's a really pretty credible story here. Worthy of Oscar? Not a mile, but I don't know I'm getting it in the 'let's get' Like 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', they actually tried to do a real movie here, so the hi-jinx between falls true it may.
