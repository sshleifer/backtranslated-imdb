I just finished a dual feature night from an American Werewolf in London and Paris. Let's start by saying, "London" is still going on over the years and the transformation series is pretty impressive at any standard, the movie was funny and awful, also a bit gore .... Now we can go to Paris come. It is nice, a few scars, very gore, not as exciting or ominous as it used to be, but it does have a few laughs in what has become fashionable today, perhaps in the time being, the transformations are a CGI while good for the technology of his time, is nowhere as impressive as the original. I gave this movie a 7 because I have to admit it was nice, I laughed a lot and found Tom Everett Scott to be so stupid that I first wanted to disapprove of it just to enjoy it. .John Delpy was skilled as the direction it is, the script that lacks some glamor and finesse. I read here that John Landis was supposed to go bad. He didn't make sure it was completely different. I also noticed a discussion of a follow-up "What If" Well, no one noticed the Obvious, it should be in America and here's my title "An American Werewolf Comes Home" or in DC which will be fun, though the political dogs are terrified. You just have to see the original in the new DVD transmission with dolby 5.1 audio and both watch this on an HDTV with upconvert turned on ... beautiful !!
