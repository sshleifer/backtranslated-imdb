He is not your conventional driver. <br /> <br /> These guys have problems. With his wife, with his son, a priest, all his prizes, his ex-partner and most of all himself. And the biggest thing is that they throw us all. So we have to look to find out more about his past. <br /> <br /> The idea may not be original, but David Morse does. I think it's a good performance, and I hope people catch up before the season ends. <br /> <br /> WATCH THIS SHOW !!!!!!!!!
