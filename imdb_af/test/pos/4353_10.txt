The questions and answers of the human spirit are all here in this masterfully crafted historical documentary. The shaving beauty and horror of one man walking through life, is revealed in totality. Dieter and Herzog are combined and linked by a spiritual maze transformed into a single straight passage where the walls are plastered with images created by one-man characterization of himself by the vibrations of his own vocal chords. This movie, for about 80 minutes, has discovered a new dimension of storytelling. What do I call this seemingly new sentence? Only God knows, it is not a MIRACLE that God does for us, but prefers to remain ANONYMOUS? <br /> <br /> It's a requirement to see. If you want to experience the beautiful horror of war, this documentary will clear your soul to the marrow.
