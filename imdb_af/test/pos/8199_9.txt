I will recognize my ignorance of the movie's existence until I advertised it on a cable connection. I was very impressed with the novel structure of the film. The film, which is in a language I don't understand, shone for me with intelligence and nuance. I think that speaks the quality of the movie. This was astonishing visually. The acting was visually invasive. The Chinese scene of movement traditions, used to enhance the delivery of dialogue, is so compelling to look at Western film, where actors traditionally focus more on dialogue. The action in this movie comes right with you, without much explosion to get your attention. It is human action that is so affective. The added benefit of filming my history to one of the world's greatest tourist attractions, the funeral education of China's first Qin Emporer, was very impressive. The film seems to be of international relevance beyond the film's major ethical themes. This is a movie that I can recommend to a wide variety of friends and acquaintances comfortably.
