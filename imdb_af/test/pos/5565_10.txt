I must tell you that I was a Star Trek TNG fan since I was a kid. <br /> <br /> Well, I gave a friend of mine some DS9 episodes and I asked him <br /> <br /> "Hey man, what are you watching lately, because I'm ready to watch all the TNG episodes, "he said. "Well, I have these episodes of Farscape". I said, "Okay, let me try." I was pretty sure at that time that I didn't like it because I was just finised watching TNG and found it well. "<br /> <br /> I had 3 episodes, watched it was my imagination, I initially impressed childishly and I thought it was just another TV show, nice adventures, but often. Music was" a little different, neat special effects and I had the vague impression that the actors did not quite get into the hype. <br /> <br /> I watched 3 more episodes and thought 3 eps was not enough to decide if I was from then on. Then the show got me started, I have a good understanding of the action and wanted to see what happened next to the poor Crichton .... the rest is history. <br /> < br /> I think I mostly like the freedom of the characters in the context of the action, unlike Star Trek where everyone slept when they were supposed to do and too much hi-tech bullshit. <br /> <br /> The show is better with every episode, very interesting sory line ..... what can I say, this movie is like poetry. <br /> <br /> I recommend this star k on !!!
