Night of The Demons is definitely one of the demons' final cheesy 80's demons, horror flick in the same action as the brilliant Evil Dead and Demons movies. This movie combines boozy sexually active teenagers and demons into one hell of a fun movie. A special addition after the 80's was overshadowed by bracts, it was nice to see something else. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a group of teenagers who all arrive for a Halloween party at a romp house that was a funeral room hosted by Angela. About 40 minutes of spit and sex eventually lead to a demon or demons coming out of the oven and possessing each of the teenagers. Add some snazzy makeup effects, lots of gore, and cool demons and you'll find yourself a sweet 80's cheese party that will be ranked as one of the best demon-related movies in many horror fans' lists. br /> <br /> First, I loved the setting for this movie, "Hull House" is very creepy and scary and the perfect setting for a horror movie and plus when the demons come forward, that's when the action really kick and it becomes a night of terror and fear. This movie has created 2 successors, the first one in 1994, which was good, but nothing has happened to it. The third one titled Demon House was absolutely horrible. This is one of the horrors that has definitely been the test of time and remains a true gem of mine for many years to come. <br /> <br /> All in all, a fun cute movie with Demons that is definitely worth checking out.
