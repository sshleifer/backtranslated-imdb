Stephane Audran is the eternal heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small Danish community by the end of the last century. Two beautiful and musically talented sisters give up their own prospects of happiness and marriage to look at their aging father. One day, a French woman, Babette, came to work for them. After a few years she won the lottery and was determined to do something for the sisters who packed her. Her solution is to prepare a beautiful and abundant festival that changes the lives of all who are invited. It is a film about human and cultural interaction, reflected in the changing language of the Danish-French dialogue, and especially between the conscientious austerity of Protestant Northern Europe and the sensuousness of the Catholic south. It is also about human needs, and how warmth and friendliness can be expressed and stimulated by the cultivation of the senses. A deep uplifting movie.
