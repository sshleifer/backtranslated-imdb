While I was agreeing, it was a 1950's sitcom, I didn't feel it was "typical". First, Donna Reed was a strong woman, unlike regular 50's sitcom moms. She took a stand for the value and equality of women (remember the episode where the TV announcer says "just a housewife") and Donna stands up for all women who do and represent it, especially those who don't home does not work? And when the women rebelled against something in the series, it was not something trivial ... it was always something to show that women have the right to be treated with the same respect as men. Remember, Donna Reed was married to the show's producer, so she had much more input to make her a more powerful character. <br /> <br /> The kids were intelligent but not preschoolers. They were ordinary children. And this can happen. <br /> <br /> Something else that Donna Reed Show did not only look like the kids like their parents, but you can feel the chemistry between all the actors in the real life situation. Then the characters came out. Shelly Fabares and Paul Peterson regularly wrote and commented that they were treated like the children of Donna Reed and Carl Betz, and that adults were completely protective of the pediatric actors and treated them accordingly. Donna and Alex also had some sexual chemistry that was not seen on other family programs. And the characters can be faulty, and in great ways, and yet, accept for the mistakes and mistakes. These were not super parents who did not do wrong and had no emotional height and low. They were normal people acting as normal people. <br /> <br /> Women's Rights, Drug Abuse, Child Abuse, Single Fathers, Poverty, Children Who Need Good Health Care But It Can't Afford ... It's All Shown. on this show. Beautiful pioneers for the era. <br /> <br /> Donna Reed's show didn't last eight years for eight years. And it could have endured if it wasn't for Tony Owens and Donna Reed. <br /> <br /> This show is highly understated and must be shown so that other generations can appreciate. <br /> <br /> In short, I agree with the original poster, which obviously cares for the show, but I think the Donna Reed show has entertained so much more than comfortable.
