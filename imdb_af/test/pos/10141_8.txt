Certainly, this film has the truth ring about it, as it claims it is based on actual events on a marine basis. It deals with the attempt by the local marine commander of unacceptable action by a marine chief who has been shot dead by his former girlfriend, a marine captain. The husband and wife were lovers, but the captain tried to break out the relationship when she discovered her son's friend, was married. He still bumped her, as far as firing his side arm in one direction in her direction. Eventually he broke into her home, attacked her with a knife and shot and killed twice with her service pistol. The civil prosecutor decided the self-defense, but the Marines decided to kill the captain. The chief, you see, was a decorated hero from Vietnam, and an old friend of the Marine base commander. The captain also made some enemies in her motor vehicle mission and rejected some male advances in a lot of slaughterhouses. <br /> <br /> There is considerable psychological load that motivates and controls the actions of the main participants in this play. , which gets the very capable throw over pretty. However, the director and editor seem determined to hide the events as much as possible with frustrating flashbacks and shifting views. You are happy if you know where you are most of the time. Carry with them; It is a valuable story when the captain's court murder trial unfolds, and every man's hand sometimes seems to be her lawyer. <br /> <br /> The verdict? Well, it's rather a tension story, so you have to see for yourself. There is a kind of "pacifist" message folded in the movie but forget about it. Sure, "war is hell", but sometimes it can't be avoided. We will need those Marines, even if they aren't always the best champions of honest play internally. As Kipling says in his poem "Tommy Atkins": <br /> <br /> "It's Tommy this and Tommy, and Tommy is waiting outside. But that's the place for Mr Atkins when the troop is on the tide. "
