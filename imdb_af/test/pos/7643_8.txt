TUGH LUCK follows a homeless drifter when caught in the underground crime scene of deception and chaos. Archie (Norman Reedus) has been released from prison and has nothing to lose. He is almost murdered before the owner of a carnival called Ike (Armand Assante) hires him for work. Soon Ike reveals a strong desire that Archie kill his naughty wife, Divana (Dagmara Dominczyk), an erotic dancer for the carnival. Things get complicated soon when Archie falls in love with Divana and warns her about the scheme. They become involved in a very steamy relationship that leaves little to the viewer's imagination, after which they soon make a plan. Together they plan to kill Ike, but things aren't quite as planned. <br /> <br /> I would lie if I said this movie didn't surprise me. I was personally blown away by how good this movie was. When renting it a few years back, I expected another clich√© thriller with lots of typical elements and themes that are featured in many movies of the kind these days. Within minutes I was addicted and I became very involved in the world of this movie. It's the kind of movie, like BUFFALO '66, that just sucks you and transports you in the style and sense of paranoia. It's a movie that really makes it look beautiful. One thing I particularly appreciated was how the film portrayed its characters. The film is not as easy and clear cut as it appears in the plot summary. These are characters that you actually grow, care for and fascinate, including the characters that are supposed to be the bad guys. In fact, there are no good guys or bad guys in this movie. All the characters are flawed in ways that are realistic and incredibly true-to-life. There aren't many movies that can do this job as decently as this movie, but it's definitely a movie style I want and I want to see more movies today. There were quite a few crime films that were so early in the early 50's, but there has never been one so tempting and unique as that! <br /> <br /> In terms of errors, I usually have very few handles. The film itself is not exactly original. However, I doubt most people expect it to be original. The movie's editing style can also be annoying to some, as it tends to have a camcorder-type shaky camera throughout. While I didn't get through it and actually felt it was adding to the atmosphere, I'm sure most viewers won't be so enthusiastic about it and can generally withdraw. However, despite the slight flaws, it is one of the most underestimated films of the 2000s. It is so refreshing to be happy and to watch an unfamiliar movie that seems to be good. This movie seems to be a direct-to-video release, though this movie is much better than that. If it were placed in theaters, it would have won no awards, or it would have been seen much, but it would have much more recognition than it has today. Recognition that this movie deserves. TOUGH LUCK is an astounding, entertaining, and twisted neo-noir thriller with a true sense of class and style together with enough fabric to make the average movie lover more than happy.
