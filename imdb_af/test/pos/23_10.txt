Anyone who appreciates a good acting and listening dialogue will love this movie <br /> <br />. Taken from Ronald 'Take Side' Harwood, it's a funny <br /> <br /> and ultimately lavish analysis of a relationship between two very active types <br /> <br />. Albert Finney is sublime as the despotic <br /> <br /> Shakespeare actor who barely sees the world war <br /> <br /> around him, so he is at the crumbling fortune of his theater. <br /> <br /> The company and its own psychological and emotional collapse. <br /> <br /> Tom Courtenay is indifferent to Norman's "Dresser" of the title, <br /> <br /> whose apparent commitment seems to be anything but unselfish. <br /> <br /> Actually a must see.
