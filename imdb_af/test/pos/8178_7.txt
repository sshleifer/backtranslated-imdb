The pace of the film is sensibly slow in parts, but if you fit into its quiet speed and long silence, it's a satisfying piece of courtesy plot. The story of the first emperor of China, his childhood and the personal cost of power. The film is very atmospheric, the extremely temperate and polite courtesy and ritual as opposed to sudden brutal violence. Filmed in a way that calls shadows and cold spaces. Scenes are scarce and short, the focus is on the struggle within the individual about what is right to do and whether the ends justify the means. The emperor's journey from idealistic peacemaker to relentless tyrant attempts to be subtle, but gives little background or convincing insight into the motivation of the emperor. Indeed, his actions and goals do not change throughout. Only Gong Li's attitude towards him is changing. The most interesting performances are Gong Li's and the titular Assassin when they reconsider when to fight, when to retreat, when to kill. The most expensive film ever made in China does not matter to the emperor and the Assassin on hysterical emotion or great fighting, but rather a disturbing atmosphere of threat and inevitability. Gong Li fans will be untouched to hear that she is as beautifully beautiful as ever, and gives an understated performance.
