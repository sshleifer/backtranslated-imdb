Okay, I must admit, I do a little like Peter Liapis and I will admit it is not the best Ghoulies successor. I mean, yes, it had its faults, like NO GHOULIES themselves. But the two Ghoulies coming to earth were really funny, I think they are called Dark and Lite. I enjoyed the plot of the movie. And even at the end of the film, both Ghoulies implied that there would be a successor. Still waiting. lol. Peter Liapis rejected his role as Jonathan Graves, this time playing a detective, how cute! Ghoulies IV shouldn't be scary or exciting, but it's definitely funny. I thought I'd comment on this movie and just say - it's not that bad. It is worth looking at, although the Ghoulies are not in it.
