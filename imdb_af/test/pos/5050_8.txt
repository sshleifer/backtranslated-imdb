It's a lovely movie to say the least. The main character, Fanda, is an old man who refuses to be among the living dead where he is surrounded. He and his accomplices walk around to pull tears and get into trouble in the city. Meanwhile, his family is in the arms about what to do with him. From there you see Fanda's relationships with his wife, best friend and son develop. This eventually leads to one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are rich and deep. They develop well through the course of the film. The movie has quite a variety of moods. It goes from light and funny to dark and dark. Any slow parts for you in this movie will eventually be made. <br /> <br /> Autumn Spring carries a similar message as many other European movies do - don't forget the little pleasure. in life. If you enjoy Amelie, the eighth day or life is beautiful (all big movies VAT), you'll probably like this movie. <br /> <br /> 8.5 / 10
