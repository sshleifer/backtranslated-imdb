I tend to get angry when I hear Lucio Fulci's reputation as director. Too often, he is categorized as a talented filmmaker, but only to shock the entire audience and dislike images of pure gore. True, its films contain more explicit filth and disease than your average mainstream US production, but its films are always of wide variety and the plots are brutally morbid. Don't Torture a Duck Is Another Story! This movie is a pure jewel of the Italian shock theater! Do I dare to call this movie a masterpiece? It's an old-fashioned gala that includes all the brilliant aspects of real horror. The film shows the quest for an inhumane ceremony in a small Italian mountain village. The bodies of 3 young boys are found, terribly mutilated. There are a lot of pseudo-madmen in town, but every route nowhere leads. Among the suspects is a greedy bum and a scary woman, obsessed with witchcraft and voodoo. Fulci knows, like a true master brain, to find the right, crazy tone for his movie. He portrays the small town as a claustrophobic and inevitable environment of macabre events, backed by a greedy soundtrack. Fulci also develops himself here as a brilliant storyteller. The writing is always one step ahead of you and the complex plot will deceive you more than once. In other words, it's a unique giallo (horror slash murder mystery). The gore is not presented as grotesque and explicit, as in Lucio's later milestones (including the legendary Zombie 2, The Beyond and the New York Ripper), although there are still some misleading and difficult clocks. . <br /> <br /> Don't torture a duck. This is the most compelling and effective achievement Lucio Fulci has ever brought. It is easily among the biggest Italian horror movies ever made. Right next to the masterpieces made by Mario Bava and Dario Argento. The film is fascinating from start to finish, some plot aspects are terribly realistic and the tension is adrenaline at all times. A must have for horror fans and an absolute priority for Italian shock lovers!
