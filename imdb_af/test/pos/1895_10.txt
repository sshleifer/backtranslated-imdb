If you watch this movie, you will quote it and refer to it for a long time. It was years since I saw Dolemite and I still get it to this day. It is a true classic. It's so annoyingly horrible that it makes a hilarious view. Every terrible line of dialogue is absolutely wonderful. Each wobbly shot an artwork (?). And every punch and kick performed so dirty. You will not believe your eyes. That's all I can say. If I really get involved in the show of this movie, I won't be able to stop and I'll go beyond the IMDb 1000 word limit. <br /> <br /> Please check out this movie. You will be in hysteria. Or 1/10 or 10/10, depending on your sense of humor.
