IMAGINARY HEROES is a nice little movie! Written and directed by Dan Harris, this story is a classic theater, which makes the comedy and the tragedy so tight that the climax of the film takes your breath away. <br /> <br /> The Travis family is a strange bunch: no member is who doesn't seem to be everybody. With a suicide from unwilling 'hero' child swimming champion Matt (Chicken Pardue), father Ben (Jeff Daniels) falls apart and isolates himself from his family and himself while the mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver) turns and rages and sarcasm, daughter Penny (Michelle Williams) returns from school to her family's behavior, and the remaining son Tim (Emile Hirsch) takes the breast of all of the above with his classmates, girlfriend and teams with his closest Kyle (Ryan Donowho) jump into drugs and sexual experiments. In the course of the film, Tim tried to hide his bruises, which had all his own secrets, but his girlfriend rejected rejection, his mother was furious with the trailer's roads. Bully believes she is the cause and finally opens the window. lesions this family suffered for years. Mysteries and lies, here and their decision are painfully dramatic. <br /> <br /> Sigourney Weaver may be the best part, though Emile Hirsh, Jeff Daniels, Ryan Donowho and Kip Pardue (despite the briefness of his role) all contribute to performances. The story starts slowly and looks awesome and the fact can lose the attention of the viewers, but stay with this little Powerhouse movie and the impact of the work will surprise you. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
