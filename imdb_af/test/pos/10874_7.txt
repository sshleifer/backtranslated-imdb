I do not know if I go so far as to say that this movie is part of the 'Aussie waste', but it is fair to say that there are no nominees for the Oscar prize. What should be considered is that most of the actors in this movie were not actors, only children with nothing better to do. There were many others presenting roles in the film, but turned to surf the coast. Taking all that into account, it wasn't really a bad movie for his time. In some respects, it's actually no different from today's times, where peer pressure is still alive and kicking, just without the mobile phones, computers and other similar gadgets that kids lived, unlike this generation. Anyway, I have to judge this movie as an old fave that I watch once in a blue moon and never take it too seriously ...
