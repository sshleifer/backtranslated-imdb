I was terribly terrified by the soft power of this movie and the mood it created. I think it had to get a lot more credit than it did. I agree that Michelle Pfeiffer should be nominated, but I think all the performances were excellent and that Michelle Pfeiffer and Jessica Lange portrayed the deep affinity and conflict of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity. Although I didn't read the book, I found the modern concept of King Lear very cool. I will definitely never look at the scene again!
