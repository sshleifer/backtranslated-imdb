Don't be fooled by the nostalgic aura that surrounds "Mr Antoine", because the best of the Canadian films falls just below the surface. <br /> <br /> Assuming rural Quebec in the 1940s, the story explores the evolving consciousness of young Benoit as he learns to deal with sexuality and death. <br /> <br /> The appearance of the movie is amazing, especially as a high percentage of criticism of Canadian theater by the general public for aesthetics. In addition, the modest Benoit is a seductive protagonist for the audience, watching his corrupt community with fresh innocent eyes. <br /> <br /> I recommend Jim Leach's critical essay on film in Canada's best features for anyone who places the film in a historical context also dissects the film. Sure this one out.
