Goldie Hawn, in 1969, was best known for playing in television comedy shows - especially ROWAN AND MARTIN'S LAUGH IN, where she was the giggly biscuit young blonde. She made movies for CACTUS FLOWER, the most notable is a Walt Disney feature, the one and only true, original family band. But CACTUS FLOWER picked up on her character of LAUGH-IN and (due to a good script by IAL Diamond - Billy Wilder's second partner - based on an Abe Burrows play) she could develop the television characters so that a real achievement was. fleshed out. As a result, Ms Hawn won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 1969, and her career went to such future hits as PRIVATE BENJAMIN and THE EVERY WIVES CLUB. Although other stars of LAUGH-IN were well on television (Henry Gibson has a recurring role as judge at BOSTON LEGAL), only Goldie could have a career as a bonifide movie star. <br /> <br /> At LAUGH- In Goldie's personality, a naive one would give it embarrassment. Sometimes she realized it, and she laughed aloud to cover, but sometimes she not only saw her mistakes (for example: Goldie is introduced to the 1950's variety gossip host Gary Moore, and is said, "Goldie, that is Gary Moore. "She shakes his hand and says (much to his confusion):" I always wanted to meet John Gary Moore! "). But like Toni Simmons it is very different. She is desperately in love with dr. Julian Winston (Walter Matthau), a successful dentist who can never marry her. Julian told her that his wife (with whom he had two sons and a daughter) would never give him a divorce. So at the beginning of the movie, Toni tries to commit suicide by the gas from her stove. But she was rescued by her neighbor, Igor Sullivan (Rick Lenz), a struggling playwright, who broke into her apartment and turned off the gas. <br /> <br /> Toni was thanked to live but she sent a suicide note to Julian. Igor tries to send a message to ignore the note, but Julian's receptionist / nurse / assistant, Stephanie Dickinson (Ingrid Bergman) will not stop Julian's work schedule to give him the phone when Igor calls. Instead, Julian finds the letter and races to Toni's apartment, just to find her alive. When Igor supports her story trying to kill herself, Julian realizes the depth of her love and decides to marry such a woman. Unfortunately, Toni swallowed Julian's lies, and believes in his wife and children. You see, Julian has no wife and children. Since Toni believes she cannot marry a man who will lie to her, Julian falls on a weakening tree branch. <br /> <br /> Julian comes to solve it by giving Stephanie as if she were Mrs. Winston. Stephanie is opposed, but on her first free Saturday, she confronts Toni at the record shop where Toni is. They talk, and Toni notices all the fine strengths of character and personality of Stephanie (and since Stephanie has her two cousins, Toni thinks they're Julian's kids). Toni tells Julian they need to see who the man Stephanie is going to get married. So start the lie for Julian, Stephanie and Toni. Soon, a lover will be given to Stephanie in the form of Julian's friend and release of patient Harvey Greenfield (Jack Weston). Greenfield is so sloppy (Stephanie disgusts him) that Toni feels unavailable to Stephanie. <br /> <br /> And so, with one complication (most caused by the deliberate, misinformed Toni) going to another until the conclusion. The script is full of first-hand situations and one-liners (for example: Julian to reward Stephanie for their marriage, buy two record albums from Toni's store. He stole a mink from Toni, but she decides to send it to Stephanie. Julian's card Stephanie is very happy to get the mink, but she doesn't say a word about the nature of the gift she has, and when she thanked Matthau, he says she wants Horowitz - what Vladomir Horowitz means Stephanie thinks Horowitz is the name of the furrier!). <br /> <br /> Bergman had to enjoy the filming, as several scenes show the earthly look that was her trademark in the late 1940s. But there was also the deal with her 1958 movie comedy smash hit, INDISCREET. There, Cary Grant lied to make sure that the couple would concentrate on the romance of their relationship without thinking of marriage. When Grant's lie is revealed to Bergman, she decides on a lie to convince Grant that she is making him a cookie. Here, instead of the passive lover, Matthau believes in telling the truth, Bergman Matthau tries to get out of his mess through small white lies, just to lead one leading to another to complicate everyone's lives . Bergman is seen as a good woman who becomes part of the problem, despite being part of the solution. <br /> <br /> All the leaders perform well, especially Bergman, all business thoroughness first but regaining her sexuality gradually. Matthau is beautiful as a man who finds a useful lie is an obstacle that just can't be put aside. The supporting role, especially Weston as the mooching and sexually slender Harvey, and Vito Scotti as the American ambassador, who actually has Bergman's backbone. It was a clever comedy and a great way to push Goldie Hawn's film career forward.
