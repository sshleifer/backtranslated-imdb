Chop Shop, the second feature of Ramin Bahrani, is a rare breed. It's an American movie that is told of a story that is not usually found in American cinema, the story of the minority living in poverty. It is a work of simple beauty. On the spot in Queens, New York in the shadow of Shea Stadium, Chop Shop is neo-realism. With non-actors, it has more in common with Vittorio De Sica's classic Bicycle Thieves than anything made in the United States. There is no score or soundtrack, all the music and sounds are diageties. To see it feels like a great foreign movie, it takes us to another world because it's so unusual to see. However, this other world is not after World War II Rome or Istanbul or New Delhi. It is the contemporary New York city. <br /> <br /> Bahrani tells the story of Alejandro (Alejandro Polanco), better known as Ale. He is a 12-year-old Latin American child with no parents or family unit to look at him. He lives in a small room at the top of the car shop where he works. He shares the same bed with his teenage sister Isamar (Isamar Gonzales). None of them passed the second degree. Ale, though young, is tough and mature. He acts as the head of the small family. He hooks his sister with a job, and he does anything he can to make a goat if he doesn't work at the coat rack. He sells bootleg DVDs on the streets and candy in the subway. He looks for motor vehicles and sells it to the many car shops in the street where he lives. <br /> <br /> Alejandro is sad when he teaches his sister working nights as a prostitute. He is becoming less and less interested in complying with the law. He started stealing, first car parts and later wallets. Like Antonio, the desperate protagonist in Bicycle thieves, we can't blame Ale for becoming a thief. It's just survival. Ale and Isamar are saving up hoping to buy a $ 4,500 vending machine. They see the bus as their way out, and there is a lot of optimism. As usual, however, in neo-realism, we know that it will only lead to disappointment. <br /> <br /> Polanco's decisive achievement is giving legitimacy to Chop Shop's realism. Here is a 12-year-old character who must be credibly independent and vulnerable naive. Whether he's driving cars to the store, selling movies and Snickers bars or playing with his sister in their skinny room, it's authentic. Chop Shop is a sobering reminder that not all American children are growing up. a land of opportunity. Ale's lifestyle is what many see in middle-class white America as "third world". They notice the poverty and hardship in foreign countries while drinking their coffee and reading the New York Times on Sunday morning, but blinding themselves. Once you have watched Chop Shop, you will think differently about the kids who go candy on the subway. <br /> <br /> More reviews at www.mediasickness.com
