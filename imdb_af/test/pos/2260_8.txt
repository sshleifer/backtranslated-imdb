After I didn't read the book, I was more open to the fresh interpretation that each director gave to their medium (which is film, not "to the letter" reproduction of literature) on this particular movie. I was glad that the holocaust that took place in Russia (and its neighboring countries) eventually got attention. The Nazis were especially cruel to Russians and Russian Jews. If you read history and see the monuments in Smolensk and nearby areas, you will understand this movie and why have kept quiet when they had to speak. <br /> <br /> It was definitely time for it to be chronic and I hope more stories will come out of it. It's high time.
