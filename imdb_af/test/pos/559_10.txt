I saw this movie on HBO last night and didn't expect me to get hooked. I usually fall asleep when I watch HBO. But this has happened and you will too. It is a tragic documentary (2002 Oscar winner) about a murder of an elderly female tourist in Jacksonville, Florida and the subsequent investigation, arrest and trial of a 15-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie today and get a feel for how we progressed as a society. This film was the most deserving of a valued Oscar - you will be moved to tears.
