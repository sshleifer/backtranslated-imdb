With the war it did not do well for the Soviet Union, but Stalin accepted the prisoners volunteers and used the prisoners as shock troops. This is the story of such a battalion. There are little crooks, political prisoners, soldiers from other units, gray-haired veterans of the White Army, and some dangerous criminals. <br /> <br /> They are thrown into illegal and untrained battles and face the threat of the NKVD if they show signs of cowardice or failure. <br /> <br /> The special effects are rudimentary and many of the small characters are one-dimensional, but the general story is very human and sound. <br /> <br /> I didn't see a version with subtitles or dubbing. The show's show requires liberal use of the pause button and explanations of a Russian native speaker.
