Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez), urgently urged by two FBI agents, Peter Novak (Vince Vaughn) and Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) to use her therapy on Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Ofornio), a serial killer ( use strange and terrible torture tactics) found in a coma by the feds. What Novak wants in return for Deane is the place where Stargher's last victim is and as his life. Once Deane comes to Stargher's mind, which has the look and feel of a colorful combination of David Lynch's "Dune" or "Blue Velvet" and Wes Craven's "A Nightmare on Elm Street", the adventure begins. Deane sees a variety of strange people ranging from Carl as a youngster (an adorable Jake Thomas) to a Freddy Krueger-like man minus the razor claw. I don't want to end, but the movie is quite apart from the dynamics, Howard Shore's creepy musical score and directing (by Tarsem, showing here he can direct).
