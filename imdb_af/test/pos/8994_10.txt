I wanted to see this movie since the previews came out. I don't understand why everyone is so hard on this movie. It may not all be technically true for the sport of rugby, but this movie is not mostly about sport. It's about a rugby team being taught how to be more than the world's expectations. They are taught to become men, and not temporarily vain boys. Hollywood is never 100% correct in their productions. They are there to make a product that sells. Something entertaining. The story of Coach Gelwix and what he learned over the years is simply amazing. He learns about service, honor, integrity and moral purity. How many other movies does this teach us today? I was proud to see such a wonderful story that taught respect and respect.
