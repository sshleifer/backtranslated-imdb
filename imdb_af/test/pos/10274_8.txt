So here's a little background on how I came to see this movie. As you probably know, it's the original French film, which was later restored by Hollywood as Wicker Park (Quelle Surprise). Well, I avoided the movie like the plague when it was first released just because: a) I knew it was absolutely nothing to do with Wicker Park, and lived in Chicago, I didn't see why it did not - it's filmed in the beginning of Canada! - b) I have a very difficult time doing with useless remakes, done purely because Hollywood thinks we are too idle to read a few subtitles. I can't do the repetition of Infernal Affairs. says Josh Hartnett, "Nuff said. <br /> <br /> But I generally got the WP on TV on the TV, probably about half an hour, and I shouldn't understand anything at all until about half an hour from the end. it begins to come together. In the end, I was really surprised to find myself really in it, and then the end was just as good - a perfect combination of story, passion and ending with possibly one of the greatest musical choices I've ever seen (heard ?). Since then I have heard a lot about the L'Appartement vs Wicker Park argument and look at WP, I still say it has everything to do with Chicago, but there was something about what I liked, so when I was back, I watched it again. Unfortunately I still miss the first piece (I haven't seen it yet!) And I still thought it was pretty good. Very even Josh Hartnett looked good! But I was curious about L'Appartement and wanted to see what all the fuss was. So I waited and waited to catch L'Appartement somewhere in some way. Netflix dropped me, so I finally got a copy of a site in Ireland. And I just watched it. <br /> <br /> It's really kind of weird, but a little weird. A classic French film. Great play, Romane Bohringer is an absolute gem - sorry, but she acts Monica Bellucci out of the screen in every scene. Vincent Cassel was a strange choice for the lead, but by the end he worked. And I watched Jean-Philippe Ecoffey in many movies and I just love him - the scene where Alice showered him in the restaurant and he looks like someone's told his puppy was overrun! But I can honestly say that I saw WP and pretty much expect it to be a play for drama (like about 75% of the rest of the movie - perhaps in a different order, but come on, the scene with the movie). coffee in the glasses word for word !!), you can imagine my surprise looking at the end of L'Appartement! I can literally say I was blown away - hmm, a little like poor old Lucien was really through the cafe window! So be prepared if you've seen Wicker Park and you'd like to look at the original look I did, don't make the mistake of expecting an identical movie, because you'll be disappointed or excited. French film history - an excellent example of how you can watch a movie, think you're going to see a spicy happy ending, and get a bit of the total spin in the opposite direction to the right at the end. Decide this movie definitely. Oh, and while you're at it, maybe not too close to the same time, but under the road, look at Wicker Park, it will also surprise you.
