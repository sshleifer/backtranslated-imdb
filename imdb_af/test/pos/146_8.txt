A beloved and dedicated priest from a small town volunteer for a medical experiment that fails and turns him into a vampire. <br /> <br /> Physical and psychological changes lead to his relationship with a woman of his youth friend who is oppressed and tired of her everyday life. <br /> <br /> The one-time priest falls deeper into despair and depravity. As things get worse, he struggles to keep what is left of his humanity. <br /> <br /> The vampire movie now really had to be extinct thanks to the poor efforts of the Twilight and Underworld franchises, but the director injects new blood into the story of the vampire, putting simple things in perspective. <br /> <br /> These vampires have reflections, and no strings, but still feed and die the same. To make the main performance, a priest really opens a can of worms for interrogating such acts. The priest feeds mainly to make himself better, but when he meets his unfinished wife, carnal instincts are instituted. <br /> <br /> What makes this movie extremely erotic is that when the couple first consents, it's something they've never experienced before, forbidden passion, which makes the scenario so sensual. <br /> <br /> Chan-Wook puts the necessary humor in the movie, but only in the final third of the movie. We see the daughter lift her mother in the chair in front of everyone, and if she realizes her own strength, he just sticks down the chair and continues. Hilarious. <br /> <br /> The final act will not be in a portable movie, or even the three Stooges as the couple for survival / death. <br /> <br /> CGI is subtle and fantastic, and the screens with those jumping from building to building are so graceful, you can watch ballet. <br /> <br /> The vampire genre then feels fresh and alive, but more importantly, it has the erotic and intensity that most vampire films currently lack. It's violent, but I don't expect anything else from the director in question. <br /> <br /> A very interesting story, with fantastic characters and beautiful cinematography.
