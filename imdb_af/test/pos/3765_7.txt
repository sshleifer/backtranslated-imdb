It took me a while to find this movie, as they don't have it on DVD yet (and my video recorder isn't worth re-connecting). I think all the references to drug use are too much for some people. But I found a decent bootleg on Ebay and I have to say that anyone who takes this movie too seriously is only delayed. It is a flapper pole in the ear of "airplane." I have to say that when I watched it on Showtime or Spotlight in the 80's, I enjoyed the humor much more than I do now. But it is definitely worth watching just to see what they (ie, filmmakers) were able to get away from before "Just Say No" hypocrites unleashed their propaganda. sing ... "We're all on drugs" hahaha It's a silly movie and worth the $ 10 I paid off Ebay to get it on DVD, don't even think of comparing it to the original one - It's just stupid. What are you high on?
