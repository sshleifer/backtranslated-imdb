This film centered on a young lady who makes prayers to help her family and friends when they experience problems in life. It reminded me of other movies such as the "Bernadette Song" and "Francis of Assisi" and has a very strong Catholic influence on the film. Ann Blyth is very charming as first, the Catholic school student and later as a young woman who buys a statue of Saint Anne (which is the street on which I live, incidentally) and very much pray for the saints intercession when problems arise in her life . Frances Bavier (Aunt Bea from Andy Griffith show) and Edmund Gwenn (from Miracle on 34th Street) play relatives of her. A local priest of mine said my sister Ann Blyth looked and both had the same front and middle names. A nice good family movie that came from an era when life was a little more simple.
