Since the past few days I have been really attached to the "Female Scorpion" series and I keep myself on the head because I have been waiting until now? what is too long? before purchasing the whole set. "Beast Stable" is the third brilliant effort in a row, and the unmistakable main asset of this series is how the writers have always gained something completely new and different for each installment. Never, or after, there was an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines, settings, themes, and filming styles. The original more or less qualified as a so-called "Women-in-Prison" movie (but already an atypical one), but you may not be able to categorize parts 2 and 3 as such, as they have virtually no footage in the prison walls. does not contain. . And the overall tone and atmosphere also changes with every new episode. The first movie was loud and fierce, while the second was psychedelic and part three was almost melodramatic. Don't let this last description discourage you, however, as "Beast Stable" contains more than enough explosive themes and stores videos despite the dramatic atmosphere. The opening order, for example, is straightforward fantastic. Sasori, another refugee of the law, literally cuts her way to freedom on the subway when there is no other option but to cut off the arm of the persistent policeman who handcuffed her. Her running through the city with the cut arm hanging on her hair, while the credits appear on the screen, accompanied by the well-known theme song, is just pure and real gold exploitation! The story has urgently gone on with our heroine who desperately tries to lead an anonymous life in the big city, but the poor thing simply can't escape her past or even new forms of anxiety. Sasori befriends a prostitute, though without exchanging a dialogue, and works in a sewing studio. Her own delayed brother (!) Fertilizes the prostitute, while Sasori gets in trouble with the local pimping and underground crime network. She prevents a thief from taking advantage of her body, meeting a former enemy out of jail and furiously dismissing one of the prostitutes when subjected to a barbaric abortion. Meanwhile, one armed police remains obsessively seeking the streets, seeking retaliation against Sasori. Our multifunctional director Shunya Ito crosses all these story lines to a powerful healthy and never forfeits the visual aspects or ingenious filming style. "Beast Stable" features some of the most impressive compositions and ingenious camera angles you can imagine, the editing is flawless and the outdoor spaces are effectively depressing. Those who know a little about Sasori's character are aware that the movie is seriously lacking in memorable dialogues, but it is always widely reimbursed by Meiko Kaji's wonderful screen-carism and threatening grimace. There is very little sleaze, apart from the aforementioned turbulent subplot, but the brief flashes of extreme violence are great and the distorted end is almost too brilliant for words. In fact, I think part three might just be the biggest (or at least my favorite) one of the series so far. My only small and completely irrelevant point of criticism is about the ridiculous sounds that one of the birds produces when Sasori is locked up in a cage. This bird sounds like a ventriloquist's dummy with stomach cramps.
