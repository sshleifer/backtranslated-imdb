Spending an hour watching this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his "Dan Band" play their special on Bravo, is the nicest hour I ever watched on TV. This young man (Dan) is such an incredible talent, as a singer, performer and even dancer. He can go to some of the coolest ballad songs, all sung by women, hip-hop, rock, and women's songs too. This man can do anything. I saw him at least 11 times, so I didn't just think how well his performance would fit into a television or movie format, but all the discussions went away immediately when the show started because of Dan's overwhelming quality. a favor and watch it, or better still, buy it.
