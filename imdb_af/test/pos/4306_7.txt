This Columbo is unique because we don't really know the exact outcome to the end. Our favorite dark horse detective suspects some identical twin brothers to kill their rich uncle; each one points his finger to his brother. In a mystery series showing the crime at the beginning of the drama, this quarrel can only be used once or twice, and that was Columbo's time. Unlike that ripple, this episode fits well with others of the series. It has a lighter tone than some, with a very funny performance by Jeanette Nolan as the versatile and loyal housekeeper Columbo likes right away.
