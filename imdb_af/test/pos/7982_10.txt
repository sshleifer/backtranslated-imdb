Any Batman fan will know just how big the movies are, they are a great success. Batman Returns is by far the best movie in the series. A combination of excellent directing, brilliant acting and settings make it worth looking at at night. <br /> <br /> Tim Burton, who directed this movie, specifically made sure this movie gives a realistic atmosphere and he's already a good job. Danny Devito (Penguin Man) is a man who has inherited penguin characteristics as a baby and grown up to be a horrible and ugly thing! Michelle Pfiffer plays the slender and very seductive 'Catwoman' after cats gave her gene to be bitten. The result in both character changes is excellent and both Catwoman and Penguin man play a very important role in this excellent movie. The mysterious Catwoman is very nice to watch - her classic words and a funny part jumping into a jewel shop add such fun to the movie. Danny Devito also does well, his ability to personalize a strange being was essential and he adds a good atmosphere to the movie that we bring back to the dull sewers where he lives. <br /> <br /> You can't forget. Batman al. Micheal Keaton draws a comfortable performance again and shows us another way to Batman. His love is released when he confronts Catwoman at the end of the film, and his encounters with her when she leads a normal person, Selina Kyle, is that he is being deceived in his own home. There is now a clever part when they leave, and the movie is full of great scenes. It is noteworthy that Bruce Wayne's Bat phone is not used as much as the other Batman movies, as the battle against screens and storytelling forms this film. <br /> <br /> The winter setting is perfectly created in Gotham City with most of the scenes set at night, and the city is filled with snow. Therefore, if you see this movie in the summer as I did, it doesn't feel the same. Best watch it during the winter. <br /> Overall, this is an amazing movie. All the credit goes to Tom Burton and the cast, they did an incredible job.
