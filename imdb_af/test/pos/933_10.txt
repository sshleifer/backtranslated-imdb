The final part of Kieslowski's trilogy, based on the colors of the French flag, finds the director in peace with the metaphysical and transcendent nature of the film. In Red, images are important, as well as the obvious but smart color coding. But rather than meeting the "cinema you're watching" empty aesthetic relationships, Kieslowski's Red is a multi-faceted, close-knit meditation on the nature of fate and love. In Red, Love and Fate, intertwined but complex concepts are dictated so much by the whims of people as the invisible parallel associations we have presented. You feel Red is really an allegory, a reenactment of Prospero's ubiquitous gestures in The Tempest, but that's more than his story appears. Red claims countless views, and in every look something new is discovered that weaves in the already impeccable structure. <br /> <br /> Although Red stands alone as a masterpiece of Kieslowski, it is best regarded as part of the trilogy. Elements of Blue and White are mentioned in Red, which will enjoy knowing viewers.
