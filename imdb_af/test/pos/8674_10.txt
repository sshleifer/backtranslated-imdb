I think this is the best Norwegian movie I've ever seen. It's about 40-year-old Andreas who is hit by a metro train, and suddenly finds himself in a strange city, but everything is ready for him here. He has a job, a house and clothes. Initially, this city looks perfect, no death, no pain and no trouble. Everywhere there are men in gray suits who fix everything that doesn't fit in their definition of perfect. However, Andreas can't really fit in and start back to his old world, trying with all means to come back. <br /> <br /> The thing that impresses me most in this movie is how the way the city looks so surreal, although I have seen many of these places in real life, looks so far. Another thing that greatly contributes to the game is the performance of the actors. Trond Fausa Aurvaag is just the perfect guy to play the confused and troublesome Andreas. And all the other characters also do a good job of playing apathy (sounds like a hard work or not?). The strong difference between Andreas and the others also leads to many amusing situations. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The plot can be a bit confusing, but the movie has such a good atmosphere. I would recommend that everyone see it. <br /> <br /> And I would not recommend listening to "ccscd212" because it appears that he has seen too many commercial American movies and seems to have become too accustomed to just morale on a silver billboard be served. As I see it, there is not much in this movie that we are trying to tell that suicide is right or wrong. I see this as a warning of a direction our society seems to take. But surely everyone can see a movie in their own way.
