By 1950, John Ford had already developed the ideas and motifs at the heart of his most successful Western form. Always present, for example, is a strong community feeling, most commonly found in the Jewish family of Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Revenge" (1940). "Within these communities, even under Ford's elevated themes of racism and pioneering spirit, there is always room for the smaller human interactions, the minor friendships and romance that make life worth living. 'Wagon Master (1950)' came after Ford released the first two films in its "cavalry" trilogy? "Fort Apache (1948)" and "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)?" and it covers similar areas, just without the military perspective and, more judgmentally, the strong lead of John Wayne. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr., are good actors, but they feel like playing second-violin to someone, and Ward Bond's cunning Mormon parent, while possibly being a candidate for such a role, doesn't get enough given. To fit the bill satisfactorily. <br /> <br /> In 'Wagon Master', Ford looks so comfortable with its proven Western formula that any character development is largely transferred. Ben Johnson's romance with Joanne Dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and Harry Cary Jr's charm of a Mormon girl is so perfunctories that it is almost inconsistent in the final film. This allows the survival of the scrapped scene to be considered. Only in Charles Kemper's charismatic and shameless villain Uncle Shiloh, Ford is trying a bit differently, and it even works when he is surrounded by a gang of indifferent hammy, dragged dragons. Where Ford succeeds in orchestrating the conglomeration of three different racial Americans ?? the values-oriented Mormome, the mitigating horse traders, the eccentric traveling watchers ?? in a cohesive community of pioneers looking to a bright future. This apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of Uncle Shiloh's armed criminals, who exploit the lawlessness of the West border, but ultimately lead to the noble cowboys who "just pulled snakes on." <br /> <br /> Ford considered Wagon Master to be the favorite of his film. Maybe it has something to do with the absence of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with its stockpile of regular players, Ford can generate a sense of community by not focusing on any one character, although most of the Mormom travelers remain completely anonymous. In spite of the fact that it has undoubtedly been made good, I can't help feeling that this movie does just fine what other Ford pictures have done even better: the tremendous majesty of the West border is more beautifully presented in 'Sy wore a Yellow Ribbon '; The romance and friendly ailments of community members had greater prominence in Fort Apache; The early relationships with Native Americans, just shown here, were thoroughly investigated in 'The Searchers (1956)'; The bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more mobile (though by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in 'How The West Won Won (1962).' Wagon Master is pure John Ford, but it's not a landmark.
