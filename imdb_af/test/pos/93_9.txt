A boy worshiping Maurice Richard of the Montreal Canadiens receives a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey in the post, to his horror. I recently watched it in a class where little of the students were interested in hockey, but almost everyone knew about Maurice Richard and the Toronto / Montreal rivalry. Very entertaining, amusing and accurate.
