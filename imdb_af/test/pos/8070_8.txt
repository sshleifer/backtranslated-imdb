The summary line is some men's wet dream for the ideal woman ...; o) Seriously, but back to the movie, which has a classic theater written on it (word and literally shown in the picture as you see it)! <br /> <br /> How can anyone make a silent movie this year and age? It's not quite silent for once (for example, the music). With great cinematography, the answer is. And it's no wonder it's won prizes (like another user said) in this area! But sometimes it's also ruin. Although the pictures are good, it sometimes delves too much instead of moving forward (plotting and timing). If you can handle it, you'll enjoy it even more than I do. I didn't tell you anything about the story, but I'll never do it because I don't want to cheat on you.
