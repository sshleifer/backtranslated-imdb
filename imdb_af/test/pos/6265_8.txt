This movie is about so many things. Most obvious is the grip that the film can have on an audience and how to capture life on film can be a kind of magic. There is also the tense relationship between China and the West, as many Chinese (probably rightly) saw the "Barbarians" to persuade and pollute their way of life. Liu even tries to preserve their lifestyle on film because he sees that it will disappear someday. They are also Liu's internal conflict between China's loyalty and traditions against the self-determination philosophy of the West. All these themes are intimately interwoven in a coherent and enjoyable whole by Hu. A very enjoyable movie.
