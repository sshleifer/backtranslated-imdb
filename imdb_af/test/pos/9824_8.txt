I don't know how I would feel if I lived in the US. I would look at some preview screens, advertisements, I would know, Sidney Pollack directed it, Harrison Ford and Kristin Scott Thomas starred. I will watch this movie as soon as possible without reading any bad review. Should I Be Disappointed? <br /> <br /> I read a lot of review that says how bad this movie was: It's boring, long film without passion emotions and it's not interesting. Harrison is wood, cold. The sublets must be cut. Too serious, especially for Harrison Ford. I'm interested in the subject, and I like Harrison Ford in the movies that aren't actions. I also like Sidney Pollack and Kristin Scott Thomas. So read reviews on IMDB website then in other sites than in February in the Hungarian movie magazines I was wondering and wondering what the movie was. Anyway, there are movies, directors, stars I want to see despite any reviews. <br /> <br /> I can understand people who think this movie is boring and cold and has no passion, but I feel different. . It is true that I love Sliding Doors, The Forbidden Woman (this is a French film, I don't know what his title is in English or French). Basically these movies are developing a love. <br /> <br /> I think Random Heart is a nice and interesting movie in its own way. <br /> <br /> It may be true that the sublime congressional election and police investigation into a corrupt policeman - is not well written, not worked out in detail, but adds something to the leading woman a man's character. After his wife's death and betrayal emotion, the evil of Dutch comes during his work. He will be suspicious and almost lose his best friend (also the woman). The film shows two ways to survive the tragedy: our wife / husband's death and fraud. One of them is the woman: it is tragedy, but life continues. She doesn't want to mourn forever. What she wanted to know - how her husband's lover - the police's wife - thought she would never learn. She is forced to act in this way. The election comes, and anything about his husband can be scandalized. She wants her daughter not to disappoint with her father. The man is a cop. He suffers from the fact that he lived in lies. He wants to know - maybe every man in this situation wants to know - when his wife began to deceive him. How long did she love her? He needed the woman's help, but she didn't want to, but the man was stubborn and persistent. The woman can't stand him, because he always steps in her life and she can't forget. Their relationship is tense at first and then slowly develops a kind of silent sympathy that prefers an alliance against the outside world, the tragedy. (I said this despite the fact that they made love in bed). However, the police member cannot stop investigating, cannot stop and cannot allow the woman near him, but he begins the "love" and the woman wants their relationship to continue. But it can't. The woman realizes this. The end is a bit sad, but logical, and nice at the same time. <br /> <br /> Seeing me again Peter Coyote-I love the man's face - Sidney Pollack. I barely knew Bonnie Hunt, but she was good. <br /> <br /> I think Harrison Ford has done a good job. His eardrop is unusual, but at the beginning I finally believed the woman, despite his temperament, liked being with his company. It was a pity he didn't have a joke. But Ford has a good sense of humor. A reviewer noted (in Hungary): "Ford is charismatic and overwhelmed and we are waiting for his presence and wants him to smile with us and make an ironic notice. But Dr Jones doesn't smile for us. "But he smiles at the end and it's so good. I agree with the rest. I love him a lot in this role. He is good at doing it, a little rough, but cool somewhere in his soul, smart cop. The character of Kristin Scott Thomas is a determined, confident woman, but she is in an ivory tower and she loves her emotions. But she is a real woman who is undecided and gets support from the policeman. The two cool, reserved people find each other. Maybe the writing isn't good. It is full of common, banal sense, but there are some humorous sentences of the woman and the movement, especially of the man. It's a good movie, but not for everyone, not for the general big audience. I watched the women under 18 and men above 45 looked this movie better. Perhaps over the latter, Sidney Pollack may have made this film for his age group not going to plywood. Anyway, I guess the people who love energetic plots with action scenes that just like Ford's action movies are missing out on this movie.
