I think it's wonderful how Chiller picked up this series and showed it to this generation. Filmmaking has come a long way, especially with the special effects and to see one of the archive versions they never knew, they will definitely see the progress compared to now. SAMPLES aren't lame or spectacular, but it's entertaining. It takes creativity for the type of story lines they've gained and each generation has its own horror series. This particular series was not as terrible as Friday's 13th, The Series, or as adult-oriented as Freddy's Nightmares. It was something that a whole family could see and still get a laugh and scare. I'm glad the Chiller Channel shows it in their series, I'm just about the episodes I missed when I grew up.
