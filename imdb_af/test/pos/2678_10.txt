Wow, it's my best sitcom since my friends. If you had a crap day, just sit with a beer (if you are old enough, it is. If you don't have to do a root beer.) And look at a few episodes, it's the perfect recipe for happiness. /> <br /> The thing I like most is that everyone in the show is very funny and everyone has a fantastic comedy timing. After a while you touch the characters and really care about them. I think the secret to the appearance is that they have an enviable life. Doug is thick, but still happy with it, he loves his wife, his work and his friends. The father-in-law is the fly in the ointment, but hey is not perfect.
