Born in 1946 I was about eight years old when I first watched this movie and it left a deep impression. Not just scary, because the film has been chasing me for over 50 years. The crowd that played John Larch was frightening. . The only scene that had devised in those 50 years was the murder of the little girl and the unconscious policeman who referred to her as a "little child". These words were replaced when the movie was shown. Recently on TV, maybe there are two versions of the movie or someone has forced to change this heartbreaking scene a little. The film played a major role in formulating my opinion of the South and to this day the closest I 'I come to a southern city, is El Paso. It may be extreme but there is a little more to the story. When the film was recently shown, it became clear why it haunted me for years. The news rule, like starting this movie, gives the impression that what is shown is fact A film is supposedly only one or two years after the depicted incidents, which add to its realistic credibility. The terror in the movie is not provided by creatures or space strangers, but by people living in our society. : The recent look helped to make the impact it had on my 8-year-old mind more clearly. When this movie came out, the only school I ever went to was mostly African Americans attending. The victim looks like a girl in my class, it was like seeing a real death. It made a horrible scene much worse. Maybe no one will find this review helpful, but it helped me.
