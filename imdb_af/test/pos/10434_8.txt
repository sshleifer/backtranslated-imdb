The Last American Virgin (1982) was one of the few teenage comedies I really enjoyed. The subject and the acting were far beyond the ordinary three times that Hollywood (and still is) crawling. But for a while, the smaller studios produced movies about teenagers, who didn't sink or soften the kiddies. The men pulling the strings behind this production were from your Cannon friends. <br /> <br /> Three teenage girls are trying to lose their virginity while still in high school. They will do anyone or anything to reach their dream goal. The sensitive one of the group (Andrew Monsoon), who is the right girl, while his two best friends will take whatever they can get. One day the child finds his perfect girl (Diane Franklin). But the lot will play one of their dirt points. His best friend moved in and wiped her off her feet. After she beat her, the sensitive child helps the girl back on her feet and pays for her abortion. He still has feelings for her and tries to win her heart. Meanwhile, his best friend has a very violent fall to get her dream girl preggers. Yet he tries his best to love her. The night comes when he asks her the question. But his heart is crushed when he sees her dance with his former best friend. In tears the child leaves the party. <br /> <br /> What I enjoyed about this movie was that it didn't bump. Instead of being filled with fake situations, it was very realistic, honest, and brutal. The movie is full of his share of funny moments and hysteria. I have to recommend this movie for teenage comedians. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
