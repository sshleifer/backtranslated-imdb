Post-war England, the beginning of the "atomic age". Yet, the concerns of a young schoolboy who wants to experience his first "kiss" cannot be deterred by something unimportant to THE BOMB. It was a wonderful, non-educational look at young love from the prospect of an adolescent man and his 1940s world. <br /> <br /> Free from political correctness and beautiful messages, this movie exposes the viewer to the world that can only create the mind (and <br /> <br /> hormones) of a young teen. Wonderful subplots <br /> <br /> Maintain character interest ala "Gregory's Girl", and many <br /> <br /> of well-blocked shots help keep the images of this era. This is a very good story for anyone, young or old, who ever fell in love with, or ever wanted to be. Does he ever get his wish? See it and see.
