Shuai is a brave and inept young Beijinger with a pointy hairstyle, selling a living sale of cheap books from a stall in an indoor market. He does not seem to have anything to do with the wiry, middle-aged, intellectuals, Zhang - and yet the two of them are in a restaurant gathering to discuss the pros and cons or murder (the Chinese title might be better than Talk It about "). If it sounds like a pedestrian, don't be deceived: this movie is abundantly inventive in its plot and mostly coincides with breaking speed (although the tempo is rather poor at the end). <br /> <br /> If you only know Zhang Yimou's worthy historical plays such as Raise The Red Lantern and Shanghai Triad, or his more recent martial arts epics, Hero and House Of Flying Daggers, you'll be amazed; In fact, which of its other movies you've seen, you'll be surprised, pleasantly surprised - it's by far its most original, most peculiar, most experimental work. It was shot in a minimal budget within a few weeks, almost entirely in Beijing (and using many ordinary Beijingers in the smaller supporting roles - there is even a brief como by the director himself) and mostly with a handheld camera, in a jerky, hyper-kinetic style, which is a million miles from the elegant formalism of its best-known films. <br /> <br /> OK, I live in Beijing, so I find an added joy in all the bizarre little details of everyday life that I will recognize and entertain (though shot in 1997 and things so fast here) change), but I really think this movie can be appreciated by anyone. I saw it as I have so many other Chinese "comedies" at a movie club that has subtitled versions of recent Chinese films for an almost exclusively extinct audience; and that's the only one I can remember where the audience laughs aloud. Some non-Chinese audiences may find it a little too strange, sometimes uncomfortable, as it includes violence, and after the opening as a stormy, horrible romantic comedy, it turns into something darker in the second half. However, it is very, very funny. <br /> <br /> It is also excellently performed by the two leaders, especially Zhang Yimou associate Jiang Wen, who is probably China's main film star. screen presence reminiscent of a young Depardieu or De Niro. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie - to prove that Chinese has a sense of humor that can translate into other cultures, to prove that Zhang Yimou is far, far more than a one-time pony. .... and for a good time.
