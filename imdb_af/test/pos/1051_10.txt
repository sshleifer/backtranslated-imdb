"Christmas In Connecticut" is a gem of a Christmas movie classic. Although less well known than some others - it is a pleasant way to spend an evening on vacation. I watch it every year. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck was thrown perfectly as Elizabeth Lane, the single, career girl. Away before it was popular, Stanwyck embodied the single girl on the rise. Her NYC apartment, and her friendly "uncle" restaurateur, characterize the single girl in the city's existence. She can't cook yet, she writes a homepage for a magazine! <br /> <br /> Dennis Morgan was also perfectly cast as our war battle, Jefferson Jones, who wants to meet the amazing Elizabeth Lane. After losing at sea, everything he wants is Christmas in a "real" home. What sets the marvelous, crazy story developing. It's fun from start to finish. We must all have Uncle Felix too!
