There is hell to pay if you cross Nami Matsushima (Meiko Kaji), Female Scorpio, and a dangerous group of rascals. (Including their sadistic stumbling block and his equally apostate lady), who runs a prosthetic ring with an iron fist, just do it. Hell has no fury like Scorpio, and a determined detective, Gondo (Mikio Narita), who seeks revenge to hide his arm after bending her, will do everything necessary (and that includes intimidation for someone who probably know her) to catch Nami. . Nami finds an ally in hooker Yuki (Yayoi Watanabe), which offers her a temporary shelter. Yuki has a delayed brother who had a brain injury during a job and needs to take care of him. (In a disturbing revelation, about incest, she also offers his sexual needs!). She actually holds him in a room while you work the streets! Meanwhile, Nami is being targeted by a dirty neighbor when she finds her own place (she works as a sewer) and he threatens to change her into the authorities. (Nami was an escaped offender who fled a subway from police) if she didn't offer him sexual favors. His wife pours a tea pot of boiling water over his face and body, which leads to death, and the prostitution clan seeks Nami to pay the debt to lose a very important member of their organization. That's when Katsu (Reisen Lee), the pimp's lover and confidant, realizes that the one responsible for losing their loyal member is a former resident of her, Scorpion. Suppress her with a injected liquid drug that puts her in a bird cage! (!), Katsu decorated in her prison sentence. What Nami's anger eventually fuels, looks at a prostitute who dies outside her cell, a victim of a forced late abortion, which is being killed. To hold a shovel in her hand (out of the operating room), Nami will break out of the cage and prey on every member of the clan responsible for the hooker's death. The series of murders kill Gondo the opportunity to catch Nami, and he will catch her in underground sewers under the city, but can he catch or kill her? Especially when Yuki comes to her aid? <br /> <br /> Trust me when I say there were no links binding director Shunya Ito or his film crew, because FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE is another perverse, confused and ultra-violent entry into the very entertaining series . Equipped with fine production values ​​and a visual silent talent to capture all the madness in imaginative ways, Ito draws your right (or me) into the twisted drama that always exists when Nami Matsushima is on the screen. If you have a protracted opening credit line where your anti-heroine flees through the crowded city spots, with a man's cut-off arm cuffed to her, the viewer needs to know what they are getting into! The incestuous sub-plot is simply bizarre (.. and it was shot in a soft chorus with the delayed brother who envisions his numb, cold sister with dead eyes!), And the whole abortion sequence is quite hard to go through. But the abortion angle, which is so disturbing, motivates Nami's revenge. In spite of Nami's imperfect ways and her criminal nature, you would rather see that she took out these criminals than vice versa. Interesting corner with Detective Gondo as well. Gondo is prepared to break the rules, and he becomes a force of nature towards anyone who is in his way to capture his mortal enemy. His fate at the end, visiting another enemy of Nami's, in an isolated cell, while watching, perfectly encapsulates what makes these movies so ridiculous, yet so entertaining. The murders are a montage of grinding planes, in various places, the flesh-out blades, with Nami leaving the crime scenes to wipe out the entire tribe in memory of a fallen victim of unfortunate circumstances. While the movie is essentially a comic book adventure, there is a sadness that permeates, and few characters get away without mistakes. I think many people will move away from this mockery at how unrealistic FEMALE PRISONER SCORPION: BEAST STABLE (.. specifically how Nami can escape time and time again, repay her goals of revenge, all those who qualified her,) watched it as a violent action cartoon, like the 80's movies, and enjoyed it for what it was. As always, this movie contains some beautiful Asian actresses and some colorful ones. Meiko Kaji, almost always reserved / quiet, yet cold with her violent actions, is in fine shape (.. in more ways than one) and Reisen Lee, like her cruel, contradictory opponent, runs away with the picture as a complete realization contemptuous abusive enemy worthy of psychological torment (.. when both are in prison, Nami's way of torturing her is sweet). My favorite scene has nothing to do with the plot, but it is so badly wrong. It contains a dog that discovers Gondo's torn arm, walks through a street and finally gets a rest to chew it!
