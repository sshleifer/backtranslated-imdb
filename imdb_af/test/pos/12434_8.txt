"Gaming? Nicotine? Fisticuffs? We are moving in a descending spiral of injustice!" So says the head of St Swithen's on the inspection of the master's communal at Nutbourne. The faculty and students of St Swithen were ordered to share facilities at Nutbourne to avoid German bombs during World War II. Then there's the master's library. "The diary of Samuel Pepys? Shortened ... Well, it's something to be grateful for. What is here? The Memoirs of Casanova? Wasn't that the book we caught? Jessica James read in the cupboard? Decameron Nights What ever this place may or may be, it's not the place to bring gently carried girls! "<br /> <br /> Yes, a terrible mistake has been made by the Ministry of Education. Nutbourne is a school for boys. St Swithen's is a school for girls. And what makes this one of the best after-WWII British comedies, Nutbourne's headmaster is Wetherby Pound ... played by Alastair Sim, while St Swithen's chieftain Muriel Whitchurch is ... played by Margaret Rutherford. <br /> <br /> "St Swithen's?" says dam. "You shouldn't say yours is a school for boys and girls?" He asks one of the early girls. "Only girls" she says cheerfully. "Does that mean, sir," asked one of Nutbourne's teachers, "we expect 100 young girls?" "This means that the ministry has not only made the mistake of sending a school here, but it is guilty of a terrible sexual disorder!" <br /> <br /> See Margaret Rutherford's Miss. Whitchurch, as positive and immovable as a battleship, plans to make the best of it by, if possible, taking over Nutbourne quickly. Alastair Sim's Pound is excited about his big bald head and is determined to save his school. In the meantime, there are 100 young girls and 170 young boys being fed, and there are places for them to sleep (along with all their teachers). The cooks and caretakers, totally tackled, get out. Miss. Whitchurch and her girls are, however, on the cooking tasks. "Come on, Angela," she said to one girl trying to stir something in a big pot, "didn't you make porridge before?" "Yes, but no one ever needed it to eat it." "It's a defeatist attitude, my dear. Stir it well and don't be afraid." <br /> <br /> Things are hardly going to happen when Pond discovers that four governors of a school he hopes to lead arrive at any moment to see for themselves how good Nutbourne is. And me. Whitchurch learns that four wealthy and influential parents have just arrived to see how their daughters in the new boy are doing, they are telling - amenities. The only solution? Miss. Whitchurch and Vond, their teachers and their students, have changed a class of classes to the notion that Nutbourne has no girls and that St Swithen's have no boys. After the parents checked a dorm and went to a class, the girls in the beds came down and the boys who got away in the beds entered the governors. The boys are seen in rugby and, as soon as the governors turn their backs, the goal posts are taken, nets for lacrosse are erected, and then the parents walk over to notice the girls. One parent mocks her daughter in a science class, then she later sees her in a choral practice, then moments later ... "There is Angela again," she says to me. Whitchurch. "Why is it," she replied, encouraging the parents to avoid the governors who were just around the corner. "The child is fairly commonplace." <br /> <br /> When we leave Nutbourne, everything is discovered. The students are grinning. The teachers are dazed (except for two who kiss.) The Education Department has just sent several busless students. The parents are speechless, but the governors are not. "We're waiting for an explanation," one says sharply. Pond keeps its head and smell. "Can't you see I'm trying to think of one." <br /> <br /> The movie moves from one complicated and ridiculous situation to another, enhanced by a very funny screenplay and two huge comic performances by Rutherford and Sim. Sim's droll exasperation and Rutherford's impeccable determination is so well-fitting that it's a pity this is the only movie they've ever made together. Joyce Grenfell, as Gossage, St Swithen's long, uncomfortable, sporty teacher, gives them some competition. If you keep your eyes open, you'll also find some entertaining reference director, Frank Launder, including a gong at Nutbourne that looks like a midget version of J. Arthur Rank's, a fine echo of the harder theme of The Third Man and a shot stolen from David Lean's Oliver Twist, except this time, the little boy is going to hold his paw in and say, "Please, sir, I don't want any more." <br /> <br /> Frank Launder and his partner, Sidney Gilliat, were responsible for some of the best films produced in Britain during the Thirties, Fifties, and Fifties. They wrote, produced and directed, sometimes one, sometimes the other. Somehow, they were responsible for such top-quality movies as Green for Danger (with a masterly drumming performance by Sim). I see a Dark Stranger, The Lady Vanishes, Night Train to Munich, Wee Geordie, The Belles of St Trinian's, The Rake's Progress and many others. With the happiest days of your life, Launder wrote and directed while both were produced. This is one of their best.
