Warm sad movie depicting archangel Michael as a brawling, overweight, cigarette smoker, who likes dancing and cavort with the opposite sex. He does have a good side, as he strives to rectify things in the lives of some burnt-out losers before he is recalled in heaven. Funny, well-played movie; very pleasant, though somewhat irreverent.
