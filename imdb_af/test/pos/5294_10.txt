I heard about this anime from the anime legend Hayao Miyazaki, and I wanted to see it. But I was fortunate enough to use the movie online on YouTube; After watching the movie, I knew it was another Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli classic. <br /> <br /> Inspired by my favorite fairy tale, The Little Mermaid, this movie is about a 5-year-old boy named Sosuke and his relationship with a goldfish princess, whom he called Ponyo, to become human and to be with Sosuke. I won't give you more details, you'll see the movie for yourself. So overall one of the best animated movies ever made, with lots of fantasy, adventure and humor ... I loved it!
