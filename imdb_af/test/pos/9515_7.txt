Another end to the world movie compared to the mutilated "Day After Tomorrow". To the same structure as DAT, but with a distinct Japanese style. How are you? It depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. <br /> <br /> I found the little man to make what makes this movie compelling for most of the 2+ hours. Also the regular title cards that some of the science explain. The effects are probably the best I have seen in a Japanese movie and they compare very well with anything from Hollywood. Many of the ram genera are really awful even though the human massacre is usually on the screen. And this is one of the disadvantages. While the terror of thousands of on-screen deaths, as in the recent "World War, may be too overwhelming, we also don't really get a sense of the chaos of a whole nation crumbling in the sea. Some scenes are touching The chaos, but mostly, this part of the story is hardly touched, but unfortunately this movie works on many levels and is much more realistic than DAT, it's up to the end. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately story depends on one click-plot device and another plot device that would be threatened by Gorath in the 1960s Japanese Earth, after the fairly good science and mostly realistically tackling the disaster, makes it a bit disappointing The sudden don't stop the movie for a pop love song either (unless you like the song) .This made the "exciting" a bit of a drag for me. <br /> <br /> The overall direction is Good and the art design is excellent, both are good too.
