Created the same year as the first Lumiere movies, it's a lot more dramatic than the brothers tried until next year's "Niagara". The surviving picture is very rough, but it only contributes to Turnes' visual violence, as big water rises against a igneous pole and seems to devour the camera, the viewer. <br /> <br /> If you look at some of these early shorts in chronological order, and try to enter into the minds of the times, there is a further shock in the fact that, unlike a single window set up by the Lumieres, this film contains a modification to me at all, was as slim as the razor in 'Un Chien Andoulu'. <br /> <br /> Contrary to the mono-vision of the Lumieres films, Paul opens up the possibility of multiple perspectives that release the viewer from the power of nature, the elimination of his understanding in a way that the Lumieres could never. The second shot has a similar impact to that of Niagara, but is less frightening because we endangered the danger. In a film such as 'L'Arroseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du Bebe' nature is indifferent and powerful, uncontrollable by the camera. Basic film grammar puts an end to his rule.
