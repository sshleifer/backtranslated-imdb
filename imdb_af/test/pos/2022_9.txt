The other night I watched this movie, and I have to admit it was probably the best movie of this generation. It seems to me that I wasn't born until 1988, but I can relate to this movie, as Cary Grant may have an STD, or Burt Reynolds, a burnout. Marky Mark did not notice in unshakiness after his brief stint in New Kids on the Block, which I would refer to as "the best band in the world (aka BBW). As it is, a morality story about color" trannies " a 'poop', so beware! I love everybody and continue to support Marky Msrk because he now needs more than ever, he is the only boy who survived the De-sharted.
