Running Out of Time rests somewhere in the middle of Johnny To's canon, in the "solid good" category. As a crime thriller, it's not terribly original or overwhelming and the action scenes won't blow you away, but it has something else to do. It's a Johnny To movie, but it should. <br /> <br /> Andy Lau has 72 hours to live. He decides to play a strange cat-and-mouse game with a HK police hostage negotiator, played by Lau Ching Wan. It's the plot in a nutshell. Over and above low coils and turns that keep all the events interesting. It occasionally becomes annoying for the sake of their sake, but never lets it be the best. Just like Johnny To is about to surrender a smooth and well-done crime fly (what we see it is a dozen), he slips into pieces that bring Running Out of Time to life as a full emotional experience , which provides the soul and heart to the well-oiled skeleton. <br /> <br /> The concepts of synchronism and minimalism (staples in his work) are being explored in great effect here. Always subtle, let the images speak for themselves, give them time to develop with long tasks and slow tracking, an exemplary cut to the score, that's all here. A little love story in a bus between Andy Lau and a girl is one of the highlights of the movie and part of the "heart" I'm talking about. So simple yet so powerful. It also builds up Lau's and Lau Ching Wan's car screens and bowling cream. <br /> <br /> But something stops me from claiming. Running Out of Time is a masterpiece. In addition, all the abilities and craftsmanship have a notch, but it can be too thin or tender. When he's good, he's really good. There is even an isolated moment of pure luster that is just right for them and gives the rest of the movie a bittersweet aftertaste. I'm convinced that if he puts his heart on it, he can make a very good movie. As it is, it is still one of its flawed but enjoyable movies. Under the smooth HK style, it's the black humor and warm drama that makes it a compelling movie. Usually look.
