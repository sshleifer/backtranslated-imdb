I really like the movie "JOE." It's really a cult class among some age groups. <br /> <br /> The producer of this movie is a personal friend of mine. He is my Stepsons father-in-law. He lives in Manhattan's western side and has a Bungalow. in Southampton, Long Island. His son-in-law lives next door to the Bungalow. <br /> <br /> Currently he does no Producer, but dabbles in a business with HBO movies. <br /> <br /> As a person, Mr. Gil is a true gentleman and I wish he would continue in the production venture making move.
