This movie is really worth seeing. Robin Tunney is performing and Henry Thomas proves that he is one of those rarities, the child's actor, who becomes a true actor. The characters are perfectly drawn, and in the wrong hands because of their depth they could have been unconvincing - but all the actors are simply amazing. The movie of this movie must be accompanied by that of "Girl, Interrupted" (both movies accidentally die the brilliant Clea Duvall). The score and music selections fit perfectly, and there is a lot of action to keep the movie from becoming a character study. If you want the story, you won't find it in this review, but I'll say the climax will haunt you for a long time.
