For those who are unfamiliar with Paddy Chayefsky, this is a very good introduction. While Chayefsky includes the reality behind the myths of many things, including medicine, this work is surprisingly prophetic of the way medicine goes today, two decades after the film was made and more than a decade after its death. In addition, some insights into Chayefsky's philosophy of life are generally also part of the film. The 20th century may be the first and last century of the United States in the history of the world. If it appears that the contribution to the arts by the United States was in the dimension of the film, this is an excellent example of that art.
