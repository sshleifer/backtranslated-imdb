"Icky Flix" is an excellent starting point for anyone with even a vague interest in the residents. Most of their classic videos are present (though "Earth vs. Flying Saucers" and "Do not Cruel" are missing), and the "concentrates" of their various CD-ROM projects offer exciting looks at how the beds are. Spending all their time since realizing that MTV was no longer in heavy rotation (or even video duration). <br /> <br /> All the videos on this compilation feature are striking images and idiosyncratic music (with a choice of original tracks and new ones). And two of them - the Third Reich a 'Roll' and 'One Minute Movies' - are in the Museum of Modern Art's permanent collection. Watch this DVD and find out why.
