It's an excellent movie, but Momento (Nolan's other big budget movie) is much better. I would recommend watching people at Momento and if they want, see this movie. The film is shot in black and white. I was a little annoyed at first, but once in the movie you understand, black and white are the best way to see the movie. It is extremely gripping and fairly easy to understand, although the way it is made is extremely clever. Elements of the storyline I think are a bit foolish, but the movie is definitely worth a second show. To declare the film has a clever plot, clever twists and turns, very good acting and taking into account the budget of the movie, I have to say it's pretty amazing.
