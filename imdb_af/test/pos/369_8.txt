I was lucky enough for this movie to come on TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It is quite difficult to find, despite being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which have repeated Hitchcock. First, the end is a bit too neat and "perfect". In the last few scenes, up to the last five minutes, there is an amazing amount of tension; then, the five minutes just fix everything perfectly ... very unsatisfactory. The end is also too dramatic for a Hitchcock movie. He is, and will always be, the master of tension ... why would he end up at something as low as a cheap action series for the end? Apart from the few shortcomings, the movie is huge. The plot is excellent; one of the best and most universal ever. The theme? Simple. You meet a stranger. A perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you ... you know you have someone you want (if nothing else, unknowingly) is dead. The catch? He asks you to do the same for him ... will you accept this bizarre but ingenious arrangement? You are apparently suspicious, and so is he. Yet no one knew you the victim. And you don't know each other, either ... you're just "strangers on a train". Brilliant concept, and one that can have just about every person. The pacing is good, you never lose interest or patience. The cinematography is good, but not as good as in other, better Hitchcock movies. The acting is flawless. The characters are well written, credible and realistic. Hitchcock uses the same elements he often uses; the dominant mother, the mother's boy, etc. The film is very good, but it just feels a bit watery. It didn't go that familiar extra mile that made it good. It has stopped before the line is transferred between what is common and what dares. This is the primary reason why the film is not good, but remains mostly good, with the potential to be more than that. The end leaves you dissatisfied and disappointed. But everything that leads to the end is very good, so the film still gets a profit of 8/10. Good, but not good. Any fan of Hitchcock should see this, as it is among his best ... somewhat far below the list, but still there. I recommend this to any fan of Hitchcock. 8/10
