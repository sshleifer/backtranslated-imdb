Well, I have to say I had the chance to see this show here in Philadelphia, PA, once in June of 06. And I really loved it. My favorite Madonna watch was the 1990 Blond Ambition Tour. This is for me 'MADONNA' Now that she is a mother of 3, she needs to change something to adapt to motherhood, and I totally agree, this is a classic Madonna concert, I wish "live to tell" has not been edited, we have seen the body fall from buildings. At 911 we can see a woman on the cross ... anyway I look forward to the release of this tour on DVD and hope it is the whole show unchanged and with a lot of bonus material, she is an artist of all time, the best out there ... and still above and going strong - long life MADONNA!
