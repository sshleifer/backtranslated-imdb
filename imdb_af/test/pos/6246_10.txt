"Tourist Trap" is a really spooky low budget horror movie that will surely satisfy horror fans. It contains a lot of strange atmosphere and there are some rather unpleasant moments of total fear and fear. Some scenes are bizarre, for example, there is one scene when Chuck Connors sits down to eat with a mannequin that comes to life and starts talking to him before his head falls. There are many gore, but the violence is pretty strong for PG-rated horror film. The dolls look very sinister and The climax is frightening. David Schmoeller came back to make several other genre films, including Crawlspace, Puppet Master and Netherworld. Another "Tourist Trap" is definitely his best horror movie, so if you want to be scared, give this little one a glimpse. <br /> <br /> Rated PG for short nudity, violence and profanity.
