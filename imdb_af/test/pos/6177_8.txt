I am Czech and soldiers (not just pilots) who escaped Czechoslovakia after Nazi invasion in 1939 and fought abroad, are true heroes and brave men in our history for me. This film by the director of Oscar winner Kolya (1996) is a tribute to these men. It is the first large-screen film about Czech-Protective World War II soldiers since "Nebesti jezdci" (1968). I think "Dark Blue World" is a good movie - good acting, good special effects, nice music etc. Film is half in English and some actors are British. But the biggest thing about this movie is it's pure existence. It is a good chance to show people around the world (and also for many people in Czech Republic ...) that Czechoslovakian role in World War II was not only an occupied country but as an active member of the Allied campaign. <br /> <br /> Leading characters are older and wiser Frantisek and young Karel. They escaped together from Czechoslovakia, they fly in the same squadron and they fell in love with the same woman ... Maybe it's a clich√©, but fortunately this story is not so aggressive and is in good balance with other scenes (including great dogfights). I don't want to compare "Dark Blue World" with "Pearl Harbor", someone will love PH and someone will love DBW. But if you like happy ends, DBW is not for you. So, I think it's a very good movie for anyone who likes these stories and a very good movie who wants to get to know this chapter of Czechoslovakian history. <br /> <br /> VAT, main theme "Dark Blue World" comes from Czech 30 and 40's composer Jaroslav Jezek. He wrote this theme when he lost his eyes.
