Another slider on the radar of most people. This little B-crafted jewel is so full of new ideas in an old genre and so totally refreshing and inventive that a horrible feeling about the lack of cojones in today's cinema is overwhelmed by your body. The final set is so innovative in its environment and style that it all previews from Tarantino to John Woo. Oh, and if you think "dying lines" are all cliche, wait for the dying line of FF. A piece of dialogue that tore you down with laughter will take your heart. A real pleasure. Find it and see it. You won't be sorry.
