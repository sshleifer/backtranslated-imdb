This is one of Barbara Stanwyck's previous films and it certainly has an unconventional theme. She makes money by dancing with men at a dance hall. She doesn't really like the job, but it's a life. Her boyfriend looks like a pretty old man, but she is also pursued by the rich old Ricardo Cortez. Well, after she married, it seems that her "nice guy" seems to be a thief, greasy weasel and a rich Cortez. By the end of the film, Barbara had just had enough, as any SANE woman of this terrible marriage would. <br /> <br /> In the 1920s and early 30s, Hollywood did almost everything they wanted and some of their films had themes or scenes that would surprise many today - such as nudity, adultery and bad language. While TEN CENTER A DANCE is not a blatant example of this morality, it has a theme that would never have been allowed after the hardened Production Code was created and enforced, which began in 1934. In some respects the Code was great. , parents don't have to worry about what their children have seen in movies (such as nudity in BEN HUR, 1925). However, it also tends to over-salt some of the movies - and there was no way this particular movie could be made and approved, as it glorified the divorce - a serious no-no 1934 and beyond. It's really a shame because I don't think TEN CENTS A DANCE was bad at discussing it - especially since star (Barbara Stanwyck) was married to a clerk. Still, the movie can't be the case. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is interesting and enticing. Plus, it was good and fit its relatively short-term time. Give this one a look. <br /> <br /> FYI - Unfortunately, Ricardo Cortez was not Spanish, but changed his name due to possible prejudice because he was Jewish. He was an excellent leader of his time, but today everything is forgotten.
