So the Korean is now beating American horror movie. But they do it with style. DOLL MASTER is a close copy of PUPPETMASTER and DOLLS, and even a small child goes for it. Several young adults are invited to attend a special event at a gallery filled with dolls, just to find they are targets of a fiery spirit. The dolls come to life and do some nasty things for the kids. The gore level is pretty high, photography and set design and production values ​​are the first time, the acting is not that bad, and the scares are definitely there. DOLL MASTER may not be in the same league with a LANGUAGE OF TWO SUSERS or even DEATH FRIEND, but it is close. Give it a watch. You won't be disappointed.
