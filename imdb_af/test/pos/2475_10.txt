Opera Death Camp: Right Right, Right Now! <br /> <br /> Ten years ago, I read that a very special movie is about the polarization of our society. A certain Peter Watkins was the author. His photo was performed by some non-professional actors, citizens like you and me? and others. The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic. Was it a movie, a documentary? Both actually. <br /> <br /> Over the years, I realized how difficult it was to find it. Maybe I should? Anyway, this is another old story. I saw it for a short while. Totally impressive. My very favorite art scene: Penalty Park is his name. I love this "docu-fiction", this "truecastmovie", this "reality show fiction", ever. After all the shock movies I've seen, I get the best with this strong and intense cinematography experience. I found a masterpiece. There is plenty on the net to know many things about the movie. It's even for sale on DVD, with additional stuff. The only words I want to add are about my own experience with this movie. I can trust such a sincere and devoted artistry about people and people, those who act directly, act or watch. A cinema that is simply a real human experience within an art adventure? or the opposite. <br /> <br /> So I'm not talking about all the "mucs" we can see on TV, especially the "real'shity show" which is interesting but used to the concepts of people who play themselves. . in a stupid and perverse way. In Punishment Park, we can see real individuals living as they are. We only set them in a very specific context, with a few rules to follow, and let them be what they want to be. It's a kind of therapy, a way of 'individualizing' for those in the movie and also for the active spectators in front of screens. Then the director's touch ends with a short and sweet apocalypse film, a desperate scream, a Death Camp Opera, where some people are going to the illegal trials. Penalty Park is for those who want to grow. See this movie and get the opportunity to choose your own morality. Grow and harmonize with it! If you can feel it! If you can see it !! In my case, Punishment Park is always in me, with all my love, consciousness and will.
