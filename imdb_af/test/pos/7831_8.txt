Ladies and gentlemen, we really got a winner here. Actually, we don't, but boy is this movie an often hilarious and always entertaining horrible story of a stinker. Poor Alma (quotes Julia Ruiz) suffers from an ancient Mayan curse that causes deadly poisonous snakes to grow inside her body. Alma and her infamous shaman-man Brujo (Alby Castro, who overworked feverishly eye-catching intensity), are quiet on a Los Angeles-bound train. Of course, a lot of deadly vipers are lost so they can terrorize the foolish variety of passengers. The Mallachi Brothers, who are working on an absurd script by Eric Fosberg, treat the ridiculous prescription straight, creating a wonderful piece of nice cheesy cheese. The ferocious CGI effects, the pathetically fearless common variety of Gardner snakes (there are terrifying rattle sounds added to the soundtrack to enter them with dull feel of otherwise non-existent threat), the speed pass, the total lack of tension or momentum , the obvious tragic stage-bound train set, and especially the simply amazing "you have to kiddin"! Over-the-top preposterous end, everyone is really wonderful in their very shaky horror. Better yet, we also have a game name (like lame) that is called by name, a nice smithy of nice, free women's nudity, a funky hum'n'shiver score and very gross and grotesque makeup -up f / x. Bonus points for the fact that the sign is annoyingly scary girl being eaten by a large reptile and that the stoner engineer caught is smoking out of a hollow bulb (!?). An absolute gut-buster from a kitsch howler.
