Simple entertainment feature of Nick Park and the company that has such films as King Kong and The Wolf Man, has Wallace and Gromit as rabbit security, finding it difficult to solve a major problem in their town. A giant rabbit is eating the vegetable crops of the citizens! What makes it even worse is that the big vegetable festival is about to begin and the citizens have all prepared diligently to win the prize. Worse still, Wallace is the reason for the whole vegetation. He invented a new invention to use his brainwaves to try to break the trapped rabbits into the aberrant vegetable crops. What is happening is catastrophic because there are types of hybrid rabbits in the process. And it has more to do with Wallace than he could ever have imagined. It will be his loyal (and surprisingly intelligent) and fast-paced Gromit dog to save the day. <br /> <br /> It's a clever and imaginative effort by the crew behind other Oscar winning clay games. starring Wallace and Gromit. Seeing good clay-like clay is refreshing in the light of the CGI boom that recently had some rude price, as the industry spits more and more mediocre products. Here we get a complete feature with humorous humor and some wild stunts with great animation, not to mention gut-busting sight gags.
