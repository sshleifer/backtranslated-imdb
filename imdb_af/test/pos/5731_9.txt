This program was very interesting. The way the program is displayed has made it more and more interesting. String theory is also very interesting to listen to as well. For me, the whole three hours was worth it. I enjoyed listening to the ideas given by the physicists. Extra dimensions make the mind really angry. If you have the chance, look at this wonderful documentary.
