I have no idea how the budget was on this movie, but whatever it was, made it work! I saw movies that spend 100x the amount (Pearl Harbor someone?) And sucked 200x badly. This movie has it all. David "Makin 'It" Naughton starring Adam, an average college student wrapped up in a game called the Great AllNighter "managed by Leon! This old rock!" A "genius" with nothing better to do than to come up with an extensive game for a lot of people to play in. But he not only chooses his friends, he has a team of Jocks, nerds, greasy , average kids and, of course, Flounder's team that are the bad guys, Adam is not the altruistic hero with no flaws. He treats Alex P. as crap. a jerky stomach. The jocks play dirty, but so do everyone! This movie dresses! The scene at the PBR factory? Classic! "Johnny's Obese Male Child?" Can you write a better idea? These things are gold Jerry! GOLD! Maybe I'm from another generation, but I like movies that are outrageous, but still have roots in reality, this never happened ... but it can. Eeee e-Gypt .... EEEE. ... Easter Bunny .... Easter Parade! Oh and look for a young Paul Rubens still busy with the Pee wee character PS That Devra Clinger Was / is HOT! actress not to work in Hollywood anymore. See this movie!
