It's a surprising movie that will keep you in the chair waiting for the last minute of the movie. On your jumps is a nice taste of: ... I want more! There are many good actors, Portuguese actors who have a lot of experience in the world of theater and movies. It's not a million euro budget movie, but we can still see the destruction of a car in an excellent perspective you get in the movie. If you have the opportunity to get your hands on this great movie, don't wait another minute. Just watch the movie! I think Portuguese film increases the quality. Watch out for Spanish producers ... The Portuguese have high quality standards. I've seen the movie and I'm waiting for more ...
