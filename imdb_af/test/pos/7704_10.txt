I watch this movie in horror in my heart because my mother was also a cracking head like Michelle. I wondered where Michelle is now. There were times when I had to get my mom in places where I was scared to be, but more scared to leave her there! To see how Michelle acted like that made me wonder where she slept all that time? I looked in hope, it was never so bad for my mother! and what I want to know is ... where did Matt and Tracy "tear what picks up"?! The worst scene for me was to shoot Tracy in an old navy dressing room! you never try clothes for you and it looks like everyone else except Michelle has AIDS !! where do they know 2008? can we get an update ??????????
