Enjoy this movie that is all about an average family, so it turns out. Ben Travis, (Jeff Daniels) plays the role of a father who is only interested in a boy who is great at swimming and winning a lot of trophy, but he hates it a lot and even his father. Ben has little to say to his other son, Tim (Emile Hirsh) and even his daughter, Penny, (Michelle Williams) who is happy to be away from college. The mother, Sandy, (Sigourney Weaver) tries to keep the family together and even she is completely ignored by her husband. A very tragic event happens in the family that changes everyone's personality, young and old, starts drinking drugs, smoking pots and all the time at parties. There is even a homosexual scene and at the same time there is even room for comedy and of course there is a very dark secret that Sandy Travis eventually tells her son Tim.
