I'm not sure where to start. In short, it was a disappointing movie. After learning the novella, I was aware that it would be a difficult story to change into a movie. The movie has some interesting lines (mainly between Alfred and Aschenbach), but it does not represent the debate on art that basically forms the novella. <br /> <br /> For one I expected a parent Aschenbach and a younger Tadzio. In the book, Tadzio is fourteen, but he is described as pure, ideal, innocent, while in the film a series of sexuality and a plague. He is an accomplice to Aschenbach, he always looks back at him, almost challenging. In the book, Aschenbach looks at the boy. As for Aschenbach, I suggested something closer to the professor-turned clown in The Blue Angel (based on a story by Thomas Mann's brother Heinrich) than that forty-year-old with little gray hair. In all fairness, I think Dirk Bogarde did a good job, but someone else had to do it, or he should have made it to the beginning. <br /> <br /> I know the discovery of homosexuality is important to the story, but the film minimizes the talk about art and duality between the Apollonian and Dyonic inspiration and rather focuses on Aschenbach's obsession with Tadzio and does not justify this. I like the fact that Mahler's music was used because he eventually inspired Mann to write his story. I'm not sure Aschenbach has changed into a musician, was a particularly good move. Or the creation of Alfred I don't remember in the book. <br /> <br /> And one thing that really got me was the sound and how it didn't fit with the actors' lips. I wondered if it was bought because I expected it to be in Italian. But then I remember that every Italian movie I watched had this problem. It just bothered me because these directors (Fellini is the other person I think) are supposed to personalize perfection in Italian theater, and here their characters are laughing without sound, then you hear a noise that doesn't match their faces (I think of the scenes when Aschenbach almost collapses and starts laughing. This scene could have been the strongest, but it was annoying).
