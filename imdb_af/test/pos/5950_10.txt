This is the latest entry in the long series of films featuring the French agent, O.S.S. 117 (the French answer to James Bond). The series was launched in the early 1950s and generated at least eight films. No one has ever been released in the US. 'O..S.117: Cairo, Nest Of Spies' is a lazy little comedy that doesn't ... need to be repeated, taken too seriously. Our protagonist finds himself in the middle of a spy in Egypt (with Morroco standing in Egypt) to find out about a lost friend. What follows is the standard James Bond / Inspector Cloussou type of antics. Although our husband is something of an open xenophobe, sexist, homophobe, it is treated as pure farce (as I said, do not take it seriously). Although there is some rough language and cartoon violence, it's basically good for older kids (ages 12 and up). As mentioned earlier in the subject line, just sit back, pass the popcorn & just enjoy it.
