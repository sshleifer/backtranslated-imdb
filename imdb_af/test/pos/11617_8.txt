"Subconscious cruelty" should be one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. "Salo" and "Cannibal Holocaust" didn't bother me so much, but there is a strange psychological element of "subconscious cruelty". This film captures your subconscious with shocking taboos, surreal footage and one of the most disturbing movie scores and sound designs. Repulsive at times; Yes, but its visual flair can be compared to Avant Gard directors such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Dusan Makavejev and David Lynch. Take the extreme elements of the 4 directors and throw in the graphic violence of a movie by Luico Fulci, and you might guess what you're interested in. <br /> <br /> The movie is divided into 4 parts. The first part "The Ovarian Eye" is really short. A narrator tells us about the parts of the brain and its functions. Then a naked woman gets her stomach open and an eyeball is pulled out. The second part "Human Larvae" is kind of like the movie "Eraserhead" but with incest. It's about a man's sexual obsession with his pregnant sister. Where Are Women When You Need It? The third part is my absolute favorite. It reminds me of "Begotten" and Jame's Broughton's 1972 short film "Dreamwood". In this segment, people have sex with the earth. People burst bloody holes in the ground, girls masturbating with tree branches. The branches bloom when broken. Look in horror as a man gives fellatio to a knife protruding from a woman's vagina. These people really know how to get in touch with nature. <br /> <br /> The last part of the movie is the most disturbing and sometimes it borders on hardcore pornography. This part of the film made me think of Jodorowsky's "The Holy Mountain", "Sweet Movie" and "Cannibal Holocaust". I have never been disturbed in my life by what I have seen. A business man gets his private apart by fishhook. Yuck and Ouch! Two women urinate on a Christian figure and continue to eat cannibalist like community bread and sodomize him with a tree branch. Poor old man. The last part was so extreme that I would see my eyes again or slightly fast forward if I ever watch the movie again. Karim Hussien and Mitch Davis are of course very talented, To think they did the project early in the 20's. Hussein led the Tarkovsky influenced "Ascension" (2002), which is a much better film, and he writes the script for Nacho Cerda's post-dark horror masterpiece "The Abandoned". "Subconscious Cruelty" is a fascinating and disturbing journey; with images coming from the unthinkable world of everyday human thoughts. Well, kind of.
