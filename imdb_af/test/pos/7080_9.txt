"One True Thing" is a very quiet film that was opened in autumn 1998 to a glowing review but a soft box. It tells the mutilated story of Ellen (Renee Zellweger), a workaholic who is forced to go back home to take care of her terminally ill mother (Meryl Streep) so that her father, William Hurt, can manage his academic department . These terms are common. The power of "One True Thing" lies in the way the actors increase their characters above the Hollywood clich√© area. <br /> <br /> Stripe is Kate, the perfect homemaker whose ability to lift a room with her charm is evident from her opening styles at a costume party celebrating Hurt's birthday. But Ellen has never been near her mother, and since graduating from the University of Harvard, she has a certain judgment. Ellen thinks her mother is a simplistic airhead. On the other hand, while she admires her dad, who shares a special passion: Write. Ellen writes for an aggressive New York firm and is almost sad when her last piece is torn by Hurt. It looks like it's a very lonely figure. <br /> <br /> To get to the point, if Kate gets sick, Ellen's perspectives change and she grows closer to her mother and more away from her father. Hurt excuses not to be there when the family needs him the most, and Ellen accepts that he has a relationship. Meanwhile, she gave up her desk at work to spend time with her mother's cult group The Minnies and also to learn that her mother is not as weak as she initially accepted. <br /> <br /> Without giving away too much, "One True Thing" is a masterpiece in character study. Strike once again into a beautiful show, this time working on a subtle level that starts slowly but ends with a brilliant speech about the vows of marriage. Streep earned her eleventh Oscar nomination for this show. Bad is also convincing as the father who carries a secret that is not revealed until the end time. But this is Renee Zellweger who steals this movie. Forget "Chicago", "Cold Mountain", "Bridget Jones's Diary" or whatever you've seen her and rent this movie. She is remarkable in it. Zellweger works in her character's bitter grudge to understand her parents and manages a realistic depiction of a young woman fighting to keep her lip while she shouts.
