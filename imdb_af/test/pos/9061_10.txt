Who would be able to handle a thought suicide in a way shown by everyone? I saw the movie at SXSW with his premier and it seems to be the best movie there. Yes, it is skewed and it is bizarre, but it makes sense in the world creating the movie maker (Michael Parness). If you didn't laugh (most of them did it), you just didn't get it and it was a shame. In particular, Guillermo Diaz as Hector steals a lot of scenes and that chemistry between Natasha Lyonne and David Krumholtz is intense. The movie reminds one of Harold and Maude, but not really, it takes one bizarre spin to the other, and they all make sense in this crazy mixed world in which we all live. I did (as most did) for the Q&A Then it was wonderful that the same things I thought in my mind why things happened were the reasons they did. I don't think you can say very badly about the movie unless you didn't get it. I think I got it and it looked like most of them did the same. The movie is a suicidal comedy, but it has a lot of heart, a lot of laughter and a lot of hope, but it does not detract from the suicide bombers either. A nice little movie that needs attention when it gets a release, which hopefully will happen rather than later.
