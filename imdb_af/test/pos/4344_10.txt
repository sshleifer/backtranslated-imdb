One of the most wonderful movies ever made. The actions of Charles Buchinski (later known as Bronson) are simply outstanding. This is the crown of the director of Winner, who has often quoted himself and said it was his masterpiece. The plot has been copied many times, but it has never been followed. Wildey J. Moore, the gun manufacturer, has often claimed his brand's growth since the mid-80s to DW3, and rightly so. It's not just a movie, it's art that many generations will admire and appreciate. Although this film has never been fully appreciated in the US, it has found a major role in Europe and Asia. The film is regularly shown at film schools and is still a popular hit in student clubs across Europe. All in all, a true classic.
