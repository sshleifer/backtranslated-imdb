The movie is not that bad, because people want to make you believe it. <br /> <br /> What is the reason why so many people hate this movie? Is it because Laurel & Hardy's last one is not their best? Or is it because of the lack of Laurel & Hardy tribal money? Or because it's not made by the Hal Roach studios or 20th Century Fox? <br /> <br /> Definitely true that this movie is not a successful attempt to revive and bring Laurel and Hardy to the '50s. It's also definitely true that the movie is far from their best, but honestly, the movie is still entertaining, and this movie is also far from their worst. Not the most worthy 'goodbye' movie imaginable, but an entertaining and enjoyable goodbye. Both retired with movies after completing this one. <br /> <br /> The movie still contains some good slapstick moments and the chemistry between Laurel & Hardy is still very much present. It also makes this movie better than most of their 40's movies. Another surprise is that slapstick humor is still as big as it does, as the days of slapstick comedy have been over since the 30's. <br /> <br /> The story may not have been so entertaining and it has too many sidekicks and characters, resulting in the movie losing its focus on boys. A shame because they are still the one who really wears the movie. <br /> <br /> Sorry to see in which poor shape Stan Laurel was when he made this movie. He looked really sick and old, which of course he was. He was over 60 years old. But after an operation he recovered fully and lived another 15 years before dying in 1965, 8 years after his good friend Oliver Hardy. <br /> <br /> An entertaining, but not perfect, goodbye to the boys, Laurel & Hardy and the end of 3 decades of fun, humorous, quality hilarious movie entertainment still watched by people around the world be loved. <br /> <br /> 7/10
