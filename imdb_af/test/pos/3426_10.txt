The Truth and Reconciliation Process in South Africa is an important and probably unique human experiment. This movie is an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing South Africa. I believe everyone should see this movie, as I think few people outside South Africa understand his past and are being tried in the Truth and Reconciliation process. Almost every country has a part of its own history that is still a source of continued hatred and bitterness. We all need to understand how to deal with the past. What happens in South Africa, we must all lead. I found it credible, moving and sometimes upset. There were no outstanding acting appearances, but it added to the strength of the story. The BBC once again had a complex subject and eliminated a top-class movie.
