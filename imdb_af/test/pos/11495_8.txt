I get the feeling that Lisa Krueger is easy to watch. I found her first film, 1996's Manny and Lo, personally to be a wonderful detailed character study and the performances were uniformly wonderful (with special credit to Mary Kay Place). The film played and disappeared in large urban centers for a week or two. One or two critics really loved it, but many regarded it as minor. Krueger's second film, Committed, was released this year (2000) (after almost two years of delays) and it also disappeared. And again critics gave the film so little and set aside the film, with most praise for Heather Graham's screen presence, but rarely her acting ability. And again, to me, Committed is a great success. I feel as if Krueger has a real voice and a personal visual style, and these are features that should not be ignored so easily, simply because she works on a very complicated cloth. <br /> <br /> The title has several meanings, but mostly it refers to Joline's (Graham's) refusal to flee her husband Carl (Luke Wilson) and leave her. She follows him from New York to El Paso and becomes one of the most attractive stalkers in recent film history. Her respect for her marriage vows leads her to Mexican mysticism and self-discovery. And yes, the plot is just as simple and so easy to ignore. Joline is, of course, the crying voice of a generation whose parents divorced at a rate that reaches about fifty percent. And to me, her personal revolution against broken promises and a legacy of fraud is quite intelligent and powerful. Trust in the belief that people just don't have enough faith in each other, Joline must inevitably discover that her beliefs are not in line with that of society as a whole. Several comments made her refer to her character as one-dimensional and I fear it is a simplistic reading of the movie. Or maybe even a wrong reading. If Joline was just an innocent, she wouldn't be interesting at all. It's the fact that she understands the world and refuses to play according to the rules of the "normals" that make her so interesting. Sociologically she is a completely deviant. <br /> <br /> Krueger sometimes falls into moments of sneaky dialogue and her direction of this movie has a rather exaggerated confidence in clouds moving across the El Paso skyline. However, her mistakes are rather scarce and in this movie, such as in Manny and Lo, it is the performances that carry the day. Graham has never been better because she never had a character that perfectly suited her like Joline. For the first time in her career, Graham seems comfortable playing an adult, even one in slightly arrested development. She carries the film perfectly. Luke Wilson and Casey Affleck (as Joline's brother) both have fine moments, such as Alfonso Arau, as a Mexican mystic and Mark Ruffalo and T-Bo, the slightly psychotic truck driver. Like in Manny and Lo, the characters are part of their environments, well-detailed completely organic creations. These characters sometimes seem meaningless, but they make sense in their context. Even Goran Visnjic, as an artist named by Joline's dedication, fits in a strange way, although his character's stranger is never discussed. <br /> <br /> For me it's a movie that gets the depth back. Another commentator here talked about the stereotypical Mexican depictions. And again I'm tempted to call it a wrong reading. Joline is seeking self-justification. She knows that her commitment is out of control, but she is looking for any spiritual way that can help her make sense. Arau's character understands that most people do not believe in him and he plays his own faith if he sees a woman who respects him. <br /> <br /> I think I can understand how this movie can be regarded as underprivileged, I simply don't agree. It is consistently funny, often hilarious, and all the characters have a great warmth. <br /> <br /> I give this one a 7.5 / 10 and if I sign here in the voice, it will go up to an 8.
