I saw this movie on PBS for the first time. Then I bought the video and watched it countless times. Every time I see it, I can get something else out of it. It is a true proof that you want to live a good life, but now the world is changing. But you don't have to be older to hold on, even the young characters, like Charlotte, don't want things to change. The overall tone and mood are excellent. The film is outstanding with all stars like Kathy Bates, Beau Bridges and Arthur Kennedy. And it's fun to see the upcoming stars before they hit more recognizable feature films, such as Kevin J. O'Connor (The Mummy) and Vincent D'Onofrio (Men in Black and Law and Criminal Intent - one of my favorite shows ). It's just one of those movies that stays with you.
