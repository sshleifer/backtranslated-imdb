"Cooley High" is one of my favorite movies ever !!! I think I spent this movie with my mom years ago the night of the night when I was little and I thought it was so funny. This film is also referred to as a "black American graffiti". Glynn Turman is great if Preach and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs are great as Preach's friend Cochise. There are also other great characters in it, and this movie packed a lot of humor into it. From the beginning of the film where Cochise goes to Preach's house to get ready for the school to the sad end of Cochise's funeral, this movie is one that will make you laugh. There are many scenes in this movie that I love very much. The scene where Pooter (another of Preach and Cochise's friends) goes with them to the zoo and the gorillas throw feces on his shirt (very rough but also funny), the first scene in the street corner cafeteria, the quarter party at this girl's home has become a disaster because of a fight, and some are great to watch. This movie even has a wonderful companion soundtrack album, packed with many wonderful Motown hits and early 60's artists. (Only 6 songs on the soundtrack were done in 75 while the rest were from the 60's). The film is mainly about two friends who dream of getting away from their poor and rough environment after high school, but their future seems almost out of reach, due to their innocent joy in a stolen car for which two other bonnets were responsible. Preach's relationship with his girlfriend, Brenda (played by Cynthia Davis), is almost endangered. Go out and rent or buy this movie, and be ready for some comic entertainment !!! Get the soundtrack too. It's also fun!
