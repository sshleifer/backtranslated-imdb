Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is an example of the French transitional philosophy. A film between the realism of post-war theater and the full-of-magic and symbolism nouvelle blurred. With some patches of American classic films (but not mimicking), the director tells us a story about love, crime and the importance of points of view. We can also find good actors (Suzy Delair is impeccable). <br /> <br /> Also interesting is how we can find aspects of this movie today. Quai des Orfèvres heritage is significant in the Woody Allen tradition. A crime situation plunged into a picturesque environment. The naïve end is also typical in Steven Spielberg's good final films. And lastly, I want to point out that the deja sensation during the photo session between Jenny Lamour (Suzy Delair) and Dora Monier (Simone Renant) in which the first confesses that she thinks her husband is unfaithful and exactly with the woman who photographs her? This scene is exactly the one between Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in Closer (Mike Nichols, 2004).
