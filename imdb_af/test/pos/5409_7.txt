The Kinks warned about media heroes. Besides the movies, most heroes are also "Ordinary people." Society requires a role play, but what happens when it reaches the parent-child relationship? Do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than the other way around? How do you give a role model, but not a role? A brilliant swimmer who hates to swim; a brilliant musician who won't play. Convincing, funny (despite portraying "serious" problems), very good multi-dimensional acting by everyone. Many plot turns fill the emotional tension. Cellulose heroes never feel pain. I never remember being disappointed in a Sigourney Weaver movie (I even kept "The Village"!).
