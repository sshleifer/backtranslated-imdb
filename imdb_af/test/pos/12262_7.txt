Broadcast News is directed by James L. Brooks (Terms of Endearment, as good as it gets) and has a good role, including William Hurt, Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter. Everyone gives a good performance, but they are too unlikely to really care for them. <br /> <br /> Some parts of the movie are really brilliant, like the prologue and the short scenes with Jack Nicholson. The main reason it doesn't quite work is that it is a movie that relies on the characters to be amusing rather than doing things with them. <br /> <br /> You can't consider it any more than a drama, but it's often too stupid to be so successful. Still, the writing makes it worth a watch. Certainly not for everyone. <br /> <br /> 7.0 out of 10
