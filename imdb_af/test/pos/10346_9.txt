A film about a talented woman struggling with a society and a love that underestimates her. The issues are subtly addressed and timeless, as many of the measured problems between men and women still exist in Dutch society today. This movie is a tribute to all modern women without staying on feminism. Not only is the story well told, the acting and the scenery are also good.
