Based on a true story. . <br /> <br /> The premise of this movie is to illustrate it through reasonably normal events, which are possible for an outward 'decent' mother to pull into heroin addiction. <br /> <br /> *** semi spoiler *** Some of the screens are pretty inaccurate - while others almost make you get the 'fix' yourself. <br /> <br /> Computer technician / graphic artist woman with good relationship with her young teenage kids in addiction to work colleague, who is a "chipper" (someone who can take and enjoy it now and then -) Spiral then in a addiction that eventually leads her to prevent "street traders" after losing contact with her steady dealer. br /> <br /> The scenes that show off and get sick are often VERY real - especially the first real 'night sweats'. Before all these events she started a relationship with a guy who just lost his wife to the bottle, and insisted he had an inner radar not to wear such women. Some radar! But after a few late upward and weird behaviors, the boyfriend challenges her to what 'is going on'. His radar starts to get more with it and demands that she empty her pocket. she hit the roof and storms. <br /> <br /> Due to the excellent and open relationship she developed before this tragedy, he is the first to find some true evidence in her pocket. He then looks at the snake for her 'stash' - apparently his sensitivity comes from schoolgirls about drug taking - and when he discovers a big stash in the bathroom, he flushes it out! NOT A HAPPY WOMAN when she takes her next bath and she 'disappears'. <br /> <br /> The child holds the one back and places it on the table. She then goes further in denial - acknowledges it and says she is no worse than baptism. <br /> <br /> The child does all the right things and calls her friends and usually puts her in a position to get clean - if you forgive the pun. <br /> <br /> The movie takes the viewer through some difficult situations where danger is not far away. <br /> <br /> Eventaully gets his help from a professional organization and cold turkey - you have to watch the movie next. . . .
