The man who knew too much (1956) is a remake of a film that Alfred Hitchcock made in England in 1934 with the same name. In my opinion, his later effort is much better. Many critics and supporters of Alfred Hitchcock will argue that the remake is mediocre and not the brand new tension of the original with Peter Lorre. In both films, the plot is essentially the same, except the original is in Switzerland and the remake in Marrakech. It tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) who holiday with their young boy and meet a suspicious man, it is very curious about their past. It just so happens, he is an agent looking for a couple involved in a plot to kill a world leader. Then he was stabbed in a Marrakesh market because he realized he was a spy and continued to fall into Stewart's arms. Died, he told him the whole story of the assassination. Separation and Day then find that another couple they met was the couple after whom the agent sought and kidnapped their son. The film features excellent performances by Stewart and Day, in a dramatic dramatic role, as well as worried and frightened parents. This film proved that Doris Day can perform in thrilling drama and carefree musical. The direction of Alfred Hitchcock is in addition. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat every minute. The scene in Albert Hall is a classic. The original is so slow and jogging. I don't know how people can compare the two. Just look at the remake and you'll enjoy it. I give the movie a 9 out of 10.
