The end of Suburbia (TEOS) is a very useful movie. It's also important and challenging. There seems to be no medium-sized ground with the film or the main source of entertainment, the anti-sprinkler Meister, James Howard Kunstler. <br /> <br /> While I'm not a big fan of New Urbanism, my criticism of this is because of its small vision. In the case of the new urban Peter Calthorpe - another praathoof - you finally hear what is a little obvious in and among the special, added TEOS clips. Calthorpe only understands peak oil. <br /> <br /> I used it as a teaching tool in economic classes to get the importance of land as a production factor - a fact that has long been declined by the Neoclassical Economy - and also a means of to learn about: peak oil, our land use, global warming, our endangered food production, public transport, our compromised future. <br /> <br /> Move across South Park! .... Made by Canadian from Toronto for $ 25,000 and released in May 2004, this video sold more than 24,000 copies by October 2005. One large DVD rental company recently ordered nearly 400 more copies. <br /> <br /> The end of selling Suburbia is actually 1 1/2 years after it was released. It has also been available from one of the major online video services since September 2005. <br /> <br /> A sequel, Escape from Suburbia, is in the works. with a possible release by August 2006.
