My skateboarding career ended in 1974 when my two-by-four skateboard with steel roller skates hit a rock and I came down for days, next to the pavement outside my Boston home. By the time the roll of my arm came down, the summer was gone. <br /> <br /> But I always admired the X games types and surfers. I think I spent the first month after going to the south of California on the beaches and piers to look at the surfers, having missed my calling. It's the kind of thing you have to learn young, before the terrible senses of self-preservation and self-awareness. Or else you would be so worried that you didn't hurt or laugh, you would stop looking. like a trained bear. <br /> <br /> I always admired how a good surfer doesn't seem to care about anything, but that moment, that wave, which is experiencing. One with the power of nature. A good surfer makes it look like there's nothing else but it's right there and the way you work with it. There is a lot of Zen for me. <br /> <br /> This documentary sketch describes how some young people took the surfing concepts and expanded to skateboarding. Disasters, downgrades, low wiper curves while interacting with the cement waves under their feet. In their day and time it was all new. radical. In front of the Zephyr Skate team, the idea seemed to be as fast as you could in a straight line on a skateboard, so my long "Evel Knievel at Caesers Palace" like to dip the top step. <br /> <br /> This movie is a glance back through time, to an America before everything is marked, marked, marketed and jam-forced to our throat as "extreme". (Seriously, what is so "extreme" about Taco Bell's "Extreme Value Meal" other than the extreme danger to your colon ...) <br /> <br /> watch this movie and watch the birth of 'extreme sport'. Before the ASA was an X-games, before Boom-tree Huck-Jam, before Crusty Demons ... There were these young street hedgehogs that created extreme sports without really trying. They just did it for purity, pure pleasure, skateboarding with friends in the sun. <br /> <br /> I hope they get a cut from the "extreme" money out there. Goodness knows they don't get the credit they deserve. Maybe this movie can fix it. <br /> <br /> Excellent movie with a good soundtrack, a portrait of a Southern California, indeed an America, that no longer exists. <br /> <br /> I don't care for Sean Penn, but he does a decent job.
