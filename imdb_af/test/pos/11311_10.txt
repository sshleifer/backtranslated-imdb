Julie Brown shoots hilarious Madonna's attempt at a rockumentary with gut ripping humor and truly original and catchy songs by Madonna's own. Cinematography and sets are also. <br /> <br /> Kathy Griffin and Chris Elliott offer their own comedy injections that enhance and compliment this movie. Appearance of Bobcat Goldthwait and Wink Martindale, as themselves, is an added bonus. <br /> <br /> It's hard to see if Brown's show Madonna wants to insult or play, but I hardly think the Material Girl will find humor <br /> <br /> My favorite line: "Why You're not here (for the Philippines); everything they eat is a dog and I'm a vegetarian. "
