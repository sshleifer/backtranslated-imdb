I can't believe it's been 25 years since I first watched this story on TV. I remembered much about it and was happy to get the VHS band a few years ago. I didn't watch it again until recently. I've been watching over and over. I had to watch it 10 times in the past 2 weeks. <br /> <br /> The play is wonderful, the story is compelling and I am ashamed to say that I have not valued actor Bryan Brown's talent to date. The playful facial expressions shown in the first half - when he gave Jean the stolen medicine in Malaya is such a contrast to his very reserved and nerve body language shown in the second half: in their first drink in Caines and the tour of the house. We have to wait for the wedding reception, especially the final dance scene to see his open display of love for Jean. The same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in Malaya. Who doesn't want to be his Mrs Boong? <br /> <br /> While Joe changed from a shark, almost bigger than the figure of life in the Malaya jungle to a somewhat self-conscious average Joe in his own backyard, Jean took the opposite path; Her wartime experience gave her new confidence. She didn't waste any time and went to what she wanted. She took steps to get what she could get - just as Joe once told her. <br /> <br /> For me, all these transformations mean that it's more than a love story - it's a story of growth, courage, and fragility in life. The lawyer -Noel is both a lovely and sad figure. He also gave Jean a lot - he gave his last hope for love. In the end he did what required true love - he put her luck in front of his own. <br /> <br /> I didn't have the fight between Joe and Jean as it was in the book. I thought it was an appropriate and necessary addition, because it helped the inner struggle they had to deal with. to bridge their lives. <br /> <br /> Now, I'm older, maybe I understand life, love and loss a little better. This story touches me even deeper. <br /> <br /> But I'm surprised to see B. Brown has blue eyes in the promo photo shown on this site. He certainly doesn't have a town like Alice. Well, 25 yrs is a long time!
