It was the one movie to watch over the civil war. My aunt actually played in this movie as an extra in the Justin and Madeline wedding, and my uncle was an extra on a horse. The writing was genuine and accurate. The costumes were tastefully finished, the flow was in order and even the accents were good. I love Patrick Swayze and James Ried. They were the best 2 choices, and it even played a major supporting role. The Civil War is my favorite thing in American history, and I love movies about it. I've seen quite a few, and this movie and the sequal North and South Book 2 took the cake. If you haven't seen it, rent it. As soon as possible. It's quite an eduation.
