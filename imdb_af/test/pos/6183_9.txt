The Lubitsch's Touch is more than ever in this movie. Humor at any time and very subtle. The plot is simple, but the director likes it. The film cut is very clever and adds to the comic effect. A real piece of comedy that doesn't get so old for a XXIth century spectator. The character was fine by Gary Cooper and especially Claudette Colbert so clever and meant by this poor Micheal in the movie. She avoids every fall of her husband and turns the situation to her advantage, very funny. And no problem, with Lubitsch, there is always a happy ending. A movie for men with confidence with women. Don't let your girl watch this movie ...
