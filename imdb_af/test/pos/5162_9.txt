"With all the misery in the world, how can we not get drunk?" ?? Mia <br /> <br /> A stunning big city airplane is ominous in tackling a naval plane bombing; An irate hairdresser who responds to an observed racial blow cuts a path through a businessman's bushy hair; A man dreams that he is being dragged to an electric chair after a failed magic and a teacher breaks in front of her grade school because her husband calls her a grip. These and about fifty other vignettes are the spectrum of the utterly captivating to the wild humorous of the joyful lifting crowd, Roy Andersson's You, the Living, his first feature since his critically acclaimed as commercially unsuccessful Songs From the Second Floor. <br /> <br /> You, the Living are filled with the same kind of imaginative set-pieces as Songs, full of black humor, surreal situations and strange characters. Although a little longer and less focused than its previous work, it remains constant, Andersson's unmistakable style with its stationary camera, sterile backgrounds and precise attention to detail. If there is a theme that links the sketches together, it is that our time on Earth is limited and "tomorrow's day", so let's treat each other with kindness. Along the way we are entertained by tuba and drama music from Louisiana Brass Band, dinner guests at a banquet hall stand on their chairs singing an exciting song, and a moving train house. <br /> <br /> The emotions range from the gloom of a daughter trying to communicate with an Alzheimer's patient to a young woman's ecstasy dream of marrying an attractive guitarist named Micke. the cheering of a multitude of spectators. While there is no ongoing narrative, the theme of greed and despair appears in several sketches. has two corporate individuals and their puppy sitting on a park bench, the woman claims that no one understands or loves her, but she does not ignore the man's reassuring and reassuring words at all. <br /> <br /> There's also a solid mix of irony. While an executive lunch looks, one man tells another person on the phone that workers don't value quality and how good it is to value money and the things it can buy like good wine. However, when he does not look, a man at an adjacent table lifts his wallet from his jacket to the back of his chair. Although Andersson's cynicism is sometimes not very well hidden, you have life an underlying humanism that shows compassion for the human condition. This is a warning story that looks at the mess our people got ourselves, but suggests there is still time to reverse it, if we notice the poet Goethe's poet opening the movie, "Please the living, in your lovely warm bed, before Lethe's ice-cold wave will leak your escaping foot.
