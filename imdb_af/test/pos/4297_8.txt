I wish there were more films about middle-aged people. The intellectual journey and the twists and turns of life's moral highway make interesting shows. There is apparently another standard of judgment on women who have extramarital affairs than men. Amy Watson's hurt and humiliating behavior towards her husband looks without comment. Turn the rolls around and expect a stream of condemnation to the man. If she found her husband boring and judgmental, she could have told him so, walked away and waited for a large financial settlement at divorce. The country and London scene are wonderfully authentic and rich, while the autumn adds the most beautiful backdrop. The end is perfect, so in line with real adult life.
