I expected it to be good after seeing some other ozone's wonderful moments, and reading a lot of it ... but this movie is brilliant - clever, very bright (emotional and visual), perfect at all times. every movement is there for a reason, everything fits so closely and truly and truthfully. this is the film about beauty and innocence; about this is simplicity.
