17/02/09 "More" (1969) Dir: Barbet Schroeder <br /> <br /> For a movie that most viewers agreed on, it's pretty average, I'm impressed with the number of different interpretations offered . . I just shaved the web and I was already informed that "More" is: a 19th-century romance, a reference to the story of Icarus, an ordinary movie full of dull people and just important to Pink Floyd completed. It is fair to say, then that critical reception is mixed. I would argue that these very diverse lectures of Barbet Schroeder's 1969 legal message are proof that "More" is nothing but a pretty average movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, this is not a masterpiece either. I approached "More" like "Easy Rider" and Antonioni's "Blowup" - as a time-series movie, a snapshot of an era - despite the differences in tempo, style and content between these movies. They all have similar shortcomings - either vague or straightforward, which seem active because of reality, relaxed editing and sudden endings that leave the viewers indignant. These movies never try to be persuasive or meet the audience halfway - they are what they are, man. This in itself is not a problem as long as we are left with a memorial of experience. Fortunately, 'More' offers several real-life memorable images, sounds and suggestions to the viewer, and that's what it saves. <br /> <br /> Stefan is a young man who arrives in Paris fresh from his studies in Germany. The first part of the film follows him as he falls into a group of French hipsters, accompanying them to devastatingly cool and self-conscious parties and bursting before they meet Estelle. The two characters are sexually and romantically involved and he promises to follow her to Ibiza, against the advice of his friend Charlie. That's where the Icarus thing comes into play - she's the Sun, he's following her. You can now guess how it all ends. <br /> <br /> Ibiza is an idyll so far from the urgent urgency of the crowded Paris that the naive Stefan knows he must be a good thing. . Estelle remains unsteady and volatile and the island has a less popular underbelly. Until now, I have taken little care of one of these characters and striving to be free, but once the action is rejected, only these two are suddenly fun. At just one volatile exchange of dialogue in the remote villa in which they live, the place where their fleeting love crystallizes, I looked at a fading optimism to be totally surprised. I can't think of many other movies that did. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Stefan and Estelle is real and human, as we can see that it is from life-defining intimacy to disillusionment and cruel colds. They take many drugs and cavort naked on the terrace, rocks and beaches. Their lives revolve around nothing but each other and the beautiful Mediterranean environment. For a while their situation is at the heart of freedom, emotional openness and experience for their own sake. But Stefan is not in control, and that is the demise of more than just his future in Ibiza. <br /> <br /> Pink Floyd's score is a perfect fit for the exoticism, intimacy and vanguard of 'More'. This is one of the most memorable inclusions, along with the mosquito net around Estelle's bed, and their hallucinogenic exuberance around the windmill (which appears on the front of the soundtrack). A square in which they take acidity to escape from heroin withdrawal, illustrates the fundamental flaws of the couple - they cannot land without an accident. Maybe they came too close to what they wanted. <br /> <br /> Stefan never contacts any family or friends before arriving in Paris. We must assume they have no idea where he is. While others are coming to debauchery, excess, media and voyeurism in the presence of the culture of Cultural Culture by the sixties, Schroeder instead gave us a story directed at one man, somewhere in the world. repair a small corner and quietly disappear.
