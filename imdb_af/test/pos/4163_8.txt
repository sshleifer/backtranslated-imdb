I never thought I'd say it about a biopic product, but there is an abundance of characterization (especially with Kenji Miyazawa's emotions) and too little on the literal events of his life. In the end, I'm not sure if he dies (he should), or if his sister eventually dies (she must), or if the director spent a little too much time on the Galactic Railroad (this is an inside -grap, if you missed it, Miyazawa wrote a children's book called Night on the Galactic Railway). However, this glimpse into the minds of a writer sketching poetry and fairy tales from his imagination is very intelligent, creative, entertaining, and emotionally powerful. <br /> <br /> All of these are despite being animated like animals (as in many of Miyazawa's stories). <br /> <br /> Some of the visuals are truly amazing, especially as it made a TV movie. Seriously, some of them (like the sequence with birds that follow blue light) are competitive parts of Fantasia. However, I can't stand computer animation when mixed with cell animation. The CGI trains are terribly obvious - even more so than the Anastasia train. <br /> <br /> 8/10
