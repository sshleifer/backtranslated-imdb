It's bad because Ya really shows George Carlin's talents. He is still as sharp as a branch. It's a pity that we've lost him over the past year, but his comedy will last forever. This stand-up special is literally one of the funniest things I've ever done a comedian. Even though he does have fun with small children, it just makes you tell a few things. It is true that Carlin can literally make something look rude and in one of the funniest things you ever have and will ever hear. I really enjoyed this view, especially from Carlin and recommend that those who liked it look at George Carlin's stand-up.
