This 8 minute gem is not only timeless, but it is a cartoon milestone. It's Mickey's third cartoon, and one of its best. This is a cartoon milestone, as it was the first one with sound. And my good, even after 70+ years it's ever been so good, and gives real added weight to the story. The black and white animation is excellent and the characteristics are convincing enough. The music is great, I love the soundtrack, it makes the fun of the cartoon no matter how thin the story is. And the cartoon is funny! So many unforgettable moments, such as the cow's teeth as a xylophone and its udder as a bagpipe are used. The characters are also encouraging, Mickey and Minnie two landmark Disney characters are well-spoken by Walt Disney, and Pete serves well as "the villain of the piece". All in all, "Steamboat Willie" is just a timeless gem that everyone should see at least once. 10/10 Bethany Cox
