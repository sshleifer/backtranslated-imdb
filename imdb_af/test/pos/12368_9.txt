In the New Year's Eve, the Salvation Army Edit tuberculosis sister (Astrid Holm) asks her mother and her colleague Maria (Lisa Lundholm) to call David Holm (Victor Sjöström) to visit her in her deathbed. Meanwhile, David's alcoholic tells two other drunkards in the cemetery the legend of the Phantom Coach and his coach: according to the legend, the last sinner who will die in the turn of the New Year becomes the soul collector who collects souls into his coach. When David denies visiting Edit, his friends have an argument with him, they fight and David dies. When the coach arrives, he acknowledges his friend Georges (Tore Svennberg), who died at the end of last year. George reviewed parts of David's stupid life and in flashbacks he showed how meaningful and selfish David was. <br /> <br /> "Körkarlen" is an impressive and stylish quiet movie with wonderful special effects (for a 1921 movie). The characters are very well developed; However, the story is dated and there is a strange and inexplicable situation when Sister Edit tells her she loves David Holm. Why should an enlightened woman love such a despicable man who has wasted his life and damaged others? Despite being dated in contemporary religion, it eventually gives a beautiful message of faith and salvation. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "A Carroça Fantasy" ("The Phantom Coach")
