"The Piano Teacher" is all about Huppert's character; A middle-aged classic piano instructor with a stoic facade behind which attracts a highly compelling deviant personality. Unsatisfactory as a story, but intriguing as a character study, the film follows the Huppert character through the time of its confused relationship with a pupil delivering outstanding performances in the process. Not for everyone, "The Piano Teacher" plays best with those in strange movies and character-driven plays dealing with dark problems. (A-)
