When the Bicentennial hit, I was in Hershey, PA and part of the Middletown Skate Team. We did nothing except to kick around to learn what we read in the pages of Skateboarder Magazine. A few local hills provide all the speed bumps you can handle. At that time, Mike Weed was hot with Russ Whats-his names, with the Z-boys warm on their tail. I have a GT (GrenTech) plastic board with Power Paw urethane wheels (loose bearings). <br /> <br /> My parents told me that we were to California later that year and that they had taken a trip home. hunting. I was a very good boy that summer and asked if I could not be rewarded with a REAL skateboard from California. They delivered. It was a fiberglass deck with the Surfer Magazine logo shown on it. Big trucks and big red wheels (precision bearings, you don't know). They have it at Oak Street, a fire shop in Laguna Beach. <br /> <br /> When I came to California (everyone 13), Anaheim had the concrete wolf and Carlsbad also had a big park. Soon the Skateboard Odyssey arrived in Mission Viejo. An indoor park with every imaginable scenario. All the time I read about Stacy, Shogu, Tony and Jay. This movie was right for the money and a wonderful experience to watch.
