Hilarious and low-budget comedy at its best. This set of unique sketches with extensive self-referencing humor is reminiscent of a very racial Kids in the Hall. Be prepared for some of the most random and review-worthy lines, filled with ethnic slurry and terrible language. Sex toys included! <br /> <br /> There should be more comedy like this today. This collection of sketches on one DVD will justify many views and reviews in order to appreciate some of the parts. If you enjoy the state and / or wet hot American summer, get ready for some more glory. If you even consider it for younger audiences, I would say that every child on earth should see it.
