A fast and entertaining noir went to Vienna just after W.W.11. Donald Buka is a refugee who can't get legal work because he doesn't have papers. No papers mean no work permit, which means no way to get a passport. He survived by driving a friend's taxi at night. If he is caught, it means three months in prison. One night, he traveled to a big hotel and drove the man to an airline office. Buka picks up the man's luggage and returns to the car. There he found that his client had an unnecessary hole in the back of his head. What to do? Call the police? Without a work permit, they will really grab him quickly. No, he needs time to figure it out. He drives to a secluded spot, empties the man's bags and hides the body. He now has a US passport and a lot of cash! He falls through an underworld contact to make the passport photo change. Now he just has to go to the man's hotel and collect the man's plane ticket. His ticket to freedom! Needless to say it would be too simple. Waiting at the hotel is the dead man's mistress, Joan Camden. Camden is in the process of her rather nasty man, Francis Lederer, Lederer is of course the pigs the man in Buka's cabin hit. Camden calls the police because she believes Buka robbed her lover. Buka shows his new passport and drives his way out of the mess. Camden breaks down when man Lederer appears at the police station. Lederer convinced police Camden had suffered a mental break and she was released to him. She escapes again, finds Buka, and the two decide to flee the country. Lederer is again looking and Buka has to decide whether Camden is worth his freedom. This movie is much better than I make it sound. Buka is best known in the 1950s between midnight and dawn. The film was produced by actor Turhan Bey.
