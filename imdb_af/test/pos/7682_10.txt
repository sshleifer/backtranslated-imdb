I was a projectionist while in the US. and remember this movie very well. We have just been set up with Stereo Sound !! o-o-o-o-o !! Well, that was a big problem in 1959. Instructions came with the roles. The transfer was played while the projected curtain image was closed and I followed when the theater curtain was also closed. for the interruption, the theater curtain was closed and after five minutes I closed the movie with the projection curtain while music as a curtain call was used after the second part. being the first stereo movie I've ever seen and such a great musical production, I really enjoyed seeing it every time I showed it for the run.
