One of my favorite movies. I love horses, I like happy ends, and I love Walter Matthau. I miss him and am happy to have such a good movie to remind me why he was so wonderful. Keep it with your children (or your horse). <br /> <br /> The story of an old, hard-boat horse trainer with children, and his luck. If you have ever gained or appreciated horse racing, you will appreciate the rags to the wealth story. It can be a little under "Seabiscuit", but not much. The story is the same, except it is the quarter horse version. Well behaved, proper racing and equipment, and nice racing scenes. Don't take my word for it, get it and make your own mind.
