This film is about a young Indian man who comes home one day and finds himself engaged to a woman. The problem is he's gay. To stop the wedding without telling his parents that he is gay, lead one lie to another until it is out of control. <br /> <br /> This movie is hilarious and has often laughed at me. Sally Banks's play is wonderful and she plays this strong woman who does what she wants. The plot is also excellent. I find the plot very realistic, and I can completely identify with Jimi's feelings of being scared, worried and upset. On the other hand, Jimi's boyfriend, Jack, is much less in the film. I'd like him to have more lines in the movie and more character development. However, as I think the director wants to make it a more general film, the love between Jimi and Jack hasn't been developed in the movie. <br /> <br /> Watching a gay affirmative movie is great. Furthermore, this film preaches us to accept the difference of other people, whether sexuality, culture or lifestyle. This movie makes viewers think hard. <br /> <br /> We need movies like this to boost us. Thank you for making this movie!
