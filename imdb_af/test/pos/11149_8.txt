After recently buying Universal's Marlene Dietrich DVD collection, I was somewhat reluctant to watch "Golden Earrings". The idea of ​​a 40-something Marlene Dietrich as a gypsy in a war-time romance was unusual and indescribable. I shouldn't worry. With all the professional talent that went into these old movies, it's really hard to miss. The movie was a joy to watch; It's a classic. <br /> <br /> The most interesting thing about the movie was Dietrich, who made the gypsy role perfect. The makeup, lighting, photography, and her performance all add up to make a truly surprising and memorable character. I've never seen Dietrich play a "good" woman convincingly before - but she's doing here! She has played many heartless vamps in the big Sternberg movies, and it is refreshing to see her in a more down-to-earth, relaxed role, playing an exotic but very human character. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very nice romance. The love story is credible, optimistic, and the happy ending is extremely satisfying.
