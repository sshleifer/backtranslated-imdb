My mom always told me to sit down and actually watch this movie, because it's one of her favorites. I never did years before I caught on TV one night. This movie was great, I don't even know how to explain it. Not only is the movie excellent (Julia Roberts, Keifer Sutherland, Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, and Oliver Platt), but the story is wonderful. It's freaky, but not too scary and it makes you think. I was left speechless to this movie and amazed at how well actress and actress are all five of these people. Where did William Baldwin go, he was wonderful. This movie is a must for anyone, if you haven't seen it going to rent, you won't be sorry. Amazing!
