Tim Robbins undertook a masterpiece to direct this film. I say this because he avoided convention and clich√©. He also retained outstanding performances by Susan Sarandon (who won an Oscar for her role) and Sean Penn. Even more surprising, Robbins did not bet. He just tells the story and lets the events play on the viewer's mind. It is so effective because it allows the viewer to form his own opinions on the death penalty, one of the most controversial issues of our time, without being unfairly manipulated in any direction. I can't recommend this movie enough, 9/10.
