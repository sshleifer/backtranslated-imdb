This exuberant Troma movie is actually a very good movie. This is known as their epic and best and highly rated production. Their version of Shakespeare's game is extremely funny with the usual dose of Troma nudity and gore. Troma made some good gore movies, one of my favorites being "Street Trash" and of course the Toxic Avenger movies. I have one Troma movie, "Terror Firmer", which has a reputation as their biggest and nastiest movie. I enjoyed so much about Tromeo and Juliet, that I finally have to look at "Terror Firmer". This is a 2-disc collector's version with four commentaries and many features. "Tromeo and Juliet" is an absolute must and is highly recommended.
