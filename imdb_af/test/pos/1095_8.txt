This movie is amazing, while not being perfect by Hollywood standards, it includes a gentle look at the wide distribution between rich and poor, black and white that is true in many parts of the world. It handles the audience with kid gloves, while providing a truthful look to social problems. The children are beautiful, especially the young man playing Sipho. The friendships that develop are universally true, and everyone can relate to the choices these young people have to make. The influence of adults is interesting - it seems to be taken from real life experiences, as there are talks and interactions, just as a child would remember. I would highly recommend this movie.
