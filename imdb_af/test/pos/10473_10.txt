I can't think of any movie that captures the concept of grace better in the theological sense. The deliberate religion of a small congregation, which went wrong after the death of their leader, robs them of the thing they preach: grace. The expensive gift of a humiliated Parisian culinary genius gives them back to their calling to love one another, and despises an aging general that he wasted his life. CHOICE is a central theme as well as grace. At the same time, craft is recognized as a powerful, transcendent role to play in everyday life and the life that comes. Impossible to improve or ignore. It's a life-changing movie for those who hear his message.
