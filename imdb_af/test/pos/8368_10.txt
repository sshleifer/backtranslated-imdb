I was born in Beijing, China and moved to the United States at the age of 9. I have been to Beijing a few times since then and loved it every time. One of the many things I like about Beijing is the people and the atmosphere they bring to the city. "You hau hao sho shuo" (which translates more accurately to "if you have something to say, say it nice"), the feeling of Beijing is wonderful and truthful. I suppose you should have been and understood Beijing and its people to get the most out of this movie, though you can enjoy it. <br /> <br />> The story isn't complicated, intentionally a bit strange, and engaging. I will unfold it and not tell too much, except for a few comments. Every detail, from the pictures on the wall, to the decorations, the streets and restaurants, feels like the house. (Zhang Yimou probably shot everything in place). But more importantly, the characters - our "hero", the girl, the friendly but unlucky "laptop man" and the night club owner are each in Beijing and love in their own ways. Their conversations really hit the essence of each character. The story, mostly driven by situations and conversation (except the brilliant bafoonery near the end) is interesting and always interesting. <br /> <br /> I'm now 21. My parents and I love this movie. We are always so amazed at the ability of Zhang Yimou to turn ordinary people into credible screen characters, and everyday life in extraordinary situations. <br /> <br /> "Keep cool" - otherwise. hilarious. meaningful.
