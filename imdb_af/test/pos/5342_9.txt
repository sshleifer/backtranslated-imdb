Wallace & Gromit had been around for quite some time, but it was their first fall on the silver screen. Fans of the British TV series, like me, were keen to see them and the movie did pretty well in the theaters. Much of the reason is that the movie is fun and fairly original. In a world of CG movies such as SHREK and TOY STORY, this stopover is a good alternative to the trend in children's movies, and it's totally different from a cartoon. Plus, compared to many earlier feature films (such as KING KONG and Ray Harryhausen films such as SINBAD), the quality and movement of the characters is lighter for years. It looks very fluid, natural and more alive. <Br /> <br /> Apart from the quality of the animation, this movie also earns kudos on every other level. First, the voice actors do a good job. Secondly, the writing is very simple, but also very cute and pleasant - with a few double-entenders that are likely to go far beyond the children's heads. Thirdly, they succeed in making it not only a movie for children, but people of all ages like the film are also not sacked, and are not only aimed at the younger crowd. In particular, I was captivated by the incredibly cute film - and especially the bunnies. I especially loved them in closing credits - which made me very happy that I was watching the whole movie. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that unless you are a real blowjob, this movie will enjoy. It's fresh, funny and incredibly clever. I hope we see a successor - and it says something, because I usually hate persecutions.
