This movie is an amazing comedy. The writing is too funny. If you see it more than once, you'll enjoy it more. Although the comedy is sometimes stupid, but it really makes you enjoy! Salman Khan and Aamir Khan justified their roles. After 1994, I didn't get a hindi movie that was as funny as it was.
