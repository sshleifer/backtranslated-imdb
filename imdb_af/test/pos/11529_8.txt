If I look hard enough, errors can be found in this movie, mainly with the writing. I didn't find the character of Wolf quite convincing. However, these were my only "complaints." Because when this movie started on Cable, I'll just record it and see it later. From the start, with the ominous music and Cameron Diaz spreading her to 60-year-old dance, I was sounded. I never got up until the movie was over. It looked like I never even sounded. <br /> <br /> Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster's acting was excellent. The scenes were beautiful, the girls were beautiful, and the music was haunting and very pleasant. The story was very unique and sometimes has a surrealistic quality. The viewer would tend to keep the picture more if they had a good understanding of the state of mind of young people in the 60's and 70's, especially in America. Many of the screens have managed to show something of that era that is hard to grasp. It was a little more complicated than the simplistic statement that they wanted to change the world and eventually become disillusioned, though that might be the obvious aspect. Phoebe learns more and more as the film progresses. <br /> <br /> One aspect that apparently is not covered by the other judges who could call it, is the way in which the two daughters drift away after the death of their father. They both honored him and his presence was a stabilizing factor in their lives and of course he loved them very much. We read so much today about boys who lose their fathers too soon, just to lose their way themselves. This film covers the ripple effect of the father's loss on the girls left behind, first on the older sister Faith, then on her younger sister. Their mother feels insufficient to try to be both parents. This type of dynamic is not covered in almost any other movie, especially in so many different layers and subplots. Phoebe's inner struggle of reality with perceptions is gradually being pulled down like layers of onions. <br /> <br /> Talking to the plot, this movie should be higher than it has. I was waiting for a great conspiracy to find out about the death of Faith. How it solved itself surprised me even though others would have guessed sooner. <br /> <br /> Maybe not for everyone, but I could watch this movie many, many times.
