Of the Korean movies I saw, only three really held onto me. The first is the excellent horror, a story of two sisters. The second and third - and now fourth - were all Park Chan Wook's movies, Oldboy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance, and now Dors. <br /> <br /> Park kinda reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with its impenetrability to convention. All his movies are shocking, but not free. It's more like showing us what we don't expect to see - typically situations that are radically against society's morals, such as incest or cowardly, bloody but devoted priest. He is also quite artistically inclined to cinematography, and his films are one of the most beautiful things I have seen. <br /> <br /> Thirst is all about priest and the oppressed, conscience-less woman he falls for - and more. It's horror, drama, and even comedy, as Park disarms its audience with very inappropriate but humorous situations. As such, it could be my best job for me, as she lacked the other two movies that made the humor element more enjoyable for repeated views.
