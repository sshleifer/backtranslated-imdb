Like all Mel Brooks' other comedies, men in Tights are hilarious. But when I see this as a far-reaching comedy, I think many people don't realize that the reason why the movie is so funny is that the characters themselves act so well. Elwes is the well-spoken former British nobleman. Lewis is an eternally irritated king (I hope it's worth it!), DeLuise is an excellent godfather, Roger Rees is a worried and cynical sheriff. The actors and actresses are so loyal to their parts that the jokes flow with ease. Yes, we've seen this kind of comedy before, but the only comedy to get better character development is, in my opinion, The Big Lebowski. Very funny.
