The Ali G character works brilliantly within the boundaries of a comedy program, but as a movie it doesn't work the same way. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong - this is a very funny movie, full of biting, witty dialogue, which cariculates the modern British chav wonderfully, while the viewer offers a hilarious, unrealistic story . <br /> <br /> One problem with this movie is that the writing and content are either brilliantly brilliant or embarrassing. If I feel ashamed, I do not mean a low office or extras, but you will wish they did not include it in the final cut. One example is the inclusion of a music video after the movie ended, as follows: "This is how we do it." When I watch the movie, I stop the DVD when it's finished, and leave it with it. <br /> <br /> Overall, Ali G Indahouse is a great movie, which is worth watching a few times. The writing is enjoyable to some extent, and there are no problems as far as it is acting. Refinement is, however, the keyword here. <br /> <br /> Ali G is a better television program. Borat is a better movie.
