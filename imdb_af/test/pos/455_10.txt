I really enjoy this movie. The first time it was on Turner Classic Movies. All the actors did very well, but Brynner stole the show as always. He is so sexy! This is one of the movies that Brynner's emotions see. Actually, this movie is the first one I ever saw laughing because it plays very strong, bigger than life and plays serious roles in other movies. In this movie you see both a male, difficult and sensitive side of Brynner. Brenner seems to be a "ladies" man in this movie. It is wonderful how Brynner eats the glass beaker and speaks in his Russian language, it makes me love to love it. I don't understand when both Brynner and Kerr (they both have very good chemistry) meet stars in a movie and then Brynner always dies at the end which reminds you of 'The King and I' in a way.
