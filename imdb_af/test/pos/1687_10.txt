An amazing achievement! It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I know it is said a lot, but I'm sure you won't regret watching this movie. <br /> <br /> It's fantastic from the beginning to the last second. The acting (especially of the mother - played by Judith Light) is so convincing, there aren't many other movies I've seen that can be compared to it, and it seems impossible to give anything to the people in this drama. do not feel. br /> <br /> There are lots of movies made every year, but if you just have to choose to see some in your life - make this one of them.
