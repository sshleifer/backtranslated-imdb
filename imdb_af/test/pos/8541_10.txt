You know those blatantly horrible movies, but you can't help but love them? Well, that's what Evil Ed is, possibly the best horrible movie in the world. The sound is rubbish, the dubbing is crap, the script is nonsense and the special effects are dull. However, I cannot help loving this movie very much and I have recommended it to at least 50 people over the years. Sam Campbell (or the man who plays him) must appear on the Actor's Studio series as he is so memorable. Perhaps the biggest movie killer is not called Tony Montana. Seriously, if you don't expect much, you won't be disappointed. Have a light-hearted approach to watching this movie and you'll review it soon a ten times.
