In 1895, in a small town in Japan, the wife of the garbage carrier Gisaburo (Takahiro Tamura), Seki (Kazuko Yoshiyuki), a relationship with a man twenty-six years younger, Toyiji (Tatsuya Fuji). Toyiji gets jealous of Gisaburo and picks with Seki to kill him. They torment Gisaburo and throw his body in a pit in the woods, and Seki tells the residents that Gisaburo has moved to Tokyo to work. Three years later, the people gossip about the fate of Gisaburo, and Seki is being haunted by his ghost. The situation becomes unbearable to Seki and Toyiji when a police authority comes to the town to investigate the disappearance of Gisaburo. <br /> <br /> "Ai no Borei" is a surreal and supernatural love story. Seki's remorse and guilty complex let her see the spirit of her murdered man and spoil the perfect plot of her lover. The cinematography is endangered by the quality of the VHS released in Brazil, but there are many beautiful scenes, including "Ringu" and the American remake "The Ring" using the view from the inside of the well in the same corner. The performances and direction are excellent for making "Ai no Borei" a good movie. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Império da Paixão" ("The Empire of Passion")
