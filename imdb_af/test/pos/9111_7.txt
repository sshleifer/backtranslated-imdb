When I first heard that Jack Black and Kyle Gass would make a movie about their band, I was freaking out! I love their music and I hoped this movie would be really funny! Having looked at it, I can't really say that this hope wasn't happy, but I think I expected more. The movie is full of Tenacious D's good music and I really loved listening to it all. There are many big jokes and I just love the story, at least the first time. I don't like the way the movie ends. The end is very sudden and I think they could extend it a little more. <br /> Overall, I think it's a good movie to watch! Everyone who wants rock music should watch it! That will give you a good laugh!
