Style over fabric. But what a style it is. "The Cell" is the internal version of most serial killers. Unfortunately, the story hardly supports the visual art. <br /> <br /> Psychotherapist Catherine Deane (J-Lo) goes through artificial means in her patient's dreams to discover and help them, and they come from their phobias and obsessions. A new patient who fell into a coma is brought to the attention of the FBI. He is a serial killer who drowns his female victims and then puts their bodies in grotesque scenarios such as mannequins. Deane must enter the murderer's mind and navigate through his ill-fated fantasies to find and save his youngest victim. <br /> <br /> Director Tarsem Singh has incredible visions and pieces for this production. Every dream sequence is like a nightmare ish painting in motion, from the landscapes to the costumes. <br /> <br /> But the plot suffers from a lack of history of its characters. Stargher is the only person with a thorough background and he is the last person you want to care about. Without him you basically have a movie that just moves in the present time. It's a pity, because the movie is so visually stunning and really scary. Lopez is wasted, but she is not as wonderful an actress, although she is as beautiful as ever. And Vince Vaughn? I don't even know why he was chosen. It's not his forts and he overworked to start. He tried too hard to become his character and it showed. Stick to comedy, Vince! Still, this movie is so visually scary, I'm still watching this movie with the lights on and can never fall asleep right away.
