I recently saw the short title "The Reader" and found that the movie was well planned and executed. I really felt for both characters that Morgan Hallett and Elizabeth Franz portray in this movie. Elizabeth was able to show great variety with her blind character and emotionally connected me. Morgan was able to sell me that she was totally committed to protecting "Sissy" or Franz from the sadness of losing her sister who lives in Copenhagen. The big thing about the movie was in the short time and the budget of only ten thousand dollars. Duncan Rodgers was able to make a very well-made movie that kept the viewer interested. Rodgers has a good insight into the actor's ability and transition, with great camera angles to show their talent. I always feel like a director can make a good movie with a small budget, what can he or she do with a much larger one. Great work Duncan !!
