Each story has a lesson for young and old. But what I still have to say may spoil a future story. But I believe what I have to say is for everyone; just for a particular episode: the soldier and death. <br /> <br /> Well ... of all the stories is the one that stands out for me, "The Soldier and Death" because it was the point in my life. realize that life was terminal. I'm not joking. The air was on my 8 1/2 birthday ... and I will always remember it. I didn't remember his title until tonight, but I made the synopsis new. (May 15, 1988) <br /> <br /> It is always difficult to explain that death is a natural part of life. It is also difficult for adults to accept that children can accept this fact. I am a living proof (currently 28 years old) that children can accept this fact and remind adults from time to time ... <br /> <br /> I write this with tears in my eyes. Heath Ledger - a wonderful actor my own age - is dead today. It reminded me of many lessons I learned in my life. So I write this as a reminder to Young and Old ... no one is immune to everything that is available to us. <br /> <br /> I hate to say Death will happen, but this story was the first time I saw death as not a bad thing; but part of life was literally in this story. I can not help it. <br /> <br /> And for that ... <br /> <br /> I love you Jim Henson (and I still remember a lot of your work in life until the day you died, and your memorable Muppet Show) and thank you Brian Henson for keeping the workshop alive !!! Honestly, thank you, all your co-workers, editors and interns. <br /> <br /> The stage is just a boost. And a show is just a show. But Imagination will create Magic / That Forever. The world will know. <br /> <br /> Thanks !!! <br /> <br /> (And to all who doubt me ... Dance, Magic Dance)
