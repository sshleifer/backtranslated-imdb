This film proves that you don't need a Hollywood budget to make something fun to watch. What is stuck to me is how the crew of different places were able to pull together without promises of wealth to make something just because they believed in it. I think anyone who makes low budget films can relate to some scenes like actors who just can't get the one line, are bothered by the police and most of the crew disappear after the first week. No one paid for it, which many say to people traveling over land and spending long hours. After watching, Stuie sells his personal property, uses his own money and researches his home to make the movie. I'm a little curious how close his wife came to leave. Good work for everyone.
