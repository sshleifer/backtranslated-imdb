I watched these brief moments on the website of the Sundance Film Festival, and I have to say it is absolutely amazing. I expected it to be entertaining - like all the Sundance shorts - but I wasn't prepared for such a deep sadness and yet a sense of passion and beauty. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this year's entries for the festival, I suggest you go to the site and look at these mini-masterpieces - I've seen them all and can honestly say: The Youth In Us is the one who touched my heart the most. I'm not the worst audience when it comes to novels in movies, but my eyes have flooded so much, I'm surprised I can still see the screen. <br /> <br /> I agree with "addict", this is really a masterpiece of legal practice, and cinematography will only take your breath away. <br /> <br /> I can't think of a better way to spend an extra 12 minutes.
