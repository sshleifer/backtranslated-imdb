I am a physics student myself, and I must say I believe that this is one of the best 'popular' introductions to the string theory there is. The Elegant Universe manages the entire subject of the string (though it is actually M) theory accessible to a wider audience. <br /> <br /> Some "popular science" programs feel that the best approach is just to throw the audience On the far side, technically throwing jargon on them without as much as an explanation, and presenting the theory " a boring, old style. This program goes through concepts such as general relativity and quantum mechanics, and explains the issues that need to be resolved between the two. We therefore have a coherent theory that can be applied to the universe on a large and small scale. <br /> <br /> I suppose some might say it's slow and takes too long to get to the interesting things like extra dimensions and worggate, but the thing is: it's against the point. Explaining the string theory from the beginning is virtually impossible without calling physics at its base, and the way it is explained in the elegant universe is clear and entertaining. <br /> <br /> Whether you really like this program depends on whether you are willing to be initially amazed by some of Greene's ideas: extra dimensions and space-time tensions are not entirely in the everyday life? But if you keep up with some of the exotic concepts in this program, you'll find it gives you insight into the research that drives the world of physics today. And if you study physics, it's also good fun, and you'll probably be able to follow it and appreciate it even more!
