Whether you're a fan of the series that inspired it or not, there's no denial, it's a turbulent job. But in the best possible sense. Strange to get away from the steps of old sitcoms that made an awkward transition to the big screen, Messrs. Pemberton, Dyson, Shearmsith and Gatiss found another way. They addressed the issues of dealing with their success, along with the creation of other creations and, inevitably, repetition of some of their beloved characters. It's a pity they don't just like a more consistent League or Gents movie, because it's so inventive that it includes themselves in the screenplay, but it lowers the final movie. Well worth the rent.
