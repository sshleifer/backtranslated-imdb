If you have a chance, see these Russian (how should I call them: jewels, masterpieces, hidden treasures?), War movies like this, or The dawn here is quiet, or Proverka to dorogah ... And right away, look again the American war films, or the international productions, the one with the allies and the Germans, etc. Or, worse, look at the Italian war movies. Everything from the west will look level, confronted, ridiculous, compared to Russian films. I am so surprised at the quality of the aforementioned Russian war films that I cannot get the say enough to praise their disintegration over the Anglo-Saxon war films.
