I have been forced to comment on this movie because it is listed as the fourth lowest-rated sci movie of all time on the IMDb. WHAT!?!? Sure, this movie is crappy, but it's HILARIE! It's not terrible on an Ed Wood level, it's more surreal and uneven. <br /> <br /> There are some classic moments in the movie. The brain surgery is gross and large - and even more useful if you think the movie is PG! Gor rushed behind his dolly before pouring acid on his face. "Me! Gimmee!" Zandor Vorkoff's speeches at the beginning of the film - "Before Amir, Kali was another weak people struggling to get rid of centuries of stagnant feudalism!" Angelo Rossito also has some good lines: "No, Gor! No!" "You want these keys, not you, me beautiful?" It is absolutely wrong that this is the 4th lowest rated sci movie on the IMDb because it is BUSINESS. No matter how bad a movie is, if it is rather strange, striking, disturbing or entertaining, it deserves and does not deserve to be fired and fired. I won't defend most of Al Adamson's movies, but this one, with Dracula USA. FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD OF GHASTLY HORROR are enough to entertain for their horror.
