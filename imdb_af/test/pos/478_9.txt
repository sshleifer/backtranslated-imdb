I caught it at the Chicago IndieFest and have to say YOU ARE ALONE is much harder than the other reviews and even the site will remind you. Not HA HA Wedding Crashers are funny, but sick, twisted, I can't believe she just said it, but it's so damn real funny. <br /> <br /> The best actress Jessica Bohl is great to watch. There's never a moment when you think, I'm watching a movie and she's an actress. She is too damn true for words. <br /> <br /> In fact, there are 2 scenes I'm still giggling about, and I won't give them away, but in one she's in the bathroom and talking about how much she gets paid for performing a certain service and how awesome it is. (I almost wonder how many people in the audience think in the same secret!) <br /> <br /> In another, she talks about a teenager's definition of "sex" to an adult, and if not The true dialogue I have heard in a movie for a long time, I do not know what is.
