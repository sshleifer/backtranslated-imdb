I can't help but notice the negative reviews this movie has received. To be honest, I've seen the preview for this movie, and the premise has contracted me. Yes, I rented it after I commented on others. They are correct because some of the plays can be imagined. They are also correct that one of the best performances of this movie is that of dr. Graves was. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is Scott Clark, who plays Grant, the child in the wheelchair. I identify with the character he played, perhaps because I am in a wheelchair. <br /> <br /> This movie is definitely worth watching.
