The Polish brothers are unique film artists, and they really printed the envelope here. A fantasy that communities have in common with "Wings of Desire", tells the story of a 50s-era small town in the middle of nowhere that is ashamed to be flooded and underwater thanks to the US government's desire to make a reservoir in the place where the village stands. It is a cruel parable of loss and remembrance, with angels, dreams, forebodings, and the most hilarious government reclamation functionaries since the "Repo Man." The performances are all outstanding, especially Nolte and Woods. I noticed that I read some of the remarks that people are being insulted simply by using the Polish twins elliptical storytelling, which is one of the things that make this movie so good: its willingness to embrace mysterious as an aspect of everyday life. David Mullen's cinematography is amazing. Highly recommended; If you suffered a significant personal loss, such as the death of a parent, I would even call the movie needed. - Ray
