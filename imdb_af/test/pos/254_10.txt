I just watched the 8th MS Gundam for the second time again. It's so much better than Gundam Wing. I can't wait to get the DVD and see what's worked out from the series. It is wonderful to see that the Gundams are actually uncomfortable moving across the country. Someone really thought about writing this paper. <br /> <br /> See it today.
