It is characteristic that this film is not better known. Of course, it lacks most of the elements needed for a successful movie theater: heroes, villains, conflict and resolution, romantic love interests. <br /> <br /> Everything is here, nothing works as it should, everyone is clumsy, sad, angry, hurt and hungry and nobody has a solution to anything. In short: it's war and it's hell for everyone involved. People try to do the best, but influence interests, commitments and so-called law. The photo takes us back in time to the Civil War with an intensity that is rarely seen in today's cinema. Straighten honest images of an intense beauty. The actors are very well thrown to the story and they really make the characters alive before our eyes. <br /> <br /> A silver dollar in a heap of nickel!
