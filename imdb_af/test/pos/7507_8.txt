Dr. Bock teaches at the hospital and he is pretty good at it. The thing about him is that he is depressed. Dr. Bock and his wife are divorced, his children are deviant, he can't act in the bedroom and he feels like he's not doing very good work to heal people. He becomes suicide, but meets Barbara, who changes his ideas for the better. Around this story is a murder mystery and a group of angry protesters outside. <br /> <br /> The movie is well done and the character of dr. Bock is well played. It's a bit sad, somewhat funny and somewhat drama. It was good to see some stories wrapped around the hospital, even though they were slightly related to what Dr. Bock did. Great movie.
