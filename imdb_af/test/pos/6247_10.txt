OK ... I just saw just about everything .... and some are considered classic ones that shouldn't be (like all the Halloween movies that suck or even Steven King junk) ....... and some are considered just OK, it's really good ..... (like the carnival of souls) ........ and then some are simply ignored ............ like (evil ed) or (pumpkin head and brain kills "the knob cort one") then saw some stick in your head once and never left ........... that's what it did for me has ........ and for my money it is much better than the last house on the left ............ Last house was wonderful to the end ... then it blasted ..... what kind of dummy is going to give a raid to someone who just killed their children ... totally stupid .. find the movie "bully" or even "funny games" if you want you to have realism and looking out ....... .. but this damn thing stuck with me for years ......... one causes chuck Connors w as always scary ......... two Tanya Roberts is the best female victim ever ... ... three the chick To be plastered in plaster, is still one of the worst killings of movie .. ...... and 4th the telekinetic forces plunged my mind and came quite unexpectedly ........ not the dummies were figures not dolls etc. ... it must be right with psycho, last home, Texas chain saw, etc ... it's a classic .............. and deservingly so ...........
