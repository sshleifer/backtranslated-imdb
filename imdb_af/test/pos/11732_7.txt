I didn't see every movie that Burt Reynolds ever made, but this one (which I just watched for the third time) can be very good! It suffers from only a few slow regions; Burt may have tried to make it more "arty" than it should have been. On the other hand, he managed to avoid many of the regular cliches in the role he played "out loud" (for example, look at the scene he was trying to visit Rachel Ward for the first time, or the fear he was pressing just before the final imprisonment with the indestructible Henry Silva). In fact, Silva and the two ninja assassins are three of the most memorable villains of cop-thrillers of the 80's. The film also has some horrible touches, a surprising amount of humor, a brutal and gripping fist fight and many well-directed shots. (***)
