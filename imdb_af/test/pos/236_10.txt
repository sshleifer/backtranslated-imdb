It was Gene Kelly's breakthrough, and it alone made it unforgettable. Throw Rita Hayworth as his love stake and comedian Phil Silvers of all people as his sidekick and you have the ingredients for a real crowd, which is exactly how it turned out. <br /> <br /> Kelly plays Danny McGuire, a nightclub owner in Brooklyn (Brooklyn is always the "wrong side of the songs" in the 40 movies). His star rating and interest is Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth). Rita is beautiful, and even plays a double role like Rusty and Rusty's grandmother. Rusty has a chance in the big time by John Coudair (Otto Kruger )'s turn, which romances and lost Rusty's grandmother. <br /> <br /> The plot turns to Danny, who lost Rusty, to the detriment of his club, as she has a chance of success he can't give. But of course, that's not what Rusty wants ultimately, because as usual in movies of that time, the real guy is the only thing on the girl's mind. There are no surprises, but everyone does their best. <br /> <br /> Kelly does the first of his wonderful tricks, this time with himself as a reflection of a glass window. He was the master of that kind of dance, and one still has to wonder how they all drew so precisely that he really looked at two places at once. The melodrama gets a little thick, and there are a few free references that are created in the bit, but the opportunity for a song or two, but Kelly takes this movie to the next level. It was before he became a megastore and too smooth for his own good. Kelly's character in the 1980s, "Xanadu", also called the name Danny McGuire. It is an underlying edge of shyness to its character. It is a credible and almost capricious air. This movie was the beginning, that movie the end, of a tremendous race for a dancing genius. Obviously this movie meant a lot to him. Highly recommended.
