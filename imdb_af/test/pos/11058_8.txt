It was my first Gaspar Noe movie I watched and I must say I was shocked. I don't mind, but it's not even gore, it's actually messed up. For some of you, some scenes may be impossible to see and I really mean disgusting. To leave these aspects, the main ideas are revealed here and the dialogue is very brilliant. When you give a strong argument to bring a new life to the world and the way it is given, you can't stop and take a moment to think about it. The actors did their job well, representing general masks of a handpick, few people found at the bottom of a sick community. The movie is full of metaphors, but I'll let you find out. Don't look at it if you want a little, quiet time. I recommend this movie to all of you who want something to think about or just see something different than you find in your average cinema.
