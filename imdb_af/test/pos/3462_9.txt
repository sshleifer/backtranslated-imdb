As a "physically challenged" person (god, how I hate that phrase) I just caught it on the cable where there was absolutely nothing else to look at - generally it was a fantastic movie. Yes, I was a little disappointed to find out that no actor is not disabled, and yes, I was a little disappointed that more of the movie was not filmed from the 'right' view of the disabled (can you imagine what it is Like always being the tallest person in the room and then living the rest of your life for nothing but other people's asses and herbs, always waiting for the idiot to stop to read the newspaper in the only disabled stall, everyone's rude physical expulsion while waiting?). and the scene with him driving the car was absolutely me! There it was, literally done. but the movie was true enough to matter - while I never lived in a home or a home, there were many times in the movie where I cut myself and told myself. "Yes, that's true .... it happened to me ...." What impressed me is that some of the commentators on this board have voiced the fact that the movie shows them a little different life and with a little more insight than the life of a quiet 'minority' I no longer ask for it from a movie, that it makes you think and sees life differently, so on the basis of it alone the movies were very successful . should be expected of every child at junior high school. <br /> <br /> pretty much every person who is severely physically handicapped, independence is one of, or not the main focus of, our daily lives, from recreation to socialization to recreation. For those of you who felt the movie was "cliched," we are trying to live our lives for a single day - you will see that the movie is "clicked" because ..... this is true. The challenges faced by the actors only have the surface of what happens to us every day - if we are happy, we experience the same emotional and personal growth that the three characters (including the girl) did. Every day we offer obstacles to overcome. It's just that there is no swelling, dramatic music to accompany our lives, unless it's in our ipods .... lol!
