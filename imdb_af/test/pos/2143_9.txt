I first saw this movie released in 1980. From other sources I learned that the only release of the 219-minute cut was in New York City, after which it was severely cut for 149 minutes. So, I think I only saw the shorter version that was thought at the time, was a very interesting anti-Western, as a little thing confusing ... <br /> <br /> So it was with even more interest that I finally got a DVD of the full length version. I'm glad I did because this second show confirmed to me that the movie is a real classic, and the critical vitriol that was thrown at Michael Cimino was unjustified to say the least. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a long movie, but so are many others. For example: at a time in America (1984) at 227 minutes; Cleopatra (1963) at 320 minutes; The Ten Commandments (1956) at 220 minutes; Spartacus (recovery version) (1960) at 198 minutes; Gone with the wind (1939) at 222 minutes and others. So, it can't be the time to run so much foam to the mouth when the Hemelekh came on the scene. <br /> <br /> But note: all those above the movies have everything to do with strengthening myths about history and heroes. <br /> <br /> Not so Heavenly: In this story, American West is shown in all its grim and inexorable hardness, injustice and poverty. And this is probably the first reason why so much of this film didn't last: it set out the circumstances of the Johnson County War or Wyoming in 1892. It showed how the Wyoming Stock Growers Association hired 50 assassins to kill and kill a large group of European immigrants. of livestock rust; and all with the help and connection of authorities, to the president of the United States. For an essay on the war, with the background and what happened, there is a link in Wikipedia under the Johnson County War. <br /> <br /> Very few are reminded of the very dirty periods in their country's history, and which are flying in the face of what the country is supposed to be. If it were a documentary, it would not be rare for most; As entertainment, it was almost bound to fail commercially and be torn by the shrill and infamous. <br /> <br /> The socio-political diatribe has left a moment, which Cimino started here, what about the story ?? The story of the three main characters? Well, it was probably not uncommon for men of that time to fall for a local prostitute, just as it probably isn't. It is a fairly standard love triangle that Ella has to choose between the two men and finally decide on the younger man, Nathan, who, while not falling above the cold-blooded murder when it suits him, shows more spirit and commitment than the older James (or Jim, as most people say in the movie). For some, the part of the story is too slow, perhaps; However, in the context of the broader story of the war, it seems to me perfectly appropriate. <br /> <br /> And the war is depicted graphically, maliciously and cruelly with scenes of massacre that have been performed and edited. faultless ?? Although I am sure in the final massacre between the Association and the immigrants that some scenes fall apart, it is repeated. A small point and maybe arise when the 219-minute cut is repaired? However, any way you look at it will be faced with the noise, dust, chaos and confusion of war. <br /> <br /> What causes me other criticism: the noise and dust It is often difficult to hear the dialogue and even see what is going on. I'd admit I found it to be a little thing first, even to play back to play parts to try to capture the picture or the words? until I realized it was really not necessary if you accepted the director's intention: life is chaotic, it is difficult to hear and see in busy situations and in the war it is the sinew of this mise-and-scene . In short, it's as if you are actually present inside and inside the screens ... <br /> <br /> And what about the title? Shakespeare refers to a figurative closeness to God and so, if you compare God to the natural world, the beautiful scenery that permeates the movie? and that's wonderful, hauntingly equal to that of David Lean's doctor Zhivago (1965) ?? is a useful metaphor. However, I tend to think that Cimino had something to say, namely the idea that brave immigrants ?? the godly salt of the earth ?? is denied access to heaven on earth and the freedom to build a life itself in the country pretending to be a freedom champion. <br /> <br /> Was it Cimino's intention? to gut the myth of the American West? To show how the rich in the United States are rich while the poor are somehow murdered by history? Is it something new? Not really, as we all know. However, where it is really hurt is to show how America was not and, by implication, is not the land of the free and the home of the brave. Instead, having absorbed this story, we have the impression that America's foundations are more concerned with a land of decomposed slaves and a house for knaves.
