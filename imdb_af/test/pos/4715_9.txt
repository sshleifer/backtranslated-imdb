Based on a real story, John Boorman shows the battle of an American doctor, whose husband and son were murdered, and constantly bothered with her loss. A holiday to Burma with her sister was like a good idea to get away, but when her passport in Rangoon was stolen, she could not leave the country with her sister and had to stay back until she was I.D. papers from the US embassy. To fill in a day before she could fly out, she went to the countryside with a tour guide. "I tried to find something in those statues, but nothing touched me. I was a stone myself." <br /> <br /> Suddenly, hell broke loose and she was caught in a political uprising. Just as she seemed to have escaped and safely embarked on a train, she saw her tour guide being beaten and shot. In a split second, she decided to jump off the moving train and try to save him without thinking of herself. She was in constant danger. <br /> <br /> Here is a woman who showed spontaneously, selfless charity, who endured her life saving another. Patricia Arquette is beautiful, not just to look at; she has a beautiful heart. It's a memorable story. <br /> <br /> "We are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always holds."
