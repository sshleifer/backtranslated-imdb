I saw it in a preview and it hasn't yet been released in the US. It was one of the more pleasant little comedies. It's about rivalry between two funeral directors in a small British town. The plot [of the movie] gets a little out of hand in the third act, but the characters are very pleasant and memorable. <br /> <br /> The play is across the board. To be overlooked in the blockbuster crisis, it's a movie worth looking for. I know I'll try it again in the theaters and / or buy the video.
