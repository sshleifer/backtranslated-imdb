Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer are not for people born before 1980 or after 1989. Most of the people will not appreciate the big things the 80s cartoons are. The fact that Rainbow Brite is made in a movie is a guilty pleasure for many of us who remember watching the TV show as a child. Granted, much of the dialogue is quite amusing and stupid, and the plot is relentless to useless, but it's a very cool movie.
