Forget every spy movie you've ever seen - that's how life in the USSR was, and is still in many places in Russia and the former Soviet countries. Be dreams of life of recreation, as she suggests the West is; her reality is very different, with a bitter mom, a violent father and the ever-present alcohol. And its future prospects are not much better. She finds a man and they try to put together a life, but he is hit by the same environment, both socially and physically. The scenery in this movie is brilliant, comfortable in the company of post-apocalyptic movies, but of course with no special effects; they just shot and shot what happened before the camera. <br /> <br /> Forget your stereotype, cold Russians from spy movies. It's the Real Deal: people are passionate, lively and present in a way you'll never see in a drama of the West.
