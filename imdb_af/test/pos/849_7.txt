Earth Final Conflict has begun as a new world, a new vision of the creator of Star trek, something fresh and unique full of great elements. A very good role with an extremely credible Kevin Kilner as William Boone, starting an ex-cop as a kind of ambassador of a mysterious alien race (Talons), after the death of his wife in strange circumstances. But the character of Kilner will soon join a group for the purpose of discovering the truth of the strangers, why they look so good and caring for the human race. Soon, this resistance group will begin to discover the sinister plans of the Talons by using the people in their own problems to survive their own destruction. As I said before, the show started, everything was almost perfect, including characters like Da'an, the original Da'an was a great secret because he looks like a beautiful creature, but at the same time he has his own evil plans manipulate some people in the earth. Soon comes Zo'or who was not bad, but ... noticed the beginning of the fall of this show because he became the first great enemy of man, the incarnation of evil, and killed something bigger in Da ' could be. The first seasons end in a good way with Boone's death and the second shows a new main character (Liam), a hybrid man and Kimera (another alien race) with some very interesting powers. He replaces Kilner character in a good way so that the other storylines make it better, including the conflict with the jaridians and the atavus. But as I said before Zo'or's wickedness began to be more important, so the new conflicts were less realistic than the same Talons. Over time, the whole storyline of the alien roots of Liam followed almost the same with other things from the previous seasons. So when the final season started the original Earth Final, it was just an almost forgotten dream. All the magic was missing, just to keep in vain to keep the show going, including the return of Kilner and Liam for a few episodes. The last episode was just the proof of how bad the show was with so many bad changes (to think the authors of some episodes didn't know anything of the first stories), it was one of the worst endings I ever had in a Television program. A real shame, because Earth's Final Conflict has begun like something unique, fresh, the stories the movie was. Having seen so much from the US, something from Canada was out of the mind of Star's creator wonderfully, but eventually it turns worse. I hope somebody someday make a repeat of this show, of course use none of the fourth and fifth season (except the cast, everyone was perfect in his work). I can still dream in a better thing.
