Excellent Hitchcock thriller with Robert Cummings proving he can really storm. <br /> <br /> This time, he is a defensive plant worker trapped in a horrible plot when his best friend is killed at the plant. <br /> <br /> Priscilla Lane is the girl who is suddenly interested in Cummings as the plot thickens and is being prosecuted to California after NY. <br /> <br /> There is a deadly plot by a group of rich 5th columnists to destroy from within. Hitchcock was known to play the top echelons of society in his long career as director. He's ironic enough, and the movie is over. As we see what happens to the man who killed Cummings's friend, we don't see what happens to the rest of the gang. Many of them represent the upper crust of society.
