I really enjoyed this movie. I have a true sense of justice and an eye for an eye, and this movie spades it. Glenn Ford is offered a very low price for his farm by the big farmer in the valley; then one of his farming hands is beaten and shot to help him sell his thoughts. When the farm hand dies, and the sheriff refuses to do anything, Ford is actually reluctant to do anything and warn his men not to take things in their own hands. But that's just what he's going to do. I knew this movie was about to catch fire when he entered the salon and confronted the man (Richard Jaeckel, one of my favorite bad-character characters) who killed his hand; After a gentle dialogue with him, Glenn Ford slammed his face and shot him dead. Similar to a neatly added justice, he kills this man with the gun that belonged to his murdered cowhand. In short, we are being treated to Ford so his farm is burnt, so his men are justified in hiding the crew of the other farm; then Ford and his men thrust all the horses and cattle from the big bad man's farm; Then they show up and burn the outbuildings and the big house on the ground. Talk about getting even big time. Much action in this movie. There is more to the story than that, but I would only recommend watching the movie. Glenn Ford was someone who has shown time and again what can happen if you consider someone wrong, and I really enjoyed watching it get the old-fashioned way.
