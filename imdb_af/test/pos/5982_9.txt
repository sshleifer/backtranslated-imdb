An amazing report of two soldiers' fate in World War II. At the freezing point of not only the fight against the Nazis and traitors in Belorussia, but the harsh natural elements, this film tells a story of two soldiers of polarized morality, one who survives, but finds it somewhat impossible for his own circumstances, and one who dies has done everything that can be done in the face of intimidation and everything possible to break your spirit, in fact the "ascending" of the title. A movie to be seen by all, especially for the phenomenal performances of the main characters, and in the possession of the pieces (especially the imprisonment and hanging scenes. An absolute must see.
