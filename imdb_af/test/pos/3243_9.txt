Heath Ledgers acting in this movie really makes me wrong, but overall it's a good look. Bryan Brown is excellent if I don't usually like him, but then his whole gang is a big job. Jimmy is an unfortunate wannabe gangster who can't do anything right (SPOILERS: lose pandos money, Akkos car and bumbles a bank robbery) but still get up. <br /> <br /> not knowing what the two kids were up to, but joining beautiful stories together. <br /> <br /> All in all a beautiful piece of Australian theater 9/10
