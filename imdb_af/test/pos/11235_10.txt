Don't care what this socially delayed person says, this show is hilarious. It shows how many single men are in a bar atmosphere, and also shows that women are not as gullible as men think they are. <br /> <br /> The game aspect of the how is really cool and original. It's not the standard reality show that we've all been using for a few days. <br /> <br /> Give it a chance everyone, we're just one episode, we finally have some Canadian programs that aren't absolute. As Canadian, we normally get, Bon Cop, Bad Cop, or Corner Gas. Come on, people show that we're not all as careful as the previous reviewer. <br /> <br /> Away to Comedy Network, giving a new show a chance. The panel is funny and the participants so far are pretty good.
