It's a pretty good thriller at a nuclear power plant in southern California that is directed by James Bridges and star Jane Fonda, Jack Lemmon and Michael Douglas. Fonda is a television reporter who wants to be an investigative journalist, but may only be a TV reporter. Douglas is an independent cameraman and Lemmon is a supervisor at a nuclear facility. Fonda and Douglas are sent on a routine mission to a nuclear power station and an accident almost happens and they get it all on film. Everyone tries to convert it except Fonda and Douglas, so Douglas steals the movie. Lemmon is starting to investigate and find out that the company cares more for profit than safety at the plant. It's a good movie with a pretty good end.
