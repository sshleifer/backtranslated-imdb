I sell the dead beads around convicted grave robber Arthur Blake. Blake's friend and co-digger Willie Grimes has just been executed and Blake will follow the next morning. While sitting in his cell in anticipation of his actions, a priest named Duffy came in and asked him if he would tell everything he saw as a tomb robber. He then continues to give Father Duffy a quasi-biography of his more interesting benefits. <br /> <br /> The plot consists of many incidents linked only by chronology. This prevents the viewer from getting bored, but also makes events less important as you can easily add or remove lots of scenes without making it very noticeable. Although flawed, I thought overall this method added to the fun loving nature of the movie and kept it very entertaining. Most of the different stories are good, specifically the stranger, the Murphy's and the vampire, but others were not so good. <br /> <br /> The acting isn't great, but I didn't find it bad. Dominic Monaghan had a good performance as he manages to be serious when it comes to playing and also plays well in the comic parts of the film. <br /> <br /> The characters were not extremely deep, but they were all interesting. . I also enjoyed how a number of the villains were done in an over-the-top almost comic book. The part with the background of the Murphy's and their gang is priceless. <br /> <br /> Overall, I sell the dead very successfully and combine horror, comedy and sci-fi into a mish mix of fun and excitement. It's one of the more interesting and original movies I've seen for a while, and it's unfortunate that independent movies like this no longer get recognition.
