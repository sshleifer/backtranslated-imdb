Like all the earliest movies, this "movie" is very, very short - lasting in one minute! So, because of its shortness, it's not really possible to compare it to more modern movies. But for the time being, it's actually a very remarkable movie. Many of these are because the pictures are hand-painted - Annabelle appears red and other colors as she does her wonderful dance. I actually saw two different versions - one where she is red and another where she changes the whole color. I think the red one featured on the DVD "The Great Train Robbery and Other Primary Works" is the best of them. The dance itself is very hypnotic and much like a wonderful performance art. And unlike other one-minute (or less) movies of the day, it's one that I could see repeatedly - it's just visually compelling and strange. <br /> <br /> If you want to see it online, there's a 36 second version on Google Video (type in "serpentine dance").
