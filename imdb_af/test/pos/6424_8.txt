"Footprints (on the moon) are almost certainly the strangest, most complicated and atypical Giallo ever made. It may come as a limitation for some of the subgenre's fans, but this film does not contain many of the regular Giallo brands such as bloody knife murders (preferably committed by a masked killer wearing black gloves), a spectacular attractive beauty and unpredictable red herring. But to compensate all this? and much more ?? "Footprints" benefit from the most indescribably mysterious and non-compelling atmosphere I have ever experienced in this type of film. The level of mystery in this movie is so high and unbearable that it literally makes you feel uncomfortable and scared. Like the female protagonist Alice Cespi herself, you have absolutely no idea what is happening or why, and this feeling of extreme powerlessness is undoubtedly the main player of the movie. As a viewer, you want to help this poor woman understand the things that come to her, but you just can't. Alice has a successful career as an interpreter, but her quiet and tranquil life is brutally interrupted when she wakes up one morning and begins to realize she has absolutely no memory of the previous three days. She finds a torn photo of a hotel on the holiday island of Gama and decides to go there to investigate what has happened. On the island, many people, including a lonely little daughter, Alice, but just the counterfeit Nicole, have worn a reddish-colored wig and acted as she came to the island to hide from an unknown danger. Meanwhile, even the poor girl's nights are restless because she repeats astronauts' dreams that jump on the moon surface and an unconscious scientist, dr. Blackman, call it. The plot of "Footprints" is really bizarre and slow breaking, and especially the cosmic subplot is really hard to call with the rest. Alice assumes they are just pictures of a Sci-Fi movie she's seen for a long time, which seems to be a reasonable enough explanation, but you feel there is a deeper meaning and real relationship with all the other events. Fans of stress-driven and stylish Italian theater can't afford to miss this movie really. It is Luigi Bazzoni's psychological tour-de-force, with exquisite photography and mental music. Despite the lack of violence (or perhaps just through it), the film is really disturbing and the spiritual pain that Alice is having is also affecting the viewer emotionally. As it is unfortunately too often in Gialli Theater, the climax suddenly comes up and does not give a waterproof explanation of all the awkward events that you have only seen the last hour and a half. However, the content of "Footprints" will consider you long after the movie is finished and its powerful impact will only increase. Florinda Bolkan is sublime as the top-ranked lady and receives excellent feedback from the limited supportive role, including young Nicoletta Elmi. The leading Euro-cult star, Klaus Kinski, also receives top billing, but his role is simply an extensive cameo. This movie is actually much better than director Bazzoni's more famous (and much easier available) Giallo "The Five Cord", so here's to hope that "Footprints" will soon also receive a fine DVD release.
