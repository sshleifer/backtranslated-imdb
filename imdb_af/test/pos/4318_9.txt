a very good episode, although it is not devastating at the end of season 1. The idea of ​​making it a Desmond flashback worked very well, and Henry Ian Cusick was fantastic. Perhaps I have tackled the best performance of this whole series, but my only complaint would be that the Michael plot line felt very much like a subplot, and after three minutes the previous episode, I thought it would work more. But the power of Cusicks's character and performance has gone through it. The plot developments, as always, left more questions and answers, like the others, something we still don't know and where to take Jack, Sawyer and Kate. What was the white light, what impact did it have? Are Locke, Eko and Desmond dead? as the hatch was destroyed for them. If it is, it would be a big mistake, as these three are the most interesting characters and the series will be without them and Terry O'Quinn is fantastic in both series as Locke. A fit finale after a better series than the first.
