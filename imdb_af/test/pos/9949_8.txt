I remember remembering that almost every day I left school to catch KTLA's channel 5 monster films, but I never went home faster when this movie was scheduled. Somehow, the idea of ​​being a boy and having a giant robot as a friend addressed me in a very unique way. Sure, I pretended to be Spiderman, Batman and other superheros, but I really wanted to be Johnny Sakko about any of them. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen this movie in 30 years and I still remember it wisely. Who can forget how Giant Robot shot his fingers! Or how about the way Ghuillotene throws his fingernails to make explosions! Geez, I can even whistle the theme music that plays at the end, which is so tragic that I remember crying myself to sleep a few times! <br /> <br /> Only one other movie has the kind of magic this movie does in my mind and that is the wizard of oz. But I've seen the movie many times since I was a kid. Of course, Oz's wizard is a real classic, while Voyage Into Space is a low budget nonsense. These two films should not even be mentioned in the same sense, but for a young boy it is not a high production value or continuity that captures your heart, its flying monkeys and giant robots! <br /> <br /> P.S. My cousin uses a very accurate impression of Giant Robot (he pronounced it 'Giant Robutt'.) If you remember, Giant Robot had a special way to shoot his missiles and my cousin chilled it cold. I repeated him the routine endlessly for my personal entertainment.
