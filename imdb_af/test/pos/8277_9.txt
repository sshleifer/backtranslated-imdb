The feature-length CGI movie has just been released this year, but while children will have a lot of fun, for the tough Alvin fanatics and followers who grew up with the 60's and 80's of the cartoon programs, The Chipmunk Adventure is probably the best Alvin and the Chipmunks-based animated film, ever. <br /> <br /> To start, the animation is just as great, the character designs are as they should be in the cartoons - unlike the movie movie itself is just beautiful to watch. There are no celeb voices, no CGI generated effects, just pure quality 2-D, hand-drawn animation and the colors are fantastic-bright, bold and beautiful. The jokes and humor are typical chipmunk standards and the narrative is spot-on. In fact, The Chipmunk Adventure is all that the live action movie should have been, but it is not. Alvin, Simon and Theodore compete with the Chipettes, Elenor, Jeanette and Britney in a hot air balloon game and on the way the kids encounter all sorts of problems and dilemmas that they have to solve in their own way. And the chipmunk movie is not complete without the strange versions of classic rock and pop songs. <br /> <br /> The Chipmunk Adventure is for kids and adults, which is also a lead over the CGI movie - like the 2007 version will get some new admirers, the 1987 movie will appeal on both young and older Chipmunk fans. Bagdarasian and Karman give the helium-like voices of the trio of the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a must for fans of the cartoon programs themselves. You won't be disappointed. If you've seen the live action version, you'll feel that this movie is a much better contrast. If you don't have it, you still need to see it or even forget about the Jason lee movie and keep it as an alternative.
