I don't want to write too much about the movie, but basically it's an action / comedy with a little romance that is thrown into about two men who come together in unlikely conditions and join the highway men. Fantastic performance by Robert Carlysle and everyone involved. A brilliant 'baddy' that really makes you hate. Some great comic lines - actually loud, wonderful action and a good plot. Choosing music and atmosphere is all fantastic, basically brilliantly directed and brilliantly written. I recommend this movie to someone who likes a good British movie or a good bit of action, I don't know why the movie never started. I thought it didn't get as much recognition as it deserved. If you're for nothing else, look at this movie for one of the best finals of all time. To give away nothing, but this one really gets the heart beating!
