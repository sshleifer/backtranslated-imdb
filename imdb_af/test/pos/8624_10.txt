with what they had. John and Carolyn were very private, so the writers had to put together what they could. I loved Portia de Rossi very much like Carolyn, but Jacqueline Bisset's voice grabbed my nerves. She had to use her regular voice. I would have preferred the whole movie to focus on John and Carolyn, rather than reflecting on what we already know about John.
