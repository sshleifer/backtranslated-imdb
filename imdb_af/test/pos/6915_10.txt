Inferno gives Los Angeles what it deserves - a baptism in the fire, death from above. An excellent throw of obsessive characters can survive and sweat the passing of the coronal mass ejection, but it won't be fun and certainly not dramatic. A very light overview in Variety criticized the characters for worrying about their personal redemption instead of saving the world. But what is refreshing about this great heat is that there is nothing anyone can do about it. We are, therefore, not merely subjected to "heartwarming" scenes of fascist presidents and other great blowhard statists, seeing their relentless plots to save a chosen remnant of humanity (Ala Deep Impact). Here, the sweaty and funny dirty half dozen work out their own salvation or see their personal oblivions in the old fashioned way - together as individuals or ...... alone with the Only One. Excellent TV movie everything. Clearly not denatured by the devastating meanness of overwhelming Network Execs. I recommend.
