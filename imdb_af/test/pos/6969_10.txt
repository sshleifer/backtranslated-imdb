Ghoulies IV should not be the best of the series, but it is not bad. If you don't take it seriously, enjoy it. <br /> <br /> It is nice to see Peter Liapis back as Johnathan Graves who rose with magic and became a detective, but still thinks about what happened in Ghoulies. <br /> <br /> The plot is about a woman named Alexandra, it's Johnathan's ex-girlfriend who breaks into a museum and takes a red jewel and uses the jewel she wakes up her boyfriend Faust, this is Johnathan's dark side, but he needs the jewel so he can enter the real world and send John to hell. <br /> <br /> Something goes wrong and Alex loses the jewelry so she has to get a new one because she leaves the gate is still open and two little Ghoulies named Lite and Drak appear. They are not the real Ghoulies, as they look like guys in a Troll costume wearing a mask, but it doesn't matter, as they are humorous in parts. <br /> <br /> Lite and Dark have to find Johnathan because he can send them home so they walk around causing chaos if they try to find Johnathan. Another difference is that the two Ghoulies are the good guys, unlike the previous ones. <br /> <br /> I found Ghoulies IV to be good, but this movie may not be for everyone, watch out if you keep low budget movies like Troll 2.
