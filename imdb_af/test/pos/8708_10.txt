It's a perfect example of a Classic Full Moon Pictures movie. Any fan of Horror / Vampire Flicks should definitely check this one. Original Plot and Good, Easy to Follow Story. Also, this movie has some heart-racing scenes that combine Horror with action. From now on, the only successor I've seen on this movie, Part IV, which I have to say is almost better than this original. <br /> <br /> I give it 10/10 <br /> <br /> Fans of Horror Movies like this should check out Puppet Master, Slumber Party Massacre, Skinned Alive, Sleep Away Camp, and other Full Moon Pictures flicks.
