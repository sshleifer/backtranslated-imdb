'Check Out' is an extraordinary film that is above most movie production tournaments. His refreshing, humorous humor is never an excuse to stay superficial. On the contrary, the film explores multiple facets of human spirit and human relationships. The warm approach promotes tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of what unites all people. The characters are charming and amusing, reflecting the idiosyncrasies we can all laugh about in ourselves. The quick dialogue and witty villain will keep you on your toes, and you may find your own laugh, because you won't miss a single phrase! You will probably want to see it in the movie and then (over several times) on video, and every time you discover something new. After each look, you're sure to feel warm and upset.
