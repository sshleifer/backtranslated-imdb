It was alarmingly close, but the China Syndrome received the worst kind of publicity when the accident took place at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Power Station. I still remember the whole country's attention was captured on hourly bulletins coming from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. And if you don't know, a scientist in The China Syndrome describes the worst scenario of making an area as large as the state of Pennsylvania uninhabitable. <br /> <br /> Less than a decade later in Ukraine in Chernobyl, the Soviet Union has dealt with such a crisis in its last days. The China Syndrome has again become a relevant film. <br /> <br /> The movie is more about cutting corners for safety than it is about anti-core. Jack Lemmon is a man who has lived his life with nuclear power as the captain of a nuclear submarine. What makes him angry and puts him off to create the confrontation that climbs the movie is the stupidity and greed of the drivers. Dumbness and greed, though products are found every day. The problem with them is that there are places where it can be tolerated in human society. <br /> <br /> Lemmon shares star accounts with some well-known Hollywood progeny, Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas. Jane is a TV news reporter who is constantly attributed to puff feature stories and only happens at a nuclear power plant when an accident occurs. The renovation of her own station and her later encounter with Lemmon turned off the chain of events depicted in The China Syndrome. <br /> <br /> However, Fonda's best scene I thought with Peter Donat a news executive at her station. Look at her facial expressions as Donat fluffers the importance of the story and tells her she demands her beauty that she likes puff pieces. Fonda knows she has something and sticks with it. <br /> <br /> Michael Douglas plays her iconoclastic cameraman, it was a typical part for him back in the day. In his TCM tribute to his father, Kirk Douglas, Michael said he chose roles that were sensitive. Nevertheless, I could have seen a young Kirk Douglas in this part. <br /> <br /> What to do about energy for industrial and post industrial nations, a tough problem our government will cover for a few generations. This film shows what can happen with a dependency on nuclear power. Our current geopolitical problems in the world are partly due to a dependence on fossil fuels, specifically oil. Consequently, everything we use brings unforeseen consequences. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the real hero of the film is Wilford Brimley, Lemmon's colleague at the nuclear power plant. In the end, Brimley really gets on the board. <br /> <br /> See The China Syndrome to know what I'm talking about.
