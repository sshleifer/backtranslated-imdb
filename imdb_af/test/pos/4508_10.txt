I both read the book and saw the movie. The storyline is so powerful that almost any script or script could justify it. So nothing there. However, it is still a beautiful film, as it makes one think and feel, just like the book. To look at it is not like looking at a documentary in a failed state and feeling sympathetic to people suffering from a repressive regime, but is like looking at any other general's story about generations over continents unfold. Amir's cowardice, his guilt, his dilemmas and eventually his choice of a way of salvation became a story of any of us. There is not a single infallible character to look at and humble, but everyone is gray, just like us all. <br /> <br /> Another important remark is that the movie does a good job chronishing the lives of Afghans over the twenty years of turbulent political scenarios. The lively, carefree childhood represents Kabul before the Russian invasion and the desolate, broken remains of the city echo that the Taliban did to it. <br /> <br /> The child actors earn 'thumbs up' all the way. They can disgrace an outdated actor. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie or read the book yet, just go into the theater thinking you'll see a multi-layered story on a multicolored fabric of human emotions and sentiments . This film is not meant to stir anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban feelings, but to feel the trials of human existence. <br /> <br /> I read some of the external reviews linked to the site and I have to admit that I don't see the point in writing reviews that summarize the storyline as a distant spectator and on technical details about great cinematography or something similar. At least for this movie you should try to link it rather than judging it objectively.
