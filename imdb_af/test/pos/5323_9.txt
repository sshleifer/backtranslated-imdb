It's a movie that really reminds you of your life, our culture, family structures and situational actions. I won't give the plot in this post, I think others have already hit me. I hope that, despite reading opinions on this site, you will have the opportunity to see this movie for yourself. I saw this movie with my husband and a friend and I must say, after the movie was there, there was total silence in the theater. After a few minutes I looked behind me and everyone in the theater looked at the screen, lost in mind. This will deepen your depth in your psychologist to devise a number of things: <br /> <br /> How much does society affect my life and the lives of my generation? <br /> <br /> How long has someone been paying for mistakes they made? <br /> <br /> If a second chance is given, is it ever realized? <br /> <br /> Is it better to stay in a box or not to live at all? <br /> <br /> My questions aren't meant to show me approval or disapproval of Leland's actions. I do not want my opinion of them to determine in any way what you will take away from this movie so that I do not give it. See it for yourself. I'm still thinking, and trying to answer many questions from the movie. I really enjoyed it and hope you will too. This movie does not attempt to answer questions, condemn any action or promote any punishment. This film is trying to evaluate us all of our lives and pick up the bright glasses that most of us see in the world. <br /> <br /> Great movie. 9 out of 10 stars
