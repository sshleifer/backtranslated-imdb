David Tennant and Sarah Parish's brilliant play had me in tears, as many of the scenes were so familiar to me. My husband had a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1977 and needed a major operation that elevated the brain and applied the lick. Like Tricia, I was naive enough to expect him to return to his former self. After more than 25 years of love and caring for him, he left me without warning to go with a woman he almost knew. He then asked and I am now going through a divorce. I hope the program has helped people understand how to treat brain injury.
