TEP is like a long cooldrink water after crawling across the Sahara to classic movie buffers that have been deprived of that particular movie magic for too long! Not only is it beautifully photographed, but the characters are perfectly portrayed. If you are looking for the movie to be a mirror of the book, you will be seriously disappointed. Instead, it's an excellent "companion" to the book, and I think that's what Anthony Minghella meant. Ralph Fiennes is probably the most beautiful man in the world; Not to mention a brilliant actor. Juliette Binoche is the poster source for vulnerability and childlike enthusiasm. And of course I'm going to see a movie featuring Kristin Scott Thomas. She has to be the best actress ever since Deborah Kerr's debut. So much has been promised with this movie, and so much has been delivered!
