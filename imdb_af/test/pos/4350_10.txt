Little Dieter has to fly is another in the remarkable body of Werner Herzog's filmless work. Having recently reviewed it on DVD, he lost nearly a decade after his initial American release in 1997. No one has lost his power and its impact on documentary documents is as diverse as Herzog's own recent Grizzly Man and Errol Morris's Oscar Oscar. Of War. Like the former, it is in his shortest 74 minutes the details of an interesting American. Like the latter, it gives a glimpse of the side of the war that sees little. Yes, we see the violence and heroism, but if the fog of war brought us into the minds of one of the foremost hot-heaters of the last century, let's take a look at the life of a grunt by the enemy caught, tortured, and finally triumphed. Except, in no way, shape or form, the film is as simplistic or optimistic as my brief description of it. Also, Dieter Dengler and the German immigrants did not survive the Nazi death (we find out that in his hometown, Wildburg, in the Black Forest, his grandfather was the only man to vote for Hitler, and suffered brutally for that position) after World War II Germany and its own imprisonment in the hands of the Vietcong, when its Air Force jet was shot down on Laos on 1 February 1966. While the title of the movie, and the idea of ​​Dengler's passion to become a pilot, is being stirred by the impression that allied fighter planes made on him when he disrupted his village as a child, Dengler believes that the central subject of the movie, that's not true. The subject is Dengler's survival, or more precisely, his human will, all human will. The details of Dengler's romantic life are too Hollywood and is an aspect of interest in Herzog. Nor did he win a Purple Heart, Medal of Honor, the D.F.C, and the Navy Cross. The thing that Dengler pressed to survive so much, and remains such a relatively optimistic man (although there are darker sides), is in the middle of this film and the entire Herzog's canon. Dieter Dengler's past distant barbarian dream is mature Herzog Country, and the use of a Madagascan kang, Oay Lahy E, during many jungle screens, including excellent touch scores, shows that Herzog may only be with Martin Scorsese , the best manipulator of image and music in film. Long may he merge!
