This movie is based on the game series: Final Fantasy. This one is especially about FF7 or Final Fantasy VII. I loved the game, and I was very happy to see it turned into a movie, I loved the CG, it was wonderful. Lot's of great battle scenes, action and characters to make the movie unforgettable. If you are the hard-working fan of the game you will love this movie. Personally, I'm not the hard-working fan of the games, but I'm starting to become one. <br /> <br /> My favorite character from Final Fantasy VII except Cloud, must be Cid. I love Cid, I think he's cute. I was amazed at how real the CG images were, it was wonderful, it's the game in 3D. I had a good time watching the movie, and by the way, I love the aeons, especially Bahamut, he's great! Overall I gave this movie a 9 because yes, I loved it. I thought it was a really good movie, and yes it is on my movie list. The characters were incredible, the CG loved, the story was wonderful, with lots of action and fighting. All-in-all, this is the best movie I've ever seen, based on a video game.
