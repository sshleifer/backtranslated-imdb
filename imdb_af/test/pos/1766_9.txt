I was surprised, "Once More, My Darling" did not generate enough votes (at this letter) for a "user rating". This is a "scorching" comedy that I have enjoyed over the years. Robert Montgomery's mission puts him in some very unlikely situations, and he's just the man for the job. He keeps his trademark "bevuddled" by the film and hysterically as well. Ann Blyth plays his provisional / eccentric prosecutor, who accepts a relationship that doesn't exist. Her character is fascinating enough to justify the undeserved nickname "Killer", but remains cute and fun. <br /> <br /> Under the flute of B-movies of the late 1940s and 1950s, "Once More, My Darling" is a standpoint. This one is worth looking for.
