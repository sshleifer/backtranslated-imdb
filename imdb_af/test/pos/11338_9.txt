Like many of Wong's films, many find them boring and confusing. Well, I like them and I love this movie as well. I went out and rented it on DVD and I watched it 3 times. This is a very subtle film that offers an intoxicating experience. for those who didn't enjoy it ...... you just wasted 2 hours of your life ... bad ... muhahahahaha.
