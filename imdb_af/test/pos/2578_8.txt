In Mississippi, former bluesman Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) is in crisis, missing his wife who just left him. He finds that the town lock and the nimfomaniac Rae (Chritina Ricci) are plunging on the road near his small farm, drying, beating and almost dead. Lazarus brings her home, gives medicine and nursing and feeds her like a father, holding her chain to control her heat. When her boyfriend Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) is fired from the army because of his question, he understands the relationship between Lazarus and Rae and tries to kill him. <br /> <br /> "Black Snake Moon" is a strange story of faith, hope, love and blues. The gift Christina Ricci has an impressive performance in the role of a young tramp that has been abused by her father since childhood and had sex with the whole town where she lives. It's amazingly the versatility of this actress, and probably it's the most mature work I've seen Christina Ricci. Samuel L. Jackson also has a fantastic performance in the role of Lazarus. The soundtrack is one of the most beautiful I've ever heard in a movie, with wonderful blues. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Entre o Cuu e o Inferno" ("Between Heaven and Hell")
