I remember seeing this movie in the theater and enjoying it. I just strangled on fear last month and looked at it again and found it better with age. First, for those of you who describe it as an 80-year-old cheese if you have objectively compared the horror flicks over the past two decades, it compares very well to being picked up against films in his unique horror subgenre, which I regard as action as opposed to psychological horror such as "The Shining" or "the Exorcist". <br /> <br /> The budget for the budget really offers the goods (or in this case bad). The film actually has a character development and gives enough of a history of the infamous body to get the atmosphere right before the characters sit in the front door. The movie also features several hilarious one linen and gives the appropriate mood that a creepy horrorflick should have. If you compare NOD to current big budget horror movies like "I'm Legend" (The Vincent Price version was much better), this movie is really out. Modern horror flicks almost completely dominated by CGI. Most have no plot or character design and are completely predictable. The special effects dominate these movies from start to finish and the characters are 24k plastic. If it's an 80-year-old horror chase, I'll take it over 95% of the current genre entries. <br /> <br /> On a closing letter NOD sees me remembering the wonderful Jill Terashita again and wondering why I didn't see her in more movies horror or otherwise. Jill on the odd chance you read it. I think you are beautiful and should have been in more movies. Lastly, if you like action noise sounds, you'll probably like this one.
