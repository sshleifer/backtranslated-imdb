I'm always impressed when a director (and this director / scriptwriter) takes a piece of classical text - and makes it alive. Certainly, Shakespeare's text can give you goosebumps even when it is hammered into self-interest, but to see a production where true ingenuity makes even more wonderful words. Providing context or nuance that is not found in the stage, it is simply awesome. . There are many disturbing things about the play. This is a racist game about racism - and it still sticks. I never accepted Jessica's abandonment of her father for no acceptable reason. I have never accepted Christians' position of sacred self-righteousness. But, brilliantly, there is a textologist who helps us understand the times and politics in which the story is set, and graciously many of Jessica's part is cut. <br /> <br /> The text is very stripped with many passes. But I only saw one line cut at the moment I expected it to be heard - and it was replaced by a look that said it all. This economy and judicious editing gave us a gripping movie - not just a movie of the play. <br /> <br /> And finally there is a rationale why Antonio is so faithful and generous to the undeserved / unrelated Bassanio - you can almost feel that Antonio's pulse is starting to race when he gets a look at Bassanio's passing in a gondola, or for a visit. But it is as subtle as it is - no more. I was playing. <br /> <br /> There were many other highlights. I felt that the arguments during the trial were heartbreaking. And the lawyers' trials are hilarious. <br /> <br /> Add everything to glorious cinematography and costumes that resonated with times, and you'll understand why I can't wait to see it again. And again.
