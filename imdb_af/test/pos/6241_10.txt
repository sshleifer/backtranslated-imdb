This is one of my favorite horror movies of all time and I thought it never really resulted. This is until I read the glowing reviews here. It seems like the same thing I did when I first saw it. <br /> <br /> It's a damn creepy movie, and I've spent most of my life watching crazy movies. I always found dolls, mannequins and such damn creepies! Look at the dolls in "Beyond the Door" and of course the great "Trilogy of Terror". And what about the wonderful Twilight Zone episode "Living Doll". Hell, baby is creepy! And Tourist Trap has a few moments that will leave your hair on the back of your neck. Everything that is helped by an excellent soundtrack that makes Connors' performance even more heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the trailer on this movie on the late-night TV and thing, "Wow, I need to see it!" It was memorable. And that's one of the only trailers I remember seeing as a kid who crept me. Took my years to see it, but it was a surprise. <br /> <br /> Stephen King also mentions this film in his book "Danse Macabre" and gives it a glowing recommendation. Pretty good company. <br /> <br /> This movie will always be high on my most beautiful list. This is a true solid addition to the genre of the time and deserves the best of the 70s sliders.
