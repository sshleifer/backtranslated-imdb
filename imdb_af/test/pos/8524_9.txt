This is an excellent James Bond movie. Although not part of the original and more well-known series, and it is a standalone film, it is well done. Returning Sean Connery to return to the role he made famous was a genius stroke. He titled the movie in a way that refers to his previous vow not to play Bond again. Connery was as big as he was in his earlier 007 appearances. The script is outstanding as well as the photography and the performances. This is the earliest movie I remember with Kim Basinger, who became much more famous after this movie. Barbara Carrera was excellent; and Klaus Maria Brandauer was absolutely perfect as the chief villain. Regular references to the aging of Bond and the changing times and attitudes of British secret service were most humorous. The 007 gadgets looked like those of other Bond movies. The only thing missing was the well-known 007 music theme, which of course could not be used by this competitive production. It was wonderful for me to see two excellent James Bond movies in the same year, this one and Octopussy with Roger Moore. An interesting aspect of the movie is the emphasis on video games and computer graphics. The early 80's was the first boom of such things, and using them in this movie made it a very contemporary movie. The movie is actually another version of Thunderball, updated with newer technology. Regardless of the repeated theme, there are enough differences to make it entertaining. I'll watch this one regularly.
