LIFEFORCE was one of Cannon Films' biggest flops. It received mostly bad reviews and did nothing to help director Tobe Hooper's career in the wake of the Spielberg / POLTERGEIST controversy. All this is unfortunate, because LIFEFORCE is actually a very good movie. It is extremely entertaining, moving fast and incorporating some of the most outrageous top, production, performances and special effects ever exploding on the screen! It should have been odd on our paper: the manufacturers of THE DELTA FORCE, author of Alien, director of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, the composer of BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S, the special effects wizards of STAR WARS ... Audience was not ready for this demented exercise in strangers. <br /> <br /> What more do you want ??? We have an alien spaceship full of giant bats! We have a sexy, naked space vampiress that excites people's souls! We have explosive bodies! We have zombies! We have owned! We have an S&M inquiry! We set fire to the whole city of London! This is Dracula meets NAME OF THE LIVING DEATH meets QUARTERMASS AND WHO MEET THE PIT EARTHQUAKE. It is probably the most outrageous horror / sci-fi / comedy / action / disaster / erotic / apocalyptic epic ever, which if there are any others there. <br /> <br /> Try watching this movie. while being chemically changed. Maybe you'll understand. A truly f *** ed up experience, and one of Tobe Hooper's most underrated movies. Maybe it will one day find its audience.
