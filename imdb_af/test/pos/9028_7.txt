It's not a serious movie, and it doesn't seem like that, but it's not as bad as some of its reviews, it's the title and the first ten minutes will lead you to expect. <br /> <br /> The plot is very silly, but it adds to the light-hearted fun and enthusiasm that goes through the movie. The characters are played sympathetically and usually avoid the morbid sentimentality that usually occurs in these movie genres. <br /> <br /> Unusual in London, sympathetic to geeks, it's worth it to be a watch when this happens; If you want a little folly, don't give up on your unbelief.
