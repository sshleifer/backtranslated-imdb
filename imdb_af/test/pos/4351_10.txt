I didn't know what to expect when I decided to watch this documentary. I knew it was about an ex-Viet Nam POW in Laos that escaped, but I didn't know much more. In fact, I didn't expect too much. Oh, what a surprise! The story of this man's life is in itself very interesting. But what sets this film apart from other biography-type documents is that Dieter himself tells most of the story itself. Dieter is very comfortable in front of the camera. His personality really shines. He tells his story about his life in Germany during World War II and the suffering. We are there with him in the same small town he describes his family, inspiration and struggle. We follow him to America and his way to fulfill his dream of being a pilot. Then Dieter describes his story of capture, escape and survival in the Laoist jungle. We are with him again in that very jungle as he describes and re-establishes his imprisonment and path to freedom with great detail. We see the same primitive huts, villagers, and forms of detention he dealt with. It really hasn't changed for 30 years. We see the thick jungle, mountain terrain, and rivers Dieter challenged during his escape. It helps us to understand his emotions, pain and fate. I enjoyed the man, the story and the style. Work Well Done!
