When I started looking at 3 of the episodes of this series on the Action Channel, I have to say from all the shows I saw that the DSP was released. This one is one of the best performances of all time. I had to see it again, and then I got my chance. I bought the whole set of this series at Best Buy for my 20th birthday. And I enjoyed it, and see more of the episodes I missed on Action Channel, and the same 3 episodes I saw. My favorite characters in this show are: Sylvia, Leon and Nigel. The animation in this series was the best, and the hard packs were cool too. But the show also has a good cast like: Chris Patton, Jason Douglas, Christine Auten, and Hillary Hague, and more. So if you like this program on Action Channel, you should own it on DVD. That's the best, and you'll see what I mean.
