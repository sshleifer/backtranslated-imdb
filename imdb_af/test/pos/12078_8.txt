It must be the ultimate chick flick. We got it from the T.V. tied years ago and I've been watching it 30 times over the years. I haven't seen it for about 12 years and recently watched this movie. I do not lie, I cried from the opening credits to the end credits. This movie breaks your heart even if you don't have children.
