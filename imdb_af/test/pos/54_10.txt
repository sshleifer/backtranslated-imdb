It was a good movie. Something not just for the Black History month, but as a reminder of the goodness of people and the statement that it really takes a village to raise a child. The performances by S Eptath were outstanding. Mos Def and his song were off the hook. I had to do a double task when I saw it, there was Rosie Peres. But the supporting film from actors and actresses made it worth watching. All the different stories they had were wonderful. And how Nanny protects Yr and literally everyone who was in her presence. I can really understand that she was the matriarch of that period and even more so tired of helping everyone. Can't wait for it to come out on DVD. It will be a welcome addition to any movie library.
