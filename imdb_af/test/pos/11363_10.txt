My introduction to a lifelong love for Shakespeare. My brother was 5 and I was not quite 7 when WTTW Chicago broadcast an age of kings. It became a family ritual to look at, including the reserves. As an autumn series, my dad bought us a rare treat for the Midwest pomegranates; and my mom will pop corn on the stove. Great because of actors whose names didn't matter to me (though I will never forget the sore young Sean Connery as Hotspur), but now! And they published the scripts in paperback so we can follow and find out the language. I managed to memorize most of Richard III about it. So glad to see it coming on DVD! Highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with Shakespeare or English history.
