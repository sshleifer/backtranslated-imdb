Do not torture a duckling is an absolutely stunning giallo distraction for Lucio Fulci. Unlike other subgenre heavyweights such as Mario Bava and Dario Argento, Fulci takes a definite keen, grounded and social-perceptive approach to the giallo story in this movie. There is nothing glamorous about the child murders and border philosophy (a 1972 gutsy subplot), and Fulci shows with a sturdy and turbulent eye, avoiding flash, melodrama and legal philosophy. The proceedings are structured by gory and instantly sensible pieces further enhanced by Fulci's frightening realism? The deeply disturbing "witch death" scene in particular, with its bald-headed brutality, feels like a sniff film. Composer Riz Ortolani bookmarks these massacre-filled scenes with furious reverberation string bumps. <br /> <br /> The film is concluded by a lyrical and violent conclusion clashing with theology, morality, fanaticism and superstition. It is a deeply effective end that has the ability to leave the viewer in a fertilized and disarmed torpor. <br /> <br /> Fulci couldn't have picked a better place for this movie. Do not torture a duckling, photographed in and around the ancient city of Matera, Italy. As Matera is being modernized today (which is marked by its shift from an agricultural economy to an industrial one), it is grappling with its UNESCO-sponsored reputation as a holder of mysterious paleolithic ghosts. The concerns of the real Materani are reflected by the characters in the film, who, with their Christianity on their sleeves, confront an exotic peace tradition (namely, witchcraft) falling outside the norm. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, Matera is also used as a built-in place for Jerusalem in Mel Gibson's Passion of Christ. If that's something, it adds even more strength to Fulci's message. Catholic guilty feelings and bigies are such a resonant combination.
