For all the people who believe the dialogue is worth something and appreciate a farce that is clever enough to take it seriously, this movie will surprise you. It's not a whodunit for people who can't follow the verbal exchange of our hero, Professor Dexter Cornell (Dennis Quaid). <br /> <br /> Cornell learning in Southern California, near the tar pits. He did not publish a novel in four years, his wife divorced him, he drank a little, and was blessed or cursed with biting white which he freely gave to his students. He recommended a friend for progress, and one shining young student submitted a manuscript for him as a standalone project. Cornell doesn't even want to read it, so give it an "A" and push it to the side. He leaned back with a drink in his office. He stares out of the window when the shiny young student falls over his window on the road to meet the pavement in a splat. <br /> <br /> Come talk, and chat, drink even more. The Cornell realizes that he should now read the manuscript. When he goes home, his wife waits for divorce papers. He drinks even more. She left, and he went to a faculty issue, just to get her there. He drinks even more. And when his wife learns that the student is dead, she sleeps and learns that she has had a relationship with the student. Of course, it asks him to drink more seriously. The next morning he wakes up to find himself in the dormitory of one of his students, a first-class man named Syd (Meg Ryan). <br /> <br /> He feels worse than a hangover, goes to the doctor and learns he's poisoned, it's irreversible, and he has 24-48 hours to live. He doesn't have much time to figure out who killed him, and there are subtypes, motives, relationships and surprises at every turn, though everything makes sense at the end. All his discoveries and exchanges are decorated with sarcasm, dry white and sharp observations. Let's just say that this movie will give new meaning to the phrase "publish or perish". <br /> <br /> There are no bad performances in this movie. There are repetitive images, and symbolism is used with careful intervals. Look for the cracked glass, and images twisted by glass. Camera shots are revolutionary for 1988, and some of the violent action is carefully and skillfully choreographed. The music is inconspicuous and appropriate, but sometimes it makes its own statement, in song lyrics. The footage in this movie is impressive. <br /> <br /> If there are any bugs, it is that the opening moves a little slower for 20 minutes, and almost lets you sleep. <br /> <br /> There are, however, no explicit sexual encounters, although there is violence and a bad language. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <> This is a writer's movie, and is best appreciated by those who have a sense of humor about their own success or failure . I think if you take it seriously, you're already in big trouble.
