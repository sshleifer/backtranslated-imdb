This show was crazy when it first went on. The first actress that played the daughter did not play the role, the writing was hit or miss, and Damon Wayans CLEARLY was not comfortable doing such a Cornball family friendly performance. The chemistry between himself and Tisha Cambell (they have long been friends, just like everyone of the Wayans group with Tisha's husband and Will Smith and Jada Pinkett). They work so that they resume the show. Once it came back, they recreated the daughter, made the boy a lot of stupid (a la Eric of "Boy Meets World") and became the youngest daughter in a genius ... (later they made her a little genius - boyfriend given comic guest appearance). The show, while often running as a rollercoaster from the top buffalo to the coast, keeps the line enough to show it as a show that Damon Wayans can be comfortable in his own skin (especially since the main writers, directors and consultants were ALL members of the Wayans family and in their character. Once everyone had been on the show for a while, they were all in the strength and could make a consistent, funny performance on the air. <br /> <br /> However, there is too much buffering, too much over the top fraud, and often too much chaos happens in the life of the Kyle family. They also made Junior, they also made the oldest daughter an attractive, clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter was not even spared by the authors. I felt they jumped the shark and signed the death note when Junior made her girl pregnant, she moved in and married her and her parents were introduced. (Junior's wife's father's character makes my WINS think of him only). The show was funny ... but it was a UPN show on ABC, if it makes sense to the reader. <br /> <br /> The reserves are funny enough, but I'm relieved it's gone ... there was nowhere left to go with it. If it's bad, it's BAD BAD. It tends to be temporarily cornball, but he was at least a black man who had a sitcom. This makes it a big network syndication. Who can tell them now? (Given the CW merger and the "brownout" on TV networks lately, that is). One.
