It is a lightly photographed and extraordinarily well-written western by the veteran creator of "Rawhide" Charles Marquis Warren. Direcxtor Gordon Douglas is his main aid in this regard. His strong plot line can be told in a few sentences. An evil officer, Captain Richard Lance, takes a leader of the Indian enemy to a mass murder at a fort. He insists on bringing the man back to trial, to be sent to Tsonson; his commander sent another man to try to hear the prisoner and the patrol was wiped out. This means that the leader has escaped, and Lance must now lead a second patrol - and he chooses the men who can save the fort the most, a business of trouble - to defend the fort fortified and the command of " save another. attack by stopping the bottleneck in that sector. As Lance, young Gregory Peck is quite strong. Others in the big film of this movie, which sees life on a cavalry outpost, resemble a military establishment of heterogeneous and dubious species, including War Bond as a rare sergeant, Neville Brand and Steve Brodie, as a warrior maker, Warner Anderson and Lon Chaney. Jr. as psychologist troublemakers and Gig Young, Art Baker, Herbert Heyes as co-officers with Nana Bryant as the colonel's wife. Even Barbara Payton as the love interest comes in a difficult role; Michael Ansara is the captive war chief, and Jeff Corey plays the Fort's exploration. There are really two big scenes in this very well-made western - the long section at the fort before the last patrol is sent out, and that long patrol to the damned Ft. Defiant himself. Once at that fort, Peck gets a big speech in which he instructed the men at his request, and he tells everyone why he took it with them. read one or one of their shortcomings; they tell them why they think he sent his best friend to die in his place, take the Indian instead of himself - and he proves them wrong for the rest of the film by his lonely struggle through intelligence and courage. win. The music of Franz Waxman is good, the production characteristics admirable; The argument about what would happen if Lance took over the war is true; Unlike this insoluble central character, it is very western. It was my favorite for fifty years.
