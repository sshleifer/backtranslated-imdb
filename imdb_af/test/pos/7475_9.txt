In the middle of the night I turned to this movie and it almost skipped and managed. That's just because there was nothing else about it that I decided to see. In the end I thought it was wonderful. <br /> <br /> An interesting story, good characters, clever writing and brilliant direction make it a great movie to sit and watch. This was actually the first thing I heard about this movie, but I would have liked to pay money to see it at the theater. <br /> <br /> My IMDB score: 8 out of 10 <br /> <br />
