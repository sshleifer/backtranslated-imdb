If you saw the Telugu version of Gilli "Okkadu", you'll find it very similar in story line, but Gilli has different songs and takes place in Tamil Nadu, not Andra Pradesh. Although it's a remake of "Okkadu", you'll find that Vijay and Trisha make it a unique movie, Vijay and Trisha make a great combination. A few negative consequences were when Vijays character hit Trishas's character to buy him a gift. He never apologizes and she eventually stays with him. Good action and songs make it a great movie I recommend. <br /> <br /> I'm giving it a 10/10, one of the best I've seen.
