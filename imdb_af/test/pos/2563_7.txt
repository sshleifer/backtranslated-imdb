The hangman on this movie has focused so much on the chain (of course it is so sensational) that it missed most of the movie. It's about a developing, but rather drawn, relationship between Lazarus and Rae, as they are trying to recover from their past hurt with each other. <br /> <br /> Of course, with the appearance of a nymphomania in chains, it is not surprising that there is enough implied sex involved. However, in his core, Black Snake Moan is a basic story of salvation and the healing power of helping another person. Maybe it's just me, but I think poor Lazarus had to focus his story more. He is a sore man after his wife left him, but we never quite see how Rae helps repair her past's pain, but also for him. It is only implied that it means - in essence, he plays the wizard who helps the young Rae overcome her curse, through a large oil chain and some blues. <br /> <br /> I like the story, but I wish it was a little bit more and didn't have to rely on the sensational. The side characters were pretty decent, so simple and I like the music. The acting was good enough, although I cannot be sure the Rae character is fully credible. But that may just be my naivety. <br /> <br /> All in all, I liked the movie, but I wasn't obliged to do so. Maybe it's too critical, but the story seems a bit too comfortable to be credible and so, while it all looks very cool, I could never really buy it. The chain thing was a little too far-fetched for me. Yet it can be a little fun for those who are looking for dramatic redemptions with a blues shot. 10/07
