First of all I would like to say that I am only amateur in the commentary on movies and that English is not my mother tongue, but that I had a strong feeling that forced me to write about such a movie; possibly as a way of thanking C. Jay Cox, the cast and crew for such a brilliant production and congratulations. <br /> <br /> Yesterday I first watched "Last Days". <br /> <br /> Initially, I thought it might be similar to the movie "Priest", which I liked very much for displaying a gay priest from the cupboard. But "Priest," perhaps due to the limitation of Catholic Ideological concepts, did not provide for my spectator's needs by revealing a deeply sad end. <br /> <br /> "Last Days" broke that concept (and some others, like the principles of the Mormon); reveal a gentle and cheerful story that leads to a happy and emotional end, yet creates a sense of God's blessing and hope. A great movie indeed! <br /> <br /> Somehow, "Last Days" made me feel L.A. as a city of angels. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves amazing gay love stories!
