This film is a classic seventy policeman who for some reason has been overlooked. It's basically the French connection with Bullit. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider is the head of an elite group of detectives, known as the "Seven Ups" <br /> <br /> One of their husbands is discovered during a shelter and dies. <br /> <br /> Separator and his team must find his murderers. They become involved in a battle with the crowd. <br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie must be the motor yacht, which of course is included to pay cash for Bullit's success. However, this car drives Bullitt out because of its length, speed and sheer excitement. It is a breathtaking mountain ride that finally ends unexpectedly and spectacularly. Don't miss this gem!
