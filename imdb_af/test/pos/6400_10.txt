I think "Key West" can do well as a DVD. There are probably many failed Star Treks who have never had a chance to succeed. We'll never know if it could be a huge series. Would I like to know if there is a way to see older shows like this or are they just another Hollywood footnote? Is it possible to find copies of these shows so that our loyal oddballs can enjoy them again? The show had a great writing talent and some or all of the episodes left you with a feel for the characters who are often missing in current hit shows. I often got away with a feeling of learning something from the storylines and entertaining a lot through the unique characters. Thank you.
