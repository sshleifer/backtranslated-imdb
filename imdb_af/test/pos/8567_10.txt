H.O.T.S. is proof that the movie industry once said "F-OFF" to the sensors and made movies with what they wanted! In today's world, this movie will be "over" and "extreme" because it is everywhere or behind a velvet curtain. Although BestBuy had several copies on their $ 5.99 rack (in case someone wanted a copy)! The film was brilliant in its own way, loading humor into a T&A movie with Playboy Playmates! Unlike most skin flakes, it had a plot. However, this is not exactly why you are H.O.T.S. <br /> <br /> H.O.T.S. will not look. is a college movie reminiscent of the revenge of the Nerds movies, taking a group of "average people" and placing it against the elite-rich preppies that most people cannot stand! The only difference is that the "Nerds" in this movie get a much better chance of being laid! I see that there are a few people who will rate this movie low, and for me that is ignorant! Obviously it is not meant to win Oscars or to break into film barriers. If you are looking for it, see what the critics are choosing for you! You must appreciate the fact that this movie actually had a funny plot, act properly (mostly given the genre), and many girls became naked! H.O.T.S. is one of those movies that you watch to think of contemporary problems and daily stress, and rather, laugh and enjoy! If you are looking for a funny college-based movie that has enough skin to straighten a pink Miata, then you really need H.O.T.S. check!
