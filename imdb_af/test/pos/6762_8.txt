This is a novelty in Danish film. The mood is different from that of Shining Light, also by Anders Thomas Jensen, but with a new touch. One difference is fewer characters, which allow much more space for them to live. And what characters?! The two butchers are perfect. Mads Mikkelsen is a dominant, confused parody and Nikolaj Lie Cheese is a careless lover with a twin brother more or less an unholy pairing of the two.
