This is the last episode of the Goldenboy OVA series. Kentaro finds himself working in an animation studio, which is interesting if you know nothing about the way anime studios are run. Apart from episode 3, it was probably the least risque, but it had a good girl interest as well as a surprise reunion of others in previous episodes. My only complaint about this episode is that it was a bit too short, but it was just because it was the only original script for the show that was not based on one of the manga chapters. but it ended well and we have the nice feeling that Kentaro is permanently 25 and then studying. Certainly look the rest of the series completely, you can buy the whole range for about $ 17, you can do it in about 2 1/2 hours, or watch your favorite episode if you have 20 minutes of free time. (what I do if I have a lunch at school.) Good range, check it out.
