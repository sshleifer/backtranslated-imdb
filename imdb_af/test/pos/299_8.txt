It is that movie that many people get as a classic - Apocalypse Now, now a re-edited, redesigned, Redux 22 years after its original release. <br /> <br /> The movie is loosely based on Conrad's Heart of Darkness, which is the main plot (if one is). Capt. Willard's journey on a naval boat through the Vietnam conflict heading to a rogue colonel. (Colonel Kurtz) We see the characters and situations he meets, and he tells the story of the colonel on the way. <br /> <br /> My initial feelings about the movie are that sometimes it's not very gripping, especially early, but at least a good dose of comedy is being introduced, in the form of surfing fanatics. Kilgore. However, as the film progresses, a lot of tension is built up with Willard's reading through various reports on Kol. Kurtz to the end is in sight, when everything comes together and the atmosphere of the film reaches and reaches an incredible level. <br /> <br /> The common aspects that everyone is looking for in a decent movie are all a good standard. Especially cinematography is exceptional, and I saw the performances of Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall and Frederic Forrest as a special mention. The score I found initially sounded out of place, but when the movie progressed ... I'm not quite sure if it really got better, whether it was better equipped or if it just grew on me, but at the end of <br /> <br /> This is the second time I've seen the Redux version. I saw the original about four times. I will now say the first time I saw it. I was disappointed. I expected a "classic" movie, with much war. The fact that Willard received the mission at the beginning of the film and didn't exercise it to the end, bored me because all the character interaction in the way the movie was the film was unnecessary. This is due to the fact that the plot is not completely defined (since the focus is more on the character and the journey than the plot), in most cases it is necessary to fully appreciate the film (as with all movies that are more character-based than plot), than the second time you know where the plot goes. I have a similar experience with It's A Wonderful Life, which is now one of my favorite movies. <br /> <br /> With the great four Vietnam movies, Apocalypse is now winning the rest of the atmosphere, but lacks the action and involvement of Platoon, the emotional intensity of The Deer Hunter, and can't really be compared to Full Metal Jacket (probably my favorite of the four). Apocalypse It is now a huge piece of work, especially at the end when it gets staggering, and it is recommended for anyone who enjoys a good character-based movie and does not care about any impatient violence.
