"Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island!" is a hilarious performance that takes place on Saturday at WB. It's star coconut Fred and all his friends on the island, and every episode is a very funny misadventure of them. Most of the time, it's because of Coconut Fred's trouble making antics that make it funny and other things happening on the island at the same time. The humor is great and nobody on the island is bright, which makes it so amusing. I don't think it can be more fun. The voice talents of the characters are wonderfully better and become exaggerated, contributing to the show's hilarity. If it's ever on DVD, I get it A.S.A.P! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for a good laugh.
