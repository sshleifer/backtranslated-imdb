Beyond The Clouds is a hauntingly beautiful, elegant artwork. The overall softness of the light that this movie is embedded makes you want to touch the screen. The autumn moment that occurred could only be reached by a director who had many summers. Or to put it differently, an old man. I know of no other movie that takes the softness of light and seasonal mood and uses it with such a surprising quality as Beyond The Clouds. Almost all the people in this movie are gorgeous, unless your idea of ​​a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blonde bimbo. The dialogue doesn't really matter too much, not that there is much of it anyway, and as for storylines, forget it. Some movies just like visual experiences, it's one of them. Don't worry if you want a simple entertainment, it's not for you. <br /> <br /> I can trust the visual perfection of this movie for days, but I won't. If you are interested in film, photography, film direction etc., watch this movie.
