Interesting twist on the Vampire wire - fast, hard and dumb. Despite my initial fears, Kris K's share is pretty good and Snipes aka Blade offers a formidable physical presence. Many blood, steel, silver, burning and explosive bodies offer a pleasant :) 110 minute distraction. If you want the black look of The Matrix, Blade will call you, Blade even has a series of dodge the bullets.
