In the first transformation scene, what is the music? I heard it was "The Greeks got no Freeks". Is that right? I really like the sound. I also liked the "Hyde's Nothing to Hide" in the final scenes. Actually a doping movie, but with lots of laughs and puns, siggats and slapstick. Mrs Woo-Woo's place reminds of some places I visited myself. Ivy Venus has appeared in some other really amazing things. She looks very different in the movie we're talking about, but her maturity didn't hurt her. Mark Blankfield somehow reminds Gene Wilder. Bess Armstrong was beautiful and maintained her beauty for a long time.
