Ok, I'm a history buff, and okay, I'm an action movie junkie, so of course, this movie is on my top ten of all time. I really love the action scenes, and the unique weapon of the era. I have doubts about the duel-riding sword of horseback riding, and the Raisuli sword looks more katana-like than scimitar-like ... Oh, I never fought off per drug. <Br /> <br /> I also like the efforts in philosophical proverbs. The typical desert man probably could not read the Qur'an, so they will take his word for it. All the authors criticized Connery's brogue; Well, on vacation as a youth I met a family of South Africans in our west, Dinosaur National Monument, and although they spoke Africans between them (yes, Germans of the second generation can hear the difference), they have Spoken English with a Scottish brother. Think who teaches you affects your pronunciation.
