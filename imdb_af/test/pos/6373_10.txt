I'm glad I'm not the only one to find this series very well. This is the best series for young ladies! I have such a funny taste on comedies and I find it so hard to please my intelligence, and I'm so glad their humor is exactly what I need. Love the gang of actors! If someone knows a series or just a movie similar to this one, I say well, please write back because I miss the series. <br /> <br /> Please ask the authors and producers to CONTINUE it, even if the actors are all big now, I think! <br /> <br /> Have a nice morning / day / evening / night! (because I don't know the exact time you will read this post)
