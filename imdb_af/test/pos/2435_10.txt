This amusing, sometimes horrible look at the Hollywood detective genre of the stars of the 1940s and 1950s, Robert Sacci, as an anonymous former retirement police, uses his life saving to pay plastic surgery to his image in that of his idol, Humphrey Bogart, change. set shop as a private eye under the name "Sam Marlowe". Robert Sacchi, incidentally, is one of the rare pair of Bogart mimics that gets the lash exactly right; More to the point, the body and face language is there. For a while, Sam's one-day client is his home-member, who wants him to find her undersized boyfriend, and his only talk film is his secretary, who is just called "Dutchess" (Misty Rowe), who in his own words "watched made like Marilyn Monroe and made about as much sense as Gracie Allen, and has a passion for banana crosses. Then he met Elsa (Olivia Hussey), the plain, sweet, virgin daughter of a retired prop master who was murdered for no observable murder. In the process of investigating the murder, Sam briefly runs: Gene Tierney look-alike daughter (Michelle Phillips) of Anastas, a fiery, obsessive-rich Greek ship-owner (Victor Buono, who turns into an honorable Sidney Greenstreet). second-year-old henchmen (Herbert Lom, who channel Peter Lorre and Jay Robinson, do a fairly accurate Lionel Atwill) and Anastas, who are the second wife (Yvonne deCarlo, who plays a variety of offensive emotions without speaking a word) ' a cruel, amorous Middle East pencil (Franco Nero) that comes with a glamor and baffling loyal lover (Sybil Danning), all giving something to acquire the "Eyes of Alexander", two great perfect star sapphires. When Elsa is murdered, Marlowe's interest in resolving the case becomes personal, and he spans a labyrinth of Los Angeles landmarks, including the Hollywood Bowl, the skatological and esoteric attractions of Hollywood Boulevard and Santa Catalina Island in pursuit. of the rocks, determined to come to them before one of the two rich rivals. Throw in cameos by Mike Mazurki and others, the traditional stupid-but-sympathetic ally of the police force, and an abundance of nicely drawn character strings that offer dimension to virtually all players, and despite an unfortunate title song, you have my mind , an enjoyable movie experience.
