I think Shane Black is one of the best writers of the best writers ever! He has us the amazing (at present) Lethal Weapon, who shot Mel Gibson into superstars. Then it followed up with the second best film Bruce Willis ever been to (The Last Boyscout). He got a bit with The Last Action Hero, but released him with this one, The Long Kiss Goodnight. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of action movies, it all has ... Action, Comedy, Thrills, then it's more Action, Comedy and Thrills. Geena Davies is big, Samual L Jackson is even bigger. Don't miss it! <br /> <br /> 9/10
