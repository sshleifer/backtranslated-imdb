Anyone who has had time to work in a hospital or medical facility should appreciate this movie. The plot is absolutely wild but entertaining from start to finish. The acting is wonderful. George C. Scott is the brilliant doctor, but Class A failure man, Dad. Princess Riggs, a 1960s and 1970s gender symbol (from The Avengers), saves himself. The surrounding cast is excellent and the dialogue quite entertaining. I think I enjoyed the movie more to see it the 4th, 5th. or 6th. time because I got so much more from the wealth of dialogue and the interaction of the characters. It's good to see again and again. You won't want to go to a hospital soon.
