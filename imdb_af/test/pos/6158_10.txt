Along with minor flaws, this film is a masterpiece, and certainly the best war movie I have ever seen. Not to mention it is one of the best movies I've seen in all genres. I may have written it for No Man's Land before, but now I think this is better. It is VERY sad in the end, and I almost cried to the two shocking scenes that came close to the movie within 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> Charlemagne's performance as a main character was fascinating, although he was supposed to be a newcomer in view of his age. This movie makes you think a lot, makes you cry (or at least gets you close), and hates you any kind of war and political BS. The flashbacks to the prison hospital make the movie even more enjoyable. <br /> <br /> One small mistake about the movie is the non-British accent of suspected British people. Most of the British people on the screen were actually British, but what about those who are supposed to be British and talk to a strange accent? It really doesn't fit in this lovely movie. But that's the only mistake I noticed. Effects can also be a little better, but then we all remember many movies from a particular country that has tremendous FX and absolutely nothing else. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is a complete masterpiece and every individual should see it. If you want to travel to the Czechoslovakia of 40, and if you want to see a huge amount of emotions right away, this movie is for you. If you don't want to do this, this movie will make you want to do it.
