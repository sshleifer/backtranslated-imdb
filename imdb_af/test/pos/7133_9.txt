I am new to playing, but I would have started much earlier if this movie were around! I caught it at Gen Con last year (a journey made just as a favor to my husband) and loved it! Even to a non-gamer like me at the time, it's funny and accessible - so much so that I finally get excited and started sitting on my husband's gambling group. <br /> <br /> I don't want to give away any plot details, but if you're a gamer, you should see this movie. If you are not, you will have a good time despite yourself. There are definitely "in" jokes, but the vast majority of the movie is accessible to everyone. <br /> <br /> My only complaints: wish it was longer and wish it was available on DVD. Soon, maybe? ...
