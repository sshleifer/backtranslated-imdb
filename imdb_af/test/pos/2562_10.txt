Initially I rented the movie to rent the movie because of the jacket art for the DVD. In fact, it was true with friends of mine who did not claim that it was a movie that had little or no interest in me (or my friends) because of the art and the spiritual image. But I rented it and watched it and was really surprised. <br /> <br /> I agree with another user's comment that this movie is not for everyone because of the blatant sexual distractions, so it is definitely not something I want young children to watch (and seriously doubt they would understand it anyway). <br /> <br /> I enjoy movies like this which characterize the character's personalities and who they really are in a no-nonsense, straightforward with no teasers to indicate they will be bad. The acting done ... was it acting? Ricci and Jackson performed so well, I was drawn into this movie, not even realizing they were acting. The same thing with the story ... may seem a little far-fetched, but it's done so well. It reminded me of another movie with Mel Gibson, Tim, where each character had limitations, either spiritually or meticulously defined. <br /> <br /> I found a lot of depth in this movie with the character involved. feel that everyone involved (from the cameras to the actors) should be praised for a perfect fit / result. After watching this movie, I talked to some friends who had a negative approach to seeing it as I did. When I heard my comments, they hired and watched. They were also quite surprised at how good it was. It's too bad that the art was done on the jacket as it was, as it's a turn-off. I can now see how the art applies, but I haven't heard of this movie yet and the art was my first impression ... art selling or destroying DVD sales / renting. <br /> <br /> These characters have more depth to them and good timing has been allocated to give an audience like me time to absorb the "feel" for each one. I felt I could trust the movie was flowing well and it did. So, with the jacket art aside, I would recommend watching this movie.
