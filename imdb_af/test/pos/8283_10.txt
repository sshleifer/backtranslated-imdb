It was one of the best movies you could find as a kid. I lived with The Chipmunk Adventure from 4 years to 8 years. The story of this movie was: Dave goes on a business trip to Europe and joins the boys with me. Miller. While a video game in the 80's plays a worldwide game, two villains, Klaus and Claudia (brother and sister), are surrounded by the Chipmunks and Chipettes in an adventure in which the kids have to go hot air balloons around the world. What they are unaware of is that the game is a diamond smuggling ring. And when the villains are found at the airport, follow a chase! And that ends in Klaus and Claudia from prison and Alvin, Simon, Theodore, Brittany, Jeanette and Eleanor safe with Dave and Miss. Miller. But I warn you now, it's a musical and quite a damn good one. Most people hate musicals, but I'm not one of those people, I love to love music like Rocky Horror, Grease, Sound of Music, Cats Do Not Dance, and just about anything (except My Fair Lady). If you see it, share with your kids (if you have any)!
