GLORIFYING DO NOT GLAMORize World War II. <br /> <br /> We had quite a few documentaries about World War II on regular television programming. Without looking up information in an encyclopedia or movie book, this old memory seems to remember the most names entirely on its own. <br /> <br /> There was CRUSADE IN EUROPE, which is the title of the war memoirs of one general of the army and later the 33th president of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower. This has told the story of the conflict in Europe, as the Supreme Commander of the Supreme Court said. <br /> <br /> There was a KRUSADE in the PACIFIC (topic self-explanatory), of which I don't remember much. Newspaper Man / Writer, Jim Bishop was the host / navigator of BATTLELINE. <br /> <br /> And there was the excellent WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALIARY YEAR. * The series was a co-production of the British Broadcasting Corporation and the American Broadcasting Corporation. It first broadcast in the 1960-61 season here in The States and boasts the fact that Richard Burton speaks Sir Winston's words. <br /> <br /> This is the 1952 NBC Television Network's Production of our topic today, this VITORY AT SEA winning the cigar. <br /> <br /> Initially, it had to carefully and literally sort the production for thousands of hours of film production. The film film referred to here was the official filmed recording taken by members of the armed forces of the United States, independent news rule film, motion picture record of our other allied partner nations, as well as prisoner photos of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan . <br /> <br /> Once reached, the different matching movies had to be cut and edited in a series of 1/2 hour installments. It was done with great skill, namely that there were so many scene changes, whether suddenly or as a solution. The appearance of any episode seems so smooth as if it were a single movie project. <br /> <br /> Writing the Spoken Word to accompany this finest real movie was no less wonderful and unique. The highly polished and meaningful eloquence does not waste a word and sometimes even endorses the description of action, rather than exaggerating it. The story goes to Mr. Ralph Graves, who was a talented actor of stage, film, radio and television. He certainly gained some immortality through his golden tinted statement of the written episode descriptions. <br /> <br /> Finally, VICTORY AT SEA enjoys the luxury of having original score, both opening theme and casual music. by Richard Rodgers of Broadway celebrity. (Rodgers & Hart, Rodgers & Hammerstein). His compositions are complex, full, variable and even "classic" in the true sense. <br /> <br /> The Classic Arrangement was played by the NBC. Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Robert Russell Bennett and as a soundtrack record / cassette tape / compact disc, has been available and in demand since the first release, 55 years ago. And, very little wonder, because it is this musical score that is so captivating to the viewer / listener. It puts the frost on this cake. <br /> <br /> * SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL, THE VALUE YEAR also achieved a beautiful and highly memorable original score. It was also compiled by Mr. Rodgers. <br /> <br /> ** We have in additional "Ace in the Hole" in our house in the person of our Father, the late Clement J. Ryan (1914-74). Dad was during the USNavy war, which was imported in 1943 or44. Our Pop was always going to explain and explain any of the situations depicted in the series. <br /> <br /> He and our Mother, now 90-year-old Bertha (no Fuerst), already had my older sister. , Joanne (1942-90) as a dependent.
