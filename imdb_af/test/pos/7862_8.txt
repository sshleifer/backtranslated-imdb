It took me years to catch this jewel of a movie and it was worth the wait. In almost all his films, Clint always plays the hero. Whether it's hero, anti-hero or hero. In this film he is a pure villain and he plays well. <br /> <br /> As a wounded union soldier, he is brought in by a student and teacher in a confederate school. Shortly afterwards he began to seduce the ladies, regardless of their age and some are quite young. He also plays on their jealousies and makes them against each other. In the end, you're never so lucky to see Clint die a terrible death. <br /> <br /> That's what makes this movie a jewel. Clint has never done such a movie and after watching this movie, he wanted him to. He plays the role of the villain as well, it will make you wonder why he never had more movies like that. This also explains why the film is not seen very often. Most people don't want to see Clint as the villain, and with Dirty Harry released shortly after this movie, it's a hidden gem. If you are a Clint Eastwood fan, it is up to you to watch this movie. You may not like what you will see, but you will not forget it soon.
