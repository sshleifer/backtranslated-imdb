It was the very first kung fu movie I've ever seen. The dubbing is not the biggest, but much better than some I've seen. The plot is much better than some made today. It is sometimes difficult, but it gives it the special pressure. Academy award material is not. But if you like to see battles and a decent story background, it's for you!
