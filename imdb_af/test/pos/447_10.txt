The "silver screen" is freshly polished with this beautiful film about the aging of happiness and enjoying life's rainbows. There are many silver hairs on this silver screen, but the movie's namesake is more like 85-on-25 with its energy, humor and desire for life. The story of the grandmother, Uncle Frank, his dedicated wife Tannie Tillie, and the zippy residents of the local nursing homes inspire us every day as if it were your last, and bring a bright hope to the often-feared golden years. A great movie for young and old audiences!
