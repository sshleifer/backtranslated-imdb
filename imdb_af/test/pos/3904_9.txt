I only saw The Victim (aka Out Of Contention) 25 years ago when I was very young. As a passionate fan of Bewitched since I was a child, I loved seeing something that Elizabeth Montgomery died of. This movie was (and still is) a real surprise - whether you're a fan of Miss Montgomery's work or not. Elizabeth always shines in her roles, like her depiction as the rape victim in a rape case and as the suspicious murderer in The Legend Of Lizzie Borden. Her performance in the victim as Kate, a scared woman trapped in an isolated house during a storm, with a killer after she's brilliant. If you like exciting tension teams then it's one movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat to the end. Another good performance worthwhile is that of Eileen Heckhart who plays the ominous and suspicious housekeeper. Unfortunately, like most of me. Montgomery's movies, the victim is not available on DVD and I believe that although released a few years ago on VHS, it is a rarity nowadays. I was fortunate to paste it when it was broadcast on television ten years ago and had such a good copy of this very good movie. A must see!
