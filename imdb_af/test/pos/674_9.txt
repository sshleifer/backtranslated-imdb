The subject is World War II and Robert Ryan is a rejected soldier who hires Lupino as a handy wife. She is a war widow. <br /> <br /> The set is limited, but the acting makes provision for it. Robert Ryan is in conflict: one moment he looks nice, then confused about where he lives. Initially, Lupino tries to help him. He looks restless, but nothing more dangerous. But how do we know it? Build the tension. I really enjoy movies like this, which rely on the human element of tension. What can this man do? There are a few scenes with O.Z. Whitehead and Dee Pollock as an annoying grocery store that sees something are wrong. We keep thinking she'll be helped, then Ryan's personality will be back. He becomes like a Jekyll / Hyde character, and later ends Lupino with a knife. <br /> <br /> Worth watching for these two beautiful actors. 9/10.
