What a surprise this movie was. I saw some of Fulci's horror and zombie flicks and was surprised that it was by the same director. He also wrote the screenplay showing that the hood was very well able to make a detailed, complex storyline. The dubbing on it is not good, but far from the terrifying scuffle that later played again like Manhattan Baby. <br /> <br /> Photography in this movie is fantastic. A strange, almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film focusing on a small town where young boys are murdered. A woman's scene is uncomfortable to watch, but refreshing compared to ordinary cinema violence. <br /> <br /> What went wrong Lucio? Perhaps there is a strong case to suggest that he has reached its peak with this movie, and then it slowed down.
