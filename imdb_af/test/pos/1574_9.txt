Until I did a web search on "What Alice Found," I didn't realize that the name of the movie was included in one of Lewis Carroll's books. The book's full title is "Through the Looking Glass (And What Alice Found It)". <br /> <br /> The Alice's movie comes from a very different background to that of Lewis Carroll's Alice. However, her fresh and self-conscious character is similar. The movie Alice begins as a young woman in New Hampshire who steals money from her bosses attacks and walks away for Miami, vague planning to study marine biology and play with dolphins. She met a middle-aged couple in a garage (the man retired from the army) who stopped her from a strange man at a road and from her car breakdown point (perhaps caused by their mechanics). <br /> <br /> As it turns out, the couple are heavily involved in truck stop prostitution and see sweet, young Alice as a promising site. The woman (played by Judith Ivey in a show worthy of a big award) buys Alice's sexy clothes and shows her how to apply warm makeup. Initially Alice accepts her ministries passively and with the couple's orders he does several tricks. The most detailed meeting is very different from most movies, but can be typical of what happens most in real life. The man is shy and distressed and apologizes too quickly. <br /> <br /> What is wonderful about Alice (and unlike her prototypes of Clarissa to Sister Carrie) is that she learns from her experiences and claims herself. So it really is. Prostitution is everywhere. People are not all good or bad. Alice left the garage with her well-deserved money and a sense of mutual respect.
