This is the best movie I've ever seen. It all has tragedy and happiness, love and hate. And a deep friendship that cannot even destroy war. <br /> <br /> The most wonderful casting I've ever seen. Patrick Swayze and James Read were the best in this movie. <br /> <br /> If you see part 1, you'll want to see it all. Some of my friends watched part of the movie at my house and then went out and bought the movie. <br /> <br /> I'm a civil war, but this movie has my grandchildren interested in history. Any movie that children can get to learn history is wonderful. I have books I, II and III and when the girls come from Florida every year, they want to see North and South.
