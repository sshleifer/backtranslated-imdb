Overall I found this movie well: exceptionally with disturbances of plays (some essential, some useless) and poor second half. Contains SPOILERS The film is divided into 2 parts. I thought the first half of the pianist was great. We meet Erika Kohut (wonderful Isabelle Huppert), a piano teacher, and is introduced to her world. She is single, struggling to find her space against an overprotective and boundary tyrannical mother. We understand that she has been lost or has experienced rare love as a physical + emotional chemistry: she protects herself by being sharp and offensive to people, introducing her sexual tension into sex shops, as a voyeur or in sadistic self-reduction . This first half is very clinical and builds incredible tension in the film, almost unbearable. <br /> <br /> Then comes Walter, a young, handsome and outgoing man (played beautifully by Benoit Magimel). Although he felt Erika's cold in the beginning, he seduced her and slowed Erika's fort slowly. He loves her very much, but she needs him to fulfill her sadistic desires. When she was about to fall, he was disgusting to her world and in the end we discovered that Erika could not love or feel at all (especially since Walter is portrayed as someone who is impossible love). This is the second half of the film, much touching as we see that Erika's inability / inexperienced love leads her to self-destruction. This second half was mastered by Haneke and sometimes has non-credible (ie, shocking) scenes that paradoxically reduce the drama. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a rough movie, at least in the French version. : You see porn series of the sex shop, daring mutilation and sex scenes. The much talked about fellatio scene between Magimel and Huppert was pretty good I thought, and is central to understanding Erika's sick relationship with love. As far as the actors are concerned, Huppert is wonderful through the film, Magimel gets better and better, and Girardot (the mother) is excellent. <br /> <br />
