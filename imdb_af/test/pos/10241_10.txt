This movie was really well written and was very entertaining. There was also a big role in that. Luke Perry did a very convincing job. (as he always does) If you are looking for an advanced movie to watch, it should be at the top of your list. There is a mix of comedy, drama and action. You can literally feel what the actors feel on points. I was very impressed with this movie. The special effects were very well done. The whole movie was very convincing. This movie is one of my favorites. What is happening is that North America can be torn apart and Jack and his team must try to stop an eruption by destroying North America. It was a very cool and creative idea. I loved this movie and I know you will too.
