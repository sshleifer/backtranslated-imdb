They say it is always better in horror movies to leave things to the viewer's imagination - to hide certain details of the audience to tickle their imagination channel, dive into their fears and give it to their darkest thoughts. <br /> <br /> This was not the case when I looked at Bakjwi under the American title Thirst. Play now at select theaters near you. The movie makers don't seem to want to save you any details. There will be blood in this movie and you will try to look away. <br /> <br /> For the rest of the review, please visit http://without-terebi.blogspot.com/2009/08/thirst-aka-bakjwi .html Thank you and hope you enjoyed it here.
