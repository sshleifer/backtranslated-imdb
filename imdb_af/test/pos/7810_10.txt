There were very few big comedy movies in the history of Hindi Cinema. Andaz Apna Apna happens one of them. The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men (Aamir and Salman) who dream of getting rich by marrying a millionaire's daughter (Raveena). Aamir and Salman Khan try their best to overwhelm each other and woo Raveena. The plot thickens when Paresh Rawal & Co. plan to take over all the wealth. The movie is good and very funny. Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy that is both funny and intelligent. This is one of the few films with Aamir and Salman together (probably the only movie!). Unfortunately, it did not pass the box, and we can never see a movie of this caliber again. Aamir Khan is brilliant in the film and has proven his versatility as an actor in this film. Salman Khan gives a very good performance as a dull. Raveena plays a convincing role as a confused rich girl, and Karishma who is Raveena's assistant / friend is also funny. Paresh Rawal, Junior Ajith, Shakti Kapoor, Deven Verma, Jagdeep and Tiku Talsania just add to the taste of the movie! All in all, the best Hindi comedy ever made and I wish they made more quality movies like this one. PS - For those of you who watched this movie, I also suggest Gol Maal, Chupke Chupke, Chhoti Si Baat, Naram Garam, Hera Pheri (Hera Pheri). old and new), etc.
