I was very curious to see this Wajda-Depardieu excursion, plus the duration is definitely fascinating. As a Wajda fan, I was disappointed, and it could be an understatement. The movie never really took film flight - there is no foundation for the animosity between Danton and Robespierre, etc. <br /> <br /> Basically, the text was poor (adapted from "The Danton Affair"). And yet, the direction was masterful ... it's Wajda, after that! There were also some amazing actors, but they never grabbed the attention of the audience as they should. Depardieu comes down as a quasi-goofy, nonchalant Danton ... not exactly the image we have in mind. Woijech Pzsoniak is unbelievable, as usual, but again the writing limits are set, even players of great talent cannot break down. Andrzej Seweryn and Bogoslaw Linda appear ... like Bourdon and Saint-Just ... and if you are familiar with Wajda, you know them. <br /> <br /> Overall, I was disappointed with this much-charged movie. Great role, good director, but no quality foundation. Bad, dynamic dynamics. We need to get into Danton (Walesa) and Robespierre's (General J) mindset ... what is their motivation? Uh ... who knows? One likes women, the other powders themselves? Riiight. Okay, so if you're looking for a great French Revolution movie, I recommend: "La Revolution Francaise" ... it's in two parts and o-so-great! Excellent performances, in-depth writing, juicy time bits ... definitely a satisfying experience !! Klaus-Maria Brandauer is a much better Danton than Depardieu. The wonderful Andrzej Seweryn apparently took a few notes from Danton and is BRILLIANT as Robespierre. SEE THIS! NOW! As for Wajda fans, you are better off with 'Man of Iron / Marble', 'Promised Land' and the like. Cheers !!
