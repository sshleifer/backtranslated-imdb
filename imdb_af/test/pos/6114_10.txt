Well, I can safely say I'm human, Wong. And I didn't give up. I laughed. One team. If this movie makes you break out, there's something wrong with you. But this movie is incredible. I bought it four days ago and have looked it up five times. The animal cruelty gets my heart, but not long enough to be guilty. The movie is shocking, disgusting and vulgar. The acting is terrible. What else do you want from a movie? I am a hard-core cult maniac. Pink Flamingos is wonderful. It makes Rocky Horror, as someone said, looks like the teletubbies.
