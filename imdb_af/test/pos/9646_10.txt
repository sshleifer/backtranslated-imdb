I was forced to give feedback on this movie I rented from Blockbuster. This movie has everything - comedy, drama, crime, tension and realism. <br /> <br /> This movie also had a lot of action with just the right amount of humor! I will definitely see it again! There were some funny parts as well as dramatic drama. I enjoy movies that are wondering what will happen next. <br /> <br /> Author / director, Travis Milloy, has to make more movies! In my general opinion, this movie was great! I'm looking forward to his next one! Travis Milloy has real talent as a writer and director.
