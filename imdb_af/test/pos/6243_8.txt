"Tourist Trap" is a bizarre, big horror movie from the 70's. The film is about a group of young adults, Becky, Jerry and Molly, traveling in a jeep through a desert area. Their two other friends, Eileen and her boyfriend Woody, are in a separate car. When a wheel goes flat, Woody takes it to a nearby gas station - and meets a creepy fate of a bizarre telekinetic chaos and some creepy mannequins. The friends are tired of waiting Woody and going to a local tourist trap mannequin / wax museum. In front of the entrance, the car breaks down randomly and the girls find an oasis area to swim in, where they come from. Slausen approached. He takes them to the old western wax museum, and the girls stay behind while he and Jerry are going to fix their car. Eileen, the peculiar of the two, walks to an old house in the area, where she also falls into the hands of a mysterious masked killer and a lot of life like mannequin. After waiting for Eileen, Becky and Molly will search for her. This is when the real terror starts and the telekinetic (can move objects with his mind). Masker brother of Mr. Slausen starts killing one for one of the teenage years while controlling his large number of human twisted mannequins. <br /> <br /> Sounds similar to the 2005 "House of Wax" remake? Well, this is. I heard about this movie, but I never saw it when I saw House of Wax, but now I see the striking similarities of the two films. "Tourist Trap" was, of course, a great contributor to the "House of Wax" remake. The mannequins in this movie are frightening to start with, some with moving eyeballs, some with no eyes, and some with mouth drops that also sing. The song was extremely gruesome when you asked me and the mannequins were honestly designed. Mannequins are creepy to start with, they are so alive, but they really aren't. The movie includes elements of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the masks the killer uses is similar to that of Leatherface), with some of the original "House of Wax" and the telekinetic forces displayed in "Carrie". The result is quite satisfactory. The telekinesis was a good touch to the movie, which made the killer increasingly threatened and inevitable. The masks were frightening, and the plastering scene was really disturbing. <br /> <br /> The score for the movie was really well done, if not a little overused during some scenes. The acting may not be the key, but it wasn't really that bad. Chuck Connors was really good as the shadow mr. Slauston, who gives the character a shady but friendly feel. A young Tanya Roberts is also in the film, she is best known for her role at Charlie's Angels and more recently the sitcom "That's 70s Show", which Donna's mom plays. Robert A. Burns serves as art director. He did a phenomenal work on the original "Texas Chainsaw" and also a good job here. It creates a jerky atmosphere for both the fluttering museum and the old mannequin house. I found it a bit odd that the original rating for the movie was PG, it seems a bit too scary to get such an easy score, but the movie is really not too violent. <br /> <br /> Overall, "Tourist Trap" is a truly unique, fast, extraordinarily undervalued horror classic. Full Moon gave it a decent 20th anniversary DVD release, the comment was interesting and the picture was bright and sharp for the most part, better than the video versions. If you enjoy an older 70s horror movie, 'Tourist Trap' is an understated retro jewel. 8/10.
