Critics and audiences both fit this movie, but I didn't really think it was too bad! Even the critics I normally agree with the idea that it was crazy, and I usually despise PG-13 "horror movies." So it means one of two things: either (1) I'm too easily satisfied, and my taste in movies has diminished over the years, or (2) 'When a stranger calls' is not nearly as terrible as it was made to be. Now, to be honest, some of the criticism of the movie is true - there's not much character development, and not much in the story. But human beings live, how much did you expect from a movie to bump a baby? Cut them a little slack! As a former babysitter who watched this movie lightly at night, I can safely say the stalker dude was a brave mofo! Who knows? I think things like this just give me the wills. <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit I enjoyed it, and I don't care how big a minority brings me.
