It's a fascinating documentary about a 15-year-old black boy accused of killing a Florida tourist and the subsequent court case. What this film shows is how corrupt the US police system is and how easy it can really be to convince an innocent man and how a senile old fool who thinks a black man looks a lot like another and sorts it when he jail because I said he was the man who killed my wife. The star is the defense attorney who is not just his job in court but also did what the police have done long ago. Fascinating things. 7 out of 10.
