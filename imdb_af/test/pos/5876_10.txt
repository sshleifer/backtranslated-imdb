Since there are so many reviews of this fine movie, I will write in a list form and try to address issues that have not been discussed. <br /> <br /> 1. Dana Andrews was 38 while filming this movie. His character according to the script was in his middle 20s. Andrews, a highly underrated actor, played brilliantly a character supposed to be much younger. <br /> <br /> 2. Fredric March, as all the GREAT actors need, must be prevented by the director at times to avoid over-the-top acting. He beat the cameras when he was drunk the night after his arrival and the next morning as he hung out in his mirror. <br /> <br /> 3. Dana Andrews was excellent as he was in Laura, "The Ox-Bowl Incident", "A Walk in the Sun," "The Purple Heart" and many other films. Why did Fredric March win the Oscar and why wasn't Dana Andrews even nominated for his excellent performance? <br /> <br /> 4. Harold Russell has the best performance I've ever seen through a non-actor. <br /> <br /> 5. I realized it was the 1940s, but Dana Andrews had no romantic interest in his particularly attractive wife (Virginia Mayo). <br /> <br /> 6. Ray Teal, who played the right wing, became known years ago to portray the sheriff on "Bonanza". <br /> <br /> 7. The south professor wrote that the film was moving slowly, boring and behaving poorly. The professor more than likely is ignorant of classic films. The beauty and meaning of these timeless classics is that they are slow-moving character studies that avoid rudeness, excessive violence and free sex. <br /> <br /> *** I was surprised that zero out of 3 people found my review helpful.
