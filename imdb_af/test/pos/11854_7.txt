This indie movie is worth a look because of the enormous talent of its creators, Wallace Wolodarsky and Marsha Forbes. Mr. Wolodarsky threw the young role, and he is praised for this effort. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is a prudent story of the danger of having something that one cannot have. What is the story of Alice and Ed. After living together for a while, Alice suddenly becomes uneasy because she thinks she has experience in the sex area. Alice and Ed's relationship, but not an example of ideal happiness, is a comfortable way to share their lives. It's up to the moment that Alice and Claire, her sister, have a sexual encounter with another couple, who doesn't have the warning. <br /> <br /> This incident makes Alice her own sexual life with Ed; she finds it inappropriate. When she intends to see other people, Ed is shocked to put it mildly, but he doesn't want to contradict Alice. He decides to go along. What happens next is that Alice and Ed enter a world that was unknown to them. The people they meet are not worth it. Unfortunately they realized in the end. They were made for each other. <br /> <br /> The movie is worth watching for the incredible Julianne Nicholson, who is in another Indian movie, "Tully". Me. Nicholson reminds us of a young Shirley McLaine; She projects such light quality over her, it's hard to take her eyes out of her when she's in a scene. This young actress proves she is a perfect artist who gets better with every new look. Basically she carries the movie. Her Alice is a study in contrasts. Alice is a decent woman who thinks she is insufficient in pleasant Ed because of her inexperience. <br /> <br /> Jay Mohr is a great match for me. Nicholson. Both do wonderful things. His Ed is completely credible. We knew people like him. He's deep inside, he's a good person who suddenly finds himself in a situation he didn't ask for. Yet, he is only going to discover that he is too decent and not cut off for a life of free sex with the willing women. It has no problem with a tumble in the hay, just for fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the roll is great. Lauren Graham does great work like Claire, Alice's yuppie sister. Andy Ritcher is also great as the well-founded Carl, the northern friend who finally finds out when he meets Penelope, a single mother. Like Penelope, Helen Slater, makes a happy but short look in the movie. <br /> <br /> The director is very gifted, who undoubtedly goes to places because he shows that he is well-suited to the job. .
