The residents are a band known for their strange looks and strange musical styles, so of course their music videos won't be exactly normal. In fact, these small videos are abnormal and bizarre, but have a great artistic value for them. The atmosphere is built with lighting, and good visuals. This is a good viewing experience. <br /> <br /> Basically, Icky Flix only contains many music music videos made for their songs. The music itself ranges from rock to synthesized music that seems to come straight from an 80-year-old horror movie. What does not change is the quality of these videos. They're wonderful! <br /> <br /> Any fan of art films will love these things. They are so original with their visual arts, and the corners on which they are filmed, and the relief makes it especially interesting. The music is creepy and catchy and very original and these short films are mini-classics that earn more than once. This is an almost perfect collection of short videos. <br /> <br /> My rating: **** from ****. 56 minutes.
