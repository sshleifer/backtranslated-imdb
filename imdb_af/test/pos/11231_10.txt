A dreamy, impressive atmospheric film takes place in a small town Northfork, Montana in 1955. Government officials come to evacuate the town to be flooded by a new hydroelectric dam. There are other visitors in the town, the angels of another time, but they are only seen by a dying boy Irvin. A local priest (Nick Nolte in a quiet heartbreaking performance) takes care of the boy. Irvin pleads with the angels to leave the place with them ... <br /> <br /> There is some unworthy quality in the movie, some worthy mourning and sublime grief when suddenly the inevitable finality of everything realizes - people and their relationships, cities, countries, civilizations, the whole world as we know it. Death and birth have something in common - we go through them in the ultimate loneliness. <br /> <br /> I can't recall the film that influenced me in the same way and as deeply as Northfork, the film so beautiful and so soft, so quiet and so powerful, so heartbreaking and so moving. Even now, after a few weeks since I saw it, tears came to my eyes when I was just thinking about it. <br /> <br /> After I saw it, I had to talk to someone about it. I sent a PM to one of my friends and I asked, "Please tell me what I have seen now?" And my friend replied, "You just saw one of the best movies of modern times. One of these days others will see the light."
