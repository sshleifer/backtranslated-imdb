I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in Prince George. I have to confess, the only reason I'm going to see it is because I'm a great Callum Keith Rennie fan. And he didn't let me down. He gave a good performance of a rather impersonal character and provided the only comic strip throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is the usual 'very bad people caught up in a snowstorm' story, but it had some twists that kept me guessing. Characteristics were strong and the whole role played quite well. The only problems I had with the roll-throw were Rose McGowan. She was so cold through the movie that we had no idea of ​​her character's personality or motivation. Unlike her and a few minor problems with continuity, it was a well-written, well-activated thriller.
