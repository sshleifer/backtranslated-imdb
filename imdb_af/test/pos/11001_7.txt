I enjoyed watching Squire Trelane jerk the crew in this episode, but after a while it just looked a little too long. Sure, the histrionics were funny for a while, and the end was a great way to turn the whole thing together. I think the problem was that I liked seeing Trelane when he was full of bravado and fun. The fun was disappearing when Trelane became furious and nasty. Talk about a mood killer - go from the unpleasant but pleasant host to the man who condemns Kirk to death! But despite this, the episode was nice and worth it. For the hard-haired Trekkies, it's a must-see, for others it's just a nice jerk of the mill.
