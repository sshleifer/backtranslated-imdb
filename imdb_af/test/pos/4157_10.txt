This film is an impressionist, poetic approach to immigrant experience, a reflective look at the unrest and fear associated with emigration. These are aspects that are not often taken into account in emigration films to the United States, and especially to the country and in general, and the film convincingly shows the nervousness and enthusiasm, as ignorance, that poor, illiterate Sicilian immigrants await their emigration to the United States. <br /> <br /> They have fantastic, unrealistic ideas about the United States being distributed on the voyage. One is that the rivers run with milk, an image portrayed in the film as poetic, impressionistic effect. The film is without sound and the silence seems to reflect the discomfort of ignorance that residents have over life in America, or if it is not ignorance, a vision that is significantly colored with superstition and fantasy. <br /> <br /> That said, the movie shows with a jolting realism, the cruise to the United States and the intake process that arrives at Ellis Island. The boat ride was imagined to be rather boring, and it certainly was a lot of time. The quarter-hour in which the incoming residents sleep is portrayed as extremely crowded, with beds stretching four or five inches apart and lacking in light, which was certainly the case under the deck. <br /> <br /> Again, the film is not replenished with unnecessary music or excessive bright lighting and the effect is to create a fairly realistic imagination of what it really is for people who emigrate to the United States. The residents may not be worldly, but it is reasonably reasonable and the interaction with the elders of the emigrants, Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) with the immigration officer who insists on obtaining specific results is bittersweet because they are not diluted or softened . The benefit of a syrupy conclusion and one sees the mention of the realism of Sicily with the extensive regulations that lead life in the United States. <br /> <br /> The immigrants and their story are very interesting and the combination of cold eyes realism and the magical fantasy of people's imagination makes for a persuasive vision of the beliefs of Sicilians, or any people, with little formal education to the United States. The acting is also bare bones; it is neither demonstrative nor apparent, but looks realistic. It says all the main artists, especially Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato), are the clear leader of the group excellent. While he never smiles, his character's actions speak much harder and it is clear that the other group members, his two sons and the above-mentioned parent Fortunata, the grandmother's grandmother, have confidence in his leadership abilities and respect his leadership. Amato impresses his character with great decency and fairness and this is proof of his abilities that his character seems so capable and confident, while his character betrays very little emotion. <br /> <br /> One strange thing about the movie is meeting with a mysterious English woman (the excellent and appropriate secretive Charlotte Gainsbourg) who speaks Italian and throughout the film we wonder why she is going to the United States or what is the connection with the otherwise unanimous Sicilian emigrant group? In the end, it is finally revealed and the revelation is typically done realistically and does not seem melodramatic or apparent. <br /> <br /> The film is directed by Emmanuel Crialese, who occupies the realistic, sometimes superstitious, worldview of his characters and offers them skill and confidence. It was indeed given tremendous confidence how uncomfortable the realism and superstition in the film could be combined. This is a worthy investigation into immigrant experience.
