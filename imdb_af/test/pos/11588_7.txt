The sea in a movie by Alejandro Amenabar. Almodovar has been offering the flag for Spanish theater for years. From now on, Amenabar has generated genres and injected some new blood into the otherwise malfunctioning Spanish industry. Now in a big game he is changing from psychological terror to social drama. Well, the big ones would be audiences ready to embrace the swing and more importantly he could keep the flag? This is the story of Ramon Sampedro, a sailor who was paralyzed in the twenties in a sea crash and his struggle with the Spanish government for the right to end his life. The story has traces of an afternoon made for TV melodrama and the only way it works is by words and honest performances and they both come in spades. Mateo Gil and Amenabar write in a way that the audience is not meant to be blindly to a death level, but they are encouraged to put their own thoughts into the process and that is a brilliant stroke, that is. not a filmpro death but a movie in favor of the ultimate illusions of our time LIBERTY. There are a few laughs that have been saving for a long time, such as when the church in a wheelchair comes home to deconstruct Sampedro beliefs, but is mostly a valley of tears, bumps come from all fronts, even if you think is safely his father who made no sense until then, the most moving line of the whole movie comes up. This is a heartbreaking experience, especially when Sampedro looks more like life than most people wandering the streets and everyone around him trying to convince him of the wonders of life, even those who help him to die? but if you strip a man of his dreams? The film is built almost exclusively on close-ups, giving a claustrophobic feeling that makes the audience more sympathetic to Sampedro. It is a big challenge for the actors to build their entire performances with their eyes and the eyes do not lie. Bardem did not receive his second Oscar nomination, probably in favor of Eastwood, but I think he was the only one that Jammie Fox could have damaged. This role reminds me of the great Gregory Peck to make a MOCKINGBIRD where the play seems effortless and I think Bardem has reached that status where the line of what is acting and what is really faded. I was never loved by his early work, but since Almodovar's LIVE FLESH he is on a role, LOS LUNES AL SOL, THE DANCE DRIVER and nominated the Oscar before the night made him an international star and although he and Banderas coming from the same Almodovar The background is fascinating to see how different paths they have taken and how Bardem has now become a true reference for Spanish theater throughout the world. A Golden Globe, 14 Goyas, the award of the jury in Venice and probably an Oscar with permission from THE CHORUS BOYS, directing directors, co-writing, editing and adding music to a high caliber drama, he deducted it? What about a science fiction now? Whose life is it anyway? ****.
