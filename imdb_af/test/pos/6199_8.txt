* Be warned of possible spoilers. <br /> <br /> A friend told me to watch this series, and I'm glad I took her words for it. <br /> <br /> I read the synopsis about the DVD cover and I was immediately intrigued. The main protagonist is Muslim? No way, this is a first! It's about an FBI agent under the guise of penetrating a possible sleep cell in LA; and get it - he is a practicing Muslim. I was initially a little skeptical, expecting half a hero or the antagonist to reach out, perhaps foolish, unreliable and prudent, more saintly than you fanatic forces ... let's see, there is a lot of sight guilty . /> <br /> But then I looked at the first three episodes, and I thought, Well, that's good. It wasn't until episode four ("Scholar") when I was well impressed. I would recommend for the great writing and also, excellent performances of the actors. I just love how complex each of these characters is - they are not straight out of two-dimensional cardboard cutout good guys / bad guys. Michael Ealy gives a wonderful and credible performance as Muslim FBI agent Darwyn Al-Sayeed, who is the fine line between the good Muslim and a man with errors. Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth. Farik is not the typical oily middle-eastern stereotype, but merely someone who truly believes in his cause and does not see himself as a fanatic, but a man willing to take any extreme measures for his beliefs. He is very charismatic and authoritative. But I would say it was Alex Nesic's performance that left an impression in me in "Scholar" clearly. His portrayal of his character's emotional struggle was astonishing between the soft words of a Muslim scholar who encouraged him to return to the non-aggressive way, because that is the only acceptable way in God's eyes and Father's belief to believe otherwise. <Br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to seeing more apps like this, and not a ridiculous high-octane one-man show series. It's smart and open-minded.
