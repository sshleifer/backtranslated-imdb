This groundbreaking film is truly a work of art. In the performance at the Indiana Convention, I went with very low expectations after watching two other "gamer" movies in the title (both were so bad that at the end of the second I pulled out one of me own eyes with my drinking straw and a twisted paper clip I found between the seat cushions). But of the opening credits, "Dorkness" had me. The temperate North West area has made a beautiful backdrop for the drama around the frustrated game master, Lodge (vividly depicted by Nathan Rice) and his deceptive group of friends facing the real drama. provide for them. After the first scene (in the fantasy world in which they live). They are being violently pushed back into the world so desperately trying to escape. It made so many comparisons with my own life that I moved to tears. Rice's acting is such a wonderful caliber that I really believed in the first 20 minutes of the film that he was really a twenty-something man suffering from frustration, male baldness and an annoying group of friends who cannot understand no. Concepts like right and wrong. Lodge's friends here are a few notes: Leo, the oldest and heaviest of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job, apart from the lodge. Still, he seems to be grinding socially to Gary, the youngest of the group. It only looks a bit strange at first until you realize that Gary is actually a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects outside his "fantasy" world. This dichotomy serves, not to confuse, but to inform the audience about the importance of diversity in our society. My only complaint about this is that the actors depicting Leo (Scott C. Brown) and Gary (Christian Doyle) sometimes play the characters fun, as if they were notified, they were acting in a comedy rather than a hard - save action / drama. Talking about action, Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass, the third and most influential member of Lodge's motley crew. the tension is always high when he is on the screen, both when passionate about his beliefs at Lodge or when he portrays his fantastic martial arts skills as "silence" his fantasy character. Or even when he suddenly turns around to meet the audience and you reflexively in the audience one day so that he is not cut by his fantastic chin. Lewis lights up on the screen, no matter what he does and I hope to see more of him in the future. Once the action starts in this movie, it just doesn't stop. the drama and action blend as seamlessly as you can say or you in the midst of a frenetic action sequence or a touch dramatic moment. Actually a thrill of epic relationships, I would recommend "The Gamers: Dorkness Rising" as required to watch for anyone who loves film. It was almost worth losing. <br /> <br /> ~ Chip Deedlenick
