I was a kid when I saw this series, a little after I saw Buck Rogers, both characters performed by the same Buster Crabbe. I have to admit that these movies were always part of the best entertainment I ever had. The fight against Emperor Ming was one thing, but I was more interested in knowing the final fate of Flash's love triangle with Dale and Aura. Barin came and persuaded Aura to forget Flash, very innocent termination of her obsession for good Flash. The series has no offensive and very violent scenes and can be watched by all audiences. Another thing is that I learned to swing in the water and watch Crabbe do it when he fought against sharks. The soundtrack was also nice, although it was used earlier in another movie by Boris Karloff's Frankenstein. It would be nice to have the DVD of this series, provided it contains subtitles in Spanish (not yet available).
