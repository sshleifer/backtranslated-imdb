I have a 4-year-old daughter, and before this movie she was all about the Disney Princesses, now she's watched this movie and all she can talk to is Princess Genevieve and all her sisters. I recommend this movie to all young girls. This movie is one of the best of the Barbie collection. It shows all the good values ​​any mother would like to encourage to encourage little girls. With the big songs and dancing moving, it gets my daughter up and tries to imitate the movements. The extras are also good, one works even on how good your memory is. I would definitely say it was a must see for kids and adults alike.
