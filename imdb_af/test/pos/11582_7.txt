I only saw Mar Ardentro and felt that I had to comment on this film. Euthanasia is a difficult subject in any field and unfortunately it can distort the true value of a movie. Many people have rushed over the excellent cast and are beautiful images / camera work. Certainly, Javier Bardem is an actor who brings something extra to every movie he makes. To say that he includes the actual Sampredo is a bit silly because I don't think any of the judges knew Sampredo personally. Being silent and using a certain charm is an acting skill that, although well done, does not constitute a "perfect" achievement. Bardem does just what he does well ... and that's it. The camera work is beautiful and generates feelings and perspectives that the film itself cannot deliver. Sampredo is shown here as a man who bends so much to die that he leaves behind his loving family and marries a woman whom he only seeks when the other person will not help him in his search for a worthy death. Now I'm not here to say anything about the right to or against euthanasia. The problem is that when you make movies like this, you almost can't escape it. The film's subject is so strong that you are almost obliged to discuss the film in that strong topic. I find it a weakness for the movie - inadvertently - suggests Sampredo as an indifferent character. Someone who is much smarter is his family as depicted in the simple cousin who does not direct the double layered poem to him. Someone who will leave a loving and caring family because HE thinks his life is unworthy. A scene next to the female lawyer, which, according to the film, caused the "wrong" choice in a petrified state of dementia, suggesting that Sampredo's choice was the right one. The woman who is constantly looking for him is almost ignored for the beautiful lawyer, but suddenly Sampredo is married when she agrees to help him die. These choices make Sampredo a calculated figure, no matter how beautiful Bardem depicts him. Argumentative I would say it does not convince fully and I do think Amenabar did not intend to add this unbalanced element to his film. For a young director it is still an impressive film and it certainly has strong moments (the discussion between the priest and Sampredo for example). The camera work is impressive and the movie is well behaved. But 10 out of 10 ... no, the movie doesn't reach that excellence.
