If you enjoy the TV series, Diagnosis Murder, you'll love Murder 101. It's great to see Dick Van Dyke again in a murder murder. If we are lucky, this one will start with a TV series or at least a series of movies. <br /> <br /> This movie definitely has some great and notable actors who fulfilled the roles. But it didn't feel like a "face" movie. It really was a story that made you forget the familiarity of those on the screen. <br /> <br /> I made a guess over the end and was so pleasantly surprised to see it again! It's a must have for any mysterious or Dick Van Dyke lover!
