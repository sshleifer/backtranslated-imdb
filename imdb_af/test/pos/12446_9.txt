I did it too. When I first saw the tape, I immediately fired them without first listening to the music. Then one day, out of sheer curiosity, I bought the CD and fell in love with it. So I bought the video. hold on to your lunch kids, it won't be nice! the video was excellent - a great opportunity to hear the music, see the promo videos, and meet the band ... although I still don't know how to handle the masks! a must for all fans of the group, and fans of alternative music in general
