The movie is a good look very considerate. I believe it is a movie about how you want to be in a world created by catalogs. The screens are all the perfect recreation of an Ikea catalog that even watches furniture on their TV. When they break into the kitchen, they break into another perfect picture of what a kitchen will look like in a catalog. When he is born again or whatever you want to call, he returns to the harsh reality of life. I love the bit when he tells his new love that he has left his mate. It stimulates fun on commercial happiness by saying that you can have it all and it's fun to have the same things, but some things you don't want to share. A movie without kids also makes a perfect ten by Say.
