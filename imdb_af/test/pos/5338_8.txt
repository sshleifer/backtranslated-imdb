If you haven't watched the movie yet, but you do like comedy, go out and buy or at least rent it! The fact that it won, the animation Oscar, is no coincidence! I didn't watch many other Wallace & Gromit movies (in fact, I think I just watched one), but the humor is very distinctive ... and some will say a lot of British. In a good way of course! <br /> <br /> The story will only be an excuse for all the jokes that come, but although it's not the most elaborate, it still works (my cousin saw one of the great surprises that is coming yesterday). I didn't, Kudos to her; o)). I think, after watching this one, you go out and look for the other W&G movies out there. Have fun!
