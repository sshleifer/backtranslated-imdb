Fred was such a good show. It was simple but somehow very addictive. I can still remember the days when I wanted to see it on Kids WB Saturdays, but then Kids WB became the unforgivable.Kids WB like that older family member who is trying to "hip" and "funky fresh". * Shudder * They have become like the family member trying to do everything cool, but the effort is a cheesy disaster. They pulled Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Inland and all the other good performances of the most senseless performances I've ever seen in my life (Johnny Test). The only thing that shows me how KWB is anymore is the occasional pieces of old performances and the anime on 4kids. It was such a big mistake to pull it. point to the schedule. It brings me back to my first point ... BRING IT BACK !!!
