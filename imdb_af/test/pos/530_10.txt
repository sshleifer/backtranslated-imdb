I saw this movie tonight. I thought it would be good because I love Natalie Portman a lot and Susan Sarandon is also a good actor, but it was better than I could imagine. You feel good from the movie. The acting was excellent, something that can be hard to come by lately. Natalie Portman is destined for great things and I am a university student at NYU, thinking it's great that she is going to school instead of just being an actor. Anyway, back on the subject, the movie keeps you going all the way and I definitely think everyone should see it. I'll give more details, but I don't want to give the movie away.
