This gives the ordinary guy / girl the opportunity to sing on television as their favorite stars. <br /> <br /> For most of the time, it sounds like the singer they portray. <br /> <br /> Another twist about it. A team of people and customers make the contestant like the singer. They may not look like them, but the likelihood of looking like a person who looks exactly the same is very slim. <br /> <br /> It's a great fun for you on Saturday night - and the contestants are furious as they are on another TV show. The fact that no prizes are involved and that is for fun means that it will attract another kind of person. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have is with the Kids version. They seem to be the Round of stage schools - what happened to ordinary kids?
