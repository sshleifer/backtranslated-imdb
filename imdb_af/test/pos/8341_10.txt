Too many Christian films are concentrated around the fear of Judgment, and as a result it comes down to derogatory and unconscious cheeses. "Second Look" gets it right. It is an almost perfect gospel instrument; It's about the real reason why so many young people want nothing with Christianity. It ensures viewers that they must give their sin - not their fun - to succeed in the Christian lifestyle. "Second Look" even works as a movie maker. The filmmakers obviously work on a very low budget, but managed to write a manuscript that is dynamic enough to distract the attention of the viewers. This movie brought me to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, and thanks to Christian stations everywhere it shows, it surely affected more people than I did.
