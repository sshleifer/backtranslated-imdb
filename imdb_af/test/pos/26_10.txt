This film has its opponents, and Courtney's forklift can offend some people (who actually need a good bang on the head) - but the film is in every way: engaging, gripping, relevant. Of course, Finney is bigger than life. Courtney makes an ideal foil. I thought the performances in both leaders were terribly strong, and Courtney's character offered very dark humor. The time was well captured, the support cast well chosen. It is seen and enjoyed like a sweet heart. I just wish it was on DVD already ... (* sigh *) ...
