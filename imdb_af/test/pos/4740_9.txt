There are many documentaries that I saw where the law was on the wrong side of the fence. The Thin Blue Line and Paradise Lost came in the first place in mind. But this is the first movie to show me with anger after I saw it. It is clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at Waco was at least an unprofessional and messy mess of the FBI and AFI, and in the worst case a murder case. As most people, when the invasion took place at Waco, I assumed that David Koresh was a completely malignant man who led a violent cult. Having seen this, I think Koresh was probably a slightly unbalanced and confused man who accidentally caught the attention of the American government through his eccentric actions. Certainly, there were many weapons at the Tak Davidian connection. But nothing was illegal. It was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the composition, all of them looking very beautiful and harmless. And it was anger to see the reckless testimony of the men in charge of government forces in the Waco area, the impeccable evidence of Janet Reno, and the biased defense of the attack on Waco, a defense led by some of the committee democrats. Most in my mind was the NY representative and current US senator of NY Charles Schumer. I voted for the man when I lived in the NY state. I am a democratic, beautiful, leaning lean too. After seeing his actions on this committee, I wish I could go back in time and vote for D'Amato instead! For anyone who is distant from the government, it is a very important film, a must see. I think even that should be shown in classes - it's so important.
