The first time you watch this movie, you can hate it, but the 2nd time you see this movie, I guarantee the whole place is laughing. The owners of the dogs are so ecclectic that you can't help but look at them and laugh. From the smallest toy poodle to the announcer, everything will make you laugh. And you can learn every single nut, there is!
