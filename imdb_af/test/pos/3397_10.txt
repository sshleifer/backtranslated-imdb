For me, North and South (Books I & II) is the ultimate TV series of the 80's. Just spotting all those cameo performances was highly entertaining. Gene Kelly, James Stewart, Elisabeth Taylor, Olivia De Havilland, Robert Mitchum, even Johny Cash No series came close to this achievement. Have you ever seen someone like Lincoln look like? Dick Smith's prosthetics did even more to Hal Holbrock's powerful performance. The machined costumes, the jawbone, are all. It is clear that there are excellent and bright TV series (Desperate Housewives, Lost, 24), but North and South were one of its kind. Don't miss it. Only David Carradine's portrayal of the ultimate villain (you can just call him a violent man) deserves the show. Maybe characters and situations are stereotyping, I admit it, but the positive sides throw a shadow over them. I'm so happy that it is finally available on DVD in Spain.
