This excitement is one of the few (movie) surprises I've had for some time. Everyone - and I mean EVERYTHING - I talked when it was in the theaters, said it was terrible ... but then I thought ... none of these people really understand horror / thriller movies or metal rock - so WHY DO I listen to them in the first place ????? This movie kicks ass - but ONLY if you can understand and enjoy this type of entertainment. In short (too late) - see it with an open mind and it might just open your mind. ... the soundtracks too ...
