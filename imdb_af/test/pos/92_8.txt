I will assume that this film will get gratings in Canada - especially in Quebec. This is because the Canadian traditionally loved hockey and the Montreal Canadian was for decades as gods in Canada. As an American, the closest thing we have to them is the New York Yankees. If you are a fan then they are the biggest and award winning team in history. If you are not a fan then they are Satan's team !! Well that's how it was as I grew up in Washington, DC regarding the Dallas Cowboys. So I am pretty sure when this film was shown in the north that everyone had a strong emotional response - their national sport and the closest thing to a national team in the NHL. <br /> <br /> Now the cartoon itself is moderately interesting when it starts and the main character talks about the rise around Ottawa and root for Canadian EN Maurice "The Rocket" Richard. But if his mother accidentally bought him a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey and forced him to wear it, I knew right away what a terrible and shameful little boy would be. This ability to link to the character - although living in a distant country - is a very special short film. The way the other children treated him and his conversation with God made it a beautiful nostalgic movie. Very smart and memorable.
