I had been about ten years old when my uncle took me and my brother to see this martial arts movie at the "DRIVE IN" at the circle in Long Beach. The title was "HAMMER OF GOD", of which I can never forget for some reason, but what I remember is the various scenes that have always impressed me. <br /> <br /> My brother always reminds me of the movie though it was forever, we seem to have seen the movie. From time to time, the years I throw out will look for the rental shops, and from time to time I will look at the web and for some reason it never seems to be available or nobody knows what movie I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> If I just knew if and where it was available, I'd love to buy it. If someone is aware of his availability, please notify me.
