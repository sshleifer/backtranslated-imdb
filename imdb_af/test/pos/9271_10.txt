So completely unique and entertaining! Another great Canadian invention. A regular "Joe" (Dan) and a bunch of unfair criminals (aka Puppets), all share residence in a halfway home. She's Dan's job to keep four "societal threats" and help them rehabilitate. Bill, the murderer, Rocko the cigarette smoke dog, Buttons, the nimho teddy bear, and hug the troop doll. The five of them find themselves in all kinds of strange predictions. Despite their murderous and often overt perverse sexual tendencies, it is difficult to love them. <br /> <br /> I give this view a 10/10 simply because it offers great entertainment without the need for a big budget and radiates a Canadian flair that makes me proud.
