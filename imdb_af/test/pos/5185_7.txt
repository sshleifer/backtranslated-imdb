Excellent special effects make this disaster very plausible. One can see that the producers have taken the trouble to get the displays on the computer screens just right - all this makes it very convincing. The sets are also very authentic. A good music choice makes the movie beautiful. <br /> <br /> The action is good and David Suchet's presence obviously adds some weight. Compared to other movies of this genre, Flood is there with the best of them. Fortunately, the aspect of the human drama is not over-done, as is often the case with this type of film. The human suffering is portrayed in perfect balance with the real floods. <br /> <br /> And of course, the movie that many of us suspect anyway confirms: weather forecasters aren't so right! :)
