Despite all the hoopla about the TROUBLE WITH TRIBBLES episode, the BALANCE OF TERROR can only be the best episode of the series. And while I've always loved a lot of the action, because it's so nice, I really have to voice my voice because this Romulan episode is the best. <br /> <br /> The movie, interestingly enough, is really like a submarine movie in World War II, as it protrudes back and forth between the towed Romulan ship and the Enterprise, as it wants to destroy the Romulane before they on the Neutral Zone after an attack on Federation Outposts. In so many ways, the performance is much like the movie. THE TOPIC UNDER - where US Captain (Robert Mitchum) and German captain (Curt Jurgens) are shown opposition as they try to overthrow the other - and in the process a resentment of respect for their enemy. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, only a brief episode of the episode occurs on a planet - and it's great because an episode on the ship could be easily static and boring. But because the writing was so fantastic and the main characters wrote and performed so well (Shatner and Mark Leonard as the Romulan leader). Strange, for the naughty Trekkers out there, they will recognize Leonard as the same actor who later played Spock's dad. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is it's just a huge and extremely engaging episode that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
