Born are black and white distorted images. It looks like it came from the nineteenth century. However, the sound is crystal clear, less the synchronization and the addition of calm nature sounds. <br /> <br /> This movie was very critical of the struggle of life. It shows a single mother and child in a violent world that thrives on the innocent. The mother is very unaware of her environment. This leads to much torture, pain and death. You can see it many times and see different symbolic, plot devices and basically "what does it mean?" <br /> <br /> If you appreciate art in movies, you'll love it. Otherwise, don't bother.
