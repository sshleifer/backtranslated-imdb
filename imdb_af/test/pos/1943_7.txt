I flung through the channels and had to stop and laugh when I got this movie. It was so clear about teenagers in the early 80's, and I called my mom. "Hahaha, turn it on and so, the child looks as if Dad was a kid." <br /> <br /> About. Yes. It turns out this movie is about my father and his friends. <br /> <br /> Even without it being based on my father's childhood, I want to say this movie is watching! <br /> <br /> It's just ... bizarre to say the least, the apathy that was introduced in the teens. It is a good "human interest" and shows some strange sides of the psyche.
