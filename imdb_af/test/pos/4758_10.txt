Growing up in New Jersey and bringing many on the streets of New York in the seventies, he watched a movie such as "The Seven-Ups" or his gender, The French Connection, reminiscent of a time and place which may have been the darkest hour of NYC for some, but which was always one of the pleasurable adventures for me in my early twenties. I really miss those times. As a reviewer noted: "This film captures the strong, cold, factual facts of the winter season in NYC, while sharply exposing the bottom of the region's infamous underworld of crime and policing. A good snapshot of a place and a time and a culture. "A stainless characterization of both the film and the city. The star features of this film - the plot, the movie, the characters, and of course the car hunt - are described in many of the reviews on this. So I will not think about it, except to say that one of My favorite moments takes place during the car hunt, when the camera focuses on Richard Lynch shotgun to male Bill Hickman. The appearance of horror on Richard Lynch's face, along with the defensive gestures, is so out of character for an actor who is much better known as a source of terror, rather than an object of it, that it is actually comic to look. I get a bell every time.
