As a word of explanation, Disney's "The Kid" has absolutely nothing in common with the Charlie Chaplin 1921 classic of the same name. What we do have is a pleasant enough, but incredible, is a good family comedy just like the people at Disney can offer. <br /> <br /> Bruce Willis is in a change of pace a self-centered stuffed shirt from an "Image Consultant". He humiliates, not only his clients, but also those who are near him. You know he needs to change before the final credits. <br /> <br /> In his life, a chapter of his past comes in the form of Willis's character as a ninth 8-year-old who is played with a tangible belief. by Spencer Breslin (Disney always finds these kids somewhere). It forces Willis to understand his past. He knows the rest. <br /> <br /> If Willis love interest is Emily Mortimer and Lily Tomlin as his Executive Assistant. Both have little enough to do as most of the movie involves the interaction between the Willis and Breslin characters. <br /> <br /> "The Kid", though not the biggest of Disney movies, is one that you can sit down and watch with your family and get away with a warm feeling.
