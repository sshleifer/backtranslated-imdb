I saw this movie when it only came out in 1973 and loved it. Since then I've been searching a video, but I've never found it, 33 years later, when I ordered Moviehunter. Sorry to say it doesn't stop. This glamorized version just can't rise to the 1937 production level. I like Burt Bacharach's musical score, it is self-evident, and I even bought a CD of it, but for my taste it does not lend itself to this mysterious and compelling story. Just don't fit. Michael York is out of here. Sally Kellerman throws a good performance, but Olivia Hussy is just ridiculous and is not worth flying through the Himalayas. The best performance is Charles Boyer as the lead Lama.
