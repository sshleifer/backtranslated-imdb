DRIVE LESSONS is a small movie that comes to mind. What initially seems a bit lazy nonsense comedy is British style, a very good story about age and the need for significant friendship of both the young and the elderly. Author Jeremy Brock ('Mrs Brown', 'Charlotte Gray', 'The Last King of Scotland') directs his own script and the result is a coherent, progressive story filled with fascinating and diverse characters, each starred by sterling actors. carried out. . <br /> <br /> Ben Marshall (Rupert Grint, who stands firm as a developing Harry Potter series actor) is a quiet, simple, little poetic seventeen-year-old living with his bird watching Vicar father . (Nicholas Farrell) and his obsessive compulsive, sturdy, evangelical doctor (Laura Linney) in a house where 'needy people', such as the murderous cross-emblem Fincham (Jim Norton) takes precedence over family issues: the mother is on a relationship with priest Peter (Oliver Milburn), with Ben as her cover! Sad Ben, among other things, is trying to learn how to drive a car. His mother is a poor teacher and decides he needs professional lessons. And should get a job to help pay poor Mr Fincham's needs. Ben follows an ad and meets Dame Eve Walton (Julie Walters), an elderly actress who is as much as any character ever created. She started Ben and started the fireworks. Through a series of incidents, including a camping trip that Evie demands, the two take life's lessons from one another's nature: Ben learns self-respect and self-confidence. Evie finds a true friend who allows her to drop her sturdy facade and be the beloved person she hides. <br /> <br /> Julie Walters, who always offers the best skills to act in every character she creates, finds a role like no other here: she is extremely wild and loving. Rupert Grint is exactly the right choice for the challenged age Ben. The chemistry between the two is as gentle as the classic film 'Harold and Maude'. As always, Laura Linney is a wonderful actress who plays a role that is completely different from her usual repertoire. And the supporting role is a panorama of fine characterization. This film is a wonderful surprise and you can warm and entertain the heart with those who love good writing and direction and acting - and message! Grady Harp
