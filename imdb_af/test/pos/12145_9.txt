Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is repeatedly recommended every time I look up a Jean-Pierre Melville movie, which I should give as soon as possible. Since I discovered Melville and seemingly backwards through his filmography, it would be easy for me to miss it as one of his films, but it was made by Claude Sautet in 1960 before Melville would involve his French neo noir claim. <br /> <br /> Classe Tous Risques has two of the best captains of the time, Lino Ventura and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Ventura plays Abel, a gangster banned in Italy with his wife and two children, who want to return to Paris because the police are joining him. After a roaring and quick opening with a big surprise, Abel is eventually hooked with Eric Stark (Belmondo) who wants to come into the criminal underworld. Stark became Abel's driver and ultimately the only friend in an underworld who claimed it was back on Abel after all he had done and had done. The film shows the duality of the two men, the older Abel at the end of his time after the tragedy, beat him up and the younger Eric started just as Abel did, fell in love with a beautiful woman glued to her husband despite the world in which they are part. It never ends beautifully for them, or their loved ones. The one thing to see an individual criminal comes to his death, and that is different than he has loved ones he is letting him down with. <br /> <br /> Like Melville's movie, the seemingly simple story becomes more subtly complicated as it goes along. As usual, as I feel with Melville's movies, it turned my head in a good way and died to watch it again to get what I missed for the first time. Classe Tous Risques is a fixed guard.
