Why would this movie be so good, but just gross an estimated $ 95 million and have no awards nominations? John Travolta knows what he's doing. He knows he's Michael, a cigar smoker, a woman, a magical arch angel who has come to live with a dying lady and is now in a car with the staff of The National Mirror and their dog, Sparky, heading to Chicago. It then becomes a road trip that is both terrible AND great. I don't even think the screens (3 to be exact) make it a tearjerker. The soundtrack is the best with "Heaven Is My Home", "Up Around The Bend" and "Chains Of Fools". I have very great expectations about this and I say that it should have a little more respect in the 90s. Read my comments. Bye!
