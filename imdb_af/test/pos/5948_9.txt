The two new OSS 117 movies have a kind of humor that is both simultaneous and dumbed-down, which I find very amusing. It really reminds me of the classic Pink Panther movies with an almost as good leading man as Peter Sellers in Jean Dujardin. And unlike Steve Martin, who completely destroys Clouseau, Dujardin is quite brilliant. <br /> <br /> Of course, the comments on the anti-Semitic movies are a case of total lack of humor and therefore understanding. <br /> <br /> Whether you enjoy or enjoy this movie, really comes down to what kind of humor you have. I can't wait for the successor!
