Gloria Swanson (as Leila Porter) is a mentally bored woman. Workaholic man Elliott Dexter (as James Denby Porter) "lost" his romance with his waist; He also smokes cigars in bed, eats onions and snores. He can hardly remember his own commemoration - attended by Lewis Cody (like Schuyler Van Sutphen); The younger man looks at Mrs. Swanson's turbulent figure and flashing unashamedly. Soon Swanson will be reported to Mr. Cody. Then Mr. Dexter trying to get her back. Who will win? <br /> <br /> The three principals are good, with Swanson key in the key role of the woman. Julia Faye grabs Cody's other interest, "Toodles"; off-screen, she requested director Cecil B. DeMille. The DeMille touch is clear; especially in an imaginary order in which Cody Swanson promised ... "Enjoyment ?? Wealth ?? Love ??" <br /> <br /> ******* Don't change your husband (1/26/19) Cecil B. DeMille ~ Gloria Swanson, Elliott Dexter, Lew Cody
