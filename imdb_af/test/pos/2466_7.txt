The connection with James Dean? In a short plan we see Emilio Estevez with a teddy bear (remember the first scene of Ray's "rebel without cause"). Furthermore, the main conflict is Estevez versus Sheen, father to son, than in "East of Eden". The soldier came home, and no one could communicate with him, even his sister (a psychology student, who was spotting). The mother, a rough matron (an excellent Kathy Bates), gets her not able to understand that her values ​​(religion, family) have become a thing of the past, especially for someone like his son whose innocence is betrayed. The father, an undisputed man, under his wife's thumb, though trying hard to play the macho, wanted to make mediocrity his life. So he saved his "honor" by forcing his son to do his duty. The scene. in which Estevez's hatred of his father exploded is very intense. The actor director gives a built-in display, integrated, as Lee Strasberg's students used to do, and his last outburst has increased tenfold.
