I love this comedy so much. Will Smith doesn't do anything slow. It's always right on the target with the greatest scripts and comedy that makes you laugh, and involved in the plot. You look at a skilled comedian who plays all his parts well. One totally believes he is who he plays. I loved him and Tommy Lee Jones from the men in black. This comedy is right on the movie. The humor is moving fast, and Will Smith is so confident of himself as he was in black men. Quickly assigned, well trained to make others, but tastefully and with finesse. <br /> <br /> Will Smith seems to renew his comedy routine well. He was so funny. I had the part where he had an allergic reaction to something he had eaten, and his face had cooled, and he looked at Cassius Clay more and more when he did himself. When he saw him on the benadryl bottle trying to bring his head back to the right size. I laughed so hard. He knows how to make us all laugh.
