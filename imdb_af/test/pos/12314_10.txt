Not often it happens that a large director's last film becomes such a moving, brilliant and filmed masterpiece. The movie is excellent as well as the camera. What begins as a cheerful gathering of a group of well-educated early 20th-century citizens. Dublin becomes a dark, philosophical narrative about all our fear of death and the sometimes dark shadows of the past. Thank you, Mr Huston, for this last piece of great theater!
