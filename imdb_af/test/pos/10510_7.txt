Now I have seen many B-grade movies in my 15 years of life, and I have to say it was one of the better ones. I personally enjoyed the property and the storyline, but it suffered from amateur workers (although Adrienne Barbeau gave a decent performance as Lisa Grant). Joseph Bottoms couldn't keep his portion good enough to be considered good. The other movie show fit was Barry Hope (Barney Resnick). It starts with an eager estate agent who takes an Asian couple through a house, just to find there is a dead girl in the shower of the showhome. It progresses with speculator speculator, announcing the key characters with reasonable grace. I think for anybody who's giggling at the over-the-top drama victim victims during the top gory scenes, it's really a gem ... XD Who do I estimate? It's not that good, but a watch is worth boring.
