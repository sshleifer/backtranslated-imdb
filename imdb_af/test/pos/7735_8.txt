Paul Mazursky's Tempest - Interesting, weird and strange movie about a mid-life crisis.Set in NYC and a remote Greek island with John Cassavettes as world-renowned architect who decides to fall out. He is accompanied by his daughter (Molly Ringwald) and a lounge singer (Susan Sarandon). A nice transfer of this 25-year-old movie to the DVD - but without any extras not even the scenic cars. Scenes of great landscapes and sharp dialogue make this 2 and a half hour movie an interesting trip. Scroll Julia and Gena Rowlands around a strong cast.A round drama mixed with comedy and excitement and near madness. This recent DVD release is worth the rent. B +
