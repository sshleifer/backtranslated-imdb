I love this movie, but I don't like how they see Egyptians, who themselves are an Egyptian citizen! therefore it deserves an eight out of 10. <br /> <br /> The relationship between Augustin and the leopard is uncomfortable, and of course due to loneliness and long ago in that cave, he develops a kind of madness and passion for the leopard. <br /> <br /> A very pleasant scene when the leopard dies, looks at Augustine's reaction. <br /> <br /> All in all, I like it and I'm looking forward to reading the short story by Balzac.
