These cartoon writers are relentless with their weird (and fun) words. The first shot we see here is an island prison with the following written above its huge gates: "Alka-Fizz Prison - Noose Is Good Noose." Within the prison, the first sign we see is: "Welcome: seat." They then point an electric chair. <br /> <br /> However, Corny is smart, but our favorite wolf is seen behind bars. With a pen in his hand he literally pulls a door next to him and then escapes through it! In no time did he crucify the United States, cut through Canada and into the northern part of the country. That's where we see the Canadian Royal Mounted Police and of course our hero Droopy, known as "Sgt. McPoodle." He was instructed to catch the big criminals of Alka-Fizz. So, with his trusty blue horse, he goes out into the heavy snow to track down the desired wolf. <br /> <br /> From that point on we get the normal story: Droopy is always a step ahead of the wolf. , no matter what the latter does ... and both characters are involved in some wild and very funny eyes. Droopy even comes out of an eagle's egg on top of a mountain. There is nowhere the wolf can go - or do (plastic surgery!) To escape the fearless "Sgt. McPoodle". No one, incidentally, in the history of cartoons may have more exaggerated reactions than this wolf every time he sees his nemesis! She screams, face and body stretched in horror every time is a big part of the eyes gags. <br /> <br /> You'd think this one-joke cartoon will be monotonous, but it doesn't. These are more good things about Tex Avery and the gang, just one of 24 cartoons in the "Complete Theatrical Collection" DVD with wonderful, restored visual arts.
