Digging robber sits in his cell in anticipation of execution, being visited by a monk who wants to take his last words for the offspring and as a warning to others about the terrible life he has led. For the first time hesitant, but with his tongue being detached, the young tombster soon drank his story full of death, the dead and the things that stumble at night. <br /> <br /> New York lensed horror movie (partially filmed on Staten Island which undoubtedly brought Andy Milligan's mind) is one of the better horror comedies to come in a while. It's an often very funny movie that just turns its story out in every way. The cast is first class. Dominic Monaghan plays Arthur Blake the tombster who tells his story. Ron Perlman is Father Duffy, the monk who takes the position and may become involved in the story. Both men clearly have a great time and show it. The rest of the cast is equally good. The music of Jeff Grace is excellent. The effects are perfect for this kind of ghoulish silliness. The movie is a lot of fun. If there are problems with the movie, it might just be a bit wide, so the result goes far too much. I don't want to give away too much, but I don't think we need the strangers in the mix. Still, it's a lot of fun and the one I am is pretty sure I'm going to watch the IFC again in Theaters where I saw it for the first time, and later I'm sure I'll upload the DVD. <Br /> <br /> worth a look.
