Although the songs and dance numbers are generally not as strong as they would have, the filming and the message of the movie is still there and ringing above the simple 70's music numbers. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this movie was made after the Hollywood Musical was almost dead (with a few exceptions to rock music), the audiences who are going to watch it do not appreciate a brave attempt at something that so far not done. Audiences who see it today will tend to judge it against the films and musicals of today and perhaps the great all-star casts of musical passing. But to do this on this movie, or at least, is an injustice to the movie itself. <br /> <br /> There are some good musical moments in the movie. The first is Bobby Van's. Mr. Van took his role of Harry Lovett just after he closed a 2 year Tony nominee (for best actor) of the Broadway revival, "No, No, Nanette". He is a song-and-dance man from behind and honestly, the only one in the role that was truly talented and experienced for musical. He never misses a step in his "Ask me an answer" and rightly so ... he was completely at home than Harry. Other pleasant numbers are done by Olivia Hussey when she welcomes the new visitors and while the lyrics are weak, James Shigeta shows his strong voice in the "Family" song, as well as a beautifully finished show of the full piece. <br /> <br /> Watch the movie for what it is ... a fantasy about a place you never get old, hidden in the ice and snow-capped mountains of Tibet, found by a group of unconscious contemporary people in the strife of any modern culture. Take it and compare it to reality and you get a movie that doesn't meet a purpose. But ... take this movie for the message of love and peace and tranquility and brotherly love and you get a warm and refreshing message and a positive one to it. <br /> <br /> For some, this movie may seem to welcome others release from the hurry of reality. First, try not to judge and just enjoy the message. Until the second you discovered the secret of Shangri-La!
