I just finished this impressive courageous thing and while I can't say it was as good as I had hoped in my mind, it was still an effective and timely piece of brain that was skewed and misogyny J trash fired. His story tells of a poor gal who is looking for her sister who arrives and is raped by Yakuza scumbags, and the helpful lady doctor who puts her off to do so. It is extremely cruel to a similar rape and drug. Oh yes and there is also a little straight sex on it. Unfortunately, all this is soft, like the Japanese condemnation of under-band nudity, but pixelation is minimal, actually only striking in a hilarious blow job scene. Although writer / director Kazuo "Gaira" Komizu fails to create a particularly compelling story, it is at least beautiful, turbulent things beginning early in the pit of garbage, with a pretty disruptive rape (worse by the fact that the gal a little young, although I'm pretty sure she is of age. Also, for the most part, it is beautiful professional stuff, perhaps not stylish, but it has a certain flair and its content is handled fairly well, with specific kudos, which largely avoids employing much pixelation. Things are mostly sex / rape based for about two-thirds of the sharp carriage and it's nice to see if you're grooving after such a ride, it gets a little over, but the ladies are easy to spot and sometimes it's quite difficult . The music, from YÃ´ichi Takahashi, is sometimes effective, but hardly an important part of the performance it does in a few places, fills the action neatly, at least enough for me to notice. More importantly, the effects are helped by Nobuaki Koga, who packs an impressive grueling punch when they appear, through the insane nature of the climbs. Things even go to a peculiar end, sure it's not a sneak or something, but for a movie so gutter level for most of its runtime, it's relatively attractive. Overall, it is a truly entertaining diversion for moderate rubbish bins, especially those that have a taste for Japanese rape adventures. I could really have done with a longer revenge section and more gore, maybe even more of a point / brain, but hey, it looked me and it is pretty well filled with memorably wtf moments. So if you dig this kind of degenerate junk, probably worth it, you might not expect the return.
