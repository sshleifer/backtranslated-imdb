Fuckland is an interesting movie. I personally love the Dogma movement. I wish it had lasted longer. It has already been dead. Many critics have tried to shut down their damndest. I do not know why. This is the most interesting movement in the movie since the French New Wave. Besides Fuckland, I saw the first three in the series, Festen, Idioterne, and Mifune. They were all great, parties are a masterpiece, in my opinion. Fuckland is not the other. I was just fascinated with the movie entertainment. It is played as if it were a true documentary, with a real person so busy with his camera that he refused to write it down. At some points in the movie it becomes clear that it is a work of complete fiction, but that illusion is stretched out for an incredible amount of time. I wish the filmmakers wanted to do something that was a little more interesting to put on the screen. It's basically about this man, Fabian, who is an Argentine visitor to the Faulkland Islands. Argentina has only been allowed on the islands for the past few months, and Fabian plans to fertilize the women with Argentinian children. He raised his eyes and most of the movie was spent on her seduction. The two actors are very natural. Camilla Heany just a few tips that she is an actress. Fabian Stratas looks really real. The film's politics is somewhat confusing to me, as I am just busy with the situation around the island and its recent history. I was 3, I think, when the Faulklands were invaded. The final piece of the movie doesn't work at all. I don't get what the filmmakers go there. Yet Fuckland is an interesting Dogma experiment. However, it breaks some Dogma rules, especially the no extra-diagic music rule. There are many of them. 10/07.
