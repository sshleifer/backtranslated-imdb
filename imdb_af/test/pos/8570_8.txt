It must be my guilty pleasure. I'm a big fan of 80's movies designed to entertain and don't care if they offend anyone. This move has no meat, not dust, no deep-minded challenging scenes. Just plain old college kids with fun and if some breasts need to be shown, then that's it! This movie is for when you just want to relax and not think. Viva la nudity!
