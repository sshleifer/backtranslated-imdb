Few people realize this, but there was world literature in the ancient world before the Greeks came to the scene. In addition to the literary remnants that are in the "Old Testament" of the Jews, there were considerable works from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The top of the former was the religious poetry and "The Epic Of Gilgamesh". The Egyptians produced many poems, but there was the main addition to a story of adventure by a traveler and doctor called "The Story Of Sinuhe". It is from this work (actually a fragment we do not know the end of) that the novel "The Egyptian" comes from. <br /> <br /> The story is unique (like the movie). The Egyptian was a best seller in the early 1950s, and Darryl Zanuck decided to make a chance: yes, he wanted a showcase for his girlfriend Bella Darvi as Nefer, as well as the rest of the movie (Victor Mature, Edmund Purdom, Peter Ustinov, Michael Wilding and Gene Tierney, but he was aware that these films rarely made a big box. One can try this as an example of Zanuck trying another. <br /> <br /> The number of films dealing with ancient Egypt is very small. "The Egyptian", "The Ten Commandments" (both De Mille versions), "Moses", "Holy Moses!", "Cleopatra", "The Mummy" (All Versions), "The Scorpion King". If there are 20 movies about ancient Egypt, it's great. But "the Egyptian" is unique. While the second "Ten Commandments" discusses Ramses the Great (Pharoah Ramses II - Yul Brynner) and his father Seti I (Cedric Hardwicke), and the films on Cleopatra deal with her, there are few other names of ancient Egypt recorded in film . Egypt's largest Pharoah was Thutmos III, which was most of the well-known Middle East of the 1470 B.C.E. conquered. or so. No film about him appeared, nor from his predecessor, history's first major female ruler Hatschepsut. But the only known Pharoah who tried to embark on a religious revolution, which approached the Jews (and later the Christians) - a kind of monotheism - is the subject of the "Egyptian". This is Pharoah Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> In fact, Akhnaton did a personal form of monotheism not intended for public consumption. But this became the priestly class that Amon worshiped, rather than Aton. Because of our uncertain historical records (although Akhnaton's official records - the Tel-el-Amana letters - are completely complete as far as they survive), we do not know if the Pharoah was murdered in a palace coup. However, he died, he was succeeded by a young brother or son whose name is better recalled than any other Pharoah except Ramses: Tutankhamun. <br /> <br /> This movie is actually pretty good, as far as it goes. Wilding makes a good natural Akhnaton, which is too weak to be as effective as a religious reformer, is supposed to be. Adult is good like the ambitious (and - beyond the film - eventually successful future Pharoah) Horemheb. Tierney and Purdom do well in their main parts and Ustinov is good as Purdom's friend. Also good is Ms Darvi, in a big supporting part. In a wonderful como is John Carridine, as a philosophical tomb robber. The film is definitely worth watching, as one of the few attempts to share the history and culture of ancient Egypt.
