I saw Anatomy years ago - called a friend's house, I don't remember much, and when I saw the video store, there was a second one - not really related to the first one that Franka Ponte a little cameo. don't make it. And that one was okay not as good as the first one. Tonight I see the first one - not the collectors edition. I really like German movies like this one, it's very interesting and people and cults like the one in the movie can exist, I think, I don't know. But it is very entertaining and scary. Anatomy 2 is a little different and the characters are not as good as the first. But if you really thought Anatomy was interesting and good, you should see the second one.
