I saw this movie as a kid and I want to see it again. did it survive? I totally discount the 1980 version as a fluff. I am sure there are many who do not feel it is necessary to preserve these films. It's so sad to discover a lost gem after it's gone. Young people today do not realize the hallucinating quality and the impact on life can have a film seen in early youth in later life. This movie, "the blue lagoon" had that effect on me. How many of us wanted to remove ourselves from the fears and chaos of the modern world. It was an idyllic story of a boy and a girl who swayed on a tropical island. There are problems to be sure, but eventually they fall in love and have a baby. Life must be so simple and beautiful.
