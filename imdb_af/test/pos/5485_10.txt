I'm a huge fan of big, hard, trashy, completely silly movie movies like The Rock, Con Air, etc. All this is nice to watch, but if you think about it, it's very stupid. In the line of fire tells a story and it tells it well. With credibility as well as excitement and excitement, it has also addressed several important moral questions that really make you think. The last shot of the movie is Eastwood and Russo who sit together on the steps of the White House and look at the pigeons after soft, quiet music and I feel a deep sense of satisfaction. This was because I care about the characters and I was happy for them that their story came to a happy conclusion. It felt like a real story. As the aging secret service agent plagued by not protecting JFK on the fatal day in Dallas, Clint Eastwood is fantastic. He brings his paranoia brilliantly and his personal need to stop his opponent. On the other side of the spectrum is John Malkovich, as the gruesome predator Eastwood tortures about what happened in 1963 by telling him publicly about his plan to kill the current president. This Oscar-named performance really gets under your skin. Malkovich speaks throughout the movie in Eastwood as if they were friends. He does not threaten him, he does not lie to him, he does not laugh at him, but he interferes with him until the last moment with his unbearable kindness. As well as this exciting main chart, there is a lovely love story in which Rene Russo, another agent and Eastwood are involved. Despite the age difference, they have excellent chemistry on the screen and the director doesn't show it too much, but keeps it as part of the background that works well. In summary, I love this movie because it has a thought.
