This movie hits the heart with reality like no other I've seen. It shows us what we take for granted in a democratic society and just what we are happy to not experience. The acting in the movie is wonderful. Sometimes you have to remind yourself that the movie is a dramatization, not real life. Mr. Rickman does wonders with his role (as he does with all roles) to make the interviewer fully dimensional and human. The set is incredible. It gives the feeling of 'in the round' theater. It does not add or remove the emotion of the action. This movie seeks to open the eyes of the viewer and I would say they have made that goal successful. .
