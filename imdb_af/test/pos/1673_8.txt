This film is a work of pure class from beginning to end, forgetting the famous 28 minutes no dialogue cage, forgetting that it is in Paris and forgets it is Noir. The film itself, the premise and the performance make it a pure gold experience. It is crisp intelligent and pervasive in detail, just like itself. It depicts true characters who are not only credible, but with whom you feel compassionate. It's a movie that doesn't enchant the idea of ​​a robbery, but it shows what it is ... theft. It shows that a lift is hard work and ultimately not worth doing. Now, consider considering giving it a 28-year-old sequence without speaking a word and sitting in beautiful Paris with real attention to detail and fantastic cinematography and the last scene ... when you look up and those trees see. Wonderful use of raw and basic filming techniques. This is a masterpiece in my view and I am happy to see it.
