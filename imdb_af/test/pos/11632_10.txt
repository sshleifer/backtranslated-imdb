Barney is about "IMAGINATION" that you did not want if my preschooler never wanted to play as if they were doing that show, then I would worry. What is 2 or 3 years old actually gets everything that is all about colors and singing. For those of you who say everything they do at Barney is eating junk food and recommending Sesame Street better, which is 'cookie sample' that's all he eats, but I haven't seen anyone commenting on one. I agree that sesame is a better educational performance, but barney is just like a show for fun, don't be too serious if you don't like your child watching TV and worrying about understanding things you do not believe, then do not "do not put them in front of the TV first, because everything is false. Everything is fake actors are fake. Why don't you do your fake brain and put it to use and think if you have a problem with a fake TV show for kids, then turn it off and play with them yourself and teach them what you want them to BIG BIRD or Bert & Ernie or Barney teach anyone what all the programs are seeing and coming out.
