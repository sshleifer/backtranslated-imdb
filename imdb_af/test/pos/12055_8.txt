The story of an obsessed lover (Shahrukh Khan) and the length he goes to get his true love (Juhi Chawla) already married to her husband (Sunny Deol). The film is considered one of Shahrukh Khan's best performances and dedicated to critics and audiences. Fear that your love may not be reciprocal, fear that you may lose the one you love, fear that your loved one may have a change of heart. In short, fear is the villain in every love story. <br /> <br /> But in 'Darr' fear is the utmost expression of passion, obsession and sacrifice. 'Darr' is the story of Rahul (Shahrukh Khan) whose love and obsession for Kiran (Juhi Chawla) frees him from all fears of life and death. 'Darr' is Sunil's (Sunny Deol) story, whose sustained love and passion for Kiran gives him the courage to experience the fear of death. <br /> <br /> And finally, "Darr" is Kiran's story caught between one man's love and another man's obsession. She fears one and the other fears. One stands for love, the other for life. In this battle between love and life, the supreme superintendent is love, because love always lives and dies. Just "Darr" is one of the best Indian movies ever made.
