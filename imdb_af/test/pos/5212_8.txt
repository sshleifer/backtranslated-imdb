It's a movie I come back for several reasons. As proof of the suffering of the ordinary soldier on the Eastern Front in World War II, it is a powerful one. There are a number of very powerful scenes in the film that help capture the horror of the war, such as the tank battle. Furthermore, from what I can see the experiences documented in the movie, it's actually "true" - if you read A. Beevor's book "Stalingrad," you'll know what I mean. The film is also successful in that it does not allow character or plot to dominate it - it is merely a story of survival, which attempts to portray the struggle mainly from the standpoint of the ordinary (German) soldier. I read somewhere that the original script had to be burned down, which didn't surprise me at all - if they really wanted to show how the battle was, it would be almost impossible to make sure. Still, there are a few moments that are hard to watch - it's made before Private Ryan, but may be even more difficult. Just one word of warning - don't buy the baptized English version, it's pretty awful and welcomes the movie. Try to get a copy in the original (German) version with English subtitles, which is much more powerful. You might buy a region 1 DVD of the movie, as I did.
