This is the second film about 1985, the other one being 'The Wedding Singer'. While the 'Wedding Singer' depicted the pop side of the 80's, 'Rock Star' is just about metal. <br /> <br /> Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute to a well-known rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day. <br /> <br /> The story doesn't get too dramatic and just scrap the surface of a rock star's life. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it's full of Rock'n Roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are brilliantly targeted! The whole concert feeling was very well captured, as they used real audiences (no cgi here). <br /> <br /> Great direction and a brilliant performance by Marky Mark, acting like a real metal man! <br /> <br /> 'Rock Star' is all about fun and if you have something to do with the old metal scene, you'll love this movie! <br /> <br /> 10/10
