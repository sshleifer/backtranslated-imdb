This drama that takes place in Chicago in the early 60's in the early 60's follows us a group of high school friends as they navigate up and down their lives. The two central characters are Leroy "Preach" Jackson (Turman) and his best friend Richard "Cochise" Morris (Hilton-Jacobs.) Both boys have promising future. Preach is a good writer, but a lazy student, and Cochise has just received a college scholarship. When they don't kick at the local chips at the local chips with their friends, or get out of a friend's house or chase girls, they go to school, drive the trains through Chicago or go to quarters in the weekends. /> <br /> Things go wrong if Preach and Cochise make the mistake of getting involved in two hoods and going into a stolen car. Police are pursuing them and they are being arrested. But thanks to the efforts of a skilled teacher (SNL's Garrett Morris), they are released. But the two hats are not, and vowed to take revenge on Preach and Cochise, and think they were blaming the whole thing. <br /> <br /> This movie is very episodic, but it still works because it's life, a series of episodes. Some funny, a little sad, a little romantic, weird. The film never gets boring, because all the characters are so well-played and realistic, and the situations are all credible and related. Like a beautiful girl, or a party that becomes violent when an asshole decides to start a fight, or to preach a little younger brother or sister. But even when a situation is not personally related, as the guys claim to be a spectacle to keep a hooker out of money, so they can get all their friends into a movie, the order is still hilarious. <br /> <br /> 'Cooley High' was the basis for the classic 70's sitcom 'What's Happenin!' broadcast on ABC from 1976-1979. Although the show is best known for the character Rerun, he is not in this movie, and there is no character like him. The humor of the show was very broad but still funny. The humor of 'Cooley High' is more lively and therefore more entertaining. <br /> <br /> In addition, the soundtrack is great. Classic songs of that time by Diana Ross & The Supremes, The Temptations, Martha & the Vandellas, and Smokey Robinson play throughout the film, adding to the fun, youthful, exuberant tone of the movie.
