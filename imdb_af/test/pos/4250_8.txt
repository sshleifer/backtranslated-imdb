"Putney Swope" is a unique, low-low budget gem of the late 1960s that would probably have been forgotten in time if it wasn't for two things: Paul Thomas Anderson (who named Don Cheadle's character in "Boogie Nights" , Buck Swope, after the eponymous hero of this film) and the limited DVD release. Watching Putney Swope is like listening to hardcore punk rock: it can't make much sense (at least it wasn't after I first watched it), but you have to respect the movie for his passion and unceasingly rebellious message. I didn't understand many things about "Putney Swope", but for the most part I liked it. The more I think about the movie, the more it gets on me. <br /> <br /> The film is advertised as a parody of New York's Madison Avenue, best known in the 1960s as the world's advertising capital. Members of Generation X and Y can be lost on this concept, but fortunately "Mad Men" is on TV to provide us with this otherwise lost piece of American history. What you need to know before watching this movie is that these advertising agencies were mostly masculine, and even more largely white businesses. <br /> <br /> With this premium in mind, open the movie with an advisory board meeting. The members are mostly white except Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson, who has an unprecedented deal with Dick Gregory in this movie), the African American token on the board. The councilors are so self-absorbed and despondent that when their chairperson dies before they die, their only concern is next. Without removing the body from the boardroom, they start a ballot paper to elect the next chairman. <br /> <br /> Putney Swope is preferred by landslide but not because other members think Swope is qualified. Voting for Swopes was a poor attempt to sabotage these councilors any other member's chance to be elected chairman. With their plans retreating, Swope takes control and sinks the boat, and shoots all but one of the original members and hires all people of color in their place. <br /> <br /> To this point, the movie has (for me) become very strange and difficult to follow abruptly. There may not even be a plot. The whole idea of ​​the movie seems to be a "what if" scenario, with the result that the new "Truth and Soul Inc" firm would be unconventional but successful. The firm ends up making so much money that members build a large glass box to keep the cash in for inexplicable purposes. This can be because Swops do not trust banks, although the point is not touched or explained in the film. It can also be metaphorical in some way, but who knows. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie takes place in the advertising agency, with occasional scenes in the White House with a president for some unknown reason. My assumption here is that some political joke has been made, but I can't figure out what. Were the filmmakers that the president is a small, insignificant part of American life? Did they say the latest elected officials (Nixon at that time) were insignificant candidates? I do not know. However, I found it a little anxious that the man playing the president has a striking deal with future president Ronald Reagan. It's funny to make that connection 40 years after the movie. <br /> <br /> What this film benefited from is how consumers outside the advertising agency responded to the new ads. Of course, the advertising footage had a strange, funny appeal for its unconventional creativity, but did these ads convince people to buy the product? If so, how? The movie showed that the new advertising campaign was successful through customer interaction and the White House calls. However, seeing average people would be revealing as demographics were always the most profitable for advertisers. <br /> <br /> Though the parodies and political messages that made this movie possible, probably not the test of The film had many unique features. Arnold Johnson had a magnetic X-factor for him that greatly benefited him in this film. Swope's rough voice was actually director Robert Downey, Sr. Sometimes the voice is bad, but fits the character so well into being an authoritative outsider. He rents and shoots workers arbitrarily, but earns the respect of all but one of the employees for the revolution of the advertising agency and the search for new ideas. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie was and still is incredible. risky, especially since the film is written and directed by a white man (Robert Downey, Sr.). However, this film refuses to be the victim of negative black stereotypes that will cause the rise and fall of the blaze exploitation genre years later. While some of the sex scenes may be a bit scary for some viewers, the main message is that a business that is owned and operated can thrive through innovation and risk. Many people may not take a positive message from this movie, but I just did. <br /> <br /> "Putney Swope" remains a forgotten movie from a strange era, and Downey, Sr. (Even in spite of his son's recent comeback), he has never been recognized as a director he deserved. However, if you get a DVD from this movie, buy it and watch it. If this is on Netflix, that's it. It's a movie that can sometimes be confusing, but it's worth watching for its gusto, ambition and its non-conforming stature, even according to today's film standards.
