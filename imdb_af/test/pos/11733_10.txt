The jazz soundtrack makes it like a Clint Eastwood movie. <br /> <br /> In fact, the whole thing strikes me as Burt to Clint. The story is good and the movie is full of one linen I carry with me to this day. (Reynolds for a bad man: I'm going to pull the chain on your partner because you're my village. And you want to know the worst part? You're out of state!) <br /> <br /> Highlights: The Technics 1500B reel to reel is a good set of accessories for the audio file! <br /> <br /> Charles Durning comes unlucky while listening to wiretap tapes of prostitutes who have (kind) phone sex. (You have to see it, trust me, it's hilarious.) <br /> <br /> Brian Keith is playing against kind as a hard man. (And do it well!) <br /> <br /> Bernie Casie's concern with Zen. <br /> <br /> Rachel Ward. WOW! (Where does she go?) Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show band play their rears as usual. (Joe Willem's guests on the choir. Manhattan Transfer repeated "Route 66".) The soundtrack lends the class for the whole thing. <br /> <br /> Should I say more? It may be Reynold's best movie. <br /> <br /> (Yes, he plays himself as usual, but it works!) <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
