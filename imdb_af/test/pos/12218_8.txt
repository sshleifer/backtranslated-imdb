*** SPOILERS *** Whatever (or not) can be said about it, SURFACE is excellently manufactured. The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx is nothing if it's not the latest. Conceptually, the show offers a bit of everything - and for just about everyone (parents, children, fantasy and / or fx fans). THIRD CHILD DOUBLE RELEASE through BLACK LAGOON CREATION, with some JAWS and GODZILLA well-thrown in, says. And there was also no single sour note that didn't act either; a little surprisingly solid casting here. This series of SURFACEd, apparently from nowhere, and through its simple storytelling, brings the viewer together for the better part of an entire season. All in all, a job done very well. I just hope it will be the next season again.
