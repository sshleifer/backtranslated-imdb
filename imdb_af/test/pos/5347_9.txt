Imaginative, fast, satirical! Americans do 'zany', but the British do 'sly' - and they like to make fun of themselves (ahem: unattractive teeth, big lips / nose, 'veddy' ordinary or 'veddy' snobs, obsessed with the 'gahden '). Within jokes for the older people in the audience, lots of action for the kids. Subtle use of devices from other classic movies (look for 'Back to the Future', 'Indiana Jones ..', 'Harvey', 'Tremors' .. and more). Also, a smart 'buddy' movie (Gromit is a quiet but inventive sidekick). Add brilliant voice work through Bonham-Carter and Fiennes (is it true? The best acting is being done in animation today?) - enjoy! I saw it with the grandchildren. fun time for everyone. - canuckteach
