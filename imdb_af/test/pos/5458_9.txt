Over the years I have watched this movie many times to see it on "HBO" and I now have a copy on DVD. I have to say it's been memorable and entertaining, and it's interesting and educational. Like any TV fan can relate to the time of the early 90s when the time came to replace Johhny Carson with the TV legend of The Tonight Show, who is going to be Jay or Dave? This original film by HBO "The Late Shift" remains where to shape and portray the right events, which have the back of the screens between the networks heads of NBC and CBS and even ABC, they all searched for the services of Jay and Dave. The play really makes it, since very small, real-time TV shows are shown to real people, as the actors depicting Leno and Letterman make it look. I didn't read the Bill Carter book, so I don't know if it really did fit the pages, but I really enjoyed the movie. From the moment it starts showing that CBS entertainment heads look to Leno sub for Johhny, and they decide they want to enter the late night game. Yet, when Carson announces its unexpected retirement, NBC wants to remain loyal to Leno, but conflict only comes when Letterman wants a lock at 11:30. It was nice to watch the wacky encounter with Michael Ovitz (Treat Williams) which makes all networks want to consider Letterman for a show. It was interesting to see the scene of Johhny who told Letterman in a direct way in order to walk from NBC and consider CBS. And by the way, Rich Little was great as Johhny Carson couldn't agree on his portrayal. And many exciting moments were provided by showcasing Leno's talent manager Helen, who is demanded by NBC chiefs. Overall good movie showing what TV really is and proving that networks are power and money hungry while showing it's a cardinal business. Obviously there is no business like show business. Great work by HBO very memorable and a watch any time it showed the true story of the late night wars.
