Movie about two Australian girls - Debbie (Nell Schofield) and Sue (Sue Knight) - and what happens when they become friends of two surfer guys. <br /> <br /> I caught it at an art cinema here in America. in 1981. Technically I was another teenager (I was 19), so I was interested in how Australian teenagers acted. Script shows there's nothing new here. It shows the usual teen adventures that are about dating, sex, suicide, etc. I always knew what was going to happen before it did, but I was never bored. What I found interesting was, despite the accent and a few changes in clothes and hair, these teens are not much different from American teenagers. They had many of the same problems and hang-ups. It was also based on a true surfer girl's book and her real life adventures and (I heard) it was a true adaptation. The acting was just OK, but the actors were attractive and made good and pretty interesting. So this is not an unassuming masterpiece, but a beautiful, accurate portrayal of what it is like to be a teenager and to try to be with the popular kids. I give it a 7.
