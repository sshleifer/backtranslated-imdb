I thought it was a very daring presentation of the old Hokey 'Tarzan' concept so popular by Hollywood, Weismuller, et al. Yes; There are many stupid things. But then the idea is stupid. It is almost unbelievable that a human baby can become obsolete through adulthood. I'm tempted to say absolutely incredible, but the concept has never been tried. And there is definitely a bit too much anthropomorphism for comfort. Although under the circumstances I can see how it would be very difficult to avoid. We now also have a much greater insight into the issues of acculturation, and know that one born of infancy without human behavioral attempts will eventually never learn in adulthood. <br /> <br /> Still, if you can get your head around that lot there is plenty to admire that is imaginative and daring. Lambert does the cattle thing with a terrific aplomb. I am tempted to say that it plays the most convincing and sympathetic role I have seen him. There are also many other good performances. Not least, including Sir Ralph Richardson and Ian Holm. <br /> <br /> What is particularly disturbing - and rightly so - is the simian perception of people. We almost get ourselves from the point of view of the poor, stupid, helpless brutes over whom we routinely practice. And this proves well how the false 'civilization' and 'morality' with which we cover and justify our behavior is just an expression of selfishness and arrogance. Sometimes it looks exaggerated, especially in the hidden museum dissection rooms, but what we see is not just a truth about Victorian; It is a truth about the way we are today. This is one that has to be said and cannot be explained often enough. Holm's character's obsession with the "ray-zor" as a symptom of civilization - as if it were facial, was a primitive state to be despised - is an excellent case in point. Primitive bearded readers take note. <br /> <br /> The story is depressed. Ultimately, it's a tragedy. For though he returns to the jungle and the freedom of moral tyranny, which is truly human 'civilization'; we know he's doomed. Before the third millennium is 50 years old, wild simians are hunted out in extinction as bush meat, and their environment has developed for agriculture and mineral exploitation to satisfy insatiable human excess. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a story about ourselves. The road to extinction that other simians trap must eventually be followed by humans. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for its ethical tasks, despite the hokey moments.
