I saw this movie at the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival. La Pianiste strengthens the "Austrians = grim" thesis I formulate. Isabelle Huppert won a well-deserved best actress in Cannes for her portrayal of a woman who, in her attempt to achieve the artistic ideal, lost her humanity. Trapped by her talent, she represses her emotions and her sexuality until they can only be expressed in distorted and frightening ways. When a younger student falls in love with her, our hope rises, but soon comes to the realization that she cannot experience love like others. It's too late for her and the movie's last 30 stubborn minutes are, without exception, the beautiful music that lasted 90 minutes. The message seems to be that the music itself is not enough without the life and beauty it describes.
