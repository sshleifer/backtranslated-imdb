If you were ever in a house, you didn't know, or if you saw the original and enjoyed it, then it's a good choice. If I ignore the reviews and posted here, I continued and hired this movie because of the memories of how the original scared me as a teenager. This movie has (of course) changed the original story to deal with teens' teens, as the babysitter is in trouble to go over her cell phone minutes and needs a baby seat to pay her bill. However, it does fit well with the original story line. If you can't talk to the baby, you don't know the house and it's usually pops and cracks, it's kind of tense. When the killer is shown, he is very creepy and you find yourself with the girl to get out of the house. If you have never been in a situation like this, you will probably not be able to relate it and will not like it. It's all about understanding her fear.
