Charles "Chic" Sales is absolutely wonderful, as the only member of the Leeds family is willing to testify against a gunman, murdered a policeman and an informant. He fought at the Bull Run in the Civil War and his patriotism goes high even after his son-in-law was beaten and one of his grandson was kidnapped by the gang, intimidating all the other members. Fear of his grandson's death is no excuse, he says. He doesn't want his grandson anyway in a country run by gangsters. The conflict between civilian duty and personal safety is sharply driven in this Oscar-nominated story. Walter Huston is also in favor of the lawyer of the difficult driving district who threatens the family with perjury if they do not restore their killer identification in court. The rest of the role, including the messy killer, Ralph Ince, is all excellent, and the movie is funny by William A. Wellman. There is also good tension as sales just disappear as the trial begins.
