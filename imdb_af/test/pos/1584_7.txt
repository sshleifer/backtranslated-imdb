I first heard of Commander's Log when I was at Congress for the local science fiction convention. Craig Bowlsby, Linden Banks, Sophie Banks and Brian Oberquell came out to show the video and give some panels to make television on a scant budget. I must say that I was very happy when I finally had the opportunity to see the show. Comparisons with Red Dwarf are inevitable, as the first seasons of the Red Dwarf are also shot at a low budget (although Commander's Log has to set a record for the least amount of money spent per minute of air time) make up for the lack of "eye candy" with good writing and acting. Linden Banks, who plays Chief Blather Blather, does a particularly good job of offering a serious but clueless persona. <br /> <br /> Bowlsby's original idea was that the story was told in two minutes "interstitials", which in between other performances during the evening, though Space for some reason did not find out how idea it would have been, and so the interstitials were all rolled into a one-hour show, usually showing space in two half-hour episodes. The existing DVD does not include episode 3 (played in Cascadia-Con in Seattle in 2005) or episode 4 (seen at VCON in Vancouver in 2006), but if you are in contact with your local fannish community, you might get news from somewhere near you.
