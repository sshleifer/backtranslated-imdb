I found this movie in an Australian hotel room at 3am. My brother and I were surfing the channel and who we see a young Russian Crowe. But not the phone that Russel Crowe threw made us known in the states and had quasi-love. This movie, to my surprise, was incredibly creative and hilarious. It is a movie of uncomfortable teens with hilarious stories of strange sexual experiences, including a clever salesman, prostitutes and an unusual sexy mother. If you are lucky to pass this movie, I would highly recommend picking it up. I must say this movie was incredibly entertaining and I thank Australia's fine people for making it ...
