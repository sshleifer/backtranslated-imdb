Two hours ago I watched this brilliant movie that overwhelmed me with his captivity photo. It's pretty understandable how it won the prize of the best camera in Cannes 2000. Close up of walls, people and many other things. The warm colored lighting (which is also usually the director) gave the movie a warm atmosphere. Only two people are seen mostly in most of them. An interesting music and especially three songs or themes have accompanied the movie almost all the time. Each of these themes represents a certain atmosphere throughout the movie. Silence and slow motion characterize the film. Certain scenes were prolonged moments or serious close ups. Not only Tony Leung deserves a prize for his outstanding acting, as Maggie Cheung was also so brilliant. I wonder how many dresses she wears in the different scenes. The story is also linked somehow to the history of Hong Kong and the region in the 1960s. This prevented me from understanding certain details of the text, especially at the end. In short, I would recommend the fans of art films to see it in the theater.
