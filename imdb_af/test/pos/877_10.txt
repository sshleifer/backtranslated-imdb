This movie is extremely well-marketed. When it was released in 1997, everything and everything with its name sold in the center of Master P's reputation and success from the shelves. Therefore, it is no wonder that this underground urban drama is selling and still selling over 250,000 copies. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of No Limit, or even now, watch it now. It has some old school fuck videos and doesn't get me with the freaky deaky strippers on the bonus Ice Cream Party. So what I do not like to all the people who do not like Master P or No Limit Records should not see it, because it is not for you and does not save it because you will only deter TRU No limit fans of the rent or purchase this video with your low voice.
