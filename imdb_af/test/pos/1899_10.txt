Anyone interested in the movie show in the 70s, watch this movie. Some of the dialogue in this movie is so funny the summary of my presentation. Also look out for the boyfriend that appears in some of the screens as well as the best karate action ever. Do not take this movie seriously or you will be disappointed, enter it with an open mind and step into the world of one of the worst mutha in the world Dolemite !!! Edit Edit It sits together as it was cut with a razor, but again this movie is so much more than you see in the movie that influenced the black community in ways you don't understand !!!
