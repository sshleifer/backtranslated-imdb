I thought the interaction between Crystal and DeVito was great. The movie is rather off the wall, but there are a few memorable lines. Ramsey as "Momma" is vulgar and top, but also very funny and effective. The character should be pretty terrible for why else would someone remember thoughts of murdering his mother? Now, Crystal's wife - she's a "slut" that everybody wants to receive, so her role, though small, is also effective because it has to justify Crystal's ridiculous "block of writing" case. While there are definitely dark moments, the film is not depressed and despite the murderous pressures the protagonists feel, they also have qualities. <br /> Overall, this is one of the funniest movies I can remember, one I don't mind watching over several times.
