I think those who were in one-sided relationship of some kind could previously identify with the main character Minako (Yuko Tanaka), a 50-year-old woman who is still in the pink of good health, as demonstrated by her daily be. , slime routine to wake up early in the morning to prepare for her milk delivery work, where his bottles of Megmilk in a bag in a trail around her village have to sink like clockwork, empty bottles for adult exchange and collect payment and receipt receipt. And there is always that one top-of-the-line delivery top that has to scale a long step to reach customer satisfaction. <br /> <br /> And, oddly enough, it stops, was an end to a man she was in love with almost all of her teenage adult life and didn't appreciate the product but the sink washed out. After going to the same school, we see that they are not talking to each other, and in their daily lives it always looks physically so close, yet so far. There is no eye contact, except for the obvious cans of chance, and little recognition of each other's existence. We learn that they share a past that probably destroyed all the concepts of being together, impeding clear attraction between the two to further develop through the previous generation. <br /> <br /> While thinking that Minako was an interesting woman in herself, one who had suppressed her feelings for so long, just wondering what kind of damage it would do. When I read that the original Japanese title means "at a time the days you read books" and that is accurate, I felt the movie had a wonderful final with the shot of her well-filled bookshelf, probably the fact that She not only is not all, and has probably returned to her crutch of all kinds to deal with the pain of being alone, and back to a lifestyle she has been accustomed to for 50 years. Apart from immersing herself in two lanes, she has the books that serve as a form of escapism, and occasionally some sweet nothings to song devotion on the radio. <br /> <br /> Yuko Tanaka did a laudable job as the emotional work. strong woman thanked her for her fate and her decision to love no one else, her intentions of love, Takanashi (Ittoku Kishibe) was a more interesting character who had more facets. While faithfully adhering to marital promises, he spends considerable sabbatical time on his sickly servant wife (played by Akiko Nishina) while juggling his social welfare work in the children's affairs department. I felt that as a childless couple, the work offered him a way of caring, not for his own, but for the children of others, the upset people who were neglected and abandoned. In a rare moment of anger, we see how he is angry with such older parents who do not appreciate their children's lives. <br /> <br /> The story of Kenji Aoki gives little time to make his characters appeal and successful efforts to give so much more glimpses and dimensions into them, such as Takanashi being a hopeless Haiku poet, despite the fact that that he is a member of the Haiku club, and supporting characters such as the old Minagawa couple, where Masao (Koichi Ueda) borrowed some comic but sad moments, while slowly becoming senile, while wife Toshiko ( Misako Watanabe) tells and brings us through this love story of a single woman of 50. Even Akiko Nishina's performance as the maid woman was nothing but detention. enlightened state to know her husband's past and make selfless and painful decisions in her sick state. <br /> <br /> This is what you can expect from a typical Japanese romantic movie, sans young, nubile lead as strong noise sed lovers, but with all the other elements in place such as romantic essay, love songs and the essential limited but loving behavior. I thought the story was in danger of going off the track when unsatisfied love is maintained, but director Akira Ogata has managed to prevent the usual melodramatic moments in such stories, although the story has a clear plot development in the final act. required. what you can predict, especially if you are already past your Romance Movie 101. <br /> <br /> If you are not your average love story, I thought the Milkwoman told a strong story with unrequited love as a central theme. , and honestly a recommended romance movie (albeit at a measured pace) if you're in the mood for bittersweet love, memory, and trying to live without regret.
