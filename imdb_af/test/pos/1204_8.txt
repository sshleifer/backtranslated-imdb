The first time I saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving it and everything about it. 13 years later I am now 17, and decided to watch it about a month ago, because I am taking a 1960 class class at school. I didn't really know what to expect because it was 13 years since I last saw it, but I was totally blown away. The actors were wonderful, the music was so nice, and I find myself singing every song. Treat Williams is wonderful like Berger, the "leader" of the hippie group, who always gets what he wants, somehow (except for the end, of course). John Savage is actually very convincing like Claude, the Oklahoma Drafee who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D'Angelo). D'Angelo is beautiful as the prime and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her education and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus, and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just as rich as Jeannie, the girl who is pregnant, but still as cute and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud, the other two members of the group, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud's fiance, has a wonderful voice. <br /> <br /> The only problem I have with this movie, however, is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are almost never shown together, and when they are, they fight (remember the skinny dipping station?). Their relationships seem to be very poor and by the end of the movie we have to believe they are in love, just at the few meetings they had. I also see many people writing reviews here are upset about the PG rating this movie has. I personally will increase the score to a PG-13, just because there are drugs ... but remember in 1979, PG-13 didn't exist. I don't think the nudity is bad, it is in no way sexual (in fact there is no sex in this movie), and it is just the childlike innocence that the group maintains. In most European countries, nudity is not considered bad, and I do not see why it is here in the US. Anyway, I give this movie a high rating, and I'm glad it was made again, because in the bad "politically correct" world today they wouldn't even think about making it, and even if they did done would be a very "watered-down" version, and I'm sure you won't get the full effect. <br /> <br /> Finally, this is a very underrated movie that is definitely worth checking out.
