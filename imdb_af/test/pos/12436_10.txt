This film was thirteen years before I was born, but I still think it's the whitest, dottiest and most harmless piece of fun ever made. It simply cannot be mistaken for shooting excellent British character characters that it boasts. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Alastair Sim-peerless; Margaret Rutherford-dito, the wonderful innocent Gossage, played perfectly by the imperial Joyce Grenfell. Caddish Victor Hyde-Brown (a Guy Middleton special) and the rest of the staff sum up the post-war middle-class England to a tea. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the humor is obvious, but it is such a special "Ealing" variety and is never offensive. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie more times than I care to remember and still a drain at the tribulation every time. The storms of the dormitories occupied by the girls' school, the wonderfully planned but eventually doomed twin tours of the school and the chaotic end that includes the arrival of a third school to add to the anarchy, are invaluable. <br /> <br /> It's an old clich√© I know, but they really don't make them anymore. How I wish they had. If you haven't seen it, please do not be disappointed.
