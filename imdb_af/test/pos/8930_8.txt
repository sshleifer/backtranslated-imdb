REALLY as written and directed by Richard Bell, a few too many stories can tell at the same time for a 102 minute movie to be completely successful, but there is such a good sense of dedication on the part of all role players what the viewer ends wants to work the movie - and so does it. Yes, aspects could have been fine if the producers had more money to spend on the final cut, but as a small independent film from Canada, it is a gentle, softly humorous, very pleasant story about vulnerability and communication and commitment. It works on many levels. <br /> <br /> In a very well-choreographed opening, our voyeurs are at a family dinner where something goes wrong, leading to a father and two boys who take off in a car and have an accident which one of the boys was killed. With an introduction like this, the vote for the surviving 18-year-old Pip boy (Paul Anthony - too old for credibility as a teenager) is set to leave his family and stay on the street. He meets Clark (Clarence Sponagle), a male prostitute who gives Pip food and shelter, Jenny (the very fine Carly Pope), who rescues him from a surprise by her fellow Derek (Ryan McDonell) and is entangled with Pip and Father Chris (Alan Cumming) in a fine producing sympathetic role as a priest. It is Pip's 18th birthday and his father (Serge Houde) discourages Pip from giving him a gift from his late grandfather with instructions. The gift must be opened on Pip's 18th birthday. <br /> <br /> Pip drinks too much and full of wrath, pledges the tire machine but keeps the tire and starts listening to the words of his grandfather Jason (voted by Ian McKellen) who is his own 18th birthday in WWII in France tells where he (now very sensitive actor Brendan Fletcher) has an experience with a wounded doctor named Macauley (Mark Hildreth, also wonderful) and reflects on his one night marriage to a cabaret singer Hannah (Thea Gill of Queer as Folk 'fame and a good singer and actress here) for something to live during the war: Jason is helping Macauley while he is dying, with a beautiful redemption field for two men at the end. The parallels of Pip and Grandpa Jason vary each time Pip listens to the band and leads Pip to eventually change his view of life and love. Subplots include Clark's isolated existence as a hustler that is changed by Jeff (David Beazely - in a surprisingly fine movie debut) who just wants to love; through an unexpected pregnancy between Jenny and Pip; By trusting Father Chris installs in a good shepherd's way in both Pip and Clark: and by a blow to the car accident where Pip could save his brother Daniel (Paul Dzenkiw) from an abusive act in his father's hand, before The accident, but he did not. He opened his deep guilt and consequent wrong rage, reflected by his grandfather's tire work. Each of these subplots at the end draws together and creates a closure for each of the persons involved. <br /> <br /> There are aspects of this movie that look like great budget production: the musical score by Bramwell Tovey is performed by the Vancouver Symphony members, the cinematography by Kevin Van Niekerk is pleasantly atmospheric and the general The performance of the Canadian film is very good. Although Paul Anthony handles his role well, the story will look much better when a very young teenager is starring. Richard Bell, with just another movie 'Two Brothers' on his CV, promises a young talent to watch. Despite the shortcomings, EIGHTEEN is a valuable film and deserves attention. Grady Harp
