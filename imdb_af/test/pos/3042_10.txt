I watched this movie on TV in the United Kingdom about 25 years ago and this has been my resonance since. My interest was recently revived by visiting Hilton Head - the next island of "Yamacraw" (Daufuskie actually), and reading Pat Conroy's excellent "The Water is Wide". With the benefit of knowledge, I reconsidered Conrack and considered it a masterpiece. Jon Voight captures the spirit of Conroy and the atmosphere of the film brings the book with some accuracy to life - a Hollywood rarity. <br /> <br /> Three things are still stopping me from this story: 1. The issues of educating the poor and not being included and staying the same remain the same. 2. Education is about reading and writing. 3. These kids were my peers, I was 6 in 1969 when Pat Conroy spent his year at Daufuskie. <br /> <br /> Why hasn't it been done on DVD yet?
