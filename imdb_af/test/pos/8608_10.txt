The opening of Imamura's masterpiece merely avoids sensationalism in portraying the ominous events of August 6, 1945, in which 90% of Hiroshima and tens of thousands of lives were destroyed in an instant. Instead, Imamura emphasizes the unparalleled peculiarity of the disaster, highlighting such spectacular images as the devilish mushroom cloud quietly in the distance and the black rain splashing a beautiful young woman's face. The rest of the film traces the conclusions of the latter incident, which killed the atomic holocaust and its aftermath (more than 100,000 people with radiation poisoning) to the understandable level of the condition of Yasuko (Yoshiko Tanaka) and her small "community bound by the bomb. "<br /> <br /> Survivors strive for normal and continuity, especially by finding a suitable marriage for Yasuko, but the imminent possibility of radiation disease shadows every aspect of their lives. Yasuko's potential suitors, of course, shy away from a young woman, no matter how attractive, which may suddenly become ill and die. True love, when it finally appears, does it unexpectedly and ambiguously. We wonder if love over class lines is more of a sign of Yasuko's status as "damaged goods" or of common humanity, which is thrown into difficult circumstances, which surpasses class divisions. <br /> <br /> The movie's classic-styled style enhances the impact, savings, eloquent indoor shots that show us that Imamura started his career as assistant to the great Ozu. Imamura's mastery is evident, for example, in the paired screens of Yasuko bath, the first to emphasize her beautiful back and legs, the second to her hair falling out. The shots are almost like books on the story's trajectory, which distills his tragic being. The film's documentary style realism is being violated several times for expressive purposes, perhaps in a scene that denies the turbulent interior of a watched veteran. Both the score of the well-known avant-garde composer Toru Takemitsu and the beautiful black-and-white photography greatly contribute to the film's breeding atmosphere. When Yasuko's uncle (Kazuo Kitamura), the film's laconic narrator, looks at the open sky for a rainbow as a sign of hope and rebirth in the last shot, the black and white images suddenly become so terrible that it's almost unbearable. Few movies from Japan (or any other place for the case) can be compared to the large, humanistic Japanese masterpieces of the 1950s. This movie is one of them. When I first looked at it for the first time, I struggled, unable to move for at least five minutes, overwhelmed as I was through the emotions, should inspire a great tragedy: terror and pity.
