I went into this movie that expects a treasure trove, and while the Mute Witness influences the style of movie-making, it's much more than just your average shovel. There are a number of excitement that focus on a particular disability. Blindness is more common (Blind Terror, Wait Until Dark, Cat o'Nine Tails to name a handful), but the implications of a dumb lead in a lot like this is well depicted and actually integral to the plot because the The fact that the main character cannot speak often is why she finds herself in dangerous situations that would be easy for anyone else to come out of. Our mute witness is Billy Hughes, a makeup artist who works on a horror movie production at a studio in Moscow. She found her one hour at night, and after trying to get her sister to help, she bumped into what was initially an illegal sex spot, but soon turned out to be a sneak peek! She tries to convince the authorities of what she has seen, but finds that no one believes her story. <br /> <br /> Recently, Hostel made the news to show snuff films in a foreign country, but this movie did it. First and foremost a better job. It may not be as dirty as Eli Roth's opus, but the gore is more effective. And since director Anthony Waller (who has appointed one of my favorite modern thrillers with "The Guilty"), implements a good sense of humor in the proceedings. , Stupid Witness are both greedy and fun to watch. The director certainly has a talent to make spectacular excitement equipment, as this one never stops. The plot is being tackled quickly, and Waller is constantly announcing plots that give a great helping hand to the overall entertainment value of the movie. The play is not bad for a B-movie, with young performers Marina Zudina, Fay Ripley and Evan Richards performing well. The atmosphere is keen, and the Russian sites are unfriendly, helping the film to maintain a precocious atmosphere. Overall, Mute Witness is a much better movie than you would expect it to be. The plot is flowing well, and the atmosphere and tension are on the point.
