Horses on Mars is an engaging animated short that sometimes looks at the evolutionary process of the eyes of those who have still evolved. The story is personal and sometimes sentimental and is supported by strong digital animation and narration involving the viewer in this science fiction story. I was fortunate to see this short widescreen format at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival, and assume that when it is transferred to the small screen, it will lose its ability to draw the reader into the less thoughtful story and beautiful images not.
