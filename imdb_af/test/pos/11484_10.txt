I watched this movie at least ten times. I do not agree with the previous comments. It's a tongue in the cheek and some of the acting is meant to be stylized. Men like Paul Cowley are few and far between, women like Linda, unfortunately a dime a dozen. The sad thing here is that although similar relationships like this rarely lead to murder and frame ups, it's a well-known scenario. Boy adores girl, girl does not know he exists, they grow up, man sees woman, he fantasizes from time to time and saves her. Bottom line, she never loved him - he met at the right time and she used him. Thomas is excellent as the nerdy, but enough Paul. His portrayal is sensitive and touching. Madsen is perfect as the femme-fatal. What really was me was the final scene. Paul said he eventually cried, but not for Linda, his wife, but for the unknown girl he looked from a distance many years ago and longed for .. and loved. And I love the close-up of Thomas at the end.
