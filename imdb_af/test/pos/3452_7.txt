This movie prevalizes the Australian movie Road Warrior and Priscilla of the Desert, and its influence on them is clear: in dialogue, places, photography, direction and political philosophy. Photography is especially confident. The direction is stylish and largely done well. If you liked the early Australian movies by Bruce Beresford, Peter Weir and George Miller will love you "Oz". This direction also reminds this reviewer of Edgar Wright's contemporary work. This agreement indicates that "Oz" was well ahead of his time. The critics of 1967 hated it and the public stayed away - 1960s Australia, like the US of 1940, was somehow the kind of place where correspondence was important, while this movie was very different from what the viewers would have expected, especially after reading the promotional posters. This movie is likely to claim more contemporary audiences: it is rather uncomfortable and self-conscious, but in a contemporary European way rather than an Australian way of the 1960s. Joy Dunstan (who later appeared in the Australian TV series Prisoner) plays her role with less raw passion than her contemporary Jacki Weaver might have done, but Dunstan's character in this movie carries some of the rather whimsical power of Australian women most famous are represented. by Kylie Minogue Charlene Mitchell plays in the Australian TV series Neighbors and further develops into later roles in her career. Men will also enjoy this movie, which offers different male issues differently than most other sixty-sixty films from the US or even Australia. In particular, Bruce Spence (who later plays Tion Medon in Star Wars III, the Trainman in the 'Matrix' movies and the bright pilot in the 'Road Warrior' and 'Thunderdome' films) plays a central and sustained Role that firmly supports the rest of the cast. This movie is worth seeing for Bruce Spence's performance alone. 7/10 for some minor continuity problems.
