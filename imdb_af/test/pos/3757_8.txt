I absolutely love this movie and have seen it many times. I signed it in about 1987 when it was shown on Channel Four, but my band is now badly worn and I want a new copy of it. I e-mailed Film Four to ask them to show it again as it was never available. on video and as far as I know, it has not been repeated since the 80's. I had no answer and it has not been repeated. The performances are excellent. The movie has everything. It's funny, sad, disturbing, exciting and takes you back to school. It is extremely well played and keeps you from start to finish. The scene in the shower room is particularly terrible. I also can't hear the song Badge at Cream and don't think about this movie. This movie deserves to be seen by a much larger audience as it is excellent. Channel Four shows or unlocks on Video or DVD.
