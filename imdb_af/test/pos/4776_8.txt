Created in 1928, and originally named Mortimer before Walt Disney changed its name (because his wife convinced him), Mickey Mouse became the staple of the Disney brand. I always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to play Mickey. It's actually his third, but it doesn't matter. For a six-minute animated short, it's nice. The story sees Mickey driving a steamboat until Captain Pete gets out of the bridge, stops to pick up cargo, and Minnie Mouse misses the boat. When she was lifted, she dropped her music sheets and a goat eats them, Mickey helps her make her tail and play the song and become other animals to become percussion. Pete comes together to stop him, and peels Mickey's potatoes. Mickey Mouse was number 53 on the 100 largest pop culture icons, and he was number 31 on the 100 biggest cartoons. Very good!
