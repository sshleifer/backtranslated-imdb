It's a great example of many Hollywood movies that are very thoughtful, moving and not without a sense of humor, Kevin McKidd and Paula Sage are wonderful. <br /> <br /> I actually watched it on late-night TV and I can see why I missed it in the cinema. It's not the kind of movie that shows the screens "mega" festival nowadays. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for the DVD. Not for those who prefer, the current trend for special effects and no story. If you like the best-selling book "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time", you'll enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is next to the best of Scottish movies, such as "Small Faces" and "Trainspotting". All movies in which Kevin McKidd also dies. <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
