I didn't expect much when I rented this movie, as many independent films have been overestimated now (well, Hollywood movies too), but this movie was fantastic, very good, it's too bad. reach audience, because it's just fantastic. I really like Alice's determination, it really makes me a gift to my life, and I see how privileged I just have an education. But all this, except the budget, is an excellent movie and everyone should see it, they will love it and definitely learn something about it. I don't have to be roger ebert to know it's one of the best movies I've seen all year, and definitely one of the truthful ones.
