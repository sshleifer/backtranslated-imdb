The golden door (NUOVOMONDO) is the best movie of the year to date for this viewer. It is a masterpiece of concept, writing, directing, acting and cinematography. Most importantly, this radiantly beautiful film is an essential reflective mirror for us to view the history of immigration of 'aliens' to America at a time when the word 'boundaries' is a political cycle. Author / director Emanuele Crialese not only gave us a deep moving story, but he also provided a point of contact for viewers to visit the history of each of our origins. With the exception of the Native Americans, we all came to America as a foreigner. a few times in our history, and it is humiliating to keep this film in mind. <br /> <br /> The film opens in centuries Sicily as shabby widower Salvatore Mancuso (Vincenzo Amato) and his brother Angelo (Francesco Casisa) climb a rocky hill to set their signs on the cross to ask if they must continue to struggle on the island or go to America, the land of dreams. Mancuso's deaf dumb son Pietro (Filippo Pucillo) walks to the top of the hill with postcards he found with images of America (money grows on trees, vegetables and vegetables bigger than humans etc.) And Salvatore accepts it as the sign that he must move his family to America. After convincing his surviving mother Fortunata (Aurora Quattrocchi) and his sisters Rita (Federica De Cola) and Rosa (Isabella Ragonese) to sell his journey, he sold his only possessions (two donkeys, goats and rabbits) and the man with the boat arranges their journey, gives the family shoes, appropriate clothing, and instructions to dress an ocean liner as third-class passengers. As the Mancuso family puts on board, they are asked for a photo, and as they sit behind a painted set, an English woman Lucy / Luce (Charlotte Gainsbourg) walks in the picture as if she were part of this farmer's family. Lucy can't go to America with the Mancuso family without the male accompaniment. <br /> <br /> The journey begins and Luce identifies her with the Mancuso family, ending her safe passage by setting her up for Salvatore to get married with ease. not for love when they arrive in America. Through a violent storm and poor living conditions, many third-class passengers survived, joined, and eventually settled on Ellis Island, believing their American dream was fulfilled. But everyone needs to pass strict physical tests, debriefing, and even intelligence testing to determine if they can enter America. The officials let them know that America doesn't want to enter genetically inferior people into the new world! Every woman must be chosen by a man to marry on Ellis Island before being allowed to enter. The way the Mancuso family remains united to a somewhat surprising end is the closure of the story. <br /> <br /> Few of us understand the strict rules and harsh treatment that immigrants face (or at least confronted with in the turn of the century) on Ellis Island, and if we do, we prefer to suppress that information. THE GOLDEN DOOR presents the case for immigrants' struggles in a way that not only touches our hearts but also challenges our acceptance of the current immigration laws. But aside all political issues, the GOLDEN DOOR is first and foremost a film of immense beauty, beautiful photography, deep sense of performances by a great role, and a very sensitive written and directed story. It's a movie that deserves wide distribution, a movie that must be for everyone. Highly recommended. Grady Harp
