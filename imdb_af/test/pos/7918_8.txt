It is important to realize that Eisenstein was a dedicated Marxist filmmaker who could achieve some very specific and specific theories about which movie, and how. <br /> <br /> It's simply nothing to compare Alexander Nevsky negatively with something a similar period in the US; This film comes from the oldest film school in the world, from another continent, from a completely different approach to the theater. <br /> <br /> To appreciate this movie a bit more, try to find out about Pudovkin's and Kuleshov's theories of montage, for example, or read the Wikipedia entry on Marxist Film Theory. If you really feel brave, you can even explore the triadic forms of Hegelic dialectics. <br /> <br /> It follows that if you watch this movie without any understanding of Eisenstein's ideas and ideals, you probably won't get it. In Alexander Nevsky, the main characters do not play themselves, they are distillation of their nation's character. Nevsky and his generals are deliberately shown to be larger than life because they represent stylized, heroic aspects of the entire Russian people. <br /> <br /> The acting is not wood, it is meant to be slightly manicured. It represents a completely different school from the more naturalistic, narrative style that Hollywood quickly accepts. Eisenstein's films are specially designed * not * to be realistic. If something looks anything "obvious", or lighting or language or a pose hit by an actor, it is supposed to be so. Eisenstein was one of the early advocates of film as an art form, not just as entertainment. <br /> <br /> If the editing sometimes consists of a clash of images, it is the idea. Shots are meant to contrast with each other. Eisenstein's films contain elements of a political / philosophical argument, namely Marxist dialectics. <br /> <br /> So come back, shout Hurray for Russia and her folk heroes, boo the cowardly nobles and the Teuton invaders, and enjoy the difference.
