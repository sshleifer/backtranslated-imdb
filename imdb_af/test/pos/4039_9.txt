I really enjoyed this movie. I'm not usually one for fairy tales or believe stories, but this movie caught my attention. <br /> <br /> For the first time I saw this movie on the British channel Hallmark ... which usually shows some sticky movies ... but then snow queen came together ... and I loved it! I really admire Bridget Fonda in this movie ... she plays the snow queen brilliantly and glamorously. <br /> <br /> I won't explain what the story is about, as other people have already done so, so there's no point repeat. <br /> <br /> I just want to suggest that if you want to see a fun fairy tale ... get this movie ... but if you want to buy it and you live in the UK, you might find it difficult have time. I bought it from South Korea brand new (English edition of course).
