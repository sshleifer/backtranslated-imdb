I bought the entire season from Surface. watch it in 3 days! I was so captured by the plot, theories and basically all about this show. The actor who plays Miles is wonderful. Mile's sister, mother and father acted like real family family. You can couple on so many levels that it's fascinating. <br /> <br /> I find animals so wonderful, you can almost call them if a parent is a child. It would be something if a creature of this sort of nature really exists. <br /> <br /> It's sad, the surface doesn't have a second season or at least four more shows. I have so many questions to be answered and hopefully they might be creating more or maybe a book. <br /> <br /> Love the show. For those who haven't looked at Surface, if you want to keep sci-fi, you should see it !!!!!!!!!!!!!
