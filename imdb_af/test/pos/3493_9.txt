The Ali G show was really amazing - he was so stupid wannabe rapper, but no one he questioned noticed that he was just pretending. Sasha Cohen is actually a very intelligent guy, who pretends to be stupid so he can really get honest answers from people. And it's very funny. So I didn't expect the movie to be good because it was all done - no real people or interviews. The basic point of all performances was thus lost. But I was wrong. I laughed all the time, it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Sure, it was stupid, but who cares if you can't turn on a car battery, as someone said? It was not supposed to be a realistic documentary. And it's not like the show, it's completely different, but that doesn't mean it's bad. When I was done, I was completely impressed, but once I got through, I realized that it wasn't that special anyway. But it still has another nine - at least for what it is supposed to be.
