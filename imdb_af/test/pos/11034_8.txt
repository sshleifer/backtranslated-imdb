I saw this movie alone when I was an early teenager in my home town in India, at a time when the only thing that impressed me about the girls was Tigers. I came home after watching it, with a glazed look in my eye, which wanted to be in the movie that befriended the Tigers. What a movie and what a moment it was! The theater I saw in it didn't exist and made way for a shopping mall. I don't know how I want to feel so many years now and don't want to remind you of childhood by finding this movie available on DVD or something similar and no longer finding it interesting. From previous experience, I learned that childhood remembrance is often ignored when traveling on remote highways, and sometimes trying to rediscover their unaffected performance through movies, just to get his innocent innocence completely sweet and no longer welcome no. And I don't want to experience the experiences of a reminder of this movie in the wind. I don't have children, so I'm probably selfish to leave this movie in a sepia-tinted area of ​​my brain, and I don't want it on DVD. But if you are at an early age and want to remember memories of an engaging childhood in later years, try to watch this movie (if ever you can). It will really be worth it.
