**** SPOILERS THROUGHOUT **** This is a very strange movie - especially for his time - in every way. For six years, American movies have shown American soldiers as everyone's son, brother and father. <br /> <br /> In movies like the best years of our lives and up to the end, our hearts are drawn to the troubles that the lovely returning soldiers have in adjusting to peace and their families. But in the same year, this movie shows soldiers as a mix of people who are worse than the viewer - one message from this movie - "include your daughters." <br /> <br /> Even the good soldiers - with plenty of time on their hands - are always gambling, getting drunk, and totally indifferent to see if they have even more women. And their reaction to the police investigating a murder is to merge against them. <br /> <br /> Mitchum, the most sympathetic soldier, says things like, "I don't know if my wife wants to do it now after the war, didn't see her in two years. It doesn't really matter to me. Maybe we'll do it, maybe. "<br /> <br /> Another soldier is shown to be unusually sensitive because he wants to see his wife away after years. <br /> <br /> Later, when this soldier at the police station says he spent the night at a whore's house - not knowing that his wife was just sitting behind him, his wife didn't seem to don't be. In fact, she is - I think it's "Hey, soldiers will be soldiers." <br /> <br /> The police detective played by Robert Young, trying to crack a murder case, says convincingly and with endless fatigue over someone's account of their actions in that particular night, <br /> < br /> "I care? No, I really don't care anymore. I've been doing it for too long, I guess." <br /> <br /> A man appears at the whore's apartment. He says, "I'm just a man like you, interested in" the whore. Then he says, "No, it's a lie, I'm her husband. I'd like to be in the army, I was dismissed before." T <br /> <br /> He says, "No, it's a lie, why do I want to be a soldier?" He goes through another series of lies when the police ask him who he is. Until the end of the movie we have no idea who he is or why he is there! He is one of the strangest characters in the history of movies! <br /> <br /> A man is standing with his girlfriend at a bar that is talking to four soldiers, when a lot of soldiers hit a drink on his girlfriend. She leaves to change her dress - and is ready to wear another, no problem. Yet the man does not leave with his girlfriend - who just disappears - but follows one of the soldiers when he goes to another area of ​​the bar! The man then extrapolates from the minimal information he learned from the soldier - to largely philosophize on the problems of returning soldiers - and immediately the soldier's house, because he is drunk and feels ill. These are strange things. <br /> <br /> Similarly, a dance hall girl gets annoyed by the sentimental soldier who wants to take her out for a real dance - and dinner. Yet she danced with him - and immediately gave him the key to her home! <br /> <br /> In the late 1940s, were people always encouraging soldiers to come to their homes after just meeting them? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan murdered his host, a stranger, when he was furious that the Jewish host was trying to get the slow drunken Ryan out of his house. The reason for the murder? "No Jew tells me how to drink". "How to drink?" Huh? What does it mean? <br /> <br /> This movie is always unbeatable, with the deliberate so - the soldiers maintain consistently with complete violation of the law, and all characters are as cold and hard as any movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> And yet the movie is quite gripping! You just have no idea how these people will act - or what new bizarre character will come up - without anyone thinking that the person's actions are at least strange - eg. The woman's behavior. <br /> <br /> The acting is about the best I've ever seen - from Robert Young, Robert Ryan, Gloria Grahame (who earned an Oscar nomination), Paul Kelly and other actors I've never heard of do not have. <br /> <br /> I "I never heard of this movie - and it is a complete pleasure that I have discovered one I want to see again and again. It's really strange, but impossible to look away, because you have no idea what these creatures will do.
