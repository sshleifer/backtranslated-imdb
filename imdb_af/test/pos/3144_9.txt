I saw the same movie when I saw 6 other shorts. This one was leaps ahead of the other in terms of the quality of acting, directing, filming and originality of story. It comes with a professionalism that often lacks short films. <br /> <br /> This is a great short film for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Great performances. The 2 actresses are immediately compelling and credible. Their chemistry is palpable; The depth of their relationship is transmitted, even though the film is 10 minutes long. The acting and direction are very powerful. <br /> <br /> 2. Beautifully shot. The lighting, framework and general filming are striking. The 35mm film sets this movie apart from other shorts. And what makes a difference. The filming is worthy of this film stock. <br /> <br /> 3. Strong story. Short films often try too little or too much with time. Or they are trying to tell a predictable story. It is a good balance to tell you an interesting story, without pulling it out for too long or leaving you dissatisfied. You wonder what will happen next while you feel that you have seen something. <br /> <br /> Nice count too. Compliments without winning. <br /> <br /> If you can find it at a festival, try to see it.
