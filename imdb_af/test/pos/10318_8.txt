A three Stooges short, this one with Shemp. Of all those who Shemp I have seen, it's my favorite performance by him in a Stooges short. The basic plot is that Shemp must marry by 6:00 that night if he is going to inherit half a million dollars, a rich uncle left him in his will. So Shemp sets out to get himself a bride, but finds it a tougher path than expected, that's until they learn about his inheritance money. Best pieces here include Shemp shear, Shemp and Moe in a telephone box and Larry on piano as accompaniment to Shemp's voice training. Also the order where Shemp as Cousin Basil and his outcome are wrong is hilarious.
