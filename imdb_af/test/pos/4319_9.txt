"Live Together, The Alone" is divided into three main story lines, and each of them alone would have been enough for a major episode. So when you all sit together, you have a good ^ 3 episode. It was a daring move to give the start of a season final to a character (Desmond) who first appeared in 3 episodes, but it worked: his background is absolutely fascinating to watch, both insightful about the past the island and the Swan station itself and honestly move. Desmond and Penny are closely connected to each other, even if they are on the opposite side of the world, and both characters are beautifully behaved (it's not hard to cry when Desmond Penny's letter reads). The action inside the hatch is the tip of your seat, as Locke is determined that the button is not pressed again, convinced that it is just a psychological experiment. Desmond gradually realized the consequences of this decision. Eko is locked outside and desperately trying to come back. The melting of the watch and Locke's "I was wrong" are memorable moments. The out-of-action caught Jack, Kate, Sawyer and Hurley by the Other because of Michael's betrayal (after making a confusing discovery with the Pearl) and Henry Gale's game-changing return than the other's leader. Even the least important plot line, Sayid, Jin and Sun sailing to the beach where the other is allegedly camping, contains one of the greatest mythological mysteries of the show, the giant statue that is almost completely missing, except for a foot with four toes. In short: emotion + history + mythology + adventure + tension + the threat of extinction + a ray of hope = a classic lost episode. *** 1/2 out of 4.
