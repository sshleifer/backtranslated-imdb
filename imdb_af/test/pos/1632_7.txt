I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago and I can honestly say that this is one of the few books I could not put down while reading. <br /> <br /> However, the movie was pretty much what I expected, lots of action, with a bit of a puzzle story. Tom Hanks, in my opinion, plays a much better role, from Professor Langdon than in the Da Vinci code. <br /> <br /> You don't have to worry about it being as bad as the Da Vinci code, that's all it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more tension, and less of the unnecessary controversy. If you haven't read the book, you'll still find it very interesting. And when you have read the book, we can say you can drop a little because I have discovered many scenes that I look forward to. <br /> <br /> Overall, Beautifully Impressive Movie for any everyday movie-goer. But, maybe not something special for Dan Brown fans.
