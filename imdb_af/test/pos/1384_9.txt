Every time you bump into a movie that surprises you and that's one of them. On the surprise scale it will share a hot tub with Jessica Alba, while a band consisting of Elvis, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Phil Lynott and Keith Moon play music for the night. The reason why this film will surprise you is that it was for the scant budget (Â£ 8,000) and that it was done by a lot of friends who just tried to express it. They made something very smooth and easily look 100 times more than their budget. <br /> <br /> The plot is simply a crew of mercenaries carrying a dangerous prisoner through space, being attacked and forced to collide on a nearby, deserted planet. After some checks, not only does the planet exist according to astronomical charts, but they are not just as it looks and something very unfriendly they add one by one. It sounds like many standard Sci-Fi price elements from Aliens. Predator and Pitch Black, but it takes all these things and makes them something fresh and original. <br /> <br /> The location shooting in this is fantastic, and use Balmeddie Beach in Aberdeen to the maximum and you really feel that you are one of an alien world. The seemingly never-ending sand dunes and smart lighting effects give it a very dark feeling, you really think the crew is stranded in a strange world. The action sequences are also fantastic. The initial attack on the truck is an excellent representation of the special effects that can be achieved on a budget and firefighting as well as the beautiful final. <br /> <br /> As far as the team of mercenaries is concerned, the film becomes excellent. For a low budget independent film, the decisions made here through local media outlets have been made and they seem to have chosen possible stars for the future. Local builder Mike Mitchell while not playing a natural actor in his role as the Arnie-Esq leader of the mercenaries. From the rest of the film, there are two performances, Patrick Wright, second in command McNeal and Scott Ironside as Rough and Ready Engineer Vince. Both have some of the best rules in the movie and Scott spits a good bit of humor into the movie with his performance. Patrick gives a well-rounded performance as cool as ice second in command. <br /> <br /> Director Mark Stirton can be very proud of what he has achieved and show that Scottish theater should not be "Kilts and Ceilidhs" or "Slums and drugs" Scottish movies can be fresh, resourceful and mostly lots of goddamn fun. This film is Scottish (with a North East flavor) at its core and commends the actors and directors to preserve the accent, adding the charm of the piece. Although the budget constraints from time to time show (the only mistake I could find) that can be expected. This movie, its cast and crew deserve all the success they get and even more. For one wish, Mark and his crew, every success and theirs, is a career to keep a close eye on. <br /> <br /> Rating - 9/10 The first Scottish sci-fi is fat, fresh and resourceful, a real triumph. <br /> <br /> Movie reviews, news and opinion like no other plus kick ass fortnightly podcasts. <br /> <br /> www.fightrunner.co.uk <br /> <br />contact@fightrunner.co.uk
