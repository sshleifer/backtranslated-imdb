I can be a good old boy from Virginia in the Confederate States, but this man does it for me. That mustache rolled me up. I remember when I first saw a video of her. The girl he beat was wonderful. The depth of his acting when cutting into his weathered fa√ßade was a new level of masculinity. It reminds me of the granite sculptures of our Mt. Rushmore. If I could ask him one question, would it be: "If you were a hot dog, would you eat yourself?" Will Orhan do a reunion tour? Take note of the great ones such as Gordon Lightfoot, true music of the heart never disappears. Vive La John Denver. Gracias my friend, O.F.F.L. (Orhan Fan For Life)
