I have to admit that I had low expectations for this movie. But I was surprised to find it entertaining, interesting and funny. It is an entertaining thriller and not so much a horror movie. There were moments that raised my hair! Even better were the highly amusing, sometimes hysterical, comic moments in the film (you will know who I am talking to). There are also some great special effects (and the humor and special effects are not necessarily separate). <br /> <br /> The play is generally very good - better than a typical low budget horror movie. The lead (especially Jackie) and many of the smaller, supporting roles (such as the lawyer, the couple staying next door, the pizza man) were well behaved. If they weren't, the movie would not have kept my interest and I would have lost my faith in the story. It's a great, interesting low budget thriller and definitely worth the rent!
