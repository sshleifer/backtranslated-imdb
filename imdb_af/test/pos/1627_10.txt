Was excited at the opening to hear part of "Chevaliers De Sangreal" but wanted more, so I bought, Hans Zimmer said. Possibly the most inspiring and beautiful 4 minute music ever written! This movie is an exciting thriller masterpiece even without the religious considerations. You can tour the Vatican and parts of Rome with excellent cinematography. The opening at CERN where the "Godpartikel" or greatest quantity of antimatter with STUNNING footage is created, is an immediate idea that predicts the excellence of this movie. Who doesn't love Hanks? The storyline and twist in this movie are just wonderful and well worked out to the incredibly twisted climax. This film indicates a satisfactory compromise between Science and Religion, although many closed heads will continue on both sides. "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind." A.Einstein
