Bud Abbott and Lou Costello have always had a good result among children, but in their careers I think you can say that they have just made one movie for children. Jack and the Beanstalk were that one movie. <br /> <br /> It was part of a two photo-independent transaction by Warner Brothers, the second movie being Abbott and Costello Meet Captain Kidd. These were the only two films that made the boys color. <br /> <br /> The two of them, as usual, out of work, take a job for a very cheerful and turbulent young David Stollery as a babysitter. Although it starts with Costello who wants to read the child, Jack and the Beanstalk, as a bedtime story, the young boy blows it to Costello. Lou falls asleep and in his dreams he fantasizes that he is indeed Jack the Giant Killer. <br /> <br /> Buddy Baer threatened the boys in Africa. Screams play the giant and he has a huge size Dorothy Ford as his housekeeper. Dorothy was a big girl, 6'2 ", and you can imagine she's hard to throw, except when her height is used as a joke. One of the only players ever to look down at her was John Wayne in Three Godfathers at 6 "4" Henry Fonda and James Stewart in On Our Merry Way are barely above her, but again her height was part of a gag. <br /> <br /> Shaye Cogan and James Alexander was the princess and prince of the fantasy and they sang beautifully but could do nothing, it was William Farnum's last film, whose career dates back to the early silent days and even to the end of the last century He played Princess Shaye's father, the king. <br /> <br /> Some not terribly memorable music numbers came from Jack and the Beanstalk, except for the title song. 78 record of Bud and Lou singing the song and repeating the story, I was in my early single years, but have a life and snakes of them by those and their television series. <br /> <br /> Jack and the Beanstalk are still a great kid for the very young, although I would warn parents to warn their little eggs not to imitate young master Stollery.
