A wonderful family movie and a beautiful horse movie. 75 +% entertainment. Casey, Buddy, Kelly Marsh are very interesting and lovely characters. The horses are real beauty. <br /> <br /> Has the horse race as a backdrop to show how happiness is sometimes nothing, except some good minds. Show how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons. Show how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons. The very realistically depicted characters transform the unrealistic theme of the movie into something everyone can talk about. <br /> <br /> Andrew Rubin puts on a great performance as Buddy, the wise older brother. Something reminded me of Aidan Quinn (eyes, speech delivery, facial display). <br /> <br /> Casey falls in love with the character because of the seriousness. Sarah Blue is also portrayed nicely by Alexis Smith. Lloyd Bourdelle, the father, is played by Walter Matthau and he IS the character. <br /> <br /> Although there is room for improvement in the movie, it is a very enjoyable, enjoyable movie.
