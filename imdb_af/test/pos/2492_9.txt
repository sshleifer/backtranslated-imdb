My curiosity and patience to see this controversial movie, now released on DVD for the first time in the UK, is more than rewarding. Peter Watkins expressed himself in his audacity and technical skills. This pseudo-documentary is definitely ahead of his time and still terribly relevant and up to date. <br /> <br /> The film was inspired by the revolution of the late 1960s in the US, when the government increased its legal use of violence and oppression, while the anti-war movement is increasingly violent and radical. In order to deal with this, the overcrowding of prisons and special training on riot police units, the government has set up so-called criminal parks. Convicted "criminals", mostly activists, are given the "choice" to imprison years or years, or spend three days in one of these parks, where they either have their freedom or even an even longer prison sentence. However, the situation in the parks is beyond their worst expectations. It reminded me of a kind of realistic version of Battle Royale (2000). <br /> <br /> The structure of the film is extremely effective and reminiscent of parallels with the Cannibal Holocaust, made almost 10 years later. Both movies are built up and filmed in such a way that the viewer is challenged to think and feel that he is actually watching a documentary and is thus shocked, even though aware of the fact that: it is a movie. Both confront us with the inherently violent nature of mankind, but where the Cannibal Holocaust has nothing of a deeper meaning (above all, it is an exploitative movie in every sense of the word) and does not question critical conditions of the world up. , Punishment Park does just that. <br /> <br /> I am deeply impressed with Punishment Park and find it hard to believe how such a powerful and important movie could have been rejected and marginalized for so long. Perhaps it says enough about the truth of its content, about the way power structures operate in this world. I disagree with the criticism that Watkins polarizes and stereotypes, because the film portrays activists and guards of legitimate power structures that are actually polarized as they are here. If they were not, there would be no conflict and therefore no change in our societies. In fact, confrontations between these two groups often take stereotypical forms, whether you put it between activists and settlers in Latin America, Russia or New York City. If these groups were not polarized to these extremes, the activists would be part of the silent majorities who quietly complain, but at the same time live in the injustices of the world. <br /> <br /> As Peter Watkins tells us in The introduction to the DVD is the actors in Punishment Park for the most part amateurs. Most children were true activists from LA, most policemen were part of national forces and even some members of the tribunals are part of the social and political establishment of time. Not to introduce both groups that used to take place in the shootings of the plays in the improvised courtroom add to spontaneous and improvised feelings. Parallels are drawn with issues of the time, such as the suppression of Black Panther members (one of the black prisoners being equal to the convicted charismatic BP leader Bobby Seale) and the trial of the Chicago seven. <br /> <br /> I admire Watkins' striking and sincere involvement in injustice and his concern about human rights and the increasingly repressive measures taken by governments (today in the name of the War in Terror) for those who disagree and refuse to become brainwashed, silent. Penalty Park remains an extremely important film to be shown in schools and seen by everyone who shares these concerns. Perhaps the marginalization can eventually be made up.
