It's a movie about loneliness and how the distance? physical and emotional - people tend to support relationships. <br /> <br /> The narrative is simply to the point of banality: a young man Yusuf (Emin Toprak), from a rural village, arrives in Istanbul to keep up with his older and successful cousin Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir ); Yusuf wants to work in the big city. After trying for a few weeks to find work unsuccessfully, the pressure to live with Yusuf is too much for Mahmut. They dispute ?? nothing physical, just verbal. Eventually, Yusuf goes, leaving Mahmut alone. End of the story ... <br /> <br /> Apart from the fact that the performance of the two men as a family is one of the best on film. Many are said visually; Dialogue is used to bring disagreement, distrust, hostility and insecurity within and between the two men. <br /> <br /> There are many visual jewels in this movie. For example, while looking for work, young Yusuf, who needs a relationship, is trying in vain for the attention of several young women around the city. The appearance of his face, as he is muted every time, says it all. <br /> <br /> Or, with a cigarette, Yusuf opens the door to the balcony of Mahmut's apartment and lights up in the peaceful December air, leaving the door open Mahmut eventually arrives on his desk, walking to the door (all the glass) and the cousins ​​just look at each other because it looks too long for a while. Then Mahmut closes the door and leaves Yusuf in the cold. The metaphor is complete. <br /> <br /> Or, Mahmut, who cleaned up Yusuf, cautiously and with increasing anger; And all the time, Yusuf wastes his time to chase skirts instead of seriously looking for work, and does Mahmut's money spend on a cousin's toy? Yusuf is emotional, sloppy, impulsive and vulnerable. Mahmut is rational, logical, confident and demanding control freak: the right brain, left brain digotomy played beautifully by two actors who say more with a look, a gesture, a frown than any words can convey. /> <br /> But Mahmut is not quite emotional. He still loves his ex-wife who tells him she is with her husband to Canada. Mahmut influences a distant and confident friendship with his ex, and makes sure she is good to go. He wished her well. He says goodbye. He leaves the coffee shop where they speak. Later, as she calls to say a last goodbye to the airport, Mahmut goes there and secretly looks away while she is away. The face of the emotion on his face, as she disappears through a door, is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is an outstanding piece of work by the two main actors and director, Nuri Ceylan. Some may argue that the rate is too slow; But life goes slow for much of the time, especially for those who are alone. The camera work is also relatively simple: choose the scene, set the camera and lighting, and let the actors move across the scene, enter the scene and leave the scene while still keeping the camera still. There were some panning shots, some high angle shots, some rural scenes ?? but much of the film is shown as being on a stage with a fixed camera and a wide angle lens. In addition to TV and radio music in the story, there is no music soundtrack. And there is that very long silence, as the two men watch television and / or engage in a very limited conversation. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie on TV so I was thrilled to watch it on a few occasions, I watched television while watching TV. The silence in the movie is similar to the silence in my house (I was awake, all the others in bed); my chair and position matched Mahmut's while watching television. Totally awful, give me a sense of 'close' with him ?? And I think I was in a certain sense. <br /> <br /> I won't say anymore because I want you to enjoy the other scenes I didn't describe. It's not a movie for everyone. More than any movie I've seen, it just shows how much we die if we're all alone? just as we are alone when we die. Mahmut's face, as it fades into black in the final scene, will stay with me for a long time ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for serious movie buffs.
