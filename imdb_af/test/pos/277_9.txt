So actually and surreal, all in one. I remember like Tessa. Heck, I remember being Tessa. It was a beautiful vignette of a relationship that ended. I especially liked the protesters' tangent. It's nice to see the symbolism in a movie without slamming about it. If you get the chance to see it, take it. It's worth the 30 minutes.
