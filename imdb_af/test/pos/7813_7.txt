I found it to be an underrated, quiet-compelling Spaghetti Western (also known as DEATH OR ALIVE). Despite modest credentials (apart from the multi-purpose co-writer / producer Albert Band, the only remarkable crew member being composer Carlo Rustichelli), the movie is evident from the presence of its three American stars (newcomer Alex Cord is an ambiguous anti hero, while veterans Arthur Kennedy and Robert Ryan give a mythical quality to the proceedings, as well as the unusual plot (a crippled protagonist, an amnesty ruse covering a strategic cleansing of the village and eventually the law with the gunfighter against a horde of Mexican bandits). <br /> <br /> There are several tough action scenes at hand? The film is covered with a tremendous climax in which the tail trio is besieged in a burning cabin ?? plus some scandalous moments that are something of a Spaghetti Western brand: From the center of the street, Cord sees a hidden armed man at a window reflected in a whiskey bottle; A man who helps Cord escapes is repeatedly immersed in a pool of oil by the villains. Nicoletta Machiavelli also makes a good impression as a village girl with whom Cord enters; The supporting roll throw is then peppered with familiar (if largely anonymous) faces ?? all of them essentially genre games. <br /> <br /> I wasn't aware that the English version of the movie was cut on MGM / UA's R1 DVD: I was misled by the wrong run time listed on the back cover; the movie was just 99 minutes and not 118? apparently, Cord's character is killed in the longer Italian version!
