François Truffaut, Young Jerk of the "Cahiers du Cinema", chief bastion of the forthcoming New Wave, made a big show to hate this role and even accused him of dragging the French movie into mediocrity. Translation: Truffaut, who was sexually repressed, was already jealous of the way Carné was able to make a big success of a story that pushed all the right buttons of his audience and it was actually involved in something that was important to all bumps and temptation of sensuality. In other words, where the general public and many critics saw an acting sociological analysis in a beautiful film, Truffaut saw "Girls on the Loose". <br /> <br /> After all, Carné has everything that is seriously lacking in the New Wave: intelligence, refinement, humor, a great talent as a storyteller, a great talk for dialogue, brilliant technical glory, the capacity to do his actors. let's do what he wanted them to do, and a good dose of good taste. For comparison, Truffaut is a provincial drill with nothing to say. <br /> <br /> A 50-year-old tragic remake of "Pride and Prejudice", the French response to "Rebel Without a Cause", an updated version of "Children of Paradise", "Les Tricheurs" tells " a story of undivided Parisian youth who lost their way in an atmosphere of existentialism, sexual liberation and lack of respect for traditional and religious values. Some (young) critics regard Carné's as the moralizing slope of an "older person" while thinking what happened, on the contrary, is that Carné is gay and knows something or something of oppression, an unprecedented feeling sympathetic to the young iconoclasts in his story. In addition, it is a French film, but there is no mistake that the rebellion in question is essentially sexual, something that still has to be decoded in American films such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "The Wild One". <br /> <br /> Carné's young people are all extremely beautiful, graceful, elegant, spontaneous and intelligent. They are gods and goddesses. They drive the latest Vespas and the right cars. Cutting their suits, dresses and duffle coats was a highlight of the fashion of the last century. Their hairstyles are still plastered on the wall of your local hairdresser. Their body shape, which they reached and maintained effortlessly, is still the modern Western ideal. They listen to the best jazz musicians. They know how to move, how to be sexy and how to make love ?? even though the pill has not yet been invented. They know how to negotiate different social classes and cultures. Unfortunately, they are defined by and live by the code of the gang and their own heartless rituals that exclude sentimentality and make a sin of romantic love. The only thing wrong with them is that their elders don't talk to them and vice versa. The incidents depicted in this film have taken many tongues in France over the amorality and nihilism of youth while still making great public and critical success. <br /> <br /> This film is so attractive and beautiful, I suspect the older viewers who watched it wish they could be like the people featured in the movie, and a few young filmmakers or aspiring filmmakers like Truffaut developed a bad case of jaundice reflecting how they could never make a movie as sexy or imaginable. popular as this one, although they will be very good at eventually aiming for the nihilistic bits. On the other hand, due to a certain cliché aspect of the writing (amorous misunderstanding leading to a medical emergency), one could only withdraw in the terrible pious and puritanic mishmash Americans of the same basic writing as they the subject. <br /> <br /> Interestingly, the film was filmed one year earlier in the same basic places as the American musical "Funny Face". Where Hollywood saw the picturesque aspects of Rive Gauche and existentialism, Carné reaffirmed his tragic and ironic dimension. Watch this trailer on YouTube: 19ZkKeoNjPo
