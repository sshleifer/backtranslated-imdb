Dolemite is one of the best movies with a pimp as a hero, taking off the man and meanwhile joining with all the best women who need to supply the ghetto. Remember these women know karate and fine ladies. <br /> <br /> SPOILER - the final scene is pretty crazy, with Dolemite ripping the heart out of Willy Green. Make sure your copy is unclassified. <br /> <br /> There is also a film full of innovative brilliant characters such as the Hamburger Pimp, Honor, Mayor, Queen Bee and others. The clothes are big and the sets are full of 70's. There are a few dumps in the production, such as a tree that accidentally appears, but it adds to the charm and laughter. <br /> <br /> I recommend drinking a 6 pack before and during drinking. this movie, and keep blocks and the man far away.
