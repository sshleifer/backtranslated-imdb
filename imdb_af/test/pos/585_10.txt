"Why are there so many songs about rainbows, and what's on the other side?" Kermit presents this relatively simple dual query near the start of "The Muppet Movie" while singing his signature song, The Rainbow Connection. As time goes by, the question and the movie are getting deep. <br /> <br /> I will deviate from the review of this movie as a children's comedy, but rather look at it as a classic for every generation of love with serious ideas and a heart-warming message that warms every year get. <br /> <br /> As the milestones in my own life crawl on me, I hear more and more the voice-oriented tribes of that elementary diny, and realize that it can fit the soundtrack to someone's life, because we all dream. And that's what this movie is about. It's not just a bunch of dolls - it's a bunch of dolls that have the power to pursue their dreams, which is a good lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> And while the humor and joy of the movie always feels good, they are not a fair judge of the movie. Only "The Rainbow Connection" and the powerful emotions it will realize. And it all fits in: "Rainbow Connection" * is * the Muppet Movie, and vice versa. It's existentialism meets children's entertainment - there's no easier way to describe it.
