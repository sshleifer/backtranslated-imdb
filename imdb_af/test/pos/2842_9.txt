A question arises right away in this extremely idiosyncratic movie: Who are the crazy people? <br /> <br /> The answer becomes less clear when the movie is underway. <br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger loses the winnoot in her voice and while her voice is still high, she is incredibly effective as the shell-shocked Betty. In fact, she is so effective that I almost wanted her to be a little more crazy because her created reality was so credible. <br /> <br /> This is the first time Ms Zellweger has been called to carry a movie and she is more than equal to the task. <br /> <br /> Chris Rock ?? although so dirty mouth as usual? is pretty muffled like Wesley. He is able to sublime his manic energy and it sometimes shoots off whenever and when needed. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting notes: the first time you see Betty, she is almost exactly like Dorothy Gale dressed in the `Wizard of Oz '?? then later in the film she is compared to Dorothy when she says she had never been to Kansas. At one stage, Doris Day's best-known song, 'Que Sera Sera' on the sound track, and later Charlie (Morgan Freeman) describes her as a whole Doris Day thing. "<br /> <br /> This is a very strange movie with good performances by everyone, including the supporting role. <br /> <br /> It has a surprising end that, just as in contrast to this actually pretty predictable. <br /> <br /> For no other reason does this movie just look at the master of the human voice: Morgan Freeman.
