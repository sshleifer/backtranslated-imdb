Jamie Foxx is leading a brilliant role in this powerful journey through the life of the blind, emotionally upset, African American genius pop jazz, Ray Charles. Although the entire cast has performed wonderfully, Mr. Earn more Foxx than just an Oscar. If it were possible to nominate an actor in successive years, I would consider mr. Foxx to do. Foxx not only plays Charles, he creates him again. CJ Sanders and Sharon Warren also deserve special mention for their portrayal of Ray's mother (the inspiration of his life) and young Ray. The dramas of Charles's struggle with guilt, the death of his younger brother and mother, blindness, discrimination, addiction and success, become neat in the tapestries of his music. The music is beautiful, the writing is, as far as I can say, perfect, and the play is nothing short of legendary. <br /> <br /> The legal philosophy of the film guarantees discussion. Taylor Hackford - a director of whom I am generally ambivalent - had to choose what aspects of the greater than life and complex life story of Mr. Charles would tell his story honestly, dramatically and understandably. Although some disagree (apparently wanting a documentary instead of a dramatized biopsy), I believe he has chosen his themes admirably. A major part of the success of this film is the consistent focus on some persistent themes in Charles's life - his profound love and respect for his mother, his need to love and be accepted, his addiction and guilt complex, his musical genius, and his profound fear of responsibility for others. Charles is portrayed as a man who is struggling firmly against an army of personal demons. I learned more than I could think of one of the men I heard on my old turntable with my dad in his living room on Sunday night while soccer games were on the TV. And nothing was sugar cover in "Ray." The themes are conveyed with power and human dignity. These themes create a unifying drama that covers the length of his long and enlightened life. The power of these themes, the strong writing and directing, the music and the acting, make this one of the most fun and inspirational biographical movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Recommended for everyone.
