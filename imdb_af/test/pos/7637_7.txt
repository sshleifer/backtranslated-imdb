"Cherry" tells of a naive, unmarried virgin who decides to have a baby, but is not quite sure how to go about it. This easy, little sleeper is full of peculiar characters and tongue-in-cheek situational humor. Fresh, fun, breakthrough stuff, I really enjoy this movie ... for everything it is worth. Recommended for lovers of romantic comedy who want something different.
