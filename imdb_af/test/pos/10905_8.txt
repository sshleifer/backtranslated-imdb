This movie is extremely funny and enjoyable, with suitable, funny and experienced works. I find this movie enjoyable not only by the elements of humor but also the music in different scenes. Kevin Kline, a good comedian, did a great job of being funny in many parts of the movie, along with Tom Selleck, who is incredibly different from many of his other films. The humor in this movie is goofy which makes several exaggerated things in many scenes, especially the starting bits. Joan Cusack is also remarkably funny and exaggerated; and that applies to all the other guests as well. This movie has many elements of goofy humor and is nice if you want to laugh.
