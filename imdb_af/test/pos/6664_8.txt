"War movie" is a Hollywood genre that has done so much and redesigned so much that the cut dialogue, rehashed plot and overarching action series are inevitable for any conflict that deals with large-scale battles. Once, however, a war film comes together that goes against the grain and brings a real original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War era "Cold Mountain", starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger, is such a film. <br /> <br /> Again, Cold Mountain, a war movie isn't quite accurate. The film starts with a (straight) fast and dirty battle sequence that lets director Edward Zwick sit down from Glory. Cold mountain, however, is not so much about the Civil War itself, because it is about time and people. of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law. He is furious with the gruesome war and nostalgia for the beautiful village of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern left he has left behind, Ada Monroe, Nicole Kidman at first glance. This setting seems like the romantic interest in the home offers enough sympathy for the audience to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive, and even Cold Mountain soon turns drastic, but as the intrepid hero Inman seems to be a despair (which might free the public from the potentially confusing scenario of the root for the Confederate) and start a long odyssey home game. Meanwhile, on the farm back, Ada's cultured ways of little use are in the field; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderness. Ada's salvation is the course. Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, helps Ada to rebuild the farm and perhaps more importantly to deal with the loneliness and isolation of the war on Ada. <br /> <br /> Within these two institutions, a vibrant, compelling and sometimes disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Interman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances by Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's father-in-law, Ray Winstone, as an undisputed southern "lawyer" and Natalie Portman as a deeply upset and isolated young mother. Everyone is greatly affected and changed by "the war of North aggression," mostly for the worst. The dark, pervasive anti-war message, targeted by effective, haunting and spectacular beautiful shots from Virginia and North Carolina, is not communicated so much by gruesome warfare as by scars and people who have traumatized the war. is fought. Although the weapons and tactics of the war have changed a lot in the past century, it is a timely and timely relevance to the country. <br /> <br /> Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for the bulk of the movie, but unfortunately the atmosphere is rejected by a fairly climax that justifies the wonderfully shaped characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is uncomfortable at the beginning and end of the film, although the inherently distant, abstract and even absurd nature of their relationship somehow matches the stupidity of the rest of the plot. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake, "Cold Mountain" doesn't have the characteristics of a feel-good romance or an inspirational war drama. This is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain, but also to absorb the audience in the lives of a people torn by war, and completely desperate to completely disillusion get rid of its consequences.
