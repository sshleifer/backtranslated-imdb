I loved this movie, it was cute and funny! Lauren Holly was wonderful, she was funny and very credible in her role. Costas Mandylan was also very good, nice to watch too !! Brenda Vaccaro, as usual, was a pleasure to watch, she did a good job with her character. It was a pleasure to watch a movie that is funny, interesting and can be watched by the whole family. It's hard to find nice movies. Thanks for the Hallmark movies, they are wonderful! I wish I could buy it, if anyone knows where to buy this movie, please let me know !! I bought several Hallmark movies and am very happy with them. I hope I can buy this one !!
