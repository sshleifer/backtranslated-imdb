Cuba Gooding Jr is back! Jesus, he did a good job in this movie! I loved this movie. One of them feels good movies that make you run out and volunteer for a mission or something. Anyway, I would recommend seeing this movie in a heartbeat! Well worth the admission price. And as for Cuba Gooding Jr, just give him his next Oscar now !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
