I really enjoyed this program. It is exceptionally well written, with fine judgments and clever visuals. <br /> <br /> It is also very honest and refreshing compared to the purified representation of drug use in movies and television. <br /> <br /> Inaccessible - one of the best television shows of recent years and conquered on all scales for Channel 4. <br /> <br /> 9/10
