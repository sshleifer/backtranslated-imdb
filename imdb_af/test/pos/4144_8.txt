I always liked listening to Buddy Holly and felt a real loss when he was murdered in a plane crash at a young age. He wasn't in the old rock-roll class, we say, Chuck Berry or Jerry Lee Lewis, but he wasn't far behind. Who knows how great his legacy would have been if he had been singing for decades. Almost everyone he had exhausted was a hit. <br /> <br /> So, I was very pleasantly surprised at how well a job Gary Busey did when he played and mimicked his singing poll. He made Buddy proud as well as the actors (Don Stroud and Charles Martin Smith) who played Holly's backup group, The Crickets. <br /> <br /> Music modes, there are some of Holly's best-known songs in the beginning of the movie and it's really good with a strong finish to the end like Holly and the boys are shown in Iowa in their last concert ever. Busey doesn't just sing like Holly, he's a dead ring for him in the corpse. Some thing was the actor's best performance ever, and you got no argument from me. <br /> <br /> I'm also happy that they ended the movie on a positive note with the Iowa Concert, rather than residing. his tragic accident. The end could have been a real downer, but they didn't leave it.
