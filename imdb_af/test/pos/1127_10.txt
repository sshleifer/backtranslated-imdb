I love this show. I hate when it comes to the season final because it feels forever until the season starts again !! I followed this show since his pilot and then completely thrown where rusty college started and saw Casey his sister, where he is now Dana. Like this show can't wait until Monday night !! Also I am so glad that Cappie and Casey finally came back together who got me crazy !!! As far as Evan and Rebecca are concerned, I hope they will meet again that just feels like they're in the final. I just watched the cast of the cast and I'm so shocked that Casey Cartwright (Spencer Grammar) is Kelsey Grammar's daughter !!! It surprises me just as much and the other thing that a big SHOCKER is is that she was born the same year as I was and that she was born on my baby's date of birth and I watched and had her all the time no idea !!
