With its ww2 timing, in and out of love and easy on the eye Kira, it is reconciliation again. <br /> <br /> It's a relationship story with focused main characters working out the balance between first and quick love in WW2's home front. Poet Dylan Thomas philanders his way between wife and ex in dark and smoky Blitz London and later in windy wales. <br /> <br /> Vera's ex and next spark of each other as the poet and soldier become a sideline while the girls connect and share. An easy watch that works well in the era, reflects along with just a few drops in fit. Will work well with French subtitles, but then I have been too many art movies lately.
