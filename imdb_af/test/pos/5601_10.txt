Martin Donovan's promise to play Jesus was honest enough to see me the movie. Definitely worth it; clever and funny without overcoming it. The low quality filming was probably an appropriate effect, but ultimately got a little overwhelmed, and the end sounded more like a PBS program like Hartley. Yet, too many memorable lines and good moments for me to judge it hard.
