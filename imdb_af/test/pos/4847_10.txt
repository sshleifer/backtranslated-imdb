Arthur Miller certainly knows. His stories give a better picture of what it means to live in the United States in the 20th century than any other writer I can think of. <br /> <br /> Focusing on one of his novels is no exception. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy and Laura Dern show great performances here. Emotionally bruising but ultimately rewarding, this movie is excellent.
