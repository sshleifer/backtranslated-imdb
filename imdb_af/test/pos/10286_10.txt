Much has been written about the film itself, and instead of adding to the noise, I just want to say a few words about the two female actors. <br /> <br /> It should be a spectacular prospect for any actress to die, in a sense to the spectacular Monica Bellucci, but Romane Bohringer draws it to sensational ends. A movie starring Monica Bellucci where I fall in love with the other girl? It is not supposed to happen. <br /> <br /> It's been said a thousand times, but Monica Bellucci hit the saddest figure in modern theater. I have never seen such an innate grief. She won't be out of the place to break Lon Chaney's heart.
