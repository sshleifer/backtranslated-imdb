FOUR FRIENDS were hit 82 in HBO at 82 as a place to sleep. After hearing the term "sleeper" when I was 14, I was anxious to see one. (!) Son - was I surprised! That movie! I didn't really fall in love with a non-special effects film outside the TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE - much less a "hippy flick" ... but I grew up with a few hippies - I got the power behind Mr. Penn's movie. FOUR FRIENDS is definitely one of a kind. The writing is so personal - and it throws !!! Craig Wasson defines Danilo Prozor as well! He merely embodies the 'writer type' for a tea - clever and clumsy (the scene at the window ...) and strong but very vulnerable. For me - he catches up on how to be with agirl that it lasts a decade ... and I've always found comfort in the character - and in the movie. During the 80's, FOUR FRIENDS was a partner in crime for me - and I caught the movie when I was on HBO - even if I had to stay 5AM! And still, always in the end - there is a sense of loss when all those wonderful characters share the viewers on the beach. Jodi Thelen embodies "that girl" to the hilt - it's so hard not to be charmed by her. This movie really is the test of time. Every time I watch my video ... or show a friend ... and it still gets a solid response. I knew women who absolutely fell in love with Georgia! So many levels ..! Just an incredibly small 60's of humanity. Very special, lots of magic. I recently found the FOUR FRIENDS GUEST by Robert Grossbach - and it's even more detailed that the movie! Actual dates of events, etc. A real find! And what's more - haha ​​- I found the novel while looking around in a used bookstore ... in Omaha, NE of ALL places !!! Guess you should have an eye for her! When I was 92 at 92, I went to a red lil memorbilia store - and there was a TON of silence from the movie !!! Unfortunately - I was broken and couldn't enjoy ... but boy, those photos of Georgia and the guys just went right through me! I met director Joe Sergant on the set SKYLARK in Emporia, KS in the summer of 92 ... and we talked about FOUR FRIENDS - very cool! Also ... working in a video store in Omaha in 98 - waiting for a woman who was a relative of Jim Metzler ..! She told her to succeed. There was a kid in Omaha who was just fanatic of the movie - and got the best of it. Again - the movie captures everything that is in Danilo's character ... great, good work --- one of Mrs. Tesich and Penn's best efforts. Steve Tesich is very missed. An incredible author.
