I'd like to know if anyone knows how to get a copy of the movie, "That's the Way of the World". It's been about 30 years since I've seen this movie, and I'd love to see it again. Earth Wind & Fire surpasses the country worldwide with their inspiring music and themes. It was a pity that this group did not start like their peers in the early 1970s, but, as said earlier, racial tensions were banned in the United States, banning the equal exposure of African American music groups. It's good to see that Earth Wind & Fire continues their success. I want to add this movie to my collection. Someone please help me if possible. Thank you for your attention. Milton Shaw
