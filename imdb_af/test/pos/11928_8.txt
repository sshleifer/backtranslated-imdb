I didn't see it in years, but when I was about 6, I first saw it on VHS and I had to watch it at least 10 times. Now I said it was a while, so I could screw the plot, but I remember some Colombian terrorists taking a prep school hostage claiming that the chief terrorist (the "wishmaster") should be released from prison. now I can only see the plot here on IMDb, but I'm pretty sure it's right. In any way, a group of boys at school decide not only to sit down and wait to die so they decide to fight back. this movie has always been stuck in my mind. There are so many images that I have not forgotten as Joey's (I think?) Death scene or in the terrorist sandwiches or one child (no idea of ​​his name) spit false asthma attack. just a good movie. It could be movies like this that gave me my tolerance for film, because if I remember correctly, this movie is pretty graphic. guys are cut off by helicopter machine guns, a special force that gets their hands on is blown by a grenade (it's not sure, but I seem to remember something like that) and the most bloody is the main terrorist who cut in the head. a gory detail. good action, good humor, good acting, wonderful movie experience. I have to look again these years!
