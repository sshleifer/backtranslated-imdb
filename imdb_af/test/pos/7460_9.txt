I agree with the posters before the characters were exceptionally strong and credible and all the actors on their top form. I especially loved David Boreanaz who was in a part, so unlike anything else he played, and again his wonderful gift for comedy. The first part of the movie was light and funny, the extortion was a bit surreal but interesting - and it was all downhill from there. <br /> <br /> I found it frustrating that at least two out of the 3 girls (Keira and Lisa) get out of the extortion and betrayal shot, nowhere on a psyche. I know the movie has changed the darker end of the play - and I don't say I missed the murder party. But I surely had to see that the two could somehow get them and I left in the frustration with the end. (That's why I just gave it 9) <br /> <br /> But definitely an interesting movie.
