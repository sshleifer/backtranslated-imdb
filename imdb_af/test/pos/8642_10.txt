The case history of 'Mulholland Dr' is known: What had to have another outing (after 'Twin Peaks') in the competitive field of TV series, suddenly ended after the pilot was completed. It was too risky and turned for the producers to risk an investment. Lynch used all the filmed and cut material and new shootings began to complete a completely new feature film. The result: One of the most impressive theater experiences of this decade to be ranked among the best works by David Lynch. His earlier films 'Eraserhead', 'Blue Velvet' or 'Wild at Heart' kept annoyingly in an annoying way involving the viewer in the role of a voyeur, but never as part of the plot does not happen. /> <br /> 'Mulholland Dr.' is a puzzle where pieces are missing, others are of course taken from Eraserhead and Lost Highway, but it never seems to be unfinished work. On the internet I got many instructions and essays to explain this movie. I am now aware that it will lose its magic if you try to decipher it thoroughly. All the detailed solution explanations are not only waste but also the dubious attempt to provide an answer where such a thing is not absolutely necessary. Imagine this scenario: A baby disciples his teddy bear to find out where the secret and the specific of the bear lie. Is it because it wants to destroy its toys? Is the secret in the teddy bear or in the heart of the child? Transferring this to 'Mulholland Dr.' this means innocence is one of the most important conditions to see and appreciate. <br /> <br /> David Lynch manages not only to illustrate the surface of human behavioral life, but also to grapple with everything. Human desires, dreams, obsessions and fears - everything that remains unspoken; Often suppressed emotions. 'Mulholland Dr.' has the intensity to ask for a cast that matters completely with the dust. Actresses and actors ready to follow the director's visions unselfishly. Laura Elena Harring, Naomi Watts, Justin Theroux unleashes their task in such a way that you would not or could not imagine another role. Although their play is a bit lower at first, you'll soon notice that this stereotyping is set to manipulate the viewer and enchant him as soon as the red thread of the film is visible. <br /> <br /> When you claim the criterion of a well-made movie, to lose yourself and to dive into what you see on the screen, Lynch has managed to make a masterpiece. A modern masterpiece that manifests David Lynch's status as one of the most important, creative and courageous directors of the present. Like any filmmaker who goes beyond the boundaries, he is confronted with criticism and ignorance. It will fade as soon as you find the individual key to Lynch's world of movies. 'Mulholland Dr.' is more than just a sleep? It's a must have for anyone who loves ambitious theater. And besides, the film is a reward with Hollywood, in form and content, which has never been daring in that distinction.
