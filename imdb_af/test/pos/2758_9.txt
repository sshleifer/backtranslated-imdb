Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is not quite different from the previous games (excluding Tony Hawk 3). The only thing new to Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is the new level of choice, and has worked out the graphics. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x offers a new career, which is the 2x career. The 2x career is basically Tony Hawk 1 career, as there are only about five challenges per level. If you missed Tony Hawk 1 and 2, I suggest you buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, but if you played the first two games, try this one. Overall, there's really nothing new, but it's still fun to go through the game. Hopefully this review will satisfy your needs. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10 Overall, the clean visual isn't really one of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x's main features. The atmosphere has changed a lot from Tony Hawk 1 and 2, and the character models look a little better. Looking back at Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2 on the old PS1, the thought that those old graphics are going badly through your head. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, the graphics are delivered much better. The character models are no longer filled with jaggys, the textures are smoother, but not to the extreme. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x footage doesn't compare to Tony Hawk's graphics, but Activision probably didn't want to make Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x special graphics. Overall, the graphics earn an average score of 7 because they didn't use the full power of the Xbox to use it here. Graphics are nice and clean. That's all I have to say. Sound: 8 out of 10 The sound effects don't deliver much to the imagination, but the skateboards that jump out of the ground sound good. . The main reason I gave the sound factor a score was because you are not obliged to listen to the Tony Hawk soundtrack below, because there is a personal soundtrack feature. The sound effects sound much better than the sounds in Tony Hawk 1 and 2, mainly because it is clearer, and just the fact that everything sounds good. One of the main reasons why I bought this game is because of the personal soundtrack. The grinding sound effects still sound the same as the first two games, just a little tweaked. One of the major problems of the sound factor is the fact that the song is over, will not go to the next song. The song you just listened to will just play again. I don't like the in-game soundtrack, but as I said, you're not obliged to listen to it. <br /> <br /> Control: 10 out of 10 The controls are the best part of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x. The control setup is wonderfully comfortable and easy to get used to. Back in the Playstation days, people thought the controls were the best ever, but it looks like 2x did a better job with the Xbox controls. Surprisingly, it is very easy to use the control stick to perform tricks. Activision did a great job with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x controls. They made the Xbox controller the best for Tony Hawk games. You won't be disappointed with the style of control, and it's a guarantee. <br /> <br /> Games: 10 out of 10 With the exception of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater being composed 2x basically Tony Hawk 1 and 2, the game is still incredibly fun. The game play factor is changing a bit. This time you get much more air than in the first two games, and it's much easier to perform tricks. In Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x, each character has three career modes, consisting of Tony Hawk 1 career, Tony Hawk 2 career and the 2x career. Tony Hawk 1 career is pretty easy, because in the first game you get nothing for air. The Tony Hawk 2 career has the same difficulty as the Playstation version did. The only difficulty that applies to the 2x career is finding out where all the items are, but after doing so, 2x career is not difficult at all. In the 2x career there are a total of 3 levels, and the first two levels consist of finding the secret tapes, the collection of S-K-A-T-E, and doing whatever is needed for that level. The third level of the three is the competition level, where you need to get some points to get the gold. In the first two levels, the secret bands, and the collection of the letters S-K-A-T-E, are found in both of them. Overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x still holds the old Tony Hawk's Pro Skater vibe. <br /> <br /> Story: - <br /> <br /> Fun Factor: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x is by far, the funniest game on Xbox today. I played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2, and then I didn't like them, but for some reason Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is 2x really fun. There is really not much to say except that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is 2x by far the best match on Xbox. One problem is that if you've gone through the game once, you'll play it a few times, but it'll be repetitive. <br /> <br /> Repeat value: 10 out of 10 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x delivers a high amount of repetition value. There are many cheats to be unlocked, and many character videos. Overall, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x has a lot of repetition value, mainly because it's so nice. <br /> <br /> Best Feature: You are not obliged to listen to the crappy in-game soundtrack. Final statement: Many people have complained in the past that they did not love Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2x because there is nothing new, but they are not that old. must stop complaining because you get many games for $ 50.00. <br /> <br /> Graphics: 7 out of 10. Sound: 8 out of 10. Control: 10 out of 10. Games: 10 out of 10. Story: N / A Fun factor: 10 out of 10. <br /> <br / > Overall score: 9 out of 10.
