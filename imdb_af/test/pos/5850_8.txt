This multi-leveled thriller kept my attention throughout. It is disturbing and informative to see how wrong human behavior can be. It is also informative about which past wounds can motivate current behavior. No one, except Sandra Bullock's partner, is very nice. But everyone is credible. Sandra did an excellent job. Her character, Cassie, comes alive with all her pain and fear and defense. She is a survivor and so her life experience finally brings her to a healing moment. I really enjoyed this movie.
