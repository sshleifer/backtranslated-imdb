I'm a big fan of Harald Zwart, and I just knew I should see this movie, though I can't say I'm a football winner. But when I saw it, I just filled my heart with joy, and I had a good time in the movies to watch it. <br /> <br /> Bj√∏rn Fast Nagell does a great job managing this movie, and although you see the main characters, new to acting, they are growing with the movie and making it what it is. Although it is supposed to be a football video, there is surprisingly little football in it. The whole idea is to set up the six guys who make up the word N O R W A Y on their journey to the World Cup in soccer in Germany this year. <br /> <br /> If you're only going to see one Norwegian movie this year, it's one.
