I still count "Police Group!" as the absolutely funniest TV show of the 1980s. Somewhere, at BetaMax no less, I've had six episodes. I knew that a show would not last this good and that I had to keep it for myself. How stupid was ABC? They were quoted because the viewers did not know that the "Police team!" was a comedy because it had no laugh track! Right! When Drebin has a line like: "You get the chance to get up just in the morning, to work, or put your face in a fan." How can this be comedy? I saw every episode at least ten times and see something new that I missed before. Even the deep backgrounds always have gags going on. Don't miss this opportunity if you have the opportunity to see an episode, but if you read it, you probably already have copies like I did.
