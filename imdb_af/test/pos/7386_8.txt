Some things to touch as a response to the previous person's comments. Just pay attention to what's going on in the movie. <br /> <br /> (I think they're spoiled) <br /> <br /> The red stuff under David's mouth? David goes "mad" because the stranger tells him to come out of the house, which David's theory of David probably proves. a relationship between the woman and the stranger; he ran to the man. <br /> <br /> David didn't lose him in the woods, he just hit the stranger a few times and let it go to his wife to pick up the pieces. <br /> <br /> Only the woman eats the mushroom. <br /> <br /> I have to say, after that one point with the woman and stranger, I started to feel disappointed. But the end made the whole movie. <br /> <br /> And for that and the very last scene ... it's one of my favorite movies ever. I had to put it together before, but let me touch later. I was really surprised. Honest. <br /> <br /> This movie is interesting to say the least. But if you don't see it for the actors' performances, I'd better say this one is because it's all this movie holds together.
