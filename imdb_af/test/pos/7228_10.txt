Wow, this movie is wonderful. It's such an excellent movie. Did some sick scenes (not nearly as sick as Terror Firmer or Citizen Toxie) a little nudity, and that was the penis monster's debut on film! It set the scene for many of Troma's movies, it's a very tricky movie. It mixes comedy, romance and my favorite, HORROR / GORE! Not so much in this movie, but enough to satisfy. This is the best adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Much better than any other version. They make it so entertaining and fun to watch. And we have Debbie Rochon ... hehe ... I love her. :) All I have to say is it's a good movie, very funny, and Lemmy is a great host for it. The acting is good, and Kaufman does stylish as always. Must see for all TROMA FANS!
