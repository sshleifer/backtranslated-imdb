Cleopatra (the delicious Monica Bellucci) is challenged by Cesar (Alain Chabat): to prove that the Egyptians are better than the Romans, they promise to build a fine castle for Cesar within a period of three months, without any delay . She calls the one-arm architect Numerobis (Jamel Debbuzi) and gives him two options: to be covered by gold if he reaches his mission, or becomes crocodile food if he fails. Numerobis will ask for help from Panoramix (Claude Rich), Asterix (Christian Clavier) and Obelix (Geraard Depardieu) (with Ideiafix). This movie is very funny, especially the parts where Obelix and the Pirates are led by Red Beard. However, the author and director have noted that French is not a universal language like English. That's why the jokes with words (such as Austin Powers movies) don't work well for people who are foreign to the French language. French people and people who speak fluently in the French language will certainly keep these jokes, but they do not make sense to me, it does not speak French. My voice is seven.
