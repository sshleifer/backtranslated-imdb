I saw the start of the Muppet movie, but only half. Because I just looked at Mrs Kelly's friend's house. The songs were the best and the Muppets were so happy. They learn it when they believe in the end of the rainbow, anyone can make it, no matter how small, no matter how green (which is included in the preview). Kermit is my favorite protagonist (What does it describe the main character) And so is the other Muppets. Mel Brooks was wonderful when he played Professor Max Krassman. The scene where Mrs Piggy Kermit saves by doing Kung Fu on the guys. It was so cool. <br /> <br /> The Muppet movie is the best Jim Henson movie with the most beautiful characters and will cherish people for his successful movie.
