As soon as I saw the ad for "Changi" on the History channel, I knew I'd love it. It caught the ANZAC spirit fantastic - you would die if you had no friends in you. The characters of "Changi" were strong and each one brought something different in the story, and Japanese soldiers were not criticized, but portrayed as ordinary soldiers they thought were right, just as the Australians did. Direction, script, play and setting are all done wonderfully, with a clear, easy plan. Humor was the soldier's key to survival, and it was great to see a mini-series about war, actually a kind of humor in it, which is usually difficult to do without breaking people. From what I read about soldiers in the Changi PoW camp, this story is a very realistic approach to the three and a half years that the Australian, British, New Zealand, American and Dutch men spent there. I would recommend this series to anyone, whether you are interested in war or not. 10/10.
