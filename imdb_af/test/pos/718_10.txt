Jennifer Montgomery's "Art for Teachers of Children" is a beautiful, disturbing masterpiece. Montgomery's keen camera and cinematography, along with the brilliantly unmotivated performances of her crying, enhance the sense of shocking, raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14-year-old Jennifer's seduction of her married councilor counsel. The scenes between the incredibly rude actress Jennifer (Caitlin Grace McDonnell) and Jennifer's mother (actually by Ruth Montgomery) actually spoke, are among the most intriguing and powerful I've ever seen on film. The lesson finally learned here? "There is nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art." Well, I would recommend this remarkable piece of "art" to anyone interested in self-sufficient independent theater.
