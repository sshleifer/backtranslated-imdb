Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure is a great TV movie for all ages. The film focuses on "Fizzy" (Alyssa Milano) who wants to travel for gold in Alaska. The only person holding her is Pierce Thomas Madison (Bruce Campbell). What comes next to her is an adventure she will never forget. This TV movie was just fantastic. The play is # 1 (especially by Bruce Campbell and Alyssa Milano) and I also learned about the Goldrush. I recommend this TV movie to everyone without hesitation. It is also based on a true story. <br /> <br /> 10/10
