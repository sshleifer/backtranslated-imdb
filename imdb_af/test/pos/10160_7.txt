Actually a story about the young child of Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day. The kid is kidnapped to keep his parents quiet. They know something about a plot to kill the ambassador of an unnamed country during a march at Albert Hall in London. <br /> <br /> The movie is rich in Hitchcockian incidents. A friendly but opaque Frenchman seems to sting innocent Stewart - an Indiana doctor - a bit too intense to just be curious. Later, the Frenchman appeared in Arabic disguise, a knife in his back, and whispered information about the murder plug to Stewart. Stewart tells his wife - Doris Day looks very naughty - but refuses to work with the police and risk his son's life. <br /> <br /> Instead, the couple are trying to find the assassins, buy them down and get their son back, take them from Morocco, where Hitchcock views our ordinary tourists' view of the customs, places and gave food to London. There is a hilarious wild goose chase that involves a set-up between Stewart and the staff of a taxidermy shop. The staff are more concerned about guarding their half-sculpted monsters than anything else, and they move around to protect the carcasses of a leopard and swordfish. In the course of the shift, she controls Stewart's throat to be cut through the swordfish bill, but is bitten by a stuffed tiger. The action is being raised by Bernard Hermann's evil. The scene ends with Stewart running the door. Hitchcock ends it with a shot of a lion head protruding from the closed door. There is also a running tub, well done, about some visitors waiting for the couple's hotel room in London waiting for things to be explained. <br /> <br /> There are two serious issues that are lightly touched. One is the relationship between Stewart and Day, which is not as rosy as it should be, as a civil ideal. She has been a musical star for many years and is internationally renowned. And she gave it all to marry a regular guy who is a doctor. It is understandable, for example, in a nurse or a flight member or almost any other woman as an international star with a promising career in their own right. It is not buried, but the edginess is noticeable as it was not in the original version. It reminds me a bit of an exchange between Joe Dimaggio and his then wife, Marilyn Monroe, who has just returned to entertain the troops in Korea. "Oh, Joe," she rushed, "did you ever see ten thousand people stand up and brave?" "Seventy thousand," muttered Joe, the former hero of the New York Yankees. <br /> <br /> The second problem is one of dedication. Who is of greater social value? One's own young boy? Or an unknown ambassador. Are we endangering ourselves or our loved ones for the sake of national stability? Day is confronted in the strongest form of the dilemma at the climax in the Albert Hall. Her solution is for commitment to political stability, although her motives are problematic. Is she screaming to save the ambassador's life, or is she just doing it to release the anxiety that is overwhelming her? (Cf. Alec Guiness falls on the exploder at the end of "The Bridge on the River Kwai.") Photography is extremely good, and the institutions may be threatening, even on a quiet street in a London neighborhood. It's mid-day, and Stewart is alone and determined, but also scared. There are footsteps somewhere on someone's Gulliver street. Is he followed? Is his life in danger? And where is hell everyone living on this street? Hitchcock paid so much attention to location details that we could project the garden walls of the bricks next to him. <br /> <br /> The director had a scarce difference with Francois Truffaut while he was questioning Truffaut's otherwise lazy book. Truffaut argued that the previous version of "The Man Who Were Too Much" lacks the depth of the later version. Hitchcock replied: "It seems like I want you to make movies for the art house," but finally agreed that the 1930 version was the work of a talented amateur and this version was the work of a professional person . No reason for that. <br /> <br /> It's Hitchcock very close to its peak.
