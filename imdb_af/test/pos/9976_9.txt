If you think of gholflieks, do you think of Caddyshack, but what if there are children? Go right to this movie! Disney use has been proven to make a movie that adults and children will enjoy. The action in this movie is, in my opinion, pretty good and the leading cast is usually very young! This movie is also very well filmed and unique, as all the corners of the golf game are seen. I think this movie should be for academic awards for movie editing or something, because the whole movie of the movie is on top of that. Although the end may be a bit predictable, the movie may well on its own! It also shows that you don't need curse, nudity or violence to make a gorgeous movie!
