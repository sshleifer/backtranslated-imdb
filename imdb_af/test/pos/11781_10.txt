The hysterical Hardware Wars is finally on DVD. HW earned his niche among the parody classics and is not only a riotous 20 minutes short, but a staple in low budget film production classes, where much of the film's cult status comes from and resides. With the DVD we not only get the opportunity to review the original parody (4Q2, Cinnamon Bunkop, Ballistic Toast, etc.) done by Ernie F. in 1978, but there are many additional materials that make the Fosselius white. Ancient Sideshow is a deadly parody that is very funny, but makes a statement about the confusion of ignorance and greed at the same time. The director's comments are also hysterical, as is the creation feature that takes parody on the talk show and is actually based on taking out HW on the talk program, even though it is the public access circuit. I would like to see Ernie, Michael Wiese and the crew watch some other contemporary, over-the-top and over-targeted targets - just like any movie that Hollywood is currently playing at $ 100m and not so much. such as Spider Man or Men In Black (actually parodies themselves!), but any number of overheated, overhyped, overwhelmed and over-performing features. <br /> <br />
