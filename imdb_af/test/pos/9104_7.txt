(Very light spoilers, a basic overview, no real details) <br /> <br /> If you're in this movie with enough low expectations. I saw this movie in Maryland a few days ago, and the only reason I agreed to go ... was because it was free. I expected a few chuckles, but as I have never been a big fan of Tenacious D, it's not much anymore. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes of the movie are hilarious, as we look at Jack Black's humble Christian origins in a Midwest American town. The film takes us years to come after the first meeting between JB and Kyle Gass, the second half of Tenacious D. We see the formation of the band and the origin of its name. Finally, as the title suggests, the second half of the film describes their quest for the fabulous "Pick of Destiny." Again, the start of the movie was aloud, and most of the movies at least kept a smile on my face. That said, there were times, it felt a bit long; It's only 100 minutes, but it still feels a bit shorter. The story is just as absurd as it sounds, and it's not a movie you see if you want a real plot. It is good, except that it means that many of the jokes are hit or miss ... and when they miss, they miss badly. Same thing with the songs; it is a musical, but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so ... then they thought anyway. <br /> <br /> I would say that the R-score really saved this movie from bombardment; The D's humor simply can't work without cussing, sex and drug references. But if you're not a true fan of the band, or at least you appreciate their comedy style, I'd recommend saving you money and rent. "Pick" will make you giggle ... but is it worth $ 9? I do not think so. I was tempted to rate it a 6, but since I think a lot will enjoy justifying it in the theaters, it seems like a 7 is more appropriate. Be sure it's your style.
