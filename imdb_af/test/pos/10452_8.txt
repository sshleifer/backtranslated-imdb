It is one of the best and most classified teenage movies ever made. <br /> <br /> I saw it and it was and is one of my favorites, maybe not as popular as "fast times", but just as big. <br /> <br /> There is a serious side to this movie, as mentioned by other reviewers, starting as a comedy and morfs in a drama over half. However, it's its beauty and what makes it apart. You get it all. Humor (not different from "Fast Times"), Drama, and a BIG BIG soundtrack. Personally, I think every child should go to high school, give it an idea of ​​the journey they intend to take. Cmon - what kid does it look like will not be able to relate to anyone in the movie? The fact that it is becoming so halfway is also cool and just excellent. You don't even see it. Definitely many surprises. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: PLEASE DON'T LEARN IF YOU DO NOT KNOW. <br /> <br /> Big, knee-creeping humor. (Who can forget the scene between Gary and Camilla?). I can still hear it: "Oh my big strong burrito !!" Unpaid !! <br /> <br /> Some of the scenes between Gary and Karin are difficult to see (especially the final scene of coarse). There are so many women like Karen out there who made exactly the same choice. Think about it - how many women reject men with hearts of gold (like Gary) for jerks? I know I did it - and so many women I know. This movie will inspire publicity and despite the many times I have seen, I still admire the filmmakers and artists. Everyone will find someone related to this movie or more likely to be one person. <br /> <br /> Finally, the music used is just great (lots of cars, u2, many obscure songs). from the 80s-80s purist dream.) <br /> <br /> But don't make a mistake, it's not the music that makes this movie unique, it's the story itself, simple and simple. One of the best of its kind and a teen movie classic.
