In the veins of Jeepers Creepers and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Monster Man made surprisingly good - even if it was bad - little horror. Throw a little buddy comedy, yummy and intense fright. It's hard not to say that Monster Man is really entertaining. The low budget seems pretty obvious, but it did not do the movie's presentation in general and shamed more major budget squatting films. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is somewhat generic as possible. Some friend, Adam (Eric Jungman) and Harley (Justin Urich) ride across land to interrupt the marriage of a woman who has always loved Adam. While Adam is more nerdy, Harley is a self-proclaimed lady and very offensive. When they added a bonus to the plot, they picked up a sexy hitchhiker, Sarah (Aimee Brooks). Things change into nightmare when a monster truck with scary face drive stalking them. When the dead body starts counting, they must risk the race at the time before their own life. <br /> <br /> Of course, the plot is reminiscent of many famous famous horror movies, but Michael Davis as author and director succeeds in being successful. in maintaining the tension. The scare builds well enough, where characterization is never the best, but pretty good. The screenplay also sowed with comedies that work for the funny moments and they are quite nice, rather than annoying, and are also waiting for the turn in the finals. It is spectacular and shocking at the same time, which is almost amusing. <br /> <br /> As a lock, monster man surprisingly entertaining. It gets more attention in the big screen. It proves that big budget doesn't make an effective horror movie, but do skill! Something the director showed and delivered.
