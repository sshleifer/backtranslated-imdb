I can't remember the series, I believe it might be 'American Masters', but it was broadcast on PBS around 1980. Most people have a little knowledge of the development of the A-bomb, and those who have little or no, probably think it's a pretty dry topic. Anyone who has watched this 7 part series doesn't feel that way. You learn to know the unrest in Oppenheimer's thoughts and how development has changed his life forever. You understand the tragic figure he has become, and why. With 7 episodes you will learn the most important players, and the intrigue and stern. I contacted PBS about the chance to get a video or DVD, but never received an answer. Sorry, I'd love to see it again.
