A strange ray of light penetrates the bedroom of Dr Craig Burton (Arnold Vosloo) and his wife Sherry (Jillian McWhirter) as they make love. About two hours are inexplicable because they seem embarrassed. Under hypnosis during a session with psychiatrist Dr. Susan Lamarche (Lindsay Crouse), Craig discovers that his wife is fertilized by strangers. Sherry resists this thought as absurd and is very happy to tell news to her husband that she is indeed pregnant. Ecstatic after trying to conceive, Sherry is afraid of Craig's persistence that the fetus is not his. This is the result of a check on his low sperm count, with a high probability that he could not fertilize his wife in any way. Terrible, troubled experiences with the fetus in her lead sherry to some discoveries. Dr. David Wetherly (Wilford Brimley) finds that the ultrasound causes some unusual results from the developing baby's appearance, but it is Craig who sees it as a stranger! Sparks explodes the electrical equipment and even cuts off Wetherly's pacemaker! Through hypnosis, Sherry reveals the experience of her abduction, but Lamarche believes her problem is not psychologically physiological. With no one who believes his wife's alien impregnation theory, Craig turns to sociologist Dr Bert Clavell (Brad Dourif), whose work is in the study of alien life and abduction. But, Bert is reluctant to help Craig go to the ends of the earth to save his wife's life from possible harm. Tragic results take place when Lamarche and others try to keep Craig from his goals to cut it off. He believes he is angry. Craig will still pursue his task of dragging Bert on this road with him. <br /> <br /> Grim, recording horror story about one man's battle to save his wife from the harm of beings nobody else believes. Fortunately, Dourif's character is not a quack, but an intelligent doctor who wants to learn more, but his pursuit of the truth of aliens is not hostile. He hopes to learn from Sherry, but is not very demanding in this. goal. The story is told realistically. It's easy to understand why other Craig may be off-his-rocker. Vosloo does not take the character too far, but expresses the need of his current situation. How can he save his wife from this enmity and prove to others that he is not tired? McWhirter earns credit for the demands of the difficult kidnapping scene where her unfortunate character is naked on this table, being investigated and molested by these things. Croese is good at her limited but important role as the voice of reason in a situation where her clients are psychologically out of control. The sample effects are icky and effective. I think the movie works pretty well and director Yuzna deserves credit to at least limit himself to this movie. The last twenty minutes Craig is trying to carry out his "removal surgery", with a scared Bert, looking at the crazy situation, is a nail. <br /> <br /> You know Fire in the Sky fans can dig it. movie.
