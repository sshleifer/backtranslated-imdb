This short was partly four of the "Short Cinema Journal" - a movie I rented from Netflix, but which was originally a monthly movie series for people who love mediocre modern short films and want the DVD bunch full of ads. . So far I've tried two of the Journal's DVDs and in the horrible way felt angry that a viewer should navigate the disc to see the movies. Talk about an over-produced and too complicated way to do it! While I have and will continue to see as many shorts as I can, I really doubt whether I will struggle with these factors with the magazines. <br /> <br /> Now it may be because I didn't like the disk much that I wasn't favorable to this Portuguese animated short. This is certainly possible. But even if that is the case, I feel that the other reviews were too positive about this simple, small movie. Some of the artwork was indeed nice - I liked the fact that the simple black and white drawings suddenly became 3-D environments, as the camera came from a dull remote shot and pigeon to the city. It was nice and did some work. But for the story of a cat who wants to go to the moon, it just didn't do anything to me. IMPORTANT UPDATE - I saw this movie again on a DVD titled "Cartoon Noir" on 5/9. It was a pretty unattractive collection of art films. But this time I saw the story of the cat and the moon with a completely different soundtrack and boy made it a difference. Instead of Portuguese with subtitles, it had a French accent narrator who spoke English in a Film Noir style. While usually copying hate, this time it really made the movie. The narration of the Portuguese version leaves much to be desired if you do not know the language or understand the subtleties. Unless you speak the language, try to find the other version (provided you understand English).
