Jingofighter I agree with some of your comments, but I don't have to agree on a few things. First, this movie is nothing like the cars that ATE Paris. Not IMHO. None of that. <br /> <br /> I think the movie has elements of surrealism, but I think the basic approach of the movie maker is not "surrealistic". Therefore, it's not really like CARS Paris, I think more like a strange Euro-work, with some scenes that are not characteristic of 'true' surrealist. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I think the music of Heuzenroeder is brilliant. They whispered, that old sound out of country and western records, and she waaayyy better than most Aussie films that usually make the movie maker with a dumb sounding Indy band team that wants to push the company. <br /> <br /> As For the name of the movie - I don't know why it is called Modern Love, but I hope David Bowie will be dressed in lipstick and lipstick. I start showing my age.
