I believe I share the same psychological view of the world with Kieslowski. He is Polish, I am Dutch, but we share a synthetic thought: the world is not empty of the metaphysical amidst coincidence. Nowhere by man or perhaps by a poet-prime minister, so that Poland, as a social and cultural 'low-pressure area', could play the role he did in World War II. He was critical but Christian towards the Jews, but often not less critical to him. There is innocence and guilt in Kieslowski's worldview, as the symbols in Catholicism: the White versus the Black Madonna. In Rouge, the Black Madonna was the one who fell in love with the judge when he was a young man. Flashbacks are realistically related to the present, although it is quite coincidental, such as the camera just floating on the other side of the street or the then young judge's red jeep passing the young woman's car after she accidentally took his dog with his dog. hit. Being in the same camera over time is what we understand later. His love was unanswered, so that his life was not as he intended. He lost his ability to love other people and animals. Being a judge, he feels that he is spying on other people's lives, and when he retires, he keeps it simple and now spends on his neighbors. The innocence and sense of justice of the younger woman (literally) who accidentally comes into his life, recovers his judgment and it is because of her that he confesses and accepts spying his espionage on his neighbors and the police and even on the stones that are thrown through its windows. In the process, history repeats itself between this man and the woman he loves, although this time he is old and the woman is not the same. Kieslowski may have struggled with this bit, because the old judge is his alter ego, and it is said he was cursed by Irene Jacob. Both women play the same essential role in his psychology, the one who owns his heart and soul and can therefore make or break him, even as an old man! It is as if the "forces in the air" or God are bringing them along. Accruals are also * coincidence to be just chance or even luck. There must be a mystical, supernatural or theological source that influences these uncompromisingly deep life decisions. The study book fell and opened on the page of the examination question. This is another example of this. Or the moment the old judge spoke his heart to the young woman, suddenly the wind outside the opera house opened the doors and broke the windows. The huge picture of the young woman happens to predict the one on television, after the drowning accident on her Canal crossing trip. These moments are effectively emphasized by the human voice of liturgy or what sounds like it (Van den Budenmayer).
