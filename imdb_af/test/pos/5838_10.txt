I watched many television in my 51 years, but I've never had so much fun because I watched Oz. The action by the entire cast was excellent. The writing was just perfect, with every character that lasted for six years. I also enjoyed death and ultra-violence. It may sound strange, but it was sometimes strange to find out how one of the characters would end up dead. I especially enjoyed the true romance and love between Beecher and Keller. The two men really knew how to throw in every possible way. I really hope that HBO will continue to show us that this great show has never been revived forever! I watched every episode at least 4 times, but I still look forward to Tuesday and Thursday nights at 11am. for an episode of this fun and very entertaining show.
