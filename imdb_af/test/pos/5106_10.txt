I really enjoyed the movie and the story! I saw the original (1939 I believe) and enjoyed both of them. To really appreciate the story, you need to be familiar with English culture and customs. The prof. (Peter O'Toole) was dedicated to his school and the "boys" in that school. It was an English "public" school, which we call in the US as private school (E.G. Andover). He is a very ascetic person and on the surface it seems as if he is stiff, stiff, unconscious and weak. He is strict in his educational standards because he cares for "his guys", that is, he doesn't want them to get cheap or poor education. He meets (by introduction) a "dance hall girl" (Petula Clark) and is completely beaten. In England at that time the reference to "dance hall" wore the connotation of extreme sexual debauchery and was definitely "lower class". We find that the prof. In fact, a very difficult and courageous person, as well as loyal to people and institutions he loves and / or respects. Clark becomes more than a lover and wife ... his "personality" and allows him to grow as a man and a person for the benefit of his beloved school and his own happiness. The first film was set before World War II, this one is going through World War II, and that is 1969 (we had the "British Invasion. Beetles, etc. Clark had hits and was very popular as ... still is for me), the music is wonderful, color and photography excellent. I think O'Toole played the character perfectly! There are dedicated people like "Chips" ... around us, but many do not receive the recognition. Very enjoyable movie and story!
