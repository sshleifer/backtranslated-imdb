I think I don't have too much to add. I found the comedy to be funny after more than ten years as it came out. <br /> <br /> The one thing I noticed was the music during the dialogue to be distracting and often made the movie very hooked if it had to be. The use of songs is fine during the movie, but the orchestra background is too busy, configured and if the movie was ever edited for DVD, I would seriously recommend that the background music be shown to an almost inaudible level. It made the overall feel for the whole movie cheap and I can see why many people have overtaken it. <br /> <br /> The film has many levels of work on the script, plot and comedy. shallow. It's too bad the producer and director feel they need the musical shock to improve the mood. Knowing this now, I find it hard to watch and I curse those involved in the music editing in the film. It had all the subtleties of a jackhammer.
