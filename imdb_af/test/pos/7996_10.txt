forget about the over-rated "Batman Begin, THIS is the ultimate Batman movie you don't want to miss. This movie has it all and it surpasses the first 1989 mega hit. It can't have done so well the first one at The box office, but it is definitely a much better movie, the visuals are amazing, Burton works his magic as he always does in his movies, Gotham city, Batman's hunting ground, is a wonderful sight to see. itself is pretty good and the 2 villains in this one are VERY interesting, much more interesting, actually there comic book counterparts. Tim Burton and screenwriter Daniel Walters go one step further to bring you a real emotional connection with these characters Perfectly played by Danny Devito, the penguin is a kind of tragic character who left his parents at his birth and later seeks revenge on the world that denies him. but he has some of the most classic lines that make a sk urk ever in a single movie. The other villain is Catwoman, played so brilliantly by Michelle Pfieffer, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time, giving a WOW performance, and stealing the performance as far as any of the past and the current live action batman villain. she also has a tragic background. her name is Selina Kyle, and she is a very closed secretary for a sharp businessman, Max Shreck, who later killed her by moving her out of a window. somehow, she survives and is awakened by cats and then decides and then to become the legendary Catwoman, of course, the incredible order she puts her entire apartment completely into one of the most Oscar-destroying worthy rage of anger and rage that I've ever seen an actress. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton returns the cape and cowl as Batman and also Bruce Wayne and this time he is much darker. There is not much else to say here, except that Keaton is simply the best actor to ever play Batman. He only harvested cool, and he has a kind of Clint Eastwood approach to playing Batman, and he's very dark. he does not speak much, and when he does, he sounds very cool and he does not sound his voice, even though the dumb and false IE "batman" voice starts in the bat. He pushes around Gotham like a man owned by his own inner demons. He is pshycologically disturbed, and you know it. In this outing, he takes on 2 of the most famous bad things to enjoy the Batman comic book world. <br /> <br /> However, despite the cruelty of the action scenes, such as the screens with the coolest Batmobile Ever shook the street and throwing the deaf on the ground and batman moving over Gotham, that's what the romantic corner between Pfieffer and Keaton making this movie the best choice for anyone who wants to see the REAL Batman in action. I rate it a 10, would give it more than I could.
