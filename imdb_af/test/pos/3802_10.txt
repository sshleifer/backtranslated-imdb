It must be one of the most wonderful things I've ever seen on film. I don't know if it's as serious as it seems to be, but it doesn't matter. This film is extreme, absolutely wild and surreal. The packaging and marketing just makes it so because you * know * that so much mother has to reprogram her child to accept our reality after checking it out of the video store and expecting something completely different. Look at the road map, for one thing! And where else in America can you see a 10-year-old child swearing as much as he does, and then getting his eye torn out by perverting the rival of Pulp Fiction's Zed? And that food inspector scene is the best! The number of well-known role players in this movie is one of the best things: Sooner, much sooner than you realize, you'll find: "Is it meat bread?" Is this Drew Barrymore? Is it the Holideck doctor of Star Trek: Voyager? Is this the fleet? Is it the sawmill owner of Twin Peaks gas exhaust with engine exhaust? And isn't he from the new Rob Zombie movie? He looks very much like Shrek. I think my favorite scene is in the end, with Phil in a full body. I mean, please, why aren't more movies like these shown in planes? This director has almost nothing but his name higher than Return To Salem's Lot, but he shows true stumbling-man genius in this creation! If you are an intellectual looking for something to pause your evening, I strongly suggest this movie to be happy. This movie's plot is too ridiculous, but think it is from the context: * A son arm that weakens an over aggressive meat loaf, which looks like hell is bent on taking out his anger because he is not accepted in Guns N Roses Don't look over his shoulder and see The Voyager's doctor enters the bar. * Can you imagine what a semi-existent channel surfer that has been active for the past six years will think you're seeing? Now, think about whether you care about meat bread or voyager! Or imagine if you are a Flea fan. Rocky Horror Picture Show fans, this movie features eye-catching music, but the soundtrack is more plasticine than Mad Max 3. What does that mean for you? This is the delayed, reverse Mongolian cousin-sister-mother of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. How about when Gus's sleeve flies back on his arm in an act of cable-access special effects mastercraft quality? When I watched this movie, it was on the cousin of my cousin who watched half of it in the early half of the 1990s in the mid-1990s, and since then I have been obsessed with vague memories, slept three days. It made me laugh! Of course, this is also an anxiety film. The music does not encourage the tension, but it ultimately comes to the point where it has been completely established that the American Sensory Committee has completely missed this movie and absolutely anything can happen to it. Probably Gus will get a corner or eye anytime. as much as camera angles change. I found that I was obsessed with the possibility of the cards coming out of his window at any second. Watch this movie. Awesome!
