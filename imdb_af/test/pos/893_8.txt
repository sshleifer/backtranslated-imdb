The incomparable Laura Gemser appears briefly in an erotic scene of the French "Emmanuelle 2." This wonderful woman has not gone unnoticed, and soon became the lead in this whole new Italian series, where she is the centerpiece; A beautiful photo journalist who travels the world experiences all the mysterious eroticism the world has to offer. In this first installment, Mae Jordan / Emanuelle is sent to Africa to photograph the people as well as the beautiful scenery and wild exotic animals. Just like Sylvia Kristel's character, Emanuelle did not come into herself when it came to being open and comfortable with her own sexuality. This first film is basically about how to become the "Emanuelle" known to most mining movie fans. Filled with beautiful cinematography, beautiful people and a intoxicating 70's of the legendary Nico Fidenco, this one is sure to please. Those who enjoy the more story-driven style of the original French "Emmanuelle" should definitely also like this. The most important story here is an interesting cat and mouse story of a female playboy who realizes that he fell in love with a woman who is the female version of him! Sexy, fun and totally entertaining; a sea opera to be sure, but one with enough skin and common eyecups to entertain the male viewers. For some reason it is the hardest in the series to find DVD. There has never been a legal DVD for this, which is very strange. The bootlegs that sometimes appear online will have to do until someone releases a movie's diamond properly.
