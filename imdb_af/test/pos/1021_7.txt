An enjoyable film, no doubt, and very appealing to both his era and that particular stage in any boy ritual. But I have to say that I read the very positive comments here, I was a little disappointed. The period was captured, but the plot was desperately thin. The whole thing revolves around the most ominous bit in the history of school games. The idea that kwackquack will ever be chosen not only to play one of only three stars but a filander, is ridiculous. And without that, Nada. The subplots had no connection that I could see to the main chart - all could be removed in their entirety without in any way affecting the main story - which certainly indicates a fundamental error. If all your subplots look like a padding, you know a central idea is stretched across its boundaries. Yet it's a benign movie with its heart in the right place, there are some good performances, and you just get the feeling that everyone involved has felt at the final 'cut!' That the good feeling permeates the film. And it must count for something. A defective, really good movie. 7 out of 10.
