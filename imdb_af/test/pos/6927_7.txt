A Ham actor without a penny. Who better than Michael Caine to play such a character? He is completely and completely hilarious, but as in most of Caine's performances, he really does. The movie appears to be a showcase of Dylan Moran and he is wonderful in his double act with Caine. However, this is where the script falls. Moran's impersonations had to be incorporated in a more organic way. They are too much of an act on their own and make the potential plausibility of the plot fly out of the window. Do not worry. Get it if you can find it. There is plenty to make it a pleasant trip.
