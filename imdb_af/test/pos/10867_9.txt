This movie gives Daniel Wu his chance to do a good action movie, but I find Emil Chow's character really good, gutsy but determined to fix. Plus, the chief terrorist, it makes me wonder my revolution, make me wonder if he does it right or bad. <br /> <br /> A movie telling us about Todd, an amnesiac terrorist who is being deceived as a shelter until he learns who he really is. The consequences he makes of his family of terror give him the choice of salvation. <br /> <br /> Purple Storm was one of the best I've seen this year. The movie really comes out when it is filled with tremendous action scenes set up by Stephen Tung Wai, which achieved the best action series in Hong Kong awards. (9/10)
