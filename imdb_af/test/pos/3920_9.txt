probably the best horror movie in 5 years. There are lame remakes, attempts to scare you (when everything they do, you do, walk out of the theater) and movies that just didn't have to be made. but this one is worth it. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because Paris is Hilton in it (but her death scene makes it to me, believe me). <br /> <br /> so here they are. SPOILERS of all the dead scenes in the movie. <br /> <br /> 1. My Favorite Death Picture Ever - Paris Hilton's! After getting her boyfriend Blake to the ground with a knife protruding from his neck, Paige started running. Well, speeding is more respectful. She finds it like a garage with all these cars in it. then (one of) the killers cut her ankle from below (this time she holds a large metal peak) so she drops it and runs and sticks behind this car. the killer picks it up and as she looks through the window, he throws it through the window and shoots through her forehead. I AM NEVER EXPLAINING OR LAYING SO IN MY LIFE. <br /> <br /> 2. Paige's boyfriend Blake gets a knife stuck in his neck and then the killer walks him (while he is on the ground) and pushes it further into his throat .. then he dies. <br /> <br /> 3. Elisha cuthbert (carly) (one of the hottest chicks ever) does not die PHEW, but she ties her lips together, hit the face, and gets a portion of her index finger cut off (yes, I feel as if he is) 4. Carly's twin brother also survives, but not without kicking his ass and a stab wound to the leg. <br /> <br /> 5. Nick's best friend Dalton is thrown off a flight of stairs and then beheaded. his body is dragged and we see his eyes blink. then he is in was covered. <br /> <br /> 6. Wade (Carly's boyfriend) gets his Achilles tendon cut by a massive pair of scissors, and is attacked by the same scissors. He died, but he was in treatment, and on two occasions his skin was accidentally removed and his nasty bloody flesh was revealed. YUMMY. <br /> <br /> so there it is. Definitely WHERE YOUR MONEY.
