You don't have to be a fan of the cartoon show to enjoy this movie. I watched it for the first time when I was nine, a fan of the T.V show, and my parents laughed as hard as I did. This is done in the classic style of Bugs Bunny cartoons of yesterday, and in the light of today's vulgar cartoons, I would think anyone would appreciate a cartoon movie that relies more on "wackiness" then on vulgarity to laugh at some laughs. get.
