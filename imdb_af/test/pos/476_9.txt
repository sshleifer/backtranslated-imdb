The 1980s 'My Dinner with Andre', with Wallace Shawn and Andr√© Gregory, is essentially a world-wide dialogue and how it affects and the spirit can lift. 2005 'You Are Alone' shows how general worldly events can break the soul. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around three main characters. There is Daphne, a pretty teenage student who rages over almost every decision in her life. Then there is the prostitute, or paid escort, Britney, as confident because Daphne is self-aware. What makes them interesting is that they share the same body, if not the same people. Part of the magic of this film takes place in one of the early scenes where Daphne approaches an older hotel room. She stops and is, of course, torn by the decision whether or not it knocks on the door? but it is Britney who slips into the room effortlessly when the door is opened. <br /> <br /> On the other side of the door is Buddy, a middle-aged man with little, if any, personal traits that someone would find appealing. He goes so far as to be confrontational about Britney's chosen career as soon as she enters the room. However, we soon learn that Buddy is Daphne's neighbor and watched over the years as she became a little girl. This makes things difficult for the audience. Is Buddy just a worried neighbor or does he want something else? <br /> <br /> If it's sex that Buddy wants, it's here. Britney loves sex. Her definitions can be Clintonesque, but it doesn't give her enthusiasm. She prefers older men and wears rainbow plastic ties with which her clients are invited. Each color band indicates a specific act she will perform? but exactly what action is not announced until after the band is broken off its wrist and the choice is irrevocably made. <br /> <br /> Britney is or believes she is in charge of every encounter. Even when she is bonded and bound, as she is with one of her regular clients, she puts in front of her arms and body hit by several men, but her legs and pubic area are stripped by a woman in scarlet underwear. The movie's images just appear. <br /> <br /> Buddy's pathetic life is one of acceptance. He lost his wife, his dog, even his fancy teenager's fantasies. It is no coincidence that he had lured Daphne or Britney to this particular hotel room. There is a painting on the wall of a board with only a fish head left. It's a perfect metaphor for Buddy's life; All the good parts are done. So this is where he brought his wife when they were still students, that he took his stand? to regain control over his own life, to make his statement. <br /> <br /> The director of "You Are Alone", Gorman Bechard, knows his craft. The main action in the hotel room serves as a solid anchor for the film, assisted by a multitude of inter-cut scenes that add dimension to the characters, their circumstances and conflicts. <br /> <br /> As the film progresses, Britney asks for Buddy or she needs to get out. He said yes, but she just stroked her underwear. A real prostitute will probably remove all her clothes (get one of the five's). But it's not Buddy being bullied, we're. As the film concludes, we find that there are far more human emotions and motivations in play. A pest does not work unless it really delivers. Britney does, so do 'you are alone'.
