My girlfriend and I saw this movie when it was originally released. The controversy surrounding the original release (teenage nudity, physical intimacy and unwanted pregnancy) were subjects that had never affected our view of the movie. We were close to the same age as Paul and Michelle and experienced many of the same intense and confusing emotions. We were too young to be trapped in the simplistic (times) acting and the twisting (sometimes) emotional twists and turns. This movie spoke to us in a way that an adult love story could never have. I still remember in the movie with my girlfriend and hold her hand as she cries during the tragic (albiet syrup) final scene.
