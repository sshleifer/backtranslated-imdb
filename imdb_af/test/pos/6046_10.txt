Hey there, Army Sgt. I am sorry dude, but being a SGT in the army and being in the army did not qualify the National Guard for commenting on a marine film. You're not a marine and just because you wear a uniform doesn't mean you're related to a Marine. We are simply the best, we have the most difficult training, yes we have big heads about ourselves, but hey when you are the best, you like to support your stuff. I was in the Iraq invasion and in Fallujah. I fought alongside soldiers. You are not qualified to say anything about my Marine Corps. I hate being the one who started the whole time, "which branch is better", but you have no right to say you're competent to judge a Marine movie. Oh yeah ...... we are drill instructors ....... not drilling SGTs. It's the biggest idea that you have no idea what you're talking about. Yes, we no longer prohibit recruits. Tell me, how about someone to make them a better Marine? How will I beat someone make a Marine a better marine? Yes, this is a children's school campus of what I went through. But we are about different times and people. We are the training of people recruiting smarter than our generations. We want smarter recruits, not mean. And whoever is a Marine in the first place has a commitment to being the best that his country has to offer. It doesn't have to strengthen us in Bootcamp. Marines come to Bootcamp who want to be murderers. We do not have to teach them by demoralizing them by imploring and hitting them. At least that's how I feel. And yes, I'm "qualified" to say it. I've been to the battlefield several times and I trained Marines and Recruits who ended up on the battlefield. But then again, what do I know. I was right there, finished, got the t-shirt. SGT of the army ....... get an idea!
