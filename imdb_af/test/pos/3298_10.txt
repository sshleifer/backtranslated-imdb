Had the pleasure of seeing this movie at the Big Bear Film Festival where it won the Public Prize. And I have to say, it was well deserved because Boy Next Door is a very funny short film! The writing is well written and keeps things going. It also has a large current of voltage running through it. You do not know what will happen next, as the main character is trying to realize that his new neighbor cannot be the most ideal person living on him. The jokes are quick and unexpected. The plot keeps us guessing. The dialogue really feels really good. I thought the direction was top-notch and director Travis Davis showed a lot of potential to raise it in the world of studio comedies. Not small praise, he is also the main actor of the film, so he had to work threefold, write, direct and lead. If you get a chance to watch this movie on iTunes, it is worth downloading the download. This will make you laugh aloud a few times. And it's more than most shorts offer these days.
