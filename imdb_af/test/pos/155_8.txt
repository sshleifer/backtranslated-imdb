In my opinion, the vampire "craze" has proved its dignity from such infamous categorization. There were many sub-genre movies from many countries last year. I reviewed a lot and still have a few to discuss. Forgive my indulgence, but since I recognized the trend as a phenomenon (what it is and by chance, it contains my favorite horror stack). I'm going to move a little outside of North America now and I hope to see movies you haven't seen before. <br /> <br /> Of the many effects of Twilight is the creation of "man" and "girl" vampire movies. I hate this sexist categorization, which is the effect of polarizing a whole generation of fans into "sides". I think men tend to hate Stephenie Meyer's work (and his offspring), because they feel a bit of betrayal that an archetype that is always of them is now being freed. Women will be unlikely to enjoy future "neutral" photos, as they grew up with the expectations four times enforced. We need more directors to create vampire films, which can enjoy either gender (uneven) as vampires will survive and remain relevant to the maze. Cue: Thirst This Korean movie is directed by Park Chan-Wook's Oldboy celebrity. There are two ways to analyze it. Whether it depends on gender expectations and is universally pleasing, or it is an onerous mess that does not decide which target audience prefers it and should therefore not be seen by anyone. Don't convince me the movie doesn't have a tendency. The director is a man whose celebrity is action-driven action movies. The protagonist is male and has a passive-aggressive interest in his lover (more on this later). Yet she desires a woman he does not know before and after the mortal life, and his attention is returned. There is a male on this photo, but it is not so unilateral that women could not enjoy it. The same cannot be said of Daybreakers or New Moon. <br /> <br /> The plot follows a Emile Zola novel called Thérèse Raquin, which I didn't read. According to Wikipedia, the novel is about a relationship that develops between a married woman and a single man. He killed her husband during a fishing trip and started dating her. The two of them are unable to have sex because they portray the dead body between them. They are therefore driven to madness, but take care of the woman's stomach. In the novel's conclusion, they try to kill each other, discover each other's plans and commit suicide. <br /> <br /> Now convert this nearly 150-year-old French novel into modern South Korea and you've got Dors. Chan-Wook does not decorate the story enough to elevate it to see. He often ignores many of his own ideas in favor of his inspiration. I think the most memorable parts are when his screws are frightened by story. His use of the mother-in-law as the foil for their bad romance is just perfect. See it. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is originally a religious Christian who becomes a vampire after a faulty blood transfusion following his volunteering for a new medicine. So he becomes the god he once hit. People flock to him and consider him a great healer. OK. It's really cool and could have provided a good basis for its relationship. Yet, this idea is given with a small idea screen time as he turns into a realistic Christ figure who tries to maintain his virtue, although his lifestyle demands that he relinquish it. Instead of confronting the perpetrators, he would rather shed blood from patients with a hospital. Let's continue with the Christian allure. The woman pulls in the vampire man to kill her husband. Her overprotective mother-in-law suffers from a stroke and eventually warns friends of the family of her daughter-in-law (finger claws). The man killed her but relived her. The two of them invite former friends and the woman ruthlessly restricts the people. The man says enough is enough and decides to drive to a beach and forces her to wait for sunrise with him. They both die, but he is for her crimes (and his own, but the film shows her evil more prominently). <br /> <br /> The woman's character is a caricature, and her profession provides an explanation for her behavior. She is a housewife without training, while the man is a priest whose mortal life was limiting. Vampirism increases their properties. She becomes a monster as one can expect from someone without knowledge. He becomes a demigod with a spirit. His life is how atheists see themselves and her life is how religious people see it without divine intervention.
