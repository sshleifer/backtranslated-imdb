This is a movie I watched when I was a young girl and never forgot. It's definitely not the best movie ever made, but there's something very special about not being able to really put my finger on it. I love it. I'm the kind of person who likes everything that has explained me and that's why this movie alone makes me crazy. <br /> <br /> Exactly what / Who is the mysterious witch lady and what is her relationship with Tom? WHY and HOW did he become a water baby ... why was he raised on earth? These are questions like these that only eat with me! I thought if I read the book, I would get answers, but I just read an article that the book from which this story is based is very different. So I guess I'll never know what the author thinks! <br /> <br /> I still love this movie and I recently watched it with my two-year-old cousin. She also loves it, though she insists on calling it "Baby Water" for reasons unknown to me. She loves the part where he jumps in the water and then declares: "I'm clean." (You must understand that my cousin is the cleanest 2 years old in the world!) We watched the scene over and over. <br /> <br /> I'm so happy we can enjoy this movie together! There should be more movies like this. (But how about the gay seahorse ?? !!)
