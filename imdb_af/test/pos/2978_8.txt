This film grabbed me from the beginning, where a lovely teenage girl was shown alone to visit a grave alone, then began playing Elton John's powerful song "Friends" while walking alone through the streets of Paris alone, with wearing a suitcase, almost unaware of the car theft and prostitution going on around her. The whole film is a beautiful, dreamy, romantic collection of young love scenes, holding hands, living in the country, wild horses freely roaming, field species of wildflowers, sunsets, wine grills, evening at the fire place, fun and general innocence. everything on romantic music by Elton John. It's magic. <br /> <br /> Somehow, I missed this movie when I was growing up. I'm sure it would have had a strong impression on me if I had seen it. I remember the radio ad for the movie in 1971, and talked about how it was a special movie with music by Elton John, and with the chorus of the theme song "Friends" playing in the ad ("Makin" see friends for the world ...) but I've never heard of anything else and never saw it until I rented it from a video store 35 years later. By then, it was edited, censored, and all kinds of unhappy people with evil political agendas used all sorts of ugly words to describe the film. What can I say? The world has since become insane. <br /> <br /> The story is that a 14-year-old girl is forced to move in with her cousin in Paris after both her parents die. (It was their grave that she visited in the opening scene.) One day while visiting the zoo alone, they met a 15-year-old boy, they hit it and agreed to meet the next day. The next day, while traveling together, the boy accidentally drove his car into a lake in a freaky solo car accident. It was his father's car. He can't go back to return to his father's anger. The two teenagers start together in the French countryside, along with the mutual background that they hated their lives at home. They settle in an uninhabited cottage, the boy takes strange jobs to support themselves, their alleged friendship becomes romance, the girl becomes pregnant and they have a baby at home successfully. All the time the boy's father tried the police to find his missing son. At the 1-year anniversary of the couple's flight gathering, police finally get the employer's employer through a personal investigation, and are told they can see the boy the next morning when he gets to work. The next morning, the boy was shown to go to his cottage to go to work, with a friend's and wife's farewell, and happy with cartwheels, while the scene froze on his girlfriend blowing away. At least this is how the video version I saw ends. It is an unexpected but prosperous time, apparently depicting the last moments of happiness before the boy is taken back to his parents' home and his happy life with his wife and baby is dashed. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as The story and images, the plot is extremely unrealistic and highly confronted. I think it's better just to enjoy the movie than a youngster's dream-come-true fantasy and not to analyze it anymore, because all logic and credibility fall apart quickly when the story is explored in depth. Why would a fully furnished and filled cottage be left unattended with the door unlocked and for a full year without notice? What did they plan to do when the owners returned? Why would a girl trust a motif enough to get pregnant? Didn't they think it was unethical to use other people's homes and food? How can they ever hope to get dental care or other emergency medical attention while living outside the community? How can the boy have a car crash on a road without collision and no other cars? Where does the wild horse run freely in civilization? How is it that a teenage man would not have sex as the primary thing when he picks up a girl at a zoo? (The Elton John songs don't fit.) Why should they get out of bed when they sleep outside at night when it gets cold? And so on. The scenes of wild horses are encouraged to appeal to girls, just like the unrealistic theme of "friendship for romance" and all the backwashing and tickling scenes with their predictable outcomes, the flow of flower fields to each other, the haze filters, the screens shot through wild flowers in the foreground, the baby ducks, and so on. It works but it is definitely confronted. <br /> <br /> However, it's a film about youth and freedom, and the ideal hasn't changed since the 1970s. Young people are still being treated as possessions or lost pets recovered by the police today, rather than being treated as adults, who have the same needs of romantic love and freedom as the adult world and the ability to be responsible when given. freedom. Therefore, the message is universal. It's clear why a successor wouldn't work: this story is about a magical, year-long postponement of the real world. Such a situation could never be prolonged indefinitely, assuming that it would even happen in the first place, and a story about real life after that would be the magical appeal of such an unreal existence of existence. missing. I really hope no teenagers have taken the film seriously enough to try such a stupid stunt. But I hope equally well that teenagers who have been impressed by this movie in the 1970s have learned something and since then have been trying to make such a magical world a more feasible reality for others, instead of to continue the different hatred and repressions of society. especially on their own children.
