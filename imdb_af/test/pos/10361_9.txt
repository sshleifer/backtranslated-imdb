This movie definitely shows something and sketch lightly what happens in most institutions today and shows how one man only succeeds in getting things done with the help of her newspaper. Her editor has full faith in her and does not publish anything important because it would hurt her friend ... and when it was the right time, she took the necessary action. <br /> <br /> In general, the movie received a score of 9 because it has everything, I mean it keeps you entertained, and they also did very well, for a TV movie, which is really high quality, which earns a lot of credit.
