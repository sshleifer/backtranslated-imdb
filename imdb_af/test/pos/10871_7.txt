Martino, a young teacher on the island of Elba, was formed by Maestro Fontanelli, an excellent educator, to be his own husband and to say what he thinks, something that gets him into trouble at school where we first found him meet because he is busy with revolutionary ideals. The island is in a madness because of the arrival of one of the most influential men in the European history of the 19th century. Napoleon comes after his exile, not exactly a highlight of his life. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Martino is chosen to forget Napoleon who writes his memoirs and needs help for his own project. The young man comes from a seafaring family. His brother and sister want him to go on a commercial expedition, but Martino decided his place was in Elba because he would try to kill Napoleon. Less is being disregarded after his mentor, Fontanelli, was tried for treason and condemned to be fired by a firearm. <br /> <br /> Martino finds comfort with the much older Baroness Emilia, a beautiful woman. In his own interaction with the deposed emperor, another kind of man occurs. Napoleon is considered a more human person who really enjoys Martino's company, and does not suspect the young man's own plans. Unfortunately, Martino can't put his design into action, as Napoleon has other plans in mind. <br /> <br /> Paolo Virzi, Caterina va in citta's director, shows why his early promise is still there. Mr. Virzi also worked with the script, based on a novel by Ernesto Ferrero. The director shows that he is so good at intimate drama, as well as at this kind of spectacle. Alessandro Pesci, the film maker, does an excellent job with the images he could get. <br /> <br /> Elio Germano, a young Italian actor, is the best in the movie. He is playing against more experienced players, but he manages us to convince him that he is the idealistic youth who is trying to find justice on what he sees as a noble cause. The great Daniel Auteuil is a more subdued Napoleon than one would expect from someone's interpretation of this greater than the life-man. Monica Belucci is Martino's love interest, but she has little to do. Omero Antonutti plays Fontanelli.
