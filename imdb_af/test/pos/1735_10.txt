2005 will be in "Dr.Who" history as the most incredible year. Everything seems to click; a first-class new doctor and companion, big audiences (10 million for the first episode and Christmas specialist), great awards, critical praise and the idiots who spent years at the Daleks' apparent inability to negotiate stairs swore. But then Christopher Eccleston dropped a bombshell and just sat down after one series. It seems the honeymoon was over. Fortunately, the public apparently embraced his successor, the excellent David Tennant. In addition, the show boasts fine S.F.X, such as the spacecraft crashing into 'Big Ben' in 'Aliens Of London' and wonderful story lines like 'Tooth & Claw', 'Army Of Ghosts / Doomsday'. The new 'Dr.Who' is basically the same as the old one, just updated for the 21st century. Some supporters accused Russell T.Davies of destroying the show. They have to remember that there was no show for sixteen years until he got together.
