Diora Baird is quite hot like hell in this movie. But really all the characters are incredibly nice to watch. <br /> <br /> (MINOR SPOILERS) As usual, the main character, B, is the healthy one of the bunch. B has this crazy idea of ​​drafting his own college when he is rejected from all the colleges he is applying for. He is known for making fake IDs. Such an acceptance letter is no problem. <br /> <br /> Because B's dad is a hard @ $ and suspect of this university he has never heard, B gets his friend Sherman to design a website for the university. Sherman has been accepted into a large college and is afraid that he will be arrested for fraud. He is very quick with witty lines, but his mistake is that he is too socially accepted. <br /> <br /> Glen, Hands and Rory are the three stooges following B. Glen has a zero on his SATs and has no thought process. He is constantly advocating kings, but he is very good at smoothing, which somehow gets very hot girls. Hande was a good soccer player who did not receive the bursary on which he acted, and turned to craft to cover his lack of athletics. Rory was preparing to go to Yale for the 1st grade and was not accepted. She spends her time meditating. <br /> <br /> Uncle Ben was my favorite character. Photo Lewis Black plays himself. If you have no reason to see this movie, see Lewis Black and Jonah Hill. They are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Monica is a B's love interest. As most of these stories go, she's more popular than him and doesn't even see him halfway through the movie. Unlike many other stories, B, she actually gets her and keeps her to the end. Monica is actually a good character, but of course she is mainly there for B to adore. <br /> <br /> There are more supportive students at the established college who are fun to watch. A.D.D. His name is self-explanatory, and funny enough he ends up in the meditation class. Kiki is a hot ex-stripper who falls over heels for a chance to go to school and finally gets a good fortune at Glen. Maurice is an ex-military idiot who takes his G.I. account and want to study rock n 'roll in college. The final man is just known as Freaky Student, who thinks he can inflate things with his mind. You who have little faith in him wait until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, the villains are the Dean of an opposing university, his university's student body president, the president's friend, and their circle of friends. <br /> <br /> Every character loves. I believe this movie has a good plot and is well done, despite what many people say. Even thought the overall story is predictable, the characters keep you guessing and making the movie good. Check out this movie. I give it 9 out of 10.
