Regarding the Christian movie, it is typical. To try a mega budget, they try their best. Sometimes they are short, sometimes the point strikes. This one has almost hit, great acting can only carry a movie so far. A combination of H.P. Lovecraft, and Frank Peretti was a good idea. All that was needed was better storytelling and better character development to make it a great movie. The footage is not so bad, but also smart to keep the demons until the last few minutes have kept the tension. at a good pace. Can be used from a better end. Not a bad idea with terrorists, but experiments go wrong. Much better than typical Hollywood treatment about the demonic realm. Perhaps someone will eventually do "This present darkness" as a movie.
