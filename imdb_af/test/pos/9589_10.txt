OK ... time for a little rant I think. This was two years ago, as I made my original comment with this top-rated footy comedy ..... and the damn thing hasn't made it to video or DVD (or even for that matter telly repeat!!) !!!!! <br /> <br /> Does anyone know why? Is there a BBC style error where the original copy has been deleted / deleted / deleted? <br /> <br /> Listen to your fate in control of ITV - beat it now on DVD! Do you even know how funny this program was? It makes "Mike Bassett" look as bad as the current trouser track team. <br /> <br /> Rant over. For the moment.
