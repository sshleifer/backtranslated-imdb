Tourist Trap (1979) is an entertaining horror movie of the late 70's. The movie is about a lot of young friends who are stranded on an old abandoned track by a dirty old waxwork museum. <br /> <br /> The owner of The Museum looks like a strange but innocent old man, but things take a very nasty turn when young group members are murdered, who is responsible for the murders, is it old man Slausen or is it his collection of fiery mannequins who looks alive and hungry for blood !!!! This movie was good stuff, it was fast-paced, the performances were very good from the actors / actresses (Tanya Roberts was very sexy) and the movie was never boring, and as I said, it had some very creepy scenes , so be prepared to hide under the lids! Definitely recommended to horror movie / ghost story fans! I give this movie a highly respectable 7.2 out of 10.
