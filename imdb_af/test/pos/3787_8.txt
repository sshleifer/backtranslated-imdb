SPOILERS UNDER <br /> <br /> A dog's life was especially noticeable for his excellent comic timing. In Charlie Chaplin's other 1918 movie, Shoulder Arms, the silent movie genius focuses on a completely different kind of humor. His war committee specializes in surreal, exaggerated pieces in which Chaplin demonstrates unprecedented creativity and mastery of composition. When the soldier's bunker is flooded, the water level reaches just the right height so that Chaplin can best perform his gags. In a later scene, the soldier pulls up like a tree, a disguise that knows Chaplin's much greater ingenuity and goofiness. Of course, when the enemy discovers his rage, the soldier is frolicking straight to the forest. The following chase is a visual wonder: Chaplin not only hides the soldier of the Germans, but he also uses the forest to mask the soldier of the audience so that the camouflaged soldier in the center of the frame is blocked, but on one somehow remain invisible. All the time we thought our little hero pulled a fast one on the German army; To our delight, the joke is also on us. <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
