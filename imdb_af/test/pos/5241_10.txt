What an error for stylized dialogue and / or dismissal as archetype characterization represents exactly how people talked, lived, and before World War II, let alone in what years the "Big Trail" represents film. <br /> <br /> The movie drove me away, the first time I saw it this year. Reading the boards here helped me understand why it missed the box office and why film people had the benefit of Wayne in B Westerns for another ten years. Wayne was in my opinion better in "The Big Trail" and the years of Bs as most of his stars turned to 1939 with Ford's incredible cavalry trilogy, True Grit and The Shootist, which is a great exception. <br /> </ p> What a pity the boat missed out on in 1930. If this movie hit, we could enjoy more movies with more realism and less hokum. It is, in my opinion, not only one of the most beautiful westerners ever filmed with an accurate dialogue and accurate character realization, but among the best portrayals of any part of any kind ever placed on film. <br /> <br /> It still takes me away. Especially the dialogue and accurate characterization of types that simply no longer exist. Some celebrate the surface homogenization of our culture that conceals the greatest cultural decline (in "people like us" and "people like them") and political divisions (corporatists towards mainstream experts) in American history, but to me "The Big Trail". represents a time when our surface differences were more obvious, but among them, most people wanted to work out the country's failures and most people wanted to build a good culture and a great nation. <br /> <br /> "The Big Trail" is an epic of the crucible in the direction of the American Dream, certainly the best movie on the road I've ever seen, that subject has ever been filmed.
