I only saw this movie in a preview and before reading my comment, you should know that it is very subjective because I like Techno, Trance, Club, House and Music. <br /> <br /> The movie is about Carl, whose brother Jason (or whatever his name was) died in an accident: he fell off a roof, "drunk". Carl meets his brother's friend Sunny and the two of them have stripped a kind of private investigation about Jason's death and Carl becomes involved with Jason's former life filled with clubs and drugs. The film itself, seen from an artistic point of view, is nothing more than a great hope. The plot is predictable, all the characters are extremely clicked and two-dimensional (stupid boy from a small town, young pretty innocent girl, big bad drug art ... the list is endless) and most of the plays like the plot are just not credible. Matthew Rhys's performance of the stupid boy comes to London and suddenly takes drugs from people he doesn't even know doesn't look very credible, unlike his female counterpart Sunny, who is run by Sienna Guillory, whose behavior is more realistic for the spectator looks. Nothing but a joke was Tim Curry's performance of the drug queen Damian: a foolish caricature, too eeeevil and just too ridiculous to be true. <br /> <br /> BUT: If you like club music like the selected songs are just brilliant, if you enjoy a simple love story with a lovely girl like Sunny (yes, I confess, I lost my heart ;). It makes my comments even more subjective, I think) with some <br /> <br /> Anyone else: FORGET .... IT! <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (objective view) <br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 (my personal view and also my final vote)
