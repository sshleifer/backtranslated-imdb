I saw it because I have friends in Ukraine. but the movie surprised me as I expected to be a perfect combination of abdominoplasty (Alex's strange use of English) situational comedy and hardship boundaries. I loved the series. it made me come in to an old car and hit the road to the ukraine. alex (hutz) plays his guide perfectly and offers a great counterpoint to elijah woods' poker face. the film shows the positive side of humanity when ppl of different cultures can bind and do the right thing when they experience the sincerity of the situation, even when they enter it with preconceptions and prejudices and how it can open doorways deeply buried memories. there is a lot in this movie.
