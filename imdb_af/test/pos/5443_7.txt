This movie was advertised as a comedy, but was much more serious than the trailers did. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but expect more laughter. Great performances by Robin Williams and Laura Linney. View, but don't expect to roll on the floor. The movie surprised me and wondered if Robin Williams' character was a real person running for president. Will we choose a comedian? Unfortunately, I doubt it. That kind of strong honesty is something that is lacking today. This is a movie I will add to my DVD library as soon as it comes to DVD. That movie is the heart.
