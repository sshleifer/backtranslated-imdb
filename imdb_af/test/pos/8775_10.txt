I really loved watching this movie. I think it's a brilliant, understated Alfred Hitchcock movie. Everyone is familiar with the well-known image of the Statue of Liberty, but there is still a very good film. Robert Cummings is wonderful in what I consider to be his greatest role, and beautiful Priscilla Lane shows that she also has a lot of talent. But I think Norman Lloyd gives the best performance. His character, Fry, is so evil and unholy. Even if he is not long, the movie will not be without him. <br /> <br /> "Saboteur" is a good movie to see every Hitchcock fan. I give it a 10 out of 10 !!
