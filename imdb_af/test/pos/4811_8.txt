I recently saw An zhan. Not because it was a Hong Kong movie, but because I was looking for a change to the films produced here in the US. In my humble opinion, I believe the movie can easily compete against the action thrillers produced here, except for the traditional idiocine racies of Hong Kong film. The one who still bothered me was the chief inspector's character. I still don't understand why there should be a complete-idiot-comic-relief-type character, even in the serious movies coming from Hong Kong, but I can live by that if the movie is so good. The characters are believable, even if the situations are involved. The story is faster and really sucks you in it. The right cincher scenes for me were the two bus rides taking the thief character. Overall, a very solid film.
