Why don't critics like this movie ?? I don't get it. This is easily my favorite Clive Barker effort. "Hellraiser" is a bit too rough around the edges (the movie just leaves that stupid house) and lets see it, "Lord of Illusions" doesn't move at all !!! For years I loved Barker's writing, especially his "Books of Blood". Terrifically entertaining. He has an evil side for him that is quite different from a Stephen King. He freely mixes his own homosexuality and strange religious and occult elements. I love love love, love it. But I also realize that Barker is so much a dark fantasy writer, as he is a horror writer. And fantasy is just not my pocket. Put me right to sleep. Always have. I also think Barker works best with short stories. His novels tend to wander a bit. This was my experience when I tried to read the "Damnation Game". It started well. Then I thought 100 pages "where is it going?" for it was not everywhere here. <br /> <br /> I read "Cabal" (the book Nightbreed was based on) and thought it was good. I'm especially like the effect on Decker's character. The way the mask spoke to him and controlled him. I like the way Barker just offers it. Black and white. There it is. He gives it a simplicity that is attractive and credible. When asked why Decker killed, he simply said: "Because I like it." Probably something Jeffrey Dahmer said at some point. <br /> <br /> But I liked the movie Nightbreed better than Cabal. I adore the visual attention to detail that Barker gives to his films. REACH IT. I think it's just beautiful. Lord of Illusions also had these things. Some of the drawings in the beginning, during the Night Broad Credit Series. It's like a whole vocabulary Barker just dreamed for the Nightbreed world. I would be curious to know how much his design was pure. I know he is an AMAZING artist who has his own style and language as an artist. <br /> <br /> Nightbreed is also (according to me) BArker's most entertaining movie. It moves very fast. Well edited. It does not bear like Lord of Illusions, but a little. Very fast. Everything in it is just perfect. It also works as a fantastic and scary movie. The things with the killer in the beginning killing the family and later making the old man in the shop painful are very scary things. The mask is frightening. I would like to know if Barker also designed it. It's not just a hokey Jason or "Scream" type mask. Something about this is really worrying. <br /> <br /> Anyway, this is a good movie. Definitely determine it if you haven't seen it. Highly recommended. One of my favorite horror movies of all time. In my opinion, Clive BArker's best. It's frightening and violent, be warned
