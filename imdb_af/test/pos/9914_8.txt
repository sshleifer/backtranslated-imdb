I sympathize with the fate of the first man, Schmitter, we saw killed in this episode. He reminded me of the tension associated with a lonely security guard somewhere - the kind of work I did briefly 20 years ago. Of course, I was never in danger of being burned, as the colony chief (Lynch) likes to describe. The monster in the dark here, killing members of a deep mining colony, creates a frightening impression in the first act. We don't really see it in the early scenes and, as many of us realize, the best monsters are sometimes left to the imagination. "Big and shabby" is one pronounced description, but it looks like a big, lumpy pepperoni pizza that shines on the ground like a silicone puppet - limiting the show's budget. It also shows in the latest carpet painting, known for Trek fans, the only way to transfer a long shot of mining operations. <br /> <br /> But the whole theme of this episode is about what's inside, rather than outward appearance, anyway. Certainly, this Horta, a new-found silicon-based life form, looks like a sensible monster at first glance. Thanks to Spock's telepathic ability (probably the best use of a Vulcan mind for plot purposes), we learn it is a highly intelligent, even sophisticated creature. In addition to Spock's instrumental use of his talent, McCoy recovers his usual medical routine, which resembles a rock or asbestos being. He also gets one of his best-known lines: "I'm a doctor, not a brick!" I found it very noticeable in his scene where he fears in his success, though he does not allow Kirk to share his enthusiasm - Kirk's busy organizational results. The episode throws unexpected turns in character and motivation at the audience as the story progresses; Spock champions have the need to keep this discovered life possible, as Kirk takes his usual standpoint to prevent the death of red-breasted (no half-measures, as in "The Man Trap"). But later it is Kirk who for some reason refrains from exploding an explosion, as if the heat of the hunt has turned and he had time to reflect on Spock's point (I believe it was during this episode filming that Shatner learned that his father was dead. Uncharacteristic for most of the first season, it has a happy ending. The conflict arises from the needs of basic capitalism, such as adherence to standard quotas, to the protection of the natural environment and its inhabitants - a space-age version to protect the owls of modern-day tractors. Somehow, despite many murders and a feeling that everything can go to hell at any moment, with one excited phaser, Kirk and Spock can mediate an agreement that satisfies everyone. I think people and silicates are more reasonable in the 23rd century.
