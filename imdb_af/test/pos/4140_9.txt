This film sets the standard for all rocky bopies to follow. This has been achieved by the energetic performances of the leaders, the steadiness of the camera work (avoiding rock-video cliches actually invented for the Beatles in their first two films), rigorous editing, and a non-judgmental representation of the star as a person rather than a symbol or god (or demon). Yes, there are small holes in the plot, and casual details that are a bit unnecessary, and there will always be a debate between families of those who are personally involved in details. But the issue here, as in the very recent "I run the line" or Carpenter's famous TV Elvis biopies of the same era, is whether the artist's life in his time and place as a catalyst for the ideas of fans and appreciation are manifested in the show, and this is clearly the case here. We got away from this movie, and not just how Buddy Holly became a star, but why. I don't see what else one wants from the movie.
