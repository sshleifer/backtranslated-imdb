It's still one of John Travolta's "coming back" movies, and if he continues with characters and movies like this one, she'll get stuck back. <br /> <br /> It's so nice ... sickly, so if you're not in the romance comedy scene. If you are, it's one innovative RomCom. Every performance (including that of Skippy the Dog) was beautiful, without much more than a trace of the indifference found in "Dogma". (Though, like movies, I loved Dogma!) <br /> <br /> Travolta isn't nearly as bitter in his performance as the previews will make you believe. He is an angel and if you consider yourself reading well, you understand that angels were far from perfect. So you won't be insulted by this movie. Even those who are excessively sensitive to such things should not be insulted by this work, as Nora has largely gone to ensure that it was the least abrasive given the subject. <br /> <br /> I love this one and keep it more every time I see it. It is beautiful and sweet, engaging and engaging. <br /> <br /> It's a 7.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
