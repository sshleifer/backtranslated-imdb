Let me first say I am a huge fan of the original series Lonesome Dove and the book on which it is based. I watched this sequel for a better 10 years because of the bad reviews I heard about it. If Tommy Lee Jones Capt. Call played, I didn't see the point. If Larry McMurtry wasn't involved, why should I care? How wrong I was. <br /> <br /> In many ways, this is a worthy successor to Lonesome Dove, perhaps even more so than the dark mood of Streets Of Laredo. The story, acting, production, filmmaking are all top notch. Of course, the writing is not as colorful as Lonesome Dove, but it has moments. And to my surprise, there are some Lonesome Done in this series; The relationship between Julie and Clara, completely dismissed in the prequel, is almost identical to the book, a welcome surprise. The story is not all roses, it also has surprises. By far the biggest surprise is Jon Voight's interpretation of Capt. Call. While not a direct copy of Tommy Lee Jones, he is both faithful and unique to Voight's credit. The cast is fantastic across the board, and I don't think Rick Schroeder did a better job of acting than in this series. Oliver Reed puts the show into practice here, he is wonderful in a role that gives you his character as much as you hate him. <br /> <br /> It is worth seeing if you are not due to bad criticism, especially that the DVD is so affordable (I set the 2-disc for $ 10.99, you can find it probably cheaper). It is by no means the disappointment that Dead Man's Walk turned out (well, it was for me). And MCMurtry was involved with that one!
