E. Elias Merhige's existential experiment in perseverance is definitely one hell of a boring watch. It's like Alexander de Large was forced to look in a Clockwork Orange. But, despite how immovable this movie really is, it's a success. <br /> <br /> If you read it and haven't seen the movie, then it's too late. For me, the payout (after 3 separate views with lots of breaks between your mind) was the list of characters * to * the story was told. This is when the simple message goes home. But I wonder if Merhige was able to tell a 5-minute story in about 30, instead of 78. <br /> <br /> But as the role-play of credits prominently appears on the cover for this movie, the cat is already out of the box and you will only appreciate this movie if you make the existential movie of the early 20th century appreciated. Even then you can pull a piece. <br /> <br /> 4/10 (but I recommend Merhige for an artwork, even if it's not available)
