As soon as you come across Nic Cage to play an Italian soldier who likes opera and believes in love, not war, you can relax and enjoy this beautiful movie. It can be used as an advertisement for tourism in the Mediterranean. John Hurt is wonderful and Penelope Cruz is not bad, as you would expect. The character of Christian Bale is somewhat one-dimensional. That is a shame. <br /> <br /> The main drawback of this movie is the adaptation of the book. After telling the differences between the book and the film plots, I feel cheated from a much better and more convincing story.
