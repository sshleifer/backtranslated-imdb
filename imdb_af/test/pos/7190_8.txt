I don't know about the English version of this movie, but the Norwegian translation is the funniest movie I've seen in many years. The characters say so many funny things and make so many strange references to current events that I am amazed that they still had more options, such as the architect who can never properly name the wizard Miraculix. These are things like Malcom (i) X and "foreign", which is Norwegian for foreign affairs. <br /> <br /> Like the word "foreign", many of the translations have no meaning in English, and probably not in French either, so the translators must have made their own jokes and done so well. . Of course, they have a very good foundation to build on, with a movie that is just comic from start to finish! <br /> <br /> Recommended in all languages ​​with a good translation!
