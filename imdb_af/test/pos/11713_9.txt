In short, if you want to see Burt Reynolds' best movies, then it should be included. If you don't like Burt, you can still keep it that way. If you like Burt, it may be one of your favorite movies of all time! Getting out of Atlanta hits it home, but it's also nice to see a cop / action / drama that takes place elsewhere than NY City, Chicago, Miami or LA. The movie is funny on points with a good plot and good performances of a good supporting role (every character is actually and the bad guys are not so one-sided, they are really well thought out). A beautiful, rogue romance in the 2nd half and it has some good old fashion shoots and fist battles (no CGI thanks, really!) <br /> <br /> If Clint Eastwood made his best impression of A Burt Reynolds movie with "Any Way But Loose" & "Any Which Way You Can" Burt then responded with his best Clint-type flick, and it'll be fine!
