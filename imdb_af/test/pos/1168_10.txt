We usually think of the British as the experts in delivering great adventure from the imperial age, such as the Venerals (1939) and Zulu, simply because the imperial age was largely British. Here, in the wind and the lion, we see a wonderful version of America's own imperial century. <br /> <br /> America's projection of power under Teddy Roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional story of the kidnapped girl who, despite her gentility, is being beaten by the rough, masculine nobility of her prisoner, who turn is disarmed by her beauty and mockery. (Politically correct gigs eager to see some "indigenous" peoples or cultures can be assured that the way Arabs and Muslims are portrayed here is much flatter than the way their modern counterparts portray themselves at the current world stage .) What makes this story different from the tremendous production values ​​- flawless photography, compilation and editing - the fantastic deciding thing - the undervalued Brian Keith plays a bully Teddy - and a lively history. <br /> <br /> Although the wind and the lion are largely told By the eyes of the boy, every family member can identify with one of the characters, whether it is Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's fiery heroine, John Huston fiery John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spies, radiant, relentless, lazy lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick". There is a transcendent scene at the end when the little boy is swept away symbolically by the dotted moor on his white red. It's a great adventure at its best.
