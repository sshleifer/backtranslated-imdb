This movie was incredible. I was in the tears at the end of the movie. Okay, I know the play sucks, but that's not important. The message came loud and clear about God's love for us and Jesus' sacrifice. The film was realistic and showed real human feelings whether it showed Pete's anger at the blonde girl's slashes or the guy who asked questions. But it also showed the joy that comes from a true relationship with Christ. The cars were great and the actors were very hot and it attracted my eye. But what I like most about this movie was the clear Gospel message. The mother and pastor supported Ben in his new walk with Christ and tried to be a divine example to others. Nicky D showed that no matter if you have the whole world, without Christ, no matter what. Nina showed how a misguided but good person can easily miss the point. I loved this movie and think it would bring many teenagers to Christ.
