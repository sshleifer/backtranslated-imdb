A very credible and disturbing film depicting the effects of war on the general public, Shame gives us a different understanding of oh Ingmar Bergman's beliefs. The absence of color and sound (as in a soundtrack) helps to give the film a more realistic feel. There is no soft or hard lighting or a variety of camera angles to give the story a beautiful or dramatic effect. Everything is portrayed very simply, as it will actually be. Sometimes the storyline was confusing, but perhaps to give the characters' mood? how they now know what is happening or why. The simplicity of the movie made it a bit boring, but I could understand how the director tried not to enchant the story and the points. He portrayed the harsh and disturbing events and consequences of the war. Initially, the characters were introduced and displayed as content with the lighter settings and very long, stretched shots. When they suddenly fell, they were much darker and quieter with less intimate shots. Bergman has done a good job of allowing us to be consumed by the war himself and to give an image of it that addresses the war so adequately. Although the storyline itself was not too impressive, the content of the film was.
