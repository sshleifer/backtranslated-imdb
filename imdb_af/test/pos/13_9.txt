I work at a kiosk and every Thursday night we have an employee's performance of one movie coming out the next day ... Today it was The Guardian. I saw the trailers and the ads and never expected much from it, and in no way did I really expect to see this movie. Well, this movie is much more than I thought. It was a great story first of all. Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Costner did incredible plays in this movie. To be a big fan of That 70's Show, I always thought of Kutcher, like anyone except Kelso despite the great acting he did in The Butterfly Effect. But after watching this movie, I think I can finally see him seriously. <br /> <br /> It was also a great tribute to the unsung heroes of the American Coast Guard.
