For those looking for the crazy stunts that typified a Harold Lloyd quiet comedy, it's not the movie for you. What the Cat's-Paw gives is an interesting and atypical character for Lloyd trying to establish him. <br /> <br /> For me, the closest movie comparison to Lloyd's character is that of Peter Sellers in Being There. For all the education that Lloyd received in dealing with the world, he could also be educated in isolation as Sellers. <br /> <br /> But where he was educated, he was a missionary's child in China and I don't know how much Christianity he and his family were able to teach the Chinese, but young Harold did the wisdom from the Chinese philosopher Lin Po who he continually quotes as a fortune cookie aphorism. As it turns out, Lin Po seems to be a wise man. <br /> <br /> Anyway, Lloyd's father, Samuel S. Hinds, decided his son needed training in the modern world of the 20th century America and sent him back to being the guest of the pastor's pastor. which sponsors the mission. The pastor there is the perennial candidate of Stockport's 'reform' movement. But now Lloyd comes in and the pastor dies. <br /> <br /> Now the reform movement is a sham and the pastor is a patsy of the political bosses who need a scatter opponent in every election. They decide Lloyd can only be better than the guy who's just dead. <br /> <br /> Of course, as it goes into these types of movies, the patsy doesn't seem to be so easy to imagine. In fact, Lloyd constantly quoted to Lin Po. The way Charlie Chan rejected wisdom proved the adversary of the villains running Stockport. In addition, Lloyd gets the admiration of Una Merkel, as a cynical woman as Jean Arthur, in Mr. Deeds and Mr. Smith. <br /> <br /> The Cat's Paw is still a great political satire, but Harold Lloyd didn't set as big as a comedy name. A good role player has been selected by director Sam Taylor by George Barbier who plays a political boss who discovers Lloyd and has actually proven that he has a series of honesty in him.
