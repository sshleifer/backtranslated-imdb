It's simply a good ole fashion western .. not too complex or long. It does not deceive him by thinking that it was made, but for entertainment. Yet it is one of the westerns that you can see and do once without returning. It features former partners Randolph Scott and Glenn Ford, whose friendship is strong despite the fact that Ford's Cheyenne Rogers was part of bank robberies (he even steals Scott's Sheriff Steve Upton's horse without knowing his good friend for whom he is busy). In the Red Valley, Upton was scrutinized for a bank robbery that ended with several dead. Claire Trvor portrays Countess Maletta, a friend of Cheyenne, who gives him and his girlfriend 'Nitro' (Guinn 'Big Boy' Williams) a place to stay for the moment. Cheyenne wants to go straight, but finds it difficult when Jack Lester (Bernard Nedell) and his bad bush want to rob the Red Valley bank. It's actually Jack who is behind the killings, but Cheyenne's turbulent past is hard to get away with. He and Nitro will be charged with the murders they didn't commit (the robbery was one Cheyenne didn't commit) and it would be Upton to somehow save before Lester gets away with murder. There are subplots that include the fact that Cheyenne fell in love with Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes; the irony of the story is that Alison's father, Uncle Willie, is actually in cahoots with Banker Stanley Clanton (Porter Hall) in a planned union theft with Lester to steal the village of Red Valley). Will Upton Uncle Willie and Banker Clanton expose the treacherous scheme? Will Uncle Willie go in without his conscience always bothering him? This movie has a great barroom noise and a dandy of a climatic shootout. Columbia couldn't have chosen a better genre to start the color process, as this movie has spectacular mountainous shots than men's riding and driving. Don't expect your socks to blow off, but the movie is simple and well-sounded.
