I saw this movie as part of the Midnite Madness on Sitges. In the 18th century of England, the plot covers the life of Arthur Blake from his first outing as a pupil-tomb robber to his final confession on the eve of his performance. <br /> <br /> The plot moves through a series of misadventures involving Arthur and his partner in various indifferent characters and bizarre situations. <br /> <br /> The first thing that strikes you about this movie is how accurately they have managed to capture the appearance of the Hammer era horrors, the atmosphere is set <br /> <br /> For a movie titled I sell the dead, I expected the emphasis would be mainly on horror? Don't get me wrong. There are some brand new moments and gores, but the tone is many comedies, driven by the situations the characters get into and their dialogue. The closest comparison to the screens between the two leaders (Larry Fessenden and Dominic Monaghan) is the character interaction seen in classic English comedies Only Fools and Horses, the Two Ronnies and Morecambe and Wise. <br /> <br /> The play is strong and the cast of many famous faces in Ron Perlman and Angus Scrimm highlights the movie above many of the others in Sitges. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie offers something very different from the current crop of mainstream horror and will leave a smile on your face.
