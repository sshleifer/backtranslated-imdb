I admit that I am in the awe of the Sea and spent a number of years in the Navy, so I'm somewhat biased on this one. I missed this documentary when it first came out, but several people bought it to buy it on DVD this Christmas (2002) and I got it! Some of the movie is incredible and I have a lot of respect for those who make this kind of documentary program, to see 200 tons of blue whales by sea, is an incredible sight, they looked like submarines. I like the level of information and facts conveyed by the narrative, it's just right, I don't want to know a load of science, just some of the basic things, to see that these things are for most people enough. The BBC has the ability to put things right for the intended audience. <br /> <br /> A very good documentary, top with 'The World at War for me', the DVD is of excellent quality. If I had a slight criticism, it would be the clear added sound effects here and there, I think they detract from some of the screens. But well done to the BBC and Discovery.
