It is a wonderful successor to the award-winning Lonesome Dove miniseries in the 1980s. This follow-up might be better than the original one. It's definitely more family-friendly. The language is more muted. There is a lot of violence and one particular scene with Cherokee Jack is particularly horrible. But overall a good movie. The acting is wonderful. William Peterson is fantastic. Such a great dramatic actor with a quick sense of humor and comic timing. Jon Voight fills in Tommy Lee Jones' shoes as Captain Call. Ricky Shroder gives a great sadness to the young boy who grew up with no family to claim him. Highly recommended.
