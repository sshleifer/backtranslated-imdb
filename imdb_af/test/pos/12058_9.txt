Certainly not a good performance, but better than most other sitcoms out there. This is reminiscent of performances like Married Met Children and Roseanne, as they go to places that are not traditionally treated in sitcoms. It is sometimes funny, even if you ignore the song tracks, but not screaming. <br /> <br /> Some of the characters are pretty funny (the gay friend) and some of the other add-ons. It is also one of the few shows where the characters soliloquy (sorry for the killing spelling) are actually effective and funny. <br /> <br /> Is this an All in the Family or Seinfeld type show? Absolutely not. However, it's definitely better than a show like 'Til Deat' (probably the worst TV show of any type right now). Oh, and the mother is not too bad and the Hilary character is a little hottie.
