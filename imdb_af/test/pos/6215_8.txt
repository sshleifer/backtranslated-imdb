In the spirit of the Great Space Coaster, but a few years earlier. <br /> <br /> Hot Fudge was one of the psychedelic kid's shows I grew up in. Seymour was a large, fuzzy, green puppet, with a central smile of enormous teeth that almost divided his head. I remember him wearing a variety of Elton John shades. <br /> <br /> He played a piano and watched a Jesus in a white tux beside him. They will have a moral discussion and then make a song about it. <br /> <br /> Do not remember much different from the opening stamp, Seymour and the Hippie. <br /> <br /> No one else knows. I grew up in Jersey, so if it was manufactured in Detroit like a previous post, it wasn't just local. Seymour reminded me a lot of Sherlock the squirrel of the Magic Garden (another psychedelic kid's program or there was ever one.) People always talk about LSD's effects of music and movies of the 70's, but it seems as if childhood authors also get a dose . .
