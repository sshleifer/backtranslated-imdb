I recently rented Twister, a movie I watched on TV a few years ago and it grew out of date; I have laughed aloud several times and as strange as all these people, by the end I care a lot about them. It's the kind of little movie that is made for a cult, because, rather than Howdy's gazpacho (well, I think that's what it is), it's an acquired taste: you have to be focused on its peculiar wavelength. The production value can be called charitably cheap, and the pace and atmosphere take a while to figure out, but the film has a "look", especially in some great shots that contrast the dry flatness of the country with the jerky nouveau-rich opulence from the Mansion interior: Michael Almereyda even had a good eye. Life with soda pop magnates Eugene Cleveland (Harry Dean Stanton) and his household (two adult children, a grandchild and a housekeeper) look so loose from outside life we ​​can be in Gormenghast. Everyone in this movie is wonderful (especially Suzy Amis and Crispin Glover as the directional genius brothers and sisters Maureen and Howdy). They live their roles so comfortably after a while. You just buy the strange prospect, which somehow survived the tornado and apparently was not able to Luck, these people are happy and don't quite know what to do with their happiness. There are some wonderful plays: Eugene's sudden confrontation is only with his giggling children's TV host, Virginia (a lousy peris Lois Chiles), with his children; William S. Burroughs sheds target practice and tells a story about a mysterious Jim; Maureen's boyfriend Chris proved himself by hitting a barn full of creatures dressed in a tablecloth and doily and old fedora; Howdy, Violet, Maureen and Chris are all sitting on the couch (the latter three in appropriate lightweight summer coats, the former in a red blazer and a black leather rock'n'roll gear) and watching images of deserts on the big TV and consider the future (the images were done by Bill Viola, who did the background video installation for Nine Inch Nails' last tour). Crispin Glover is predictably beautiful like Howdy: as always, he remains perfectly in character. Howdy made a cult of his misery and shine; He is like the Oscar Wilde of Kansas, and tries to offer his red velvet pack. Whether he was blunted on an electric guitar, struck with a full-fledged guitar while wearing a black-black cowboy outfit, demolished a room, or even doing simple things like having the aforementioned soup out of a blender jar. management or pouring. If you like his job, you'll like it.
