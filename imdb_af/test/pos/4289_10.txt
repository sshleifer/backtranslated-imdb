Can the intensity of a man's love for his wife lead him to cover a crime, despite treason on many levels? Tom Wilkinson is not a brutal Othello in the vicinity of contemporary England. So, gradually start a web of fraud weaving. And we testify of cycles of jealousy and drunkenness and guilt and fornication. And so the web of "separate lies" begins to fail and hold together again. And life (and death) continues, despite the bright flame of the man's love and the deep despair and guilt woven into so many lives. How many sites of fraud should be displayed in this growing tapestry? The impetus is to build strong reputations and careers and relationships in this civilized corner of the world. Wilkinson gives an emotional display, full of grace and discretion and decor, yet humanity, of those who have much to hide. Those who want clarity and openness on the road to justice will be disappointed with the evil of so much deception. And yet, who among us has nothing to hide about his loved ones? However, the viewer may wonder if this web is crumbling one day.
