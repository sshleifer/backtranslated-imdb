My two daughters (11 and 13 years old) and I were fortunate enough to see a show of this movie. We were all pleasantly surprised to see how entertaining and funny this film was. David Duchovny was very attractive because the male head and Minnie Driver usually gave her accomplishment. Some of the scenes are funny, especially one Minnie Driver scene has a co-transplant. I liked the fact that it was a movie I could see with my kids and I was not embarrassed by any scene. Everyone in the movie laughed and enjoyed themselves. Thumbs up Bonnie Hunt!
