An overview I've been putting off for too long. <br /> <br /> Bluntly, 2001 is one of the best science fiction films ever made, if not the best. Stanley Kubrick was a genius of a movie maker and it is one of his best works. And although it is widely misunderstood and underestimated, it is considered one of the best movies of all time and I will have to agree. Back in 1968, no one had done anything like this before, and no one ever since. It was a wonder of a special effect breakthrough then, and to see how the effects hold today, it's no wonder why. The movie looks amazing after about forty years! Take note of CGI people. Using great miniature pieces and realistic lighting, Kubrick has created some of the best special effects ever placed on celluloid. This aspect alone has almost created the cold void of the space atmosphere which is also attributed to the music and realistic sound effects. I can't think of another movie where you can't see anything here in space, as it really is. Not only is the absence of sound effects in space realistic, it is cleverly used as a tool to establish mood and it works flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Apart from the beautiful display of ingenious special effects, there are other factors that play a role in establishing the feel of the film. The music played, everything classic, complements what the eyes see and lets you feel the meaning of man's journey through his evolution from monkey to space traveler. <br /> <br /> The story, while seemingly simple, is deep. Several mysterious black monoliths are sequentially discovered, and basically certain movie events are triggered. What are they? Where did they come from? What are they doing? These are all the questions you ask to develop the story and are asked to find their own way. While most leave with a general idea of ​​what has happened in the story, every individual will have to decide what it means to them. In any way, one decides to answer these questions in in-depth solutions. It is not completely interpreted, but in some aspects it is. Experience this for more explanation. The end result is very cold, regardless of your personal solution. <br /> <br /> While it is a long film, and sometimes delayed, it must accurately portray man's journey. It's not a topic that would have gone well in a shorter movie, faster feature. Those with a short attention need not apply. <br /> <br /> Last but not least, is the hallmark of a relentless antagonist, HAL 9000, the computer. Never has a machine held such a cold screen presence. What reminds me, for a movie with such a deep ambition and accomplishment, is surprisingly little dialogue. Another sign of Kubrick's genius. <br /> All in all, one of the best films made to date and made one of the best science fiction films. A personal favorite. Everyone should see this movie at least once. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
