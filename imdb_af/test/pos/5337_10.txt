A great animation movie that is really on the level of oldies like "The Lion King". <br /> <br /> I saw it with one of my best Belgian friends who also watched the series on TV. I was happy because I didn't know people in Belgium, was aware of "Wallace and Gromit". <br /> <br /> When it started and the good old theme started, it got my memories of me when I was 5. <br /> <br /> The humor itself was very funny. Some nice sitcom style scenes, some word games or just jokes. The animation isn't as impressive as you know the series, but it's still fun to watch, you realize how it's done. <br /> <br /> My conclusion: Not only can it keep me happy and entertaining, but some of the humor can easily appeal to older people, so I say: Look at the curse of the wax rabbit as soon as you can.
