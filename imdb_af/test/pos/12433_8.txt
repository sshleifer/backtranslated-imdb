Before I watched the movie from start to finish, I only caught the last half hour. I usually don't look at a movie if I haven't seen it from the beginning, but a friend did it and as soon as I started watching, I couldn't stop. <br /> <br /> I'm really surprised this movie didn't get a wide theatrical release. It is quite a funny movie (often gall humor), and the sample and sample truck in it is pretty threatening. The monster makes Leatherface beautiful, and the monster truck is like a cross between a German artillery vehicle of the First World War and a giant coffin. <br /> <br /> A gentle twenty-five-year-old virgin is on a long drive to marry the woman he loves. His ex-best friends keep him constantly eating him. They are threatened on the road by an old black truck and the former monster truck. They also pick up a hitchhiker, played by the very sexy Aimee Brooks. <br /> <br /> I also watched the animated trailer with the director's commentary, and the electronic press kit and I found the two interesting. I'd bet the feature commentary with the director and the two male stars is also enjoyable, but I have so many other movies to watch what I've never seen before.
