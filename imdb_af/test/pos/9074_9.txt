Five medical students (Kevin Bacon, David Labraccio, William Baldwin, Dr. Joe Hurley, Oliver Platt, Randy Steckle, Julia Roberts, Dr. Rachel Mannus, Kiefer Sutherland, Nelson) for medical and personal relief. One by one every medical student's heart is stopped, then revived. <br /> <br /> Among temporary deaths, everyone experiences bizarre visions, including forgotten child memories. Their flashbacks are like children's nightmares. The revived students are disturbed by their unfair acts they have committed or done against them. As they live on, they bring real life experiences back into the present. As they continue to experiment, their memories increase dramatically; so much, some are physically overcome. So, they are investigating and surpassing the life-related experiences that seek to find a cure. <br /> <br /> Although the DVD was released in 2007, this film was released in 1990. That's why Kevin Bacon, William Baldwin, Julia Roberts and Kiefer Sutherland were in the early stages of their adult acting careers. Apart from the fact that the plot is extremely intriguing, the tension creates a dramatic climax and the essay is firm and convincing, making all the young actors 'Flatliners', which is now an all-star cult semi-sci-fi tension. Who knew 17 years ago that this young group of film actors would shoot? I suspect director Joel Schumacher did.
