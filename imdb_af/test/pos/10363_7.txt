I accidentally flung to the lifetime channel, just as this movie started, and finally watched it. <br /> <br /> It's definitely about a serious problem, probably more common than we realize, in terms of this kind of young woman attack by an ego-manic fellow student who feels he is above the system, and unfortunately it is often. <br /> <br /> The cast here was credible, and the performances credible. Many of these Canadian / Lifetime flicks are definitely "over-the-top". However, this is one that I can call "top-down". <br /> <br /> While not being presented in an over-the-top way, this movie was somehow like a record played at slower speeds than proper 96 minutes much more, and it seemed like a shorter movie that ran over and over, apparently going on and on and on, before reaching its inevitable and predictable conclusion. . <br /> <br /> But the engaging characters and performances made it better than the average movie of this kind, despite this criticism. <br /> <br /> And while these pictures often milk the climax, one could have given it a little more detail and length.
