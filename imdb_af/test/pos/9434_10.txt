The evil Professor Moriarty plans to get control of both SHERLOCK HOLMES and the secret weapon that can win the war for the Nazis. <br /> <br /> Basil Rathbone & Nigel Bruce return to the screen as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's beloved detective and sidekick, Sherlock Holmes & Dr Watson, in this entertaining little puzzle. Universal Studios has lost no money on fine production values ​​or a sensible script, knowing that its two stars will be the attraction that an audience needs. Indeed, Rathbone, like the cerebral ego, and Bruce, seem to be the characters they create, the characters they create. They keep their faces straight while they are most stupid. <br /> <br /> Dennis Hoey made his first appearance as Scotland Yard's Inspector Lestrade; with Bruce, these two kind-hearted but pedantic fellows actually get the intellectually superior Holmes's life. Lionel Atwill, a gentleman of the sinister who deserves more recognition for his talent, does a good job than Moriarty, making the wicked rascal an enemy worthy of Holmes's steel. He revives the scenes in which he gets torture and pain. /> <br /> William Post Jr. and Kaaren Verne plays the Swiss scientist and his girlfriend who are in the heart of the mystery, but they are not given much to do. Sweet Mary Gordon makes a distinctive look like Holmes's country member Mrs. Hudson. <br /> <br /> Rathbone crawls his classic interpretation of Holmes by appearing three times in disguise and thereby revealing the viewer that The Great Sleuth was a bit of a ham actor at heart. <br /> <br /> This film - very lightly based on elements in Sir Arthur's short stories The Dancing Men and The Empty House - follows SHERLOCK HOLMES and the VOICE OF TERROR (1942) and preceded SHERLOCK HOLMES Washington (1943).
