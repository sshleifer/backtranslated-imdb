I was a 20-year-old college student living with the people when I first saw it, and I never forgot it. I'm a great Joan Hackett fan, and this movie was perfect for her remarkable talent. I'm so glad to see so many other people have such a good memory to see it. Of course it is not available on any media! It will be perfect to show off at lifetime, but due to its age it won't. There you see nothing in the middle of the eighties. I can still remember what made me see when it was the first time. Rex Reed reviewed it in The New York Daily News. He said it was a setback to the big Hollywood films of the forties, and when it was made, parts of Hackett and Grimes would be played by Stanwyck and Crawford. Think about it! P.S. So sad that Joan Hackett left us so tragically young.
