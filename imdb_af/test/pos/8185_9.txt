Chen Kaige gives us a wonderful depth of atmosphere. Yes, it's a period piece, but Chen's artistic use of images makes it something more. The actors often act like players using the stylized diction, attitudes and facial expressions of Peking Opera. All the actors in a scene play the 'back wall', even when addressing each other. They are like spirits of the past expressing a story with urgent significance for those in the present with powerful clarity. Combined with the scale and mastery cinematography inside and out, "Jing ke ci qin wang" is a wonderful story that is revered in its own idiom that captivates completely.
