This film was a new direction for Natalie Portman. A much more mature role, though she comes from the tracks of a child in the movie itself. Ann, (Portman) and Susan Sarandon, who play her new divorced mother, Adele, travel from a small town in the middle of nowhere to Beverly Hills. There, these tortured souls try to respond to their new life and grow their new relationship as Portman's character. Unknowingly, first to Adele, she grows and becomes a better mother for it. Ann sees her mother tell her she wants to be an actress, or she thinks. Adele uses that crutch every time there is trouble in their lives. We see their struggle as the mother and daughter come between themselves and with their stand alone mind. They left their old lives behind. <br /> <br /> In addition, the acting is both. They seem to be mother and daughter. You can almost feel there is a band out of the real movie. <br /> <br /> Although this movie does not really take us any new land in these types of movies, the fact that the play was well done and the story is not too bad, let's recommend it to. <br /> <br /> But I will say it will probably go away soon, I don't think it can require the accommodation power for a big Christmas. season of movies starting in a week or so. See this before it happens if you like these actresses.
