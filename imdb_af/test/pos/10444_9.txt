As I said in the other comments, it is one of the best teen movies of all time, and one of my personal favorites. for me this movie is the second best teen movie of all time. second only to the breakfast club. the last American virgin may also be the most honest teenage movie of all time. it is underestimated, and almost an unknown movie for many people. It may come once a year on TBS, but sometimes longer. The first half of this movie is a sex comedy with some honest scenes. then the second half is honest, and most of the time is serious. with just a few comic scenes. in my opinion this is the best soundtrack of all time. I have never heard these very good songs in one movie. There are 4 love songs in this movie that I think are some of the best love songs in history. The movie is about a pizza boy named Gary, a virgin. hes in high school who has some best friends. his two friends are sex-sarved teens. The first half of the movie is pretty much sexual misadventures. It's very funny. Gary is in love with the new girl in the school. He later finds out that his best friend goes out with her. He also cheats on the side. you can feel the love Gary has for this girl. you can feel it even more in the second half. Gary's friend seems to be a creep. but his other friend is pretty cool. The movie shows how people can be. You can relate to many of this movie. the plot sounds like your typical teen sex comedy. but it is so much more than that. this is a very honest movie. It is also very 80ish that I love. If you love the 80's or grew up in the 80's, rent this movie. but there may be some people who don't like the 80s, but can still keep this movie. I only saw this movie in 1987, I think. it is very entertaining and very funny. It combines very pleasant moments with very funny moments. it is an underestimated gem! I got the movie. I love it! I give the last American virgin *** 1/2 out of ****
