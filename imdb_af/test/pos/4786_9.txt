It's over time "Kate Jackson" got her credit for this movie. I can remember watching it and trying to understand it on TV. My grandmother died in bed in cancer and I was barely 15. I did not find. until years later that Richard died long, I miss him on the other shows / movies he was in. <br /> <br /> I still have a copy of the VHS band, but it's not 'CC'd' or Closed Captioned for the Disabled hearing and that's the only flaw in the movie I can remember or know from date to time, I could not find a DVD or VHS copy containing English subtitles, if anyone outside knows whether a copy on VHS or DVD that has CC'd or English subtitles please know me. <br /> <br /> thanks - Cofffeenut
