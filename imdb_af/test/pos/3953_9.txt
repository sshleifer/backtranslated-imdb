James Franco is totally cool in this movie. Not only attractive and charismatic, but truly open and vulnerable in a sincere way. At the Tristan show, there were a few people on his back to be pouty and to do the whole James Dean thing, but I don't think that's true. Blind Spot is proving positive from his great talent. In this film, he carries quite another kind of weight. It's a unique achievement. Bittersweet and really moving. The lines from his magazine cut you like a knife. You feel a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words. The tone is everything. He wears it through action and tension, as well as the grim pieces of gallbladder. I also love the other two actors a lot. The blonde girl is absolutely beautiful and the man is hysterical in his distorted tough old-stoicism. Some of the boevies were a bit sketchy but this is really a mini-point. The movie is completely solid and Franco is completely cool.
