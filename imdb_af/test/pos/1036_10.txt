Absolutely the best thing I've ever seen on TV. It was both entertaining and informative. The reason I found this site is an attempt to find out how to see it again. <br /> <br /> In view of the current understanding of history, we need gen. General. Leslie Groves, who was responsible for the nuts and bolts of Manhattan project management. He was certainly not so paranoid about security as most of the past thought. <br /> <br /> The cast for the real people portrayed was outstanding. It was the first time I saw Sam Waterston as an actor. Except for the heights, he looked much like Robert Oppenheimer. <br /> <br /> The early stage in which Oppenheimer leads a class of graduate students was especially interesting to me.
