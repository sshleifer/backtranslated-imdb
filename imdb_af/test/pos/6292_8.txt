I love it! I love Pauly Shore. Some people don't seem to agree. It's humor, and he's not like everyone. The movie is wonderful. I love the story line and most people in the movie. It is funny the first time she met him at school. I like the fact that she chooses him over the guy. I like that Tiffani Theissan is not a bad girl in the end. All the secrets are left out. Only the people you want to see are left in the end. (except for those of you who don't like Paul Shore.) Even if you don't like him, there are funny parts, and her family tortures him most of the movies. She's land girl has become wild and needs to be heard. She finally made it. It just has the right amount of love and romance. I give it an 8 out of 10.
