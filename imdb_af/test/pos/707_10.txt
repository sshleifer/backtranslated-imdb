I read on the web that this movie is again in a theatrical function. Finally !!!!! It's time Hollywood got their act together. The big studios always frowned on edgy material, wrote about it with Oscar. Go figure !! <br /> <br /> JERICHO MILE was made ahead of time. This is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> A true visionary, Michael Mann found a way to engage an audience without over-capacity. Peter Strauss's Emmy award show is probably the best character role I've seen in my movie show life. Any actor who touches this role will never be the same (unless an Academy Award is already on their mantle). <br /> <br /> The eager multi-ethnic ensemble, a backdrop for the Jericho MILE, allows one the delicate social dynamics of our world. It's about salvation without public affirmation and the power of the human spirit to overcome all obstacles. Imagine a jail sentence for being a teenager for life, without a chance of parole. It doesn't know he might be the fastest runner in the world. ... what would you do? <br /> <br /> This movie makes you feel like you're not at any level. Totally exciting, engaging, emotional, and a "Rolling Stones" soundtrack that kicks your ass! <br /> <br /> I always thought it would be made for the big screen ... Can't wait ...! !! In the meantime, I have to continue to look at my weathered VHS copy I've had for many years.
