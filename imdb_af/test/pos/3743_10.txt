Oh yes! Hollywood remembers how to use the good old formula, and when lightning strikes, it's a wonderful feeling. Rare Hollywood creates a masterpiece because lately there seems to be more worrying about picking up fast and getting the most rewards, or there are too many chefs in the mix. Good screens are usually the result of a talented writer who is in full control of his / her property, understands his material and is a good writer. Then there is a little important part, often neglected by the marketing geniuses who so often have creativity and vision: a good actor. <br /> <br /> A good actor can make the difference between a mediocre, half-cooked try, and a fully-realized movie that may not be an important and relevant movie, but one that contributes to its genre and eventually become a classic of its kind. We get very few romantic comedies and we are people who get hungry for them. Buried in the sexy humor of "Sex in the City" is the romantic but stormy relationship of Big and Carrie, and people flocked to Mamma Mia because it had a romance played by Streep and Brossnam. It may have a dumb music, but it touched us because it was played with intensity and conviction. "Nights" offers us more of it, with the incredible talents of a woman working wonderful in romantic movies, Ms. Diane Lane, do. Since her days as a child actress, we appreciate how her talent, combined with her appreciative soul, allows us to see in the heart of the story's main characters. A few years ago she went with Mr. Gears responded. We've been given a painful, romantic and sexy show as the woman who is not sure of the consequences of her acting in 'Unreliable' work that at least accepts her academy. She's back, doing more formidable work in this romantic jewel than a woman who gave her romantic outlook. And suddenly she realized that there might be another chance around the corner. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Lane pulsates this movie with intelligence and passion. Her facial expressions communicate volumes about the different emotions that characterize her. We can read frustrations, desires, despair, anger, hope, loss, and a series that reaches out to many of the marketable types that Hollywood is constantly pushing on our throats. Here is an adult artist who has the gift of projecting real emotions and enabling us to connect with the material so that we move when we become part of the experience. <br /> <br /> Mrs. Lane is such a triumphant joy to watch as she goes through the transformation of the first scenes of the movie to the end. Her discoveries come from us when we celebrate with her the power of hope and love. She can bring back the unparalleled joy of a lover, just as a teenager does, and yet she never makes you think of stupid or irresponsible. Her eyes are expressive jewels that can even move the cynical in the audience. She is one of the stars that can do wonders with just one look. In her, the classic feel of those big movies yesterday. Her work reminds of the passionate and intelligent work of Hepburn, Davis, Garson, women who played every day and made them unforgettable because they created complete characters. <br /> <br /> We admire the wonderful actresses who truly recreate legendary legends and are rewarded for it. Half of their work is done by the mystics of the figures they personalize; but as much as anyone can make you think, it is the roles such as Lane's in this movie that is an impressive achievement because they are created from scratch, given a personal touch and can reach heights without any previous theater material support, such as acting, and the backdrop of a famous legend whose life pays tribute to the silver screen. Lane's character is one woman whose experiences can be any of us. She represents our dreams and emotions with a lot of quality, class, and just the right amount of sentiment. This is quite remarkable achievement, and we should be grateful that we can still find such a remarkable performance today. <br /> <br /> There are a few adjectives I can use to honor their work, but I can only say that in my humble opinion every single framework of her work in this movie testifies to one of the greatest performances ever performed on a celluloid by a living artist. Thank you, Mrs. Lane.
