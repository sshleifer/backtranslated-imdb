The Child - At 39, Russel Duritz has a life that most men would envy - he has a good job, is respected (and feared), has a beautiful home and bucket money. But everything comes at a cost, in this case no social life, no conscience and a fear of spending the rest of his life alone. He only needs someone to show him the way. <br /> <br /> While watching the movie, I wonder why Disney did not pass this movie on to Miramax - not because it was particularly daring or edgy, but because it is clearly an adult movie. This is exacerbated by the marketing campaign that clearly focuses on children - it is captured with fans for "Rugrats the Movie" and "Pokemon 2000" (are they not yet passed?). But I snapped. <br /> <br /> I was impressed with the sensitive treatment of the subject - rather than the typical male waist crisis that entails a pathetic juice that buys a Porsche convertible book and acts like a moron, Willis character some serious introspection and take stock of his life. His guide on this journey of self-discovery is itself at age 8 (they never explain how Rusty comes and honestly, I don't care). Young Rusty's innocence and unbridled optimism give him a clear advantage to divide the truth. He took Russell's work as an image consultant like this: "You teach people how to lie and pretend they're something they aren't." In order to succeed, you must have actors to bring it to life. Not a problem here. <br /> <br /> Although Willis has three times W.C. ignored. He was convinced by Fields' role-playing warnings with children or animals, and he also grabbed comedies with Breslin as he did dramatically with Osment. Willis manages Russell's cutthroat powerbroker traits with vulnerability and confusion without becoming ridiculous. Meanwhile, Breslin is killing a child from everyone's childhood - the one who always sticks out and is chosen for some reason. We also get two bonus achievements: Lily Tomlin is wonderful as Russell's flat-panel assistant and Jean Smart is perfect as an informative, charming anchor woman (I love her in Guinevere). <br /> <br /> The child is charming, heavy, and actually. And it will appeal to adults of all ages.
