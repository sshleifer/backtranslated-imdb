So forgive the * really * lame game scene scene, cardboard background and studio like stadium. For this part I had to give the movie 5 instead of 7, but read on ... <br /> <br /> From the starting point of the plot there are many similarities to "The Replacements". Some say this movie rip off "The Replacements", while some say this script has written before it. <br /> <br /> Both movies require a suspension of unbelief on the basic premise, and this is especially difficult for "Second String" as it has NFL license team and all its history. sounds too lazy for some people, and not to mention the "Second String" bills, has to overcome big scores time and time again. With the limit budget to shoot the game scene, it makes it equally bad. <br /> <br /> In "Replacements" is the premise and league fiction, but you know it's happening in real life. I believe it's easier to accept fiction story and setting with a real event ("Oh yes, it happens before!", Rather than real setting / background with fictitious scenario ("There is no way Bill can win a Superbowl" some of the scene was actually in the pre-season game of Raven games, real stadium, rights hearing and some NFL games. br /> <br /> But let's say both movies came out the same day , and we erase the budget factor (so forget the game scene scene scene): Overall, I like "Second String" about "Replacements", not much, but I like this lake. <br /> <br / > It has "relatively better" character development. In "Replacements" Keanu character is "out sync with the world", and all he cares may be, get a girl? In Second String you see the battle of the QB to get the job back and go with his coach with his coach or the fumble guy problem. This "keeps the ball all day long." Of course, ssing is not new, but we are seeing progress in establishing it. <br /> <br /> What about the trick? I think it's "relatively realistic" as "replacements". The "Dan Marino" like a fake knee-fit, flea monster, a wild cat's back, all the rights, except sometimes it seems a bit too easy. But for me it is better if the replacement center catches and hurts for 50 meters, or how a 60 meter field goal looks too easy. OH BTW, I'm glad they didn't force the TE kicker to make his shot. <br /> <br /> Of course --- if you objectively review this movie about other soccer movies, it can be easy. be a 5 out of 10 movie. But some say it's the worse football video? Try "The Comebacks".
