In one of the best Charlie Chaplin's short films, he places the little one in the trenches of World War II. He brings his unbearable politeness and endless patience to the grief of the ditch life, where the troops lived for months before finally reaching the top to attack the enemy, and usually until their death. It takes someone from Chaplin's skill as a comedian to make something as thirsty as a counting war in such a brilliant comedy, but the irony he uses in the film makes even the most uncomfortable conditions very amusing. <br /> <br /> Like all of Chaplin's films, short films and otherwise, this one with brilliant and memorable scenes, such as the scene where he marks off, kills a piece of chalk on a plate in the ditch and one erase when he has shot his helmet, the scene where he and his fellow soldiers are sleeping under water, the opening of the beer bottle and lighting of the cigarette, and of course the victory of the enemy. All these scenes are show-stopers, reminiscent of the wonderful Chaplin scenes. This one should not be missed!
