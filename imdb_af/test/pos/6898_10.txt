It's so refreshing to see a movie like this with real mood and personality instead of just a lot of CGI cartoons. It is a great horror spoof that has real chills alongside some very good sets and performances. His laughter is subtle, but abundant. Because there is little to any CGI, you do not have to shake the camera violently to hide the crappy effects. This makes the movie very visible compared to the other camera-man-to-be-sh% # @ ing-pants films of this genre that have emerged in the last decade or so. <br /> <br /> Much more enjoyable than the big-budget rebuilt rubbish released by Hollywood today. <br /> <br /> See it.
