Great plays are best rewarded by linking to a melodramatic script that truly enhances the human spirit. To all the minions that challenge every day, you have to take heart! Your patience is virtuous. Your tolerance and decency will be evidence in ways you will never expect. This is your big story. I do not believe that you can look to the end without a wasteland of moisture in that hardened eye. Or can you? For me it wouldn't be that way ... the story is relentless! The idealist refused his excuse. Will someone talk? Oh! but you will have to see the show itself! watch the schoolmaster in his head, without the notice and the observer who will surely expect the observer. And why does he stay that way? Yes! You have to look for O'Toole's performance for yourself! I can only wish it was still busy buying, then my friends as proof of respect for their faithful lives.
