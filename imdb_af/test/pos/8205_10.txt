This movie is a warning to all people who sit on the office on a typical day. My Warning is, Don't Show Up Much About Yourself, 2 Be Careful Who You Cross !! , there are spies on this internet thing. I thought it was so scary that the combination of men and women did to poor Angela Bennett. I didn't realize anyone could take life away in one click of this mouse. Angela I thought it had a good job of expressing Jack Delvin and that terrible girl is my question, why does that computer make that noise when it works? like a sound mine, don't do it or this one. This movie also tells you that there is fraud on this internet. Also why can't Angela do the virus destroyer program at a CyberCafe? I also thought that as all computers were slow to the transfer rate to the disk, which is correctly portrayed in this movie, if you save the program to your disk, the bar just moved slowly! I also love Angela's house at the beginning of the film. Why didn't anyone believe Angela?
