Dirty Dancing one of my most favorite movies. I just watched it on ABC twice because I didn't get the chance to buy or rent it. I had no idea Jennifer Gray was 27 when she made the movie because she was very convincing as a teenager. Compared to some women in Hollywood, she has a very flat breast, so I'm so easily deceived over her age. So, both physically and emotionally, Gray pulls out a teenager very well. I also loved the dance - who wouldn't? Both times I watched Dirty Dancing, I wanted to search for dance classes. I also love the soundtrack, and I recognize some of the songs from when I was eight or nine. I'd love to see it in my drama class, and I'm going to ask my teacher at some point if there is any part of the movie that he can use for educational purposes. This is much better than the things he did last year. And the end was absolutely FANTASTIC. This is one of the best moments in the film. <br /> <br /> I can't believe, I'm looking forward to the first day back to school because of Dirty Dancing! Who can ask for a better influence of a movie with that kind of title?
