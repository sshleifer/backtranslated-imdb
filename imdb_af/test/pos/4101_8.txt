The rendering of a classic story is on the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics by Hal David. The actors look like real people in this fairy tale of the outside world encounter with the mystical Shangra-la. It's a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting reminds me of Red Buttons, and as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who is always able to carry gravitas in his roles. <br /> <br /> The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the older High Lama. Who would have known? <br /> <br /> Overall cast, including Michael York and Olivia Hussey, makes this work a custodian for those of us who cherish people.
