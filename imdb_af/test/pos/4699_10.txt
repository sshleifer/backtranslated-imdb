I have some good memories watched on TV as a kid (Robin or Sherwood) (but I think I just saw Michael Praed's episodes, for some reason). And recently, my brother bought the newly released DVD boxes from the full range. It was great to see it again, and it's the best of all Robin Hood movies and TV shows. The role-play is great, and the places mixed with Clannad's music add to this special feeling. Personally, I think Praed is the best of both Robins, but Jason Connery was a good choice to continue. Ray Winstone, Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie are great in their roles like Will Scarlet, The Sheriff or Nottingham and Guy or Gisburne. It is a pity that a fourth season has never been made, and I have also heard that writer Richard Carpenter is actually planning to make a feature film following the events of the series. Robert of Huntingdon (Connery) could eventually be married to Marion (Judi Trott), or perhaps Herne the Hunter would raise Robin or Loxley (Praed) and he could take revenge against the sheriff. As mentioned before; as the producers of Robin Hood: The Prince of Thieves would have been clever, they would have gotten the role of "Robin of Sherwood" and made the movie a sort of sequel to the series. As Ray Winstone puts it in the DVD bonus material, it would have been good to see them as old men, just as in Sean Connery's "Robin and Marian". Who knows, maybe we'll see more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future. Anyway, we can watch our favorite series again!
