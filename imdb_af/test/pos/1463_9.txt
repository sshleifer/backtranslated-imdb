After the highlight of the darkness, it was never imaginable that Holness and Adobye could create half as good as garth marengi. Yet I think the man to man in his own right is so good a show (on the good episodes) as a dark place. I can't argue that 2 of the episodes aren't really that good, but the other 4 make sure of that. if I had to pick 2 big episodes, id for formula4 manager Steve Pising (pronounced Pissing) and the great Garth Marengi. Having a little understanding of the program is a real plus as Dean Learner makes a lot of inside jokes, but even if you haven't seen much dean id, some of the runs he's launching are genius . His argument with Def Lepord about their name. All in all, a good performance that only misses points due to the few less funny episodes.
