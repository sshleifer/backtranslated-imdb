Apart from the low budget, it never seems to be more than 50 Germans in one scene at a time, plus the same 2 half cuts, this movie is absolutely top class. Everything is accurate. That's the point I think of the uniforms to the horror and the disillusionment. Each one is as gray as the veld gray uniforms. Gray men with the life thrown out of them. Forget US has Gung Ho rubbish like Blackhawk and Private Ryan. This is one of the best war movies ever. Only Cross of Iron strikes it for tension and story. Can we please have a proper Un-dubbed German language with English subtitle version in the UK? Without paying ridiculous import charges from Europe. Most other DVDs are multilingual. Why not this one?
