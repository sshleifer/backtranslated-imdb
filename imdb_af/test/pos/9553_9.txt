Rented the video for a slow Saturday night. First sighting I thought it was funny. It took a while to get used to the American caricature (here we are more focused on British Grotesque), but very pleasant. <br /> <br /> Looked at it again the next night and really warmed. The characters look even more dignified, even. A movie you can watch several times and get more out of it every time. But my wife hated it. I wasn't supposed to be responsible for taste in humor.
