I actually liked this movie, though this movie was so hated and I think it's even better than The Deer Hunter, which is overestimated. Both this movie and Year of the Dragon are much underestimated, although I could see why someone wouldn't want this movie. At three and a half hours, the movie only lasts too long and the second half of the movie is much better than the first half. Kris Kristofferson and Christopher Walken fight over Isabelle Huppert, but she can't make her mind about which one to be. Sam Waterston is the villain who has a list of 125 people to be killed whose say is anarchists and thieves. There is a huge role that also has Jeff Bridges, Brad Dourif and a young Mickey Rourke.
