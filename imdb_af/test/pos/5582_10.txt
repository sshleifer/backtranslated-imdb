Not many television programs appeal to so many different fans such as Farscape ... I know young people and 30/40 + years old; fans, both male and female, in as many different countries as you can think of just love this mini TV. It has elements that can be found in almost every other show on T.V, character-driven drama that can be of an Australian soap opera; but in the same episode, it has scientific fact and fiction that even runs the hardest "Trekkie" for his money in brain-bone strikes! Wormhole theory, Time travel in true comparative form ... Beautiful. It embraces cultures from across the map as the possibilities are endless with several stars and therefore thousands of planets to choose from. <br /> <br /> With such a wide range; It will be expected that nothing can stop the illusion for long, but here is where "Farscape" really comes in its own element. It succeeds where everyone else has failed, especially like Star Trek (a universe with virtually zero Kaos element!) They ran out of ideas quite quickly and kept them back! In the course of 4 seasons, they manage to keep the audience's attention using good continuity and constant character revolution with multiple threads on each episode with unique personal touches to the camera specific to certain character groups within the whole. This structure allows for a very large topic as loyalties are forged and in many ways broken into many problems. I saw the pilot (Premiere) passing by and just had to fit in to see if Crichton would ever get the girl. After watching them all on television, I was happy to watch it on DVD and I have to admit that it was the only thing that kept me healthy while doing a 12-hour night shift and developing chronic insomnia . Farscape was the only thing to get me through the very long nights. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor; Look at the pilot and see what I mean ... <br /> <br /> Farscape Comet
