So Udo Kier deserves nine dollars and free food for this, so it's a victory in and of itself. <br /> <br /> More importantly, this movie tells a very interesting story about a group of rescuers coming over the demeter Demeter. I have to warn you, I'm bouncing gunna through this review, so fast so fast. First things first. Coolio plays a man named 187. 187 likes drugs. 187 find a lot of boxes on board and ... now I don't know anything about the future, but maybe they smuggle drugs into coffins. Not gunna says it was the craziest thing in this movie. Later the vampire comes out of his misfortune and then the real hilariousness begins. First, although this film has the word Dracula in it, he is not actually in this movie. However, I have a theory. From the blue you can see the salvage vessel's ship's leave without them. My theory is that Dracula was on board with his delayed brother Orlock. Dracula told Orlock he would be right. Dracula got the hell out of this movie before he could be seen leaving Orlock to play the vampire for the six or so minutes he was in the movie. The best part of this movie, and for those of you who saw it, you know what I say gunna is up to 187, embraced everything. He has this great monologue on ejaculation on different parts of erika Elaniak's body and ... other super cool things. Coolio, seriously, you're the best thing. <br /> <br /> There are also other things in this movie. As Casper Van Dean gets a little work. Orlock shouts a lot and loses his arm and then we lose him for the rest of the film. And thank God really. We find out that Erika's character is a police bot. As the movie comes to an end, we find that the ship is on a course to ram in the sun. The police bot and one other surviving character is doomed. Erika's police bot rather avoids being a whore and decides to screw and die. Before they die in the sun, they die for no reason, it's right ... their ship doesn't sound for any real reason. <br /> <br /> This movie got the incredible score for one reason, Coolio. My god, if they gave academic awards to black rappers, then he would be the first to get one. The only reason it didn't get a perfect ten is because there was no drop of nudity. Now I know what your thinking, how can you judge a movie or show women their goods or not. Well easy. A movie like this requires it pretty much. Its part of the process. Gore, gore, monsters, nudity, gore, end of the final shock at the end. This is the formula. It had a little gore, the monster was fantastic because he sucked so hard. He actually had the favor of staying off the camera. It was discreet of him and I respect it. Nudity, not a drop, though there was a long conversation about ... and looking at the above statement and for the shock / twist ... I certainly didn't see the end. It counts. <br /> <br /> I hope Hollywood doesn't think Coolio has given this movie its all and has nothing more. He earns more work. Well, to Dracula 4000, I'm out.
