(Some Spoilers) Contrary to a mid-life crisis and with his marriage to Cindy, Teddi Siddall, who said more in what he did and where he stayed, the Air Force, USAF elite was Red Beret Sgt. Big Davis Bay, Gary Cole, decided one morning to just walk away from everything and start a new life as a citizen. <br /> <br /> David first got this idea when he met at a Halloween festival and loved Alyson, Karen Sillas. Keeping his background secret from her by telling Alyson that he's in a mysterious military outfit was the perfect cover for him. Back at Jackson AFB outside Austin Tex. David begins reviewing his life's options with Cindy and the USAF and decides to change his identity by running away from it. David calls Alyson, who once met him, and makes an appointment with her. Before you know it, David, now using the name Haywood, is marrying her. <br /> <br /> His death in a bicycle accident lapses. Dave deliberately gives his wife and children into the cold and destroys his military obligation to his country. It didn't take long for Dave to find out that civilian life just didn't call him. It's too late for Dave to go back to his first wife, Cindy, and his two sons with him to the brig and a military war council when he returns to the USAF. Dave takes the only work he can do to support him and Alyson and their baby son Chris. Use his skills he learned in the Red Berets to rob banks. <br /> <br /> Based on a true story "Lies He Tell", Dave Bay / Haywood has three, not two, different lives. One of a hardworking family man, one as a relentless bank robber and another as a dead and highly decorated, by the US president and GB's premier criminal, the All American hero. Gary Cole is very effective as both Master Sgt. David Bay & husband David Haywood. David's actions, though unforgivable, are understandable in the case of his depression over his marriage to Cindy. The hug from her hug to the point where he just wanted to get rid of her and the children. But he had to seek professional counseling from the American Air Force, which he would have liked to provide, rather than choosing the easy way out. Which eventually leads him straight to the Levenworth Ferderal Prison. Perhaps it was that excessive macho Dave thought it was a bad sign on his career as well as his ego, to get help for his problems. <br /> <br /> Karen Sillas as Alyson is the glue that holds the film with her along with her new husband's explanation of his regular disappearances, some for as much as two weeks, as he is doing fraudulent action to secure the country to love domestic and foreign terrorists. The real reasons for his long absence were due to the fact that he moved and robbed banks. What was the only way he knew how to make a living he had learned, in repressive actions, over the years in the elite Red Berets. <br /> <br /> Alyson watch Dave's mother, Carolyn Bay (Linda Goranson), whom he told her, was dead since he was a little boy. In Portland, she finds out the truth about the double or triple life he has led since he married her. This resulted in Alyson finding out about his marriage to Linda and the two sons he had with her, as well as his fake death, and now AWOL, of the USAF. Because it is a true story, the end was something you would guess to be in a standard Hollywood, or for TV, movie. That's what makes the movie "Lies he said, a lot better than you would have expected it to be.
