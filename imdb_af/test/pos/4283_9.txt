How on earth people can give this movie a low rating. Unbelievable. The performances of Wilkinson and Watson are so full of merit that I can only imagine that these opponents are weaned on blockbusters and pornography. (If that sounds, it's because I just deleted my original 400 word now). I was so impressed by Tom Wilkinson. Everyone gets the man. This is a display of considerable subtle and massive skills. His development as an actor from The Full Monty to this masterpiece of performance is wonderful; one of the best things in film production over the past ten years. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson is somewhat less advised, due to the glitter in her eye saying "see me? This old woman, here? You can't guess what I'm going to do next, because I also know "It seems to be something she can't help showing us in every role, but she is still an actor of tremendous ability and presence. She is very sexy here, as she should be, and honestly playing for her: this is a screen quality that is usually not for me in previous movies. <br /> <br /> If you can expect Rupert Everett to play a late-30-class higher-level tutorial, PhD level tutorials give in to how not to give a head over hell on the basis of total selfishness, he is so thin here, but I'm worried about him, Linda Bassett's housekeeper is also excellent: a minor role but with a great plot twist to make, she remembers how much talent we have in Britain regarding character work. I want to see more of her. <br /> <br /> The narrative bow is fine; is an interesting enough plot, as no one in the production of movies apparently tries to convince Joe Public that there is nothing new under the sun, although it gets lost in the last 'reel' on the 40-year-old melodrama. "But no matter - it's a fantastic 80 minute effort for anyone who has half a brain's money. Congratulations to Julian Fellowes on his first direct effort: o How we need more movies of this kind. He shows a lot of skill in adapting the original novel, and tells a story with a lot of efficiency and subtlety. And congratulations on the portrayal of an enormous performance of the film actor's art by Mr. Tom Wilkinson. What a gift. <br /> <br /> T.
