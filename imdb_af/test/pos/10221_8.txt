I experienced Nightbreed for the first time on television a year ago, and I was pleasantly surprised with the results. <br /> <br /> Clive Barker has won over with Hellraiser, but it is a movie that has successfully stopped its film track. somewhat. What an unfortunate thing to happen, because this film looks like the people of Midian misunderstood. <br /> <br /> In this story Barker created a cross breed genre staples - it starts out as a traditional horror movie but soon becomes a fable about men's inhumanity to humans. The thrill of sympathy for the devil is difficult, but if the characters are so visually demonic as in this movie, it becomes impossible (cue the child!). The virtually Klan-like human emergence (explosives and holy wrath!) At the film's conclusion is twofold disturbing in the light of what has gone before. Like a parable of ethnic tension and white rule, this movie can be very attractive. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for those who don't see the movie from this side and think of it as Barker's fantastic dedication has gone too far. We have a real forgotten gem here and the sooner the studio and Mr. Make Barker beautiful and spend time on it - the better.
