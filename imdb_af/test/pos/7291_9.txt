Okay, I'm 12, so that's where you see the movie from a pre-teenager's point of view. I also commented on Magnolia and Bicentennial Man, both good movies, if you want to see it. Well, here on earth was a beautiful film with amazing scenes and images, very pleasing to the eye. The author (I don't know who it was, look at IMDB) also worked very hard or had a good appreciation for love, poetry and drama. I cried 4 times throughout this movie, once for more than 30 minutes. It was really sad, really beautiful, very significant. It's a good movie for anyone, says 11 and who is not a romantic comedy freak. Yes, it's romantic, yes, it's comedies, but (in my opinion), it's better than "She's All That" or "Whatever It Takes". I never cry! This is a soft story. Go rent and paste it :).
