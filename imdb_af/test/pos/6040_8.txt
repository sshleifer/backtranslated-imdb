Elizabeth Ashley receives calls from her cousin Michael - he cries, screams and asks for help. The problem is that Michael was dead 15 years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie ripped me off in 1972 when broadcast on ABC. See it again, years later, it still works. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit slow and predictable, death is very tame and there is a happy ending, but it's a TV movie, so you have to give it. Elizabeth Ashley is excellent, Ben Gazzara is ok and it's fun to see Michael Douglas so young. And those phone calls still frighten the living daylight out of me. I actually had to turn on a light! <br /> <br /> A sharp little TV movie. Worth to see.
