This is a classic continuation of Bleu, the equally excellent film, with Juliet Binouche as chief star, and she is here in Rouge a comical look, just for a moment at the end. But this film, really red and very sweet, though very sad, is a real winner. The main heroine, played by ever-big Irene Jakob, is a successful photo / fashion model. She leads a full, active life, just obscured by her traumatic relationships with her foreign friend Mike, who is in England. With a happy chance she gets friendly with the old Judge, who spends time listening to his own neighbors' private phone calls. The story begins to weave further, and we see him in court, almost universally condemned for his pastime. She is the only one who feels sympathy for him, for his cute little girl Rita and her dolls, and for all the people who surround them. We are also witnessing the breakup of a happy couple from a young lawyer and his lady, and their strife is also fueled by the telephone scandal. But the movie is not about this. It's mostly about loneliness and deep ripples between people, far and near. When she sails a ferry to England, with that lawyer as a casual passenger, as well as the Binoche who dies in Bleu, the ship sinks and we see the terrible appearance of the judge when he looks at the news that is trying to guess if she survived. She did and we still feel very heavy at heart. Mr. Kislowski managed to draw a large, subtle story about loneliness, misunderstanding, secrets and pain. Deep, dark personal pain from those who are lost and lonely. Brilliant movie.
