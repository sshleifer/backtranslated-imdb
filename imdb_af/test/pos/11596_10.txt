Much more eloquent reviews than this have described the spectacular acting, decisive and styling of this movie. It appears that the only negative reviews focus on a perceived imbalance in the film's handling of the core moral demand (euthanasia). <br /> <br /> This movie is the final scene, with the emphasis on Ramon's belief that he is not making a few big points, but simply making a life without dignity a life that is not worth living. We see as viewers an enormous amount of dignity in his life - we see family and friends and culture and, but for his physical limitations, a life has fully lived. Central to the drama of this film is that there is really only one person who thinks Ramon's life is not worth living - and it is he. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie and saying that the only counter-argument comes from Visiting a clumsy priest is a nonsense. The priest's visit is purely farce, a direct assault on the simplicity of the Spanish Catholic Church's response to the issue of euthanasia. But the sister's secret words to the priest briefly explain the powerful "pro-life" sentiments that support the entire film. We are constantly encouraged to see hope and the beauty of a life lived with love. As the film progresses, we can gradually be encouraged to understand Ramon's reasoning, but we are never reconciled with his decision. <br /> <br /> I don't remember a movie that moved me and made me so much worse.
