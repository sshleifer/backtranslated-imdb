A strong musical family, fiery love father and four vibrant adolescent girls, are furious with the appearance of Felix, a young young composer, and secondly, and very deeply, Mickey, his insolent attractive orchestral friend. <br /> <br /> It takes a while for Michael Curtiz to drive this piece of Americana. The first part looks almost like a grain trade, not without a particular bourgeois charm, and then John Garfield comes to the scene as the doomed Mickey, who makes his first appearance in movies, with black curls, sleepy, hanging eyes, rude and astonished, the absolute opposite of Jeffrey Lynn's smooth persuasive, mad, charming Felix. Overall, Garfield needs DIRECT, counterpoint to the rest of the household ('Nothing I would do, would surprise me', he shouts) and suddenly the movie becomes interesting, although I agree with critics who find the plot twists insufficient motivated. <br /> <br /> The four sisters were rather mean and seriously underwritten, but Claude Rains like the father's family has moments. <br /> <br /> Look at Garfield, though he is just the real lasting thing about it.
