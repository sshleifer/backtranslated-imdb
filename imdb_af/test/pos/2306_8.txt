Eros and Thanatos, Love and Death commend the dialectics of Life. By the end of the 19th century in a remote Japanese town, a young man and a married woman, older than him, fell in love with each other and decided to kill her husband to be free to enjoy their love. But they never enjoy that freedom, as Remorse begins to haunt them by the worst member of the couple, the woman of course. Henceforth, in an atmosphere where dream (nightmare) mixes with reality, the ghost of the murdered man appears first for the woman but also for the man. It also insists on the dreams of the other villagers causing a climate of suspicion and gossip around the couple, aggravated by the arrival of a police officer investigating the disappearance of the murdered man. But what makes this movie more interesting is the evolution of the couple's feelings in a Shakespearean deep psychological and dramatic development of repentance, anxiety and fear that change their love affair to a nightmare to their final punishment. The expressionism so fond of Japanese theater or movie show is also present in the players' performances, but not in an exaggerated form. Just to the extent necessary to show the most profound feelings of the depicted characters more effectively. It is indeed a good good movie.
