(WARNING - INCLUDED MILD SPOILER) A movie that is almost designed to keep you waiting and keep your memory in mind - it is limited to an almost empty motel where the large courtyard looks like a circus ring and the rooms look like temporary withdrawal points rather than retreats; As the characters are increasingly being kept busy by the past, the face is increasingly falling, until the eventual burning appearance of the Countess in the black Mercedes indicates the fusion of reality and fantasy. Whether their stories are true or not, and whether Stanton is really the father or just a crazy old man who is in their stories, seems impossible to determine. The theme seems to be the love of an extreme and uninhabited nature with stability to the point where reality itself breaks where exotic, misplaced fantasy becomes dangerously tangible. The image of the burning motel - a symbol of disruption by destruction - is a strange ending to this strange but effective, surprisingly imaginative film.
