Can't get much worse than Flatliners. This deep, dark film pumped my heart through. The lighting is dark and will get you in the mood for a deadly experience, literally. Keifer is in the best shape as he is today in 24. He is a good actor and plays a very convincing and shocking role that you will not forget for years. And what can you say to the rest of the movie? An all-star lineup, Julia is hotter than ever, Will, Oliver and Kevin lift the stage in this thriller that will keep you from grabbing your seats. It's a refreshing sight to see a real thriller, with professional professional actors. You won't regret seeing this 2-hour seat leg. is known per se
