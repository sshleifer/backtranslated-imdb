I think this show was right for the money for me. I watched it over the plane, but there were parts in the movie that made me control that I tore across the place. <br /> <br /> The chemistry between Richard Re and Diane Avenue was very credible (fantastic on both parts)! I loved how Diane Lane's daughter also performed in the show. She showed maturity and how she transformed during the show was easy to believe as a teenager might be in real life. <br /> <br /> I loved this show from start to finish. Definitely recommended for the romantic people out there!
