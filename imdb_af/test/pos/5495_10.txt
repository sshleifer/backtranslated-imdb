A great show by Clint Eastwood and especially John Malkovich in my opinion his best one to date. Malkovich nailed this one to the floor, it's incredible. Eastwood is agent Mike Horrigan, an old and cynical Secret Service agent who forgets his career enchanters and completes routine assignments. But one mission that allegedly runs off the mill becomes complicated and deadly serious. Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to threaten the President by "wacko". As fate would have it, Horrigan did not stumble upon a delusional note, but a professional lone wolf who had a great leg to choose with the White House. While Horrigan dives deeper into "Booth's" world, he attracts the bad man's unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him. Horrigan was JFK's top agent and present in Dallas, Texas when he was murdered and blamed himself for what happened. Now he feels it is up to him to prevent the current head of state from joining the list of dead presidents. But this killer turned the tables on Horrigan and now he is the fast-paced one in a life or cat and mouse game. Who will win? Who will die? It's a race against time to save the Pres from a chameleon enemy that anyone can get. My favorite Secret Service movie and as good as a nail bite.
