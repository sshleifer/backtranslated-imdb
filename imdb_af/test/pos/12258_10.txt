Broadcast News (dir. James L. Brooks, 1987} <br /> <br /> **** / **** <br /> <br /> Although not the emotional punch of Brooks' debut feature, (Terms of Endearment) Broadcast News is a super-movie, with exceptional performances by each of the three clues and a script that feels like real and well-researched as a tough news report. satire second, in my mind it succeeds on both levels on its own terms, the characters of the film are given surprising depth and dimension, while satire stays smart and never bitter, comparisons with the network are unnecessary because the movies Having Separate Goals and Attitudes While also a great movie, Network is a cynical and tired work, in other words, she is crazy like hell and excited with television.Network's style of satire feels more extreme and guerrilla. In contrast, the characters that populate the newsrooms of Broadcast News love and live for their work (sometimes to the detriment of their love life.) They get pleasure from the tension and satisfaction of the news release, just as the audience enjoys watching it sweet and romantic realistic masterpiece.
