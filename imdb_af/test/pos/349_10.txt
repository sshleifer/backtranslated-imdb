This is one of the games where you love to breast or hate it to tear. Although you can make a hardcore Mario fan, you like this game. You can hate it because it's 2 short and somewhat boring and easy. Or you can love it because it's a mix of amazing graphics (not a Nintendo fan great excitement) music or games. I know a lot of people say it's great, and others who think it's the worst Mario ever. It really depends on the type of Nintendo you are. I personally love this game and I think it's the best game, but you have to decide it yourself. So I think you should definitely get it when you're the real Nintendo fan. But if you love The Classics too much, you may not like it. So try it yourself.
