I watched this exhibition when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it well. If you ask me, it was a pretty good show. Every time I think about it, I don't remember the opening sequence and theme song very well. In addition, everyone is ideally thrown. The writing was also very strong. The performances were also top grade. I hope some network will bring it back so I can see every episode. Before I upload it, I'd like to say that I will always remember this show in my memory, although I'm not sure I saw every episode. Now, finally, if some networks ever bring it back, I hope you'll catch it one day before it's going well.
