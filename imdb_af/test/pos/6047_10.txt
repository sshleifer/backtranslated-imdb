Jack Webb's portrayal of the Marine Drilling Instructor who forms new recruits in basic training requires no interpretation. Straight forward, straight, front, all apply to this classic. At a time when the statements of our leaders have been analyzed, it is essential to understand what they are saying. This movie does not play with our language or our moral fiber. Right and wrong is clear and easy to describe. If you want a clear, well-known dialogue in a disciplined military environment, this movie should suit you.
