The standard carrier of all movie series, the definite good man - Flash Gordon - versus Bad Guy - Ming the Merciless. Moreover, although the special effects look terrible according to today's standards, it was for 1936. But the essence of the story is the battle between Aardman Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) versus Emporer Ming of Mongo (Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are great in their parts. And the supporting characters playing Dale Arden, Dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcan, and the rest are all very good. This series is much better than the 1980 movie, because Crabbe is much better than Sam J. Jones as Flash Gordon. <br /> <br /> This series is the standard carrier for all movie series. No problem about that.
