I first saw these docudrama in the UK in the 1980s, and I was intrigued and then amazed at how such good intentions could go wrong. Previous commentators (who are Australian) explained the details of the unfolding plot better than I could ever have, but I would like to comment on what may lie behind the governor-general's British Sovereignty. All modern laws, as I understand them, need an ethical or philosophical root to exist first and to become a law. If this is the case, and if the Conner's / Khemlani debris has been put in place (just how many businessmen / millionaires were served by Khemlani, presumably without complaint), then the Labor Court would have been the victim of "arrest" that would surely the governor-general had to be investigated as if or until he could see that the budget suppression was a real consequence of Whitlam's indifference, and NOT extensive inclusion, sponsored by a person or someone unknown '! If this were the case that Kerr did not refer to the law, because fiscal circumstances violate everything, 'royal power' is bound to be unreasonable; The implications in any Commonwealth country are that 'fiscal' rules literally regulate and that any person or organization has Carte Blanche to break any other rule, physically or mentally, as long as they eventually control the purse!
