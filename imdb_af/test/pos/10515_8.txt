I adore the Ln Chaney version of "Phantom" and I appreciate Webber's version as just for the growing interest in the book, wishing I find more of a mysterious scary spectacle with the romantic aspects being played. I do not admit that Andrew Lloyd Webber did not limit the relationship between Raoul and Christine. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, as it is a comic short with only Erik and Christine, this version doesn't even bother with any other characters. <br /> <br /> I thought I'd wait for another version that would fit Lon's performance. I was dead wrong. Leslie Nielson is fantastic like Erik, but of course it's a spoof. This is still brilliant. <br /> <br /> I especially appreciated that Erik looked more like a living body than an accident victim. I still have to watch a Phantom like that, except Lon's. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend it if you don't want spoofs. Because it should not be taken seriously in any way.
