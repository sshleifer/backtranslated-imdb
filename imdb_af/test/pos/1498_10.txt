Hearing back to the "good old days" of 1971, we can remember once again when we were treated to a whole season of Charles Chaplin at the Cinema. That's what the promotional guy mentioned when we saw him on someone's old talk show. (We can't just remember who it was, either MERV GRIFFIN or WOODY WOODBURY, one or the other!) The guest spoke about Sir Charles's circle and how his films have been since Los Angeles' former "Little Tramp" Estados Unidos, because he was an "unwanted alien." (No Schultz, he is NOT from another planet!) <br /> <br /> CHARLIE was considered a "subversive" because of his interest and open inquiry into various political and economic systems, all from the Anarchist movement of the 20s (and earlier), the Technocracy has socialism in its various forms, was a fair game for discussion at Chaplin's Hollywood parties, which of course the inclusion of the Soviet style, which we commonly call Communism. <br /> <br /> CONNECTION Mr Chaplin's predicament was both ashamed of one small detail and he has never become an American citizen. > <br /> ANY HOW, enough of this wallpaper already! <br /> <br /> Make it good to say he became "Persona Non Free" in the United States. . It was high time to get the old movies out of the car rolls and back to the Movie Houses. It will certainly be a good gesture by easily forgetting us and forgetting Americanos quickly. <br /> <br /> It will be a fine gesture for the big film maker; In addition, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts & Sciences planned to honor Chaplin with a special tribute during the Oscar Show of 1972. It would definitely be a sluggish but joyful pack of patos, great because America returned Charlie and awarded him a special academy lifetime achievement award for a worldwide TV audience in the Millions. <br /> <br /> BUT, it will be natural to promote the Chaplin season at the theater! (Remember, the Little Tramp was as sharp as a Bu $ ine man as he was as a movie maker!) The program consisted of performances of MODERN TIMES, CITY LIGHTS, THE GREAT DICTATOR, MONSEUR VERDOUX, " A KING IN NEW YORK and finally the CHAPLIN REVUE. We remember being excited about the multi-date film festival. <br /> <br /> In our fair city of Chicago, it's discussed for the Carnegie Theater on Rush Street. The festivals end with MODERN TIMES and all others will be shown one at a time, each one staying for any time needed to satisfy the public's desire to see each picture. As we recall, the last was on the schedule THE CHAPLIN REVUE. <br /> <br /> IN RETROSPECT, we look back and wish they started with REVUE. because there were undoubtedly legions of moviegoers (much like ourselves) who knew very little about his achievements in moving pictures, except for the regular feature keystone, Essanay and Mutual Silent Shorts, so many Kiddy Shows across the country. Oh, now, no one has consulted me again! <br /> <br /> CONCENTRATION on today's honored film, THE CHAPLIN REVUE, we found that it was actually three separate pictures; bound closely by the use of narrative by Chaplin (Himself), some vibrant Themes and Biblical Music (written by Chaplin again) and some happy talks and serious narration (Ditto, at Chaplin.) He opens the proceedings of some home movie-type films depicting the construction of the Chaplin Studio in Hollywood, as well as a movie taken from a rehearsal time. It shows director Chaplin exactly what he wants for a group of actors. <br /> <br /> This segment was well done and well received by the audience. Both the building's humor and rehearsal were enhanced by making them seem to accelerate. (The rehearsal is of course the building using the photographic process of the camera. The old trick makes it seem as though the buildings are building themselves. <br /> <br /> This shorts amalgam has three of Chaplin's short Comedies included in his stint with First National Photos, which is about 1917 to 1923. The choice was well thought out and gave us a wide variety of subject and mood. <br /> <br /> FIRST was SHOLER ARMS (Charles Chaplin Productions / First National Photos, 1918. As the title suggests, it is a story of World War I. Released in October 1918 about a month before the 11 November ceasefire day, it was a comedy of comic Army gags and a romance between Private Chaplin and a Frans Meisie (Miss Edna Purviance), the lifetime is fast, physical and in the old-fashioned tradition to plunder the enemy, the German army. <br /> <br /> an excellent example of old adage about children and dogs that me bring along, the next film A DOG'S LIFE (Chaplin Productions / First National, 1918) traces the parallel lives of Chaplin's Tramp and a newly adopted wandering, Scraps. The film story includes families, two of them. One Homo Sapiens, one Dog and both have us with some great surprises. <br /> <br /> The final, we have THE PILGRIM (Chaplin / First National, 1923) was a good choice to have the finals. It was bright, light and stiff. It was an excursion to the West Spoof area. Comedies of such a kind have been done since every comedian and team. The "Pilgrim" in the story is not of your standard thanksgiving variety; but rather a "dude" or "Tenderfoot" who ventured out of the West. The Tramp is not just that man; but his character is an escape convict who mistakenly thought to be the new minister of a western town church! <br /> <br /> Our rating (this is Schultz and Me) is ****. (It's four Derbies) <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
