Again, there are deadly government agencies that do nothing to prevent public knowledge of some important events. In this case, discovering a new underwater species that could threaten the planet's ecology. Although the creature has no E.T. He looks like he is one child, protecting it at all costs, not realizing it's just a baby of the species and going to grow bigger? and bathing This 2005 series went a long way. It's family drama, sci-fi, thriller with more than a few comic moments. The characters are credible, well-behaved and well-photographed. The show is paying attention. Of course, as with any sci-fi show, the suspension of unbelief must be achieved. And I think it's here. Unfortunately, the series crashed after the season, so we never get a resolution. Infuriating. There is a general comment that I make worth making here. Many TV networks and / or movie distribution companies cancel, fairly arbitrary, seemingly excellent TV series? especially intelligent sci-fi children. Now there can be many good reasons for this, although the audiences are treated with the greatest contempt and rarely tell the reasons. This in itself is irritating. What my goats really get is that they've canceled the series, then they give it as far as DVD is concerned, in an obvious effort to milk the cash cow as far as possible. For previous viewers of the series that are good, they know what they are in, but? Many of these unfinished series end up on a stone hanger. Two that are immediately emerging are "Surface" and "Odyssey 5". If you've heard good things about the series and haven't seen it, go and buy the exploded DVD and end up with an unresolved plot problem? it makes me very angry !! I really enjoyed the surface and didn't realize that poor characters would end up in a situation that seems totally unsustainable ?? and we will never know what happened. I believe there should be a prominent notice on all these DVD issues, which means the story is unfinished. Nowadays, I'm looking at TV series purchases (IMDB is a clear starting point) to determine if a 'full' range is really complete or not. Buyer beware.
