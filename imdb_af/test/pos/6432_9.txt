I recently had the pleasure of mr. Hauer at the 2005 Sarasota Film Festival for the US Prime Minister to meet this movie. He was not only gracious to maintain my copy of BLADE RUNNER, he took the time to answer questions about the film before he selected the room for a packaged theater. <br /> <br /> I was so impressed with the movie I used as the benchmark to compare all the other movies I saw at the festival. It was powerful and moving, but subtle and short. The film tells the story of how a young man (older version played by Rutger) one day enchanted himself by a seemingly ordinary room in an unbeatable building near the street. He walks through, he sees a single window, always open, from which a ghostly melody can be heard. Every day he passes through the room, sometimes he stands outside for hours, looks through the silk curtains fluttering in the light breeze, and hopes to have a look at his residents. By the end of the film we find out how important this room really is and what our protagonist has drawn on it. <br /> <br /> The movie is beautifully cut. Not a second of screen time was wasted on an uninteresting shot. Any single frame from the movie can stand alone in an art gallery. Rutger is wonderful. He is mysterious but approachable. His dialogue includes a series of reflections on a life-leading course for better or worse. His words express the familiar feelings and thoughts of the audience. I was especially moved by a scene in which he looked at some old photos, remembering his favorite dog, his favorite horse and his first love. You get the feeling that you are in his presence, as he allows you to see precious memories of a life that ends in his world. <br /> <br /> I loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh, intelligent and moving. Must be required to watch for all movie majors.
