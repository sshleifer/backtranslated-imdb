In Crystal City, a group of Mormons hire horse traders Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) as wagon masters to lead their caravan to the San Juan River. Along the journey they first met the broken wagon without water from the quack. Dr. A. Locksley Hall (Alan Mowbray) and the prostitute Denver (Joanne Dru) and Fleuretty Phyffe (Ruth Clifford). Then the sadistic exuberant Clegg boys decided to join the Mormon caravan to disguise the patrol run by Crystal City's Sheriff, which they were driving. When the Navajos cross their path, they are invited to visit their hamlet to a dance party. When the wagon train is near their destination, the Clegg boys threaten the settlers, forcing Sandy and Travis to make an attitude. <br /> <br /> "Wagon Master" is another great western of John Ford. The rides with the wagon train crossing the desert and the hills are impressive. The adventure of the group Mormons is funny and very entertaining and the songs fit well, though not dated. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Caravana dos Bravos" ("Caravan of the Braves")
