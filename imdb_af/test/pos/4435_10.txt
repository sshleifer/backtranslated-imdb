It is a profound and moving work about the creation of art, which is uniquely human and cannot be natural, the cost of genius and the search for transcendence and ultimately family, viz. We all make up. I was terribly terrified by the family discussion that Nathaniel had with his sisters about their father's shortcomings, as it was set in a beautiful home that apparently radiates heat created by Lou. And while Ester looks so cold in her discussion of Lou's inability to earn money, you can appreciate how she has been a counterweight to many of his impulses in his life. Nathaniel did a good job of showing how all the people fit into Lou's life and completed it and became so much of his work as his own genius. Yes, even, or perhaps especially, our failures make us who we are. And of course there are the buildings. I first knew Lou Kahn by name and didn't really link his name to his work, they are proof of grace. Perhaps one day there will be a building where we will all fit, and it will certainly look like a Lou Kahn building, perhaps the uninhabited temple in Jerusalem. Maybe there is salvation
