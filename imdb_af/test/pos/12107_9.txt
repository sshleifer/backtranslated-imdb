This movie offers you a fascinating journey through one of the most exciting cities of today - Istanbul - and its musicians. Don't expect a compilation of Turkish folklore or something like that. Alexander Hacke, a German musician and member of the cult group "Einst√ºrzende Neubauten" travels to Istanbul to get to know the music scene. His scant voice of what he is experiencing is a clue to the film. But mainly German-Turkish director Faith Akin speaks several artists from Istanbul - and of course their music. <br /> <br /> You meet a variety of personalities, big stars and street musicians, young and old, people who play many different styles of music. But this movie not only introduces you to the sound of Istanbul. It also draws a compelling picture of Istanbul today and how Turkey forged the past decade. The film characterizes its lead actors with subtle humor, but never without respect. Everyone shares a passion for music and faith in his power. <br /> <br /> Again, Akin shows his talent for portraying diversity lightly when he brings you close to completely different musical scenes. After his award-winning feature film "Gegen die Wand" (Head on), he proves that he has proved the "Bridge of the Bridge" that he can also touch, entertain and lead his audience in a documentary. If you have never been to Istanbul, you will want to go there after watching the movie.
