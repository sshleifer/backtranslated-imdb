"Man of the Year" tells the story of Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) a political comedian (such as Jon Stewart or Stephen Colbert) who has his own television program. On his performance he speaks of all sorts of things, but his main focus is political issues over which he has a lot of opinion. One day on his show, a fan of the audience raises the idea that Dobbs should run for president of the United States. After that episode, millions fled the web to create various petitions and vote on why Dobbs would make a good candidate for the president for the United States. A few weeks later, Dobbs decides to run for president and low and watch, the election wins. Everything looks as planned until a woman named Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) appears and begins to dispute about his position. A funny but serious political excitement ensues ?? <br /> <br /> Anyone who goes into this movie, expecting a mindless comedy, will surely be disappointed. I always wonder how some people are film markers when I see how they mislead marketing campaigns. "Man of the Year" is a good example of bad and misleading marketing because everything from the poster, trailer, online advertising makes this movie look like a comedy. I should honestly say that about 1/3 of the film is funny, while the rest of it plays as a political excitement that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think. I'm a kind of wonder in this case if the marketing has been deliberately done, as this movie addresses fairly serious issues between its comedy routine. <br /> <br /> But enough about marketing, we can come to the movie itself. <br /> <br /> I really liked "Man of the Year", although I did expect to see a comedy instead of a serious movie. One of the many things I will give this movie is that the film does a decent job that varies between comedy and drama, although it looks a bit uncomfortable at first. I really think that after you find out that the movie will be more of a political excitement than a comedy you get comfortable with. Some may not because they lead the belief that they are seeing a comedy and do not understand what this film is finally trying to say, but for those people they can blame the marketers for not advertising this film properly. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" talks about many things and has a very strong opinion. As Tom Dobbs speaks, he says things that need to be said and not about sweets. I also think the whole political subplot, while most critics have probably hurt the film again due to misleading marketing, was very good. The idea of ​​voting voices has been thrown over the past few years and with all the problems the problem has addressed in this movie, it can surely be realistic. Also the control of large businesses has voice, is also addressed. <br /> <br /> As far as that goes, I think everyone did a good job. Robin Williams had a chance to be funny while still being serious about playing Tom Dobbs. Some say that Williams overestimated his welcome as a comedian, but I personally still think he's funny and he's also a good serious actor. This is probably one of the few occasions, although we see him going back and forth from serious to funny and I think it works well. It's also nice to see Lewis Black's fellow star in a decent movie. Once again, I like Black when he appears on The Daily Show and stands up, but most of the movies he was in were horrible. It was a good movie for him because I think his political views fit the story of director Barry Levinson. Laura Linney is a good addition to the movie and again proves she is a very good actress and eventually Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum both do a very good job as always with these roles handed to them. <br /> <br /> "Man of the Year" was written and directed by Barry Levinson, the man who brought our films such as Rain Man, Good Morning Vietnam and Wag the Dog. Levinson does a good job of writing and directing the film. As I said, I know many critics did not have the whole political excitement of the film, but I thought it fit nicely. It was really nice to watch a mainstream movie that allowed me to think and laugh at the same time. Barry Levinson did a good job with this movie. <br /> <br /> In the end, this movie isn't going to see the movie that sells the ads. It laughed, but at the same time it played more than a political drama. It's not as stupid or stupid as the marketing campaign leads to believe. I really liked the fact that this movie was not a typical Hollywood movie. At the same time, it was a comedy and a serious drama and at least worked for me. I like the fact that the movie didn't really come up with any of the issues it addressed, or it had a typical Hollywood ending. I tried to call the end, but surprisingly it didn't end the way I thought it made me happy. It's a movie that makes you laugh, but then you can think for a few minutes and wonder what will happen next. I think it's a good movie that will be hurt by its bad marketing.
