After just once and in the mornings, I can't forget this haunting movie. A mixture of mystery, tension and heartbreaking romance, reminds me of Vertigo. The actors, although not known, are good, especially Joan Hackett, in one of her best performances. You believe in her, in her love, in her newly found quest for freedom brought by her love, and ultimately into her overwhelming pain. The plot is ingenious and compelling and does not extend credibility. The direction and technical stuff can definitely be better, but they do not endanger the overall effect. And it has one message: do not blind revenge, you may have become his last victim. A real pity, it has not been tackled again, but perhaps it is a period piece better alone.
