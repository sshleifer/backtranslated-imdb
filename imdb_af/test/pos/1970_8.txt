I saw this movie twice and its theme is a refreshing one. I've been in computers for years and this movie has inspired me technologically, just like a fresh love that has set the furnace of my poetic passion in the heat of paralysis. Very original idea, great surprise in the way it holds you as it tells you, is the story of thoughts that need a release from the daily realities of this life.
