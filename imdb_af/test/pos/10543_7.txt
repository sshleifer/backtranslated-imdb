Perhaps the best film ever made by director Kevin Tenney (well, his Witchboard is not on my horror list). This one is a strange, fascinating mix between Pin and Child's Play, both better than this one, but not so much better. Sure, the plot is confronted and perhaps too predictable, but the actors are good. Rosalind Allen is very pleasing to the eye (and so is Candance McKenzie - God bless her for the shower scene!), The actress is very good at interpreting The disturbed daughter and the Pinocchio puppet are terrifying to bring you some excitement to give the spine. For a B movie not bad at all.
