I read the book in a summer book club, and we all loved it. My friends from that club agreed not to watch the movie, so the book was not destroyed. I didn't agree, and recently watched it with my younger brother and my parents. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised. The film was very true to the book, without losing its own spirit. The 'new child' theme has just been shown enough to make us feel it, but it's not about the story. <br /> <br /> The acting wasn't the best I've ever seen, but it was still good, and the kids had a lot of energy. The characters were interesting, and the plot was cute and not over-emphasized. It was a children's movie that also works well for adults or teenagers. <br /> <br /> I wish there was a bit more tough girl attitude from Beatrice, but she was still a great character. Mullet Fingers was pretty much like I imagined him, except that his hair was a bit obvious, with blond hair and dark eyebrows. Roy worked very well as the little boy and the new child, especially interacting with his parents and friends. <br /> <br /> The message and the end (which I will not discuss other than what I like) worked together to make a wonderful movie for a rainy day. All in all, it was a good movie that you can watch again and again when you have to remember that the world is not a horrible place.
