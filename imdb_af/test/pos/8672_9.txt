One of the best movies I've ever seen, exactly in his vision, and beautiful and highly imaginative in his realization. I can't say much without giving it away, and I don't recommend reading that movie really much before you see it. Look. <br /> <br /> But ah, it must be ten lines of text to see a review listed on IMDb. Riddle. What can I do? Tell you about the movie? Nope. Can't do that. I think I enjoy this movie exactly because it has been without prejudice. Please do the same. <br /> <br /> I suppose it can be said: the play is excellent and underestimated, and what I have come to love for foreign films is that the movies are actually about the movie, not the stars.
