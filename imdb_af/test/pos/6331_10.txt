Although it is not exactly a comedy in the ordinary sense of the word, it is more rewarding than any movie full of laughter, but without substance. I don't think Bergman's movies can easily be classified under now genres, even the lightest is fairly complex. This movie in spite of its light touch presents a series of problems with regard to marriage and its shortcomings and what happens when the flames begin to die. I don't really communicate personally with all these issues, as I'm sure others do. But the atmosphere of the movie is extraordinary, you hardly wish to end it. I have to admit that I was swept away by the Bergman from the fifties, because he learned most of his later groundbreaking efforts. For Nykvist, von Sydow, Ulman etc., the master produced some of the richest, hot and up-to-date movies I've ever seen. Although it is a long shot, I have seen this kind of love for humanity, in its complexity, only in Fellini's films of the same period. A love reading with the smile of a summer night is worth seeing for Bergman fans, having the full picture of the man's abilities, and for those who love a theater with a heart. May he rest in peace!
