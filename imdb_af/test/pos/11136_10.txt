I have seen and enjoyed the Chameleon movies, and I have to say they are getting better and better with each one. Bobbie Phillips is fantastic and my granddaughter wants to be like her. I'm glad they brought a "Brother" character to Bobbie (Kam) so we can expect to see more exciting shows. Bobbie is beautiful, sexy and sweet, and independent at the same time, and everything a woman wants to be!
