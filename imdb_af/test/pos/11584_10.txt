As I expected, too many reviews of this film (from professional and amateurs) focused as much as it was on the film's ideology. This is because The Sea Inside (aka Mar adentro) is a movie about euthanasia. Specifically, it is a true story of a notorious Galician name Ramón Sampedro, who fought for years for the right to help suicide, which it refused right by the Spanish State Court and who - well, I do not want to destroy the end of the movie for you. <br /> <br /> Real life Sampedro has catalysed a national debate on euthanasia in Spain. Now there is another rhetorical help in the international debate on this hot button problem with producer / director / writer / composer / editor Alejandro Amenábar (Abre Los Ojos, 1997 and The Others, 2001) "biopic", The Sea Inside. <br /> <br /> But as I still say (deaf ears?), your opinion, pro or con, on the film's ideology shouldn't affect your judgment of the movie. You should not judge the philosophical or political messages that Amenábar wants to make. You have to judge the movie as a movie. Perhaps it is a little too idealistic, because none of us can probably completely separate our evaluations from our ideological bias, but ideally or not. That's the purpose. <br /> <br /> For a moment, forget about the philosophical and political issues. As a film, Amenábar has so far changed into one of his most elegant and mature works. He does not focus on social debates. He does not focus on Sampedro's legal / political struggle. He focuses on Sampedro as a man who limits his days to a bed in his brother's home. <br /> <br /> Sampedro, played here in an incredible performance by Javier Bardem, was a quadriplegic. As the film begins, he has been a quadriplegic for 26 years. This condition arose, as Amenábar showed us through wonderful jumps, through a dive accident. Sampedro was diverted by a beautiful woman, penetrated the water, pigeon, snapped his neck and almost drowned. As a quadriplegia, he eventually began writing poetry, some of which were published in a book entitled Cartas Desde El Infierno ("Letters from Hell"); In real life, Sampedro's book became a best seller in Spain. Perhaps Sampedro's artistic work as a clue, Amenábar created an elegant poetic film. <br /> <br /> Most of The Sea Inside is in Sampedro's bedroom. The focus in these scenes is Bardem's complex and sublime performance. As a quadriplegia, Bardem is confined to his head and speaks. He mastered subtle changes of expression and clash to convey a deep character with a polygonal, intellectual approach to life. Bardem and Amenábar often have a philosophical approach to Sampedro in suppressed speech, but there is always a combination of a bad sense of humor, passion for aesthetics - including music and women, and a sad and even bitterness not far below the surface. Different underlying emotions occasionally break like waves on the ocean's skin. <br /> <br /> The people who connect Sampedro with each other complex it in complex ways. The others included his son-in-law, Manuela (Mabel Rivera), who had been his chief invigilator since Sampedro's accident; his brother, José (Celso Bugallo), who is one of the voters of Sampedro's desire to die, and with whom there is an underlying unsolved matter (José seems to be the one who can save Sampedro from drowning?); his cousin, Javier (Tamar Novas), who may be the most understanding of him; a legal representative, Gené (Clara Segura); a pro bono attorney, Julia (Belén Rueda), whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease, CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Artery Therapy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) and thus would be more empathetic and in love with him; and Rosa (Lola Dueñas), a local woman working on a framework and working as a DJ, who has heard of him from the media, who wants to convince him to live and who falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> Most of the film is made up of these characters who interacted with Sampedro in his room. There are also a few other additional characters, including Sampedro's father, who stays strange, and a notorious and media-conscious priest, Padre Francisco (José María Pou), who does his best to make Sampedro's thoughts through philosophy / theology. Changes (in a scene are often mistaken for "comic" - it has an attractive comic element, but the scene is very serious.) <br /> <br /> That most of the movies in Sampedro's room occurs, the couple is making significant changes to make a bigger impact. Sampedro's room has a nice, large window, which he says he is happy with as a sight on the world. Perhaps more importantly, he often imagines the window as a launching platform through which he flies over the hills to the ocean, which he has always loved and been the most influential in his life - it delivered his life when he was younger and had his mobility departed. Amenábar gives us a fantastic series of Sampedro that represents one of its flights to the sea. It is beautifully shot, with low angles (presumably from a helicopter) of the hills running, until we follow a stream to the wide open sea, which in this film represents freedom, the infinite and natural forces. <br /> <br /> The other significant change of environment eventually comes to a wheelchair with Sampedro (he otherwise refused them and said they "mocked his impossibility") to make an appearance in court. to help his case. Amenábar gives us a gripping, melancholy travel report, a subjective shot of the Sampedro viewing life and the world in action from the car window. <br /> <br /> Whether you agree with the legalization of euthanasia or not, it's hard to deny that it's a well-educated, well-written and well-crafted film. You may not believe it is a ten (and it's even more unlikely if you disagree with the legalization of euthanasia), but it's still worth looking at as a good example of artistic, sophisticated film -up.
