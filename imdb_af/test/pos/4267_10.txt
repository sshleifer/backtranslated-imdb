I watch tons of movies and have no idea it would be as good as it was. I looked forward to reading the plot (although I overestimated Nirvana). It sounded like it would be a lot of fun, but it was more than that. Jansen is in little touches like the books (including Kubrick's book), movies, etc. I like when I see a director take his time and put his heart in a movie. And you can really feel it. There are scenes and moments that I love, I am now trying to think of other movies that are like this and I would say that the only thing I can think of is Cameron Crowe movies. Take small moments and let them stand out and special. The soundtrack is great and every song works perfectly with the scenes and the feel of the movie. This movie is incredibly shot, and the editing is outstanding. I could really go over and over the movie. I really can't recommend it. If you want a fun story with big songs from a director who puts his work clearly in his work, watch it out.
