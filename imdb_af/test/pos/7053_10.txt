Imagine spending the summer without your family or friends from school and meeting new people. Or it is your first time you are no one and the only person you can count on is someone from the camp. "Meatballs" pack a lot of comedy in this movie. In the camp there is an eccentric adviser (Bill Murray) who knows how the boys and girls can have a good time. Type a child named Rudy (Chris Makepeace) who has no one to look at. He doesn't fit in with anyone, only Tripper can have fun with him. The rest of the look is just as crazy as Tripper. Camp Northstar is an average camp with an above average team. The other hand, Camp Mohawk, is an elite camp that runs their money. In the basketball game the Mohawks became pants! And in the Olympiad, the Northstar cricket got the revenge they needed when one of the members took out the saboteur. And Morty (Harvey Atkin), this poor soul can never get him in gear if he tried. A very, very funny comedy, and it's a big keeper I will say. This movie shows that the camp can be fun if you want to be! 5 stars!
