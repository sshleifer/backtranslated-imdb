Clint Eastwood is big in this strain of 1993. With an absolute master of the edge of your seat tension, Wolfgang Peterson, Eastwood, delivers just as he can. Also, John Malkovich goes on my list of the most effective screenshots in the history of theater as the demented killer. As for Rene Russo as Clint's love interest, I think Kirk Douglas said it best when he said, referring to his own career, "I'm getting older, and my leading ladies are getting younger." This movie is a very effective thriller with enough plot moves and surprises to keep you. Eastwood and Peterson need to work together more often. Top notch movie.
