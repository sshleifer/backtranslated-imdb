The only reason the Duke Is Tops, one of several "movies" made during the segregation, will be worth it today is because it made the movie message from 21-year-old singer Lena Horne. She plays Ethel Andrews, a singer who has to leave her producer mentor Duke Davis (Ralph Cooper) to spend the great time. However, Davis has to take the money for her services in front of her, so she doesn't feel sorry for doing so. He then haunts Doc Dorando (Lawrence Criner) for a series of medicines that are displayed throughout the south. In the meantime, her new manufacturers in New York have been bombarded for a long time because they made her the whole show rather than just the specialty law. Davis finds out the radio and offers his services as producer and band leader to bring his range of other specialty actions. Many of them make them one of them few or only movie performances here, as he is the chance to play with Ethel at the big time. him. Guess what happens? While the plot is the kind you saw in thousands of other movie musicals during this time, the fact that it was made for a certain audience is one of the more fascinating features I have seen during this Black History Month. Mrs. Horne's singing is on a good performance here and it is interesting to see her so young before her professionalism perseveres later in her career. Among other supporting players, there is an unconfirmed, according to IMDb, the appearance of Lillian Randolph, Annie in my favorite movie. It's a wonderful life and sister of Amanda Randolph I just saw in the musical short The Black Network, like the woman with Sciatica complaining not to be healed after the doctor's medicine was taken before Duke explained it's for the feet not! And as a Louisiana resident, I'd like to take note of two players from this point in this movie: Joel Fluellen of Monroe as a tonic and Marie Bryant of New Orleans as the sexy dancer who appears near the musical climax. So just for Lena Horne, The Duke is Tops, it's worth seeing at least once.
