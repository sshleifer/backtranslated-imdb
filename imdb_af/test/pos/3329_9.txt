Tex Avery's term as director of cartoons for MGM was one of the finest moments in cartoon history in the 1940s and 50s. His cartoons were extremely inventive and surrealistic with a lot of strange touches later celebrated in the movie THE MASK. Eyes that protrude when a man sees a girl, impossible stunts and non-stop action were the brands of these movies. <br /> <br /> This is one of the Droopy cartoons that Avery was responsible for and it's among its best. Droopy is a Mountie and he is determined to get his husband, but in this case it is a wolf who escaped from prison. Droopy keeps up with this crook throughout the film, despite many insane stunts, until finally the wolf throws up, because Droopy is apparently everywhere! Full of funny gags and loaded with laughter, it's a great cartoon.
