This film is one of the best memories I have of childhood. If I always loved Tiere, my mom took me to see it. <br /> <br /> It's absolutely wonderful. It's one of those movies that makes a lasting impression on you. The image of Tigers running through the snow and spraying everything is still 25 years in my mind, not many movies have succeeded. Like other comments, photography is amazing. A must see. I've been searching for the movie for some time without any luck. :-( To watch Amazon from time to time, reveal nothing, not even listed. If someone knows about a source, contact me or post here. Tim
