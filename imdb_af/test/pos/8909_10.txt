In fact, the nature of the whole series is irreparably funny! But not always funny ... there are moments of extreme poignance, as the deeper aspects of human emotion are touched. <br /> <br /> Over and over, the series reacts to the injuries of human nature and the lifelong, or in this case, eternal struggle to overcome them. Monkey is both smart and stupid at the same time, his arrogance and confidence in his own fighting skills is causing him almost every episode. Pigsy is just plain gross. Sandy has a philosophical mindset. He has lots of wittiest lines. <br /> <br /> The English translation is a pleasure. "Ignorance can always be improved," Sandy pulls back, "but you can't do anything to help stupidity!" "Who are you?" The group of travelers is asked. "We are three kings of the East," says Monkey. <br /> <br /> It's not just for kids, it's a magical skirt for anyone who can suspend reality
