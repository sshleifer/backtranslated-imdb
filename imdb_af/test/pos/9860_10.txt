New York's moving image museum recently made a comprehensive retrospective of Jacques Rivette's films. After falling in love with his "Paris Nous Appartient", I decided not to miss it. <br /> <br /> Largely through extensive shots and flexible structured scenes, the movie shows two avant-garde theater companies preparing their performances. by Aeschylus' 'Seven Against Thebes' and' Prometheus'. In addition, we pointed out the pointless lifelong lives of two individuals who are detached from the companies: a working woman named Frederique, who finds creative ways to enchant men from their money and a young man named Colin who visits local cafes as deaf bucket, and play shrill accordion with the customers until they pay him to leave. The first four hours or so are devoted to the establishment of the characters and their patterns, before a somewhat loose, whimsical plot finally emerges with a conspiracy and decoding of secret secret letters. <br /> <br /> The movie is mainly about life on the edge of society. The theater companies are a desperate relationship, using their extensive, emotional finishing exercises (which is actually something to watch) to derive from the fact that their deeds are unlikely to ever be performed or even seen. Colin and Frederique both have very few friends, who only get a little excitement or purpose after the conspiracy, as they are encouraged to get more out of it. The film meditates on the consequences of the rejection of normal society in several memorable rows, including a long shot of Colin while wandering the streets of France to shout poetry for himself. As such, the film is referred to as a 1960s counterculture analysis. <br /> <br /> There is no film framework that does not burst with energy and vitality. The fact that much of the dialogue and movement is improvised makes the characters much more spontaneous, much more immediately. The camera also becomes an important character in this regard; Throughout the film tree shadows, here and there, or other similar faults, are visible, but of course they look and match the flow of action because the camera is so important to a player in it. <br /> <br /> More than anything for me, the movie looks a good example of another way to make movies, a place for film outside the regular pattern. For me, this was a thought-opening experience, even more so than "Paris Nous Appartient," although the latter carry many similarities to structure and structure. A must-see for anyone about the nature of the art.
