Definitely worth the rent! Good clean family entertainment. My 4 and 5 year olds (and I) loved it. Keep them on the edge of their seats. I recommend that parents sit with their younger children to see it, as it can be quite stressful for them. It's not too often that you can see movies you can see with your kids, and that's why it's a rare find. Some of the acting / realism is sometimes not quite there, or maybe it's a little wreath, but kids don't look like they are, they like it. Parts are predictable, but other parts aren't like trying to find out who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. The movie doesn't have a lot of scary / creepy stuff, and so I doubt it will give children nightmares. It inspires children to dream, and that is something we should encourage and promote in our children. Rent and be blessed!
