From a perspective that it is possible to make films that do not offend people with strong moral values, this one is definitely worth it. This is the second Bruce Willis movie in a row to tell his story with no nudity, horrible humor, curse or free violence. (Of course I refer to The Sixth Sense.) Both movies work on more than one level. This one is also suitable for children, but as others have pointed out, it is not a movie for children. <br /> <br /> I was bothered by the fact that the timing device that manages this plot is never explained, except we know Russell is initiating it as a 70-year-old. Why should his dying mother also come to school to get him when he wins the battle; why, if his parent himself says, he must fight that child again and again for the next few years, his mother should not get him every time, and why he does not teach buttocks in the process. I also found the score rather annoying and not always suitable for action on stage. <br /> <br /> Good use of the red plane as a metaphor, however.
