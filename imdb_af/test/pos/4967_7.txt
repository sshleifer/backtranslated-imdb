For the first time, I challenged Jennifer in the city in the middle of the night while he was out of town. I fell asleep before it ended, but it held me until I had to find it. The appeal is, but there is not much of it, it weighs an intriguing atmosphere, and because Ida Lupino and Howard Duff are currently displaying an attractive, low key chemistry. Lupino is playing a housewife - sitting in a large California estate, whose former caretaker - Jennifer - disappeared. (Shades of Jack Nicholson in the Shining, but in this case it is not Lupino who goes or is crazy). Duff is the man in the town who manages the estate's finances and Lupino shines, who decides to play hard. She is becoming more and more involved, not to be obsessive, with what happened to her predecessor in the old dark house full of descending stairs and closed cellars. The atmospheric and romantic addiction is by far the best part of the movie, since viewers are likely to find the resolution a bit of a fall - there is not much (except a little frisson at the tail end that Brian expects De Palma cinematic codes). But it's done well, and again, it bumps you. Extra added attraction: this is the movie that launched the song "Angel Eyes", which would be part of Ol 'Blue Eyes' standard repertoire.
