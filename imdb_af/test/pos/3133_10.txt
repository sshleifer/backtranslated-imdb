Two horse dealers come to a village and meet with the leader of a group of Mormons who are praying for a valley where they can settle and live in peace. The scenes of the coral in the town where Ward Bond and Ben Johnson negotiate prizes, and Bond suggest the idea. (Johnson and his partner played by Harry Carey Jr.) leading the train to this valley are among the best in the movie, like Johnson, a real cowboy, splashing wood while spoiling Bond. Once they get on the trail, they come across Joanne Dru, who might have seen John Ford in the Red River, and offered her a much better part in this movie. In the Morman train are a number of notable characters. The Mormans are a peaceful group who are challenged on the way by a really low-life group. In their case (the illegal), in the case of people on the train, and later a group of Navajos they meet, and in the well-written characters played by Ben Johnson and Ward Bond, the stereotypes are completely evaded, while the camera seems to be spending so much time giving the viewer the great picture of Monument Valley that trains the train. It moves along with some waterways along the road, in beautiful black and white and then back to what happens in this rolling community, all to the guidance of the beautiful vocalisations of the Pioneer's sons.
