I have this movie locally caught. At 4:30 I didn't have expectations for that, but after the opening credits I knew I was good. <br /> <br /> There are situations left for your interpretation to "figure out" what really happens, so your attention is a key factor. <br /> <br /> The whole psychic thrill situation is very much about character development and the way things are done by the main character. <br /> <br /> Your sub-concert also plays an important role, because through a series of events and dialogs you can make a correct interpretation and create an opinion. <br /> <br /> The technical aspects are very good. Really good, in fact. Kelly Overtone is extremely sexy and she is candy for the eye, though most of the time she is in her white clothes. <br /> <br /> The fear factor is almost non-existent, but there is a lot of secrecy and excitement to dig out. <Br /> <br /> I would recommend it to those who enjoy supernatural and psychological tension.
