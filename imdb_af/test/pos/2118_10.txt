I loved this movie. My daughter is 3 1/2 and a country girl of heart. There are no movies for young children. I loved this one because the worst in it was when one of the boys said "stupid". I applaud them for walking out and making a real family movie. I rented it for the first time, and we saw it and knew how to buy to add to our collection. My daughter can't stop talking. It goes with our lifestyle. We live in East Texas. I hope to see more family movies like this one. She even calls one of our calves "Hokey Pokey Keen" !!! I can't say enough about this movie. I look forward to many more movies like this one.
