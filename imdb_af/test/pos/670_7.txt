Ida Lupino is caught in her own home by the crazy Robert Ryan in "Beware, My Lovely", a 1952 film by RKO. Lupino and Ryan worked together three films and worked well as a team, as well as perfectly professional and strong artists. In this movie, based on a Broadway game called "The Man," Lupino is a widow of World War I renting a room in her home. She is very active and popular in her community and although her husband has been dead for two years, she is not ready to continue. The man who rented her room went on holiday, and Lupino rented Robert Ryan to help her with some heavy cleaning in the house. He is kind enough to start, but later she terrorizes her, closes her home and does not allow her to answer the phone or the door, as he becomes violent and becomes more of reality. <br /> <br /> The character played by Ryan is shown at the beginning of the movie as he discovers a dead body in another house in which he works. It is not clear whether he is the killer, because he looks surprised to see the body. He may be a split personality, as when his personality gets ugly towards Lupino, it seems he doesn't like his activities when he comes out. He doesn't know he has the keys to Lupino's house in his pocket and doesn't know why he has tickets for a festival he bought from young children coming to the door. <br /> <br /> "Beware, My Lovely," is a very exciting movie, and the two leaders give great performances. The tension builds on a very high level and ends in a way you don't expect.
