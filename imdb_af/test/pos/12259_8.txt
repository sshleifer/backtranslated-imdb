Sparkling journalist Holly Hunter produces investigative news reports for an important news network. She is a motorized maverick, brilliant at her job and with little time for romantic relationships. Fill in William Hurt and Albert Brooks, two men who love her. <br /> <br /> Brooks is an old school journalist who worships Holly because she represents everything about journalism. They both believe the media exists to test the gods, educate the public and fight the truth. Children of the sixties, they embodied hippy values. They are defenders of the public good. Knights fighting with pen and camera. <br /> <br /> In contrast, William Hurt is a much more complex character. Initially uncomfortable, clumsy and self-defeating, he reveals himself as a sexy and manipulative high achiever, capable of climbing the corporate ladder. Unlike Holly and Brooks, he is symbolic of modern media values: news as spectacle, journalism as entertainment, news anchor as celebrity, truth as subject to the bill. We want to despise him and his blip-time junk food journalism, but we can't do it. He plays the game according to his own rules. Do we condemn him for missing a moral backbone? Do we condemn the game? Can the game exist if its rules are not obeyed? How did these rules develop? <br /> <br /> It's not Lumet's and Chayefsky's "Network", and so the film never answers or addresses these questions. Content to keep things at the level of light comedy ends with Hurt being promoted to the London section and Brooks is switched to a small community network. Holly, after rejecting both men, remains trapped between them. The last bastion of media integrity, this mock reporter remembers her roots, grieves the loss of Brooks and warns herself of trying out future William Hurts. <br /> <br /> It's a nice ending, but compared to the "Network" movie looks positive. Chayefsky's vision is one in which global media offer less meaningful information, in spite of its omnipresence. He provides a world in which globalization has cultured cultures, information is subject to corporatisation and a handful of media monopolies control all international news. It is a world in which truth is subject to shareholder meetings and economic interests. A world in which viewer ratings determine content and polls dictates top stories. <br /> <br /> Perhaps that's why "Broadcast News", longing for the glory days of journalism, ends up on such a bittersweet note. It knows what the future holds. Made in 1987, it has been living for a decade. <br /> <br /> But today, in the digital era, it's even worse. Mergers and acquisitions dominated a very small number of large companies that dominate the communications landscape. Through this, the hyper-commercialism of content, but the barrier between the creative / editorial side and the commercial side, collapsed. Today, everyone may start their own blog or website, but it's grass roots. As the communication reaches the individual (due to technological advances - email, internet, electricity, airmail, etc.) increase the size of the individual's world as well. He must try his voice both further and harder, struggling with the dark white noise, the unceasing verbal static that is the global community. <br /> <br /> In the end, you need two things according to democratic theory. Firstly, you need a strong rise of people in power and people who want to be in control, both in the private and public sectors. Secondly, you need a wide range of informed opinions on all the important issues of the day. In a democratic society, the media system as a whole must produce this kind of culture. Unfortunately, the structure we currently have in the global system works directly against the needs of democratic journalism and democratic society. <br /> <br /> 8/10 ?? It's light stuff, but a funny script, a few funny moments and a short comedy by Jack Nicholson, elevate it to most other journalism films. Interestingly, unlike most movies on the media, it never plunges into satire, rather than a straightforward love triangle. <br /> <br /> Worth watching.
