This movie is excellent! Fear of watching documentary movies? Cancel your shrink and look at the little Dieter's story. You won't believe how fascinating this fine piece of movie production is until you've experienced it. I'm eager to say that it's even almost any Vietnam war movie, including Apocalypse Now. It's a real story, it's a personal story, a story about the love of flying, the dream of being a pilot, and the nightmare of shooting down the enemy's territory. Everything is shot in a "return to ..." style. Herzog asked the questions, Dieter answered them in an unforgettable German-English accent, and with a good memory shows what happened about 25 years ago. There is this part I have told friends time and time again: Dieter becomes a POW of Vietcong. Blindly for most of the days, he is dragged through the Southeast Asian jungle for miles and miles - barefoot. Tortured, insulted, disoriented, hungry, and covered with infectious wounds, they come in a small, friendly village to spend the night. The next morning, after walking for a few hours, someone discovered Dieter his wedding ring of his finger. This is it. He can't take it anymore. He began to cry, due to complete exhaustion. The Vietcong men are surprised. Dieter manages to explain what happened. Immediately the group came back to the town and started looking for the person who stole the ring. They found the man, instantly cut his finger and dropped the ring back to Dieter. - The movie is full of these elevated and surprising situations. The enormous cultural differences, the clash of East and West, the fear of the unknown (that is, America standing on the one side, the Asian jungle and its secrets on the other) can be the whole movie. Back problems? That's because you've been sitting on the edge of your seat for two hours and haven't noticed.
