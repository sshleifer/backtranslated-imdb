Erika Kohut is a woman with deep sexual problems. At the start of the film we see her come home. When her older mother protests, Erika enters into a madness, without sorry to attack the older woman. Erika, as it turns out, is a musical teacher of a certain celebrity in the conservatory where she teaches. When we see her next time, she is the model of tranquility, but she shows a cruel side in the way she attacks a young male student because she feels he is wasting his time and hair. The same goes for unsafe Anna, a talented girl who hates Erika, maybe because she sees a promise in the young woman she doesn't want to promote. <br /> <br /> At the end of the day we watch Erika as she goes into an entertainment area and goes to one of the huts where pornographic material is shown. Erika is transferred if she sees the things being done on the screen. On another occasion, Erika comes to a walkway where a movie is underway. Her attention goes to a parked car in which two lovers perform a sex action. The camera hangs on Erika as she falls in love and watches what the two lovers do, until she is surprised by the young man in the car. Erika was scary scared she was discovered. <br /> <br /> When an affluent couple invites Erika to perform in a recital in their cute home, she meets an excited young man, Walter, who is related to the host. Walter is immediately taken with Erika's play; The young man himself is a talented pianist. Her eagerness to compliment Erika is met by her skepticism. Walter decides to audition for Erika's master class and is accepted. <br /> <br /> Thus, Walter's quest for Erika, which is surprising when she realizes what the young man's motives really are, starts. Erika, in turn, begins to fantasize at Walter in ways that can only imagine her thoughts and what she wants him to do when and when they come together. Walter is turned off by the letter Erika wrote to him, describing sexual acts that contradict the young man. <br /> <br /> The movie's end reminds us of the last order of Mr Haneke's current "Cache". We are taken to a concert hall where Erika will perform. She is seen as a stall in the veranda looking for the arrival of Walter, who goes into the hall without noticing her. Erika's expression on the camera reveals much more of her state of mind in the last minutes of the film. Leaving the lobby after contracting a wound, the camera leaves her and concentrates on the facade of the building that has long been on the screen. <br /> <br /> "La Pianiste" is a personal victory for Isabelle Huppert. This wonderful actress does one of her best appearances on the screen, led by the special hand of Michael Haneke, one of the most interesting directors working today. Mrs. Huppert works with economic gestures, but she projects so much of her soul as she burns the screen with her Erika. <br /> <br /> The supporting film is wonders under the director's guidance. Annie Girardot, always excellent, is perfect like Erika's mother. She looks the key to everything that went wrong with her daughter. There is a hint of incest that is played in the context of the film with subtlety. Benoit Magimel is perfectly thrown as Walter. This young actor does a wonderful job in the film as the young man, so in love with a woman owned by demons, that he will never be able to chase or get to love him in a normal way. /> <br /> Michael Haneke movies are always disturbing to watch, but they offer so many rewards because he dares to go where other men do. The brilliant music heard in the film is mainly by Schubert and Schumann, two composers who are Erika's own favorites. The film is greatly helped by Christian Berger's cinematography.
