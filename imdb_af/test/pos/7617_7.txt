Very sad, I can relate to this movie, as I am 17, and I still have to be kissed, so I really feel Josie. It was a while since I saw this movie, but to write this review, I watched it again and remember everything I liked about it. <br /> <br /> Drew Barrymore is a great actress, and this role suited her very well. at that stage. The chemistry between Sam and Josie was really good, and Michael Vartan was an excellent actor in this. <br /> <br /> I also loved the storyline - as I said there, I can endure it and it's hardly a movie you can talk about completely. <br /> <br /> Everything about it - I loved it. 10/07
