<br /> <br /> Being a teenager, I have about 100 years of movies to catch up with. I try to see a mix of classic, mainstream, art house and other movies. The 70's is one of the most important decades for movies: this is when the average, general, classic films have turned into full messages and anti-social behavior. It has become like no one has ever seen. What has been under the influence for a decade is the importance of all the movies from The Graduate to Star Wars. <br /> <br /> Richard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme are the primary interviewers in this documentary, interviewing people like Dennis Hopper, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman and Jon Voight, including how that couple years changed cinema forever. It's a very professional, polished documentary, and it's even funded by IFC movies. However, being a very professional one, I think they will at least save the noise of someone behind the camera. For me it worked out very well, how neat and clean the whole thing was. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, it's a very interesting documentary, about film by the people who make it. Of course, they don't make their own films or anything, but they are honesty about what they thought of the movies and what they meant. I don't know much about film (but I want to get involved if I'm an adult), so I feel like someone like me. This movie is a great asset. I saw a good number of movies they mentioned, such as Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but a little more insight into those movies was very informative. <br /> <br /> The main reason, but I don't have a love The influence is as smooth as it was edited, it seems its time is in the beginning and relax and therefore does not have enough time to get everything they wanted to show. They have packed into Star Wars and Jaws in the last few minutes, when they were two of the most important. It seemed as if they were trying too hard to show lots of cuts, and that's good, but some of them were unimportant, like an extensive one from Network. Overall, though, Influence is a very exciting, informative documentary that helped me at least learn about a second 'golden age' in the American cinema. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7/10 <br /> <br /> R for language, and images of sexuality, violence and drug use.
