Watched it on British TV for the first time, with good musical accompaniment. The elevator scene is classy, ​​especially when he does the turn-off thing in the phone box and then clings to the floor indicator. The jump through the transom is really impressive, and there is so much more. Apart from all the things that have been mentioned before, there is the battle with the man who has harassed the woman with the dog - it looks just as simple. The only downside is the plot - it is mixed with Dead Eye Dan, which then escapes, but does not appear again, even when some gangsters later become involved. The scene where he seems to be shooting at the fat inspector is funny, but would have been better if Dead Eye was the one pulling the trigger.
