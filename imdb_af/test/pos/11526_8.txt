I loved it. I just sat down half of the "The Glass House" (it turned off ... god being a morass of predictable plot and bad acting) and then I saw this movie. I thought it was great. Love both Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster in it. I love the escape of the whole area, traveling in Europe in the 60's. Yet they made it more realistic by showing the dark side and all the bad things that could happen. It kept my attention altogether, though I thought parts were incredible.
