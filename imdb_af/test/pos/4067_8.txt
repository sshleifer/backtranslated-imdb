Contains Spoiler The movie is a good action / comedy, but I don't know if the director is cutting too many parts, but it looks like the bad guy is dying too fast. The end of the movie comes, the bad man dies and it is. <br /> <br /> The special effects are good and I'm not sorry to see it at the theater.
