It is an excellent criminal thriller, and also with a good role. The best and most popular actors of the Spanish language games of the past few decades, Victoria Abril and Federico Luppi, team up in one of the better Spanish language addicts of 2004-5. <br /> <br /> The film begins by focusing on thirty something Ernesto (Ernesto Alterio), an elegant, attractive and clever thief who has learned from childhood Gitano, and more recently from Manco, an old seasoned swindler. Manco introduces Ernesto to Federico Luppi, an elegant but smarter and experienced methodical thief - the best in his class. <br /> <br /> Federico's only known weakness is Pilar (Victoria Abril), his former lover and partner. She suddenly appears and presents a fantastic graduation scheme to her former lover, a large-scale crime, eventually needing the help of Ernesto, Manco and Gitano. <br /> <br /> The writing is full of twists and astonishing reversal, especially at the end of the movie. One criticism of the movie I heard a lot is that there are too many plot points, but I disagree. The film captivates the audience so much that all the unexpected events are not too much to follow. In fact, that's what makes the movie outstanding. I highly recommend it.
