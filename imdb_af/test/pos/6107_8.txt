With the title for the sickest movie ever made, PINK FLAMINGOS is an undisputed classic. Certainly, the camera work is shaky and out of the center, the story is confused and slow, and every character in the movie is wasteful and despicable, but PINK FLAMINGOS has a certain playful charm and brilliant satirical white that no other movie can match. . <br /> <br /> While this movie is indeed an offensive one, reading descriptions of what's in the movie are much worse than actually seeing it. Only John Waters can make rape, murder, sadism, cannibalism, coprophagia, and almost every other form of human disorder known to man seems completely hilarious. This movie should be seen as believed.
