First, let's put aside the cultural aspects of this movie, even if it is a very important aspect, and let's look at the simple fact that it is a very sweet love story. Two individuals find themselves in a difficult situation, caused by two selfish men. They must live without any ray of hope through their sad days. If each of these two women were alone, think about what kind of life each had to accept. They found each other and they fell in love. The fact that this love was against all the social, religious and cultural laws of their environment is almost irrelevant. They loved each other, found relief in one another, which was sufficient. The reaction of the individuals around them is but a small fact that they must accept, suffer, and then they can continue with their lives, their lives. Very pretty.
