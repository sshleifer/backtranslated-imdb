It's the middle cartoon of the three (between Rabbit Fire and Duck! Rabbit, Duck!) And is the worst of the three, while it's quite funny. It just depends on one gag for too much of the action. Another good cartoon. I feel a definite sympathy for Daffy in this one, which is rare for me. Daffy is so clearly overwhelmed that it becomes almost painful to watch. Good cartoon in an excellent series. Recommended.
