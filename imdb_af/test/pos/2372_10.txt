Death of Alive: Final, the movie that allegedly gathers the three films in the very loose Dead or Alive trilogy, and mainly linked by its stars, Riki Takeiuchi and Sho Aikawa, and that each movie is part of the bizarro world games and have neuroses. and much violence, is the worst of the lot. That none of the three movies end up being a disappointment is less evidence of the creativity of the material, but for the pound-for-pound guts that director Takashi Miike takes with the environment and the material. Here he presents a revealing dystopian future, but how low it is, where a homosexual mayor / dictator (Richard Chen) dried up the whole town, except for a group of rebels. There are also replica robots - in this year of 2346, one of them is Ryo (Aikawa), a robot of complete lethal skill, but also with the ability to love and learn and so on. Then a policeman, Takeshi (Takeiuchi), is the mayor's top guard. But things are beginning to unravel on both sides, Ryo joined forces with the rebels and Takeshi, although the unfortunate accidents like a hostage disorder were bad. And with Takeshi who finds out his wife and son, robots are an alien mood, just think, as if it had gone into power), and that he himself is one. And this leads to one last, inexplicable act between the two men. <br /> <br /> Strange that there is another movie where Miike has peaks and valleys here, and sometimes finds the center of success where science fiction can have some meaning in it. But there is really nothing to take from this story, except that the mayor / dictator is a no-story thingbat that turns off his rocks to make sure his drug gets pregnant and that everything stays under control. He also has with him his love of love, I would guess, in the hilarious, non-speaking part of a saxophone player who sometimes doubles as a human game when he doesn't walk away from the cheerful blues. Meanwhile, we get the conventional sides of Ryo and Takeshi's stories, and they are never uninteresting, just not quite convincing to keep interested. Of course, Miike is no longer fun, as when Takeshi plops Michelle (Maria Chen) enters the water to have her swim after a murder attempt on the mayor, or to speak the original English rebel leader for no good reason no. There is even a playful tribute to old sci-fi cartoons at the start of the movie. But there are nothing very compelling substances, with the exception of Takeshi's minor turn to be halfway through the movie (helping a couple get a couple) and mostly Miike's strengths are stylistic and in the choice this time of places and sets. <br /> <br /> It's like a grungy Japanese Alphaville where everything still has a contemporary feel through all the special effects. And I really used the yellow-green hue Miike used by the movie, as it was very good in outdoor scenes and just added enough greed in the indoor screens. But for peaks and valleys, one can see it more clearly - and the sci-fi film channel level of visual effects, perhaps with a few bucks in the climax. It contains the funniest material in the most delirious, Freudian sensitivity of the director, even if it should start with unbearable suppression; The way Ryo and Takeshi finally meet is similar to random and just a way for the producers to make the last two movies cheap when not needed. On the other hand, in terms of the mere guilty entertainment of a movie like Miike, where one sees something totally unexpected and very cruel sexually, it stands right up there with the best scenes in Happiness of the Katakuris and Visitor Q. Overall, Dead of Alive: Final is a cute 90 minute effort that doesn't take itself too seriously and is better off, all the more for its evil, militaristic decay and cultural hangings.
