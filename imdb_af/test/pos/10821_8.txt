Was in the mood for a French movie and saw it at Blockbuster. What a little gem it seems to be! Not sure how I missed Gregori Derangere for years, but he's fantastic. Such innocence and mercy! I love his face and the way he moves. Isabelle Adjani was hilarious - reminded me of Nicole Kidman's victory at Moulin Rouge. She looks the same as 20 years ago ... really remarkable. Gerard Depardieu also performed almost as well, but his acting still remains astonished. He's perfect in this movie. Will probably buy this one, I really enjoyed it. If you want to see another good French movie, hire Joyeux Noel. Stunning.
