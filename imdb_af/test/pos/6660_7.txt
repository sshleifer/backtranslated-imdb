I haven't been able to completely exclude this movie from memory, even though it was two years since I saw it. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong - I've forgotten the main story line long - the relationship between Kidman and Law, which didn't surprise me, but it was the torture scenes in the movie that really made me hit. I shouted after wards about two hours. <br /> <br /> Never before has it happened to me how people in war time can benefit from something as pure as a mother's love. We see several examples here - in both scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence to keep her son at home. I was shocked at these scenes and will probably never see the movie of the movie again, because the scenes are now quite clear in my mind. However, I am glad that I watched the movie simply because it made me more aware of the horrors of the war and the terrible cruelty that mankind can burn on its own. <br /> <br /> The blonde albino character is the best of my list of the worst bad guys since I saw the movie. His horrible neck and lack of any human feelings for the people he tortured really hit me a nerve. At one stage I wanted to go up into the theater and kill him myself. (See how the movie pushed me over the edge of the reason. It only happened to me that I would just hit a big screen - at least it shows the film's power and intensity). <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie for its sheer experience, not for the entangled love story, but for the way it depicts war without the need for a battlefield.
