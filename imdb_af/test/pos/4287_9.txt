Now it's the kind of movie we got every week. Now it is rare to see a drama that depends on the role that is being talked about. <br /> <br /> There are no explosions, motor yachts or any chases, there are implied sexual situations. It's not a movie for the younger crowd. It is for those who appreciate people talking to each other. They argue a lot because we are married to couples who have middle problems. <br /> <br /> Emily Watson and Tom Wilkinson are apparently a very happy middle-aged loving man and woman. Rupert Everett, now living in the same small neighborhood in London, is home, returning to his rich father. <br /> <br /> Of course, he meets Emily Watson. It will be easy for everyone to be beaten by Emily. No more, unless the credits start, there is a fatal accident, the rest of the film is about the consequences of the accident and all the lies the different characters tell. <br /> <br /> The play by This trio and the other is excellent. <br /> <br /> Julien Fellows wrote the script based on a novel by Nigel Balchin. He also aimed, it was his first attempt and he did very well. The whole production is the first time. <br /> <br /> The movie had a few months of theater career at the end of 2005, among 80 theaters. It's a shame to me. Stupid comedies open on at least 2000 screens, but it's really good drama like this and many others open in just a few. <br /> <br /> By the way, there are some very funny lines about certain situations. . <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
