It's a typical fast-paced, entertaining movie from the early 1930s. If you took James Cagney in the lead, these "pre-code" movies are even better: just fun things to watch. Usually, when movies are dated, it's a negative but not so with movies from 1930-1934. Yes, with the snake and the attitudes, dress, hairstyles, etc., they are dated, but that's a big part of the fun. These movies have a head start for those who are almost always fun to watch. <br /> <br /> They also have a wheat that is attractive and fascinating. You see people - like the youthful criminals portrayed in this movie and their goofy parents - who you just don't see, but this one (early 30's). Early on in this movie, the kids go before the judge and you sit and laugh at these crazy characters who appear in court one after another. Yes, we get the stereotypical emotional Italian father; the Jewish father; The Anglo-Saxon mother and some other moms who are all dramatic are a good boy. "Although things are predictable in some cases, you don't mind, because everyone here is so much fun to watch. <br /> <br /> It also teaches you that children were punks 75 years ago, also stealing, robbing, mumbling, lying - hey, that's the human condition. This movie debunks the theory that "people were nice back in the old days." No, people have always been rotten or good. The degree was helped by their environment, parents, financial situation and other things. Here we find a lot of children who died in the Reform School. <br /> <br /> The ridiculous and stupid-liberal storyline has children who act like angels immediately as they perform the performance at the reform school. not punished in the slightest because it caused a man to fall to death and set fire to the institute (the explanation: he was a mean and deserved.) So much for true justice and reform. and "Patsy" shoots an old bit that should never be questioned by the police, because he is the good guy! Note the subtle anti-religious tombs in which the only man who has prayed is the evil "keeper". It is no coincidence, no coincidence. That kind of negative association stuff has been canned since the Hays code in the late 60's and has been seen, as you can see, in the early 30's of the Pre Code. <br /> <br /> Dudley Digges, by the way, is outstanding in his "bad old" role of "Thomson." I especially liked his voice very effectively and could imagine him playing one of those similar roles as an institution boss in a Charles Dickens movie adaptation. Cagney played his normal role, the take-no-guff tough guy who played the beautiful girl, Dorothy Griffith, by Madge Blake. Frankie Darro was also effective as the leader of the boys, "Jimmy Smith." Just the look at Darro's face made his character credible. Somehow he was the real star of the movie, but I still go with Cagney. The rest of the reform school children were not too credible and they were actually ethnic stereotypes, but they were nice to watch. <br /> <br /> I thought the most interesting part of the movie was the first 20 minutes when we saw how bad these children were and saw the good and bad and stereotypical parents in court after the children were arrested is. These scenes are purely 1930's Dead End Kids stuff. They always showed the kids to be bad news at the beginning of the movie, but by the time the story was over, they all acted more like Wally and Beaver Cleaver - barely raw "criminals." It is far-fetched, but it works amusingly. <br /> <br /> Overall, a hokey but very entertaining movie, typical of Cagney movies and those of the early 30's. Almost all of them rate at least eight stars for their entertainment value.
