I'm a 58 year old man. On a rainy afternoon my wife suggested we see the women. After reading the reviews, I thought it could lead to an afternoon nap. Wrong - this movie kept my interest from beginning to end. It was wonderful to finally see Meg Ryan look super again. Let's see it Meg looks much better with long hair. Annette Benning looks different to me in every scene she was in. Candice Bergen shows her age as Carrie Fisher. The daughter, Molly, was performed exceptionally by young India. I could understand the dialogue that is difficult in many current films due to quick speech. Cloris Leachman and the woman from Finland were great as the housekeepers who extended their regular duties. The NYC screens were nice to see. Oh, and Bette Midler had a short role, but as usual it was great. So I got this chick flick a 9. Guys- Go see it even for the eye candy like Eva Mendes. It won't disappoint.
