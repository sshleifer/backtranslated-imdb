The Romanian theater is little known from Romania. No directors from Romania came to the attention of the international public, as some other Eastern European countries such as Hungary, Czekos or Yugoslavia managed to do so. One of the few major directors in the Romanian theater is Lucian Pintilie, who regulates 35 times a wonderful movie 'Reconstituirea' - taken quickly by the communist censorship. After the film, still a reference to the Romanian theater, Pintilie could not create freely in Romania until the Communist regime fell in 1989. <br /> <br /> 'Furia' reminds me of Pintilie's movie 35 years ago. The title means 'The Rage' and I can't imagine why the distributors chose to translate it differently. It's about a lost generation. While in the classic Pintilie, it is the root of evil in the oppression and lies of the communist regime, young people must be the rise of the subculture and the moral filth that has been fulfilled in the void by the totalitarian rule. The end is tragic and expected painfully. <br /> <br /> The movie is well-targeted, and the acting is good. Without too much complexity, it manages to create an emotional link between the characters and the viewer. One would say that some situations look like '8 Miles' or 'The Fast and the Furious' - but look at the date of production! This film was made at the same time, if not before the Western counterparts. If it is indeed the first film by director Dan Munteanu, it's an excellent debut, as the IMDB says. Anyway, a good movie can compete and can sell well on the Western market. <br /> <br /> There is hope for a new generation of Roem Ense movies that are in the international scene with some luck and good distribution. <br /> <br /> 8/10 on my personal scale.
