I want to start my review by thanking the creators of this documentary. This is of course a loving work and I think they have done a good job of compiling a pleasant documentary about a person who had so little information about him. I heard about Bruce Haack but didn't know much about him, and I found the beginning of this documentary frustration because I could hear other musicians talking about him, but Bruce Haack himself was far away. I wanted to see this Bruce Haack man !! I felt like the creators had adopted, I knew him as well as those musicians on the screen that I didn't do, so I felt a bit in the dark. <br /> <br /> When Bruce was finally in action It was wonderful and gave me a taste of who Bruce Haack was, but it was just a taste. We treated more musicians and I felt like I was told: Look, all these cool musicians are in him, so he must be cool! "I didn't care much about the musician's comment on Bruce. <br /> <br /> I wanted to see Bruce as a person. You know, the important things - more interviews with people who worked with him or knew him. More about his life, and yes, his use of drugs and other problems. I would like to know so much more about his "Hackula" project. I wanted to get into his mind. Even though they did this through a few "voices of God" commentary and pictures, it would have been good. <br /> <br /> The animations were good, but again I felt it was used as a filler, they didn't really do anything other than what I allowed to hear his music and to see an image based is on the Dimension 5 records. I thought it was smart and creative, but again ... I wanted to learn more about Bruce! <br /> <br /> Maybe Bruce Haack was this elusive in real life? <br /> <br /> Anyway - I finally had this documentary delight and some kind of sadness that made such incredible pioneers and geniuses like Mr. Haack is forgotten as the march of timestamps. I'm glad this movie is about to educate people about Bruce Haack, even with his mistakes.
