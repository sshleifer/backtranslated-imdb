This film tells the story of nine ambitious teenagers trying to follow their dream at the infamous New York High School for Performing Arts: Coco, the singer, Bruno, the modern Mozart, Lisa, Leroy and Hilary, the struggling dancers, Ralph, the comedian , and Doris and Montgomery, the actors. While they all think they need what they need to achieve their goals, they will need more than just their talent. They will have to deal with rejection, sadness, education, pain and love to achieve their fame. <br /> <br /> "Fame" is one of the most entertaining, classic and inspirational films of all time. It has everything a teenage drama / music should have: extremely catchy, entertaining, Oscar-winning songs performed by the wonderful Irene Cara, beautiful dance numbers, a very attractive role that makes you believe in the characters and " a wonderful story, including the heartbreaking scene when Coco meets the video camera. <br /> <br /> As I said, the cast is great. Irene Cara can really act and it's not just her song that makes her shine like Coco. Lee Curreri is very good as Bruno. Barry Miller brings Ralph a lot of humor. Maureen Teefy is wonderful like the wiped out Doris, and looks good, and you'll see Paul McCrane from "ER" as Montgomery. <br /> <br /> It's really a great movie. "Fame" really touched me and inspired me to follow my dream as an actor and singer. Any movie that moves me so much is a winner in my book. A must-see! The movie really touched me and inspired me to follow my dreams as an actor and singer.
