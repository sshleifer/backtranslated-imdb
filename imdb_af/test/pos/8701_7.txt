King Vladislav (Angus Scrimm) of Romania is a vampire, but a vampire of light who wants nothing more than to live in peace and harmony with man. But his son, Radu (Anders Hove), is a cruel being to his heart (it's pretty obvious as soon as you see him). Three female students came to study local folklore, but only found themselves in the vampire legends at the wrong time. Vladislav is dead. <br /> <br /> Who can say anything about a movie with a cameo from Angus Scrimm? I can not. I mean, I have some low expectations for seeing other Full Moon photos ("Puppet Master" in particular, and "Demonic Toys"). But despite the very bad animated effects of the demons, this movie was really well done and fun to watch. A lot of blood, a good plot and background (the Bloodstone story was surprisingly refreshing) and even some new angles on the vampermytos, which you think would be dead. (Maybe I'm wrong, but it's probably the first movie to get rid of rosary beads from a gun.) Except for vampires and blood, you get a share of nudity (unnecessary but welcome) and I had to get the excellent score from the composers (not sure who deserves credit, but those involved include Stuart Brotman, Richard Kosinski, William Levine, Michael Portis and John Zeretzka). This is Horror 101 all the way. Heck, you even get two successors, which is the sign of a real horror movie. (Of course, some bad movies are also available - I called 'Puppet Master'?) The Romanian theme was well done, and the movie even looks like the Romans if I guess their name correctly. And the score - the music - really challenged me as a good change of pace, very mood. I love Richard Band, but I'm glad another composer was given a shot because he nailed the atmosphere to the head. If you want vampire movies and want a slight variation (one of the Eastern European variety), it's worth seeing.
