As with so many modern American films, there has to be a supernatural element on the plot, but if you just let it go, it's a heap of charm and a heartfelt heart held in a scratch cap. <br /> <br /> We are presented with a scene of a town in an economically depressing area struggling to find something to be happy. Beau Bridges's character is really against it, with a family in multiplication, a zero bank balance and a brother-in-law who has been sold out to a big business chain that he secretly hates, but in which he is willing to rub Beau's nose . D'Onofrio finds his body cut Bubba lifestyle by looking at his 'blessed' baby brother, Joey, and itching to escape the shackles of this dead city. Their boss's business ends (much against his will) because of a lack of new clients and he is haunted by memories of his father, as he builds up the tension after his own attempt at self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Joey, who embodied the curse on their lives, was lost at sea - believed to be drowning - in an accident. His miraculous recovery from the Portuguese trotters whose boat they just built and launched (perhaps symbolic of an angelic crew member) is the sign they were waiting for and everyone decided to give life the dice the last time . <br /> <br /> There is a beautiful breeding mood through this work, which was excellent to keep our attention as brilliant as The Shipping News. There are also other parallels to the later work, which lead to a touch of a remake. I like 'Signs of Life' for his simpler, less confronted story and star performances by actors working at their craft, rather than being noticed as stars.
