I watched this movie at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival. Since working in the wine business, I was very eager to see this documentary, and I was not disappointed. Blessed with over 500 hours of footage, the good news is that Nossiter will not only release a theatrical cut, but a ten-tenth of the movie on DVD by next Christmas (ThinkFilm distributes it). The bad news is that it is still a bit of an unconscious animal. When it was shown in Cannes, it was almost three hours long. For Toronto he cut about half an hour, but it still clocked 135 minutes. Now, that's good for me. I love wine and I like to hear about the controversies that affect my business. But not everyone wants that much. <br /> <br /> Nossiter flashes around the world, from Brazil to France to California to Italy to Argentina, with winemakers and PR people and consultants and critics about the state of the wine world. The theme that emerges is that globalization and the improper influence of wine critic Robert Parker force some companionship on wine. Small local producers are either bought by larger conglomerates (American as well as local), or are being pressured by market forces to change their wines to the palette of Mr. Fit Parker. Most American). <br /> <br /> It's a complicated topic, and I can understand why Nossiter wants his subjects to speak. There are Robert Mondavi, patriarch of the Napa wine industry, and his sons Tim and Michael, whose efforts to buy land in Languedoc, confronted opponents of local vignette tones and government officials. There is Aim√© Guibert, founder and winemaker of Daumas Gassac, iconoclastic opponent of Mondavi's plans and crusader for wines expressing local terror. There is Robert Parker himself, who expresses discomfort with his influence, refusing to stop writing about the wines he benefits. There is a flying winemaker Michel Rolland, a consultant for dozens of wineries around the world, and advise them on how to make Parker-friendly wines. There are many more fascinating personalities in this documentary version. <br /> <br /> If you are a wine lover, you will be looking for the ten-part series as well as the theatrical version of this movie. But even if you are not in wine, the film is an interesting look at how the forces of globalization change many of the world's oldest and most established traditions. The impact on local cultures and economies cannot be ignored. <br /> <br /> (8/10)
