As a fan of the older warner brothers' gangster movies, I had to read it out. This is the 2nd best movie in the adventure classic DVD set that also had one of my favorite movies, Scott of the Antarctic. It was a great year for many warmer brothers films in 1939, boasting a huge role, John Garfield, Claude Rains, Ann Sheridan, and the deadly children, who will later be known as the Bowery boys on monogram photos. . Well, a boxer (Garfield) is framed for a murder he hasn't committed and is underway and is hit by a tough New York detective (Claude Rains). He ends up at a fruit spot that is back to boxing by a pretty woman (Gloria Dickson) and dead-end kids (Huntz Hall, Leo Gorcey, Benard Punsley, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Gabreil Dell) keep a low profile. It is directed by well-known director Busby Berkley who is timeless classic such as 42nd street, 1933 and 35 gold bullies, foot parade and many others. I would like to give a shout to platinum DVD / video to exclude very good, priced DVDs like adventure classes (see my Scott of the Antarctic review) I give them a criminal 10 out of 10, a great movie. sick should point out that I only saw 2 John Garfield movies, this one and body and soul. I thought he was a very good actor.
