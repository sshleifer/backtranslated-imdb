"Pink Flamingos" was revolutionary for its time, and even today it is still difficult to watch. Not that I didn't enjoy the movie, it's hilarious; but it is very repulsive and Jonh Waters pushes the envelope as far as it can. The story is about Babs Johnson (Devine), she's the dirtiest women alive. She lives in a trailer with her son Crackers and daughter Cotton. Not to mention the overweight Edie who is obsessive with eggs and sleeps in a manger. Then there's Connie and Raymond Marble, two dirty perverts who are jealous of Babs. They want to emit her to be the dirtiest person in life. That means they implant their abducted women and sell the babies to lesbian couples, flash people in public, and even send Babs a thirst in the mail. Babs fights back to prove she is the most strangled person alive. Which even includes incest, murder and eating and other ill sexual acts. It's a movie that's fun for the whole family. (Well, depending on where you live?) See "Pink Flamingos", but don't forget your barf bag. For more perverse, strange sex and bodily functions, we also see "Sweet Movie".
