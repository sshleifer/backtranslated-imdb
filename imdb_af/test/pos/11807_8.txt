There was nothing else on television yesterday afternoon, so I thought, "Okay, let's look." I didn't know the plot and I had no expectation, I thought in a few minutes or I would surf again. But then the story began to unfold, and the characters played beautifully through the two boys. The story had unrealistic parts and scenes, but overall it was a good movie. Well worth looking at.
