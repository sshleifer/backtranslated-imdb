A movie for mature, educated audiences ... <br /> <br /> I saw Random Hearts in a preview screen shortly before his North American release. This romantic drama was quite a treat. I'm sure this story won't be everyone's cup of tea, especially in light of the movie's dark indifferent point of departure. But the photo has some very uplifting strengths in its favor. <br /> <br /> All-time Box Office Draw Harrison Ford ("Star Wars", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "The Fugitive," "Air Force One", "Patriot Games") are at the top -on his play as the running and desperate interior minister, Dutch. Ford's very muted, nuanced performance shows the series he can achieve with class and determination to bring the audience into his world of loss and betrayal. It's the perfectly complex role and many different types of film for Harrison Ford to grab the screen between its action blockers. Next year, Harrison Ford will go back to action, first for director Robert Zemeckis ("Forrest Gump", "Back To The Future") in his summer 2000 player, "What Lies Below", and reportedly later in the year in the movie adaptation of Tom Clancy's "The sum of all fears." 'Fears' will be Harrison Ford's third outing as CIA operational Jack Ryan. <br /> <br /> Director Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa", "The Firm", "Tootsie") has a supporting role in this function as a political adviser to Scott-Thomas Congresswoman. It's a very sharp and energetic performance for Pollack. Not only is Sydney Pollack a gifted director, but he is also one of the most credible, natural and charming actors around. See also "Eyes Wide Shut". <br /> <br /> Kristin Scott-Thomas ("The English Patient," "The Horse Whisperer") shows that you should not necessarily be eccentric or worldly to be considered sexy. It's one of her better films, and she gives a terrific and moderate performance that works well with Ford's toughness. The subplots work wonderfully, especially the subplot that Ford's character's investigation into police corruption. . Searching for a cold and effective turn by the "Heat" factor, Dennis Haysbert, who plays detective George Beaufort, is the stumbling block to the Dutch investigation into police corruption. <br /> <br /> The rest of the supporting role is a wonderful joy. Charles S. Dutton (whose long arrears for a film leader role) show that he is one of the best character actors, and Bonnie Hunt, who I find very strong in this production, steals most of her scenes with that wonderful, ' a beautiful smile like Wendy Judd. <br /> <br /> In addition, the technical side of Pollack's thriller is. From Dave Grusin's (Pollack's "The Firm") perfectly surreal jazzy score, to Philippe Rousselot (a River Runs Through It), sharp photography, to the sharp editing that makes the movie fresh, despite the movie's unhappy downer-premise. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good yarn of mystery, good plot, character-driven stories and romance, all thrown in one. It's a great story about betrayal and forgiveness. It also features one of the most surprising, yet encouraging, and certain controversial endings for a Harrison Ford movie lately. Random Hearts is definitely one of the better movies of the year. <br /> <br /> (*** 1/2 from ****) or (8.5 out of 10.0)
