I've been waiting for THE DEAD to come out on video for years, with the fact that I carried my VHS copy so well. This is one of the most beautiful films ever made for the holiday. It takes place at the Epiphany Festival (Twelfth Night), and is a simple, striking vignette of characters visiting a dinner prepared by three Dublin women. Central to the story is a pretty loveless couple, a woman who once loved passionately for a young man who died for her and a man who wants to feel the same passion for his wife, but feels incompetent. All the performances are beautiful and the writing weaves nicely among the different characters at the dinner. Of course, his source material is James Joyce's short story of the same title, and much of his narrative structure is kept completely intact. John Huston's long career as one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers had a real fitting final with this film, written by his son, Tony Huston. stars his daughter, Anjelica Huston; and is dedicated to his wife, Maricella. Thanks to the Lions gateway for retrieving the rights to this movie and putting it on DVD. For lovers of all things, Irish or for people looking for a literate, subtle yet amazingly moving holiday movie, this is a real gem.
