This movie was incredible. Never before have I seen such a film that led me to the harsh reality of drug use. There is no glamorizing, sugar-coated or glorious heroine. This movie shows the real struggle, pain and loss that people go through when dealing with this drug. Good movie, decent emotionally packed plays, and a great story. A great look! <br /> <br />
