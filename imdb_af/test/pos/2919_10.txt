As a dedicated lover of all things, Egyptian, it is a classic piece from the fifties, along with my other favorite, Land of the Pharaohs. "The sets and colors are just wonderful and everything looks so" neat "in the production quality. Victor Adult is well thrown and Peter Ustinov is a real gem! The whole look of the movie (along with others made in this era) ) Have a job you just don't get with modern movies with all their digitized effects (I haven't seen the 1999 movie "The Mummy, but I'm sure I'll love it!"). <br /> <br /> Top things!
