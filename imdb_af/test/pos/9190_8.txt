Fado is a sad almost bluesy style of Portuguese Gypsy music repeatedly heard by the movie. As explained by one of the main characters (Igor), it also means fate. <br /> <br /> Indeed, it is the lot that brings the two main characters Paco and Alex together and causes the problems that arise. <br /> <br /> Overall, I really enjoyed it. It starts out as an 'on the occasional' drama / road movie, and builds in an exciting thriller / road movie. <br /> <br /> There were two things I found unrealistic that kept me from making it higher. rating (I gave it an 8). The first is the main reason why Alex kept these things. She was so desperate for cash that she sold her passport for a bad sum and then gave away things worth worth thousands to a stranger? Her explanation was inconclusive. Also how did they climb through the gate, where were the policemen?
