If you think about it, it's almost incredible that a film can be made about the death penalty (one of the world's most controversial topics) that doesn't offend it either. This is proof of Tim Robbins' extraordinary intelligence and sensitivity, features that can also be seen in his acting roles (Shawshank Redemption, Jacob's Ladder). <br /> <br /> This movie actually shows a subtle compromise between "for" and "against" camps ... so subtle that it can't be put into words, subtle to the point of disappearing, but one gets the sentence after watching the picture that a compromise is possible, somehow it can be worked out if we just look deep enough ...
