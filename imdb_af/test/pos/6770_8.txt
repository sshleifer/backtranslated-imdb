Not sure I have ever seen a black comedy from Denamark, but it's really good. The humor is suitable low key and deadpan to deal with some of the atrocious activities. Svend and Bjarne love working for their boss, because he always puts them down (in fact he calls them not clear enough to unpack before they cut at one point). They do what they need to start their own butcher shop and when a workman accidentally closes in the cooler while a light is tied, they hit something that makes their butcher shop very popular than their old boss. In fact, he is the one who sold their first "fillets", which is partly his fault, as he served them at a Rotary dinner at his home, and the guests touched it and the next day at Svend and Bjarnes appeared. Bjarne is somewhat shocked at what Svend did, but it didn't stop there. Svend stood up above his sad little existence to be someone of a popularity that is new to him and he does not want to leave it, so that the freezer still fills with all sorts of acquaintances (and at one point, "a small Swedish from the park "). However, it is suspected that former boss Holger is of the opinion that something is wrong. Bjarne is also haunted by his twin brother Eigil, who lives in a sanatorium for years and who wanted Bjarne to apply the plug so that he could get her inheritance money to open the shop. When Eigil was taken off the respirator, he was revived, much to Bjarne's horror. And Bjarne also has a love interest in Astrid, who works at the cemetery. Svend and Bjarne are not well-adapted individuals and therefore things start out of control. The lethal humor really makes it good, and while it doesn't laugh aloud, it's definitely amusing. It is somewhat stupid, although the cuts of meat and body parts are likely to be unaware, especially since these two things all matter. If you are a fan of black comedies, it is recommended, I liked it very well. 8 out of 10.
