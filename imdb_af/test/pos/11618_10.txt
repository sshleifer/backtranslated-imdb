Eventually, this shocking movie watched last night, and what a disturbing thought it is, and incredibly bloody and some unforgettable scenes and a total attack on the senses. Looks like a movie from the minds of Lynch (specifically ERASERHEAD), Buttgereit, and even a bit of "Begotten". What this man does to his pregnant sister is no longer convinced, but then it really happened or is it the brain's left and right side that is struggling. This is the main theme of this artwork, to draw a fine line between fantasy and reality, and what will happen if the right side of the brain that dreams and fantasize, takes over the reasoning and logical left. And the music in this movie is incredible, a kind of electronic score that is absolutely perfect. Although this film is quite shocking and pretty disgusting in some of the most extreme scenes (including hard core sex), you'll ever see in any movie, I considered it and loved it. And that music still amazes me, I have to try to find the soundtrack if it's available. Looking at "subconscious cruelty" is a real event, not something that the viewer will easily forget. Warning ... Be careful to buy this movie, as some prints on graphic sex scenes and extreme gores fail, especially the Japanese release copies.
