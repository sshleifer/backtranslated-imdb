I watched this movie at the Telluride Film Festival in 1997, where one of the screenwriters, Jos√© Giovanni, was honored. It is highly regarded as a major noir crime drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura. Attention to each character, and complex psychological representations, in which loyalty, betrayal, love, and hope are set forth, are great. It's an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent movie. Up there with the best of Melville. (The title in English 'Class all risk' in the French 'Classe tous risques' is word game on 'Classe Touriste', meaning 'tourist class'.
