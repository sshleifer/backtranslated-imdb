Like many, I saw the Water Babies as a child / teenager in the late seventies / early eighties. It has remained with me ever since with its catchy songs, memorable portrayals, less successful animation and a heart-filled, cold and ultimately good story. Recently I sat down and saw it again after at least two decades and I saw this time it looks like it's the Wizard of Oz. No, it's not blatant parables, but hears me out. In this one we have a boy and his dog - with personal problems at home, running away from something and on the scene, just after they ran away, changing the content of their appearance. In this one, the boy and dog are animated. In the wizard of Oz, Dorothy and Toto are in color. In this one, the boy and the dog are told to find the Water Babies for answers and then finally the Kracken for guidance and he has the ability to let Tom go home if he shows that he has courage, etc. In the wizard of Oz, Dorothy must also find an authoritative figure that tests her before allowing her to return. In the Water Babies, Tom meets three characters who will help him travel to the Water Babies. Dorothy also has three helpers. When every helper is met, we are entertained with a version of "Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi, Hi Cockallorum ... We're on our way." In the wizard it is "We are going to see the wizard." Dorothy has a good witch kind of looking at her; Tom has a woman with many roles (Billie Whitelaw) the same. If you look at the two now, there are many other parables. It is said, The Water Babies is by no means a knockoff, I just commented on the terrible favor between the two. This film has solid achievements from bad guys Bernard Cribbins and the ever-fascinating James Mason. The kids playing Tom and Ella are good. The supporting film by Joan Greenwood (loves her voice!), David Tomlinson, and the vocal talents of John Pertwee and Lance Percival greatly contribute to the mix. I have to admit that the animation is less than sterling, even for his time, but enough for the challenge. The three animated characters helping Tom come home are all great. I always have trouble picking my favorite between the French swordfish and the John Inman / Mr. Humphries like seahorse. The scene where we hear this guttural, maniacal laugh from a shipwreck, just to see a seahorse with a giant polo card, always has me rolling! The Water Babies are fun. Sure, it's more of a children's movie, but it has and will always be a good place in my heart. Most of the credit for what successes the movie has to go to director Lionel Jeffries. Jeffries is a wonderful comedian and his sense of humor is clearly clear.
