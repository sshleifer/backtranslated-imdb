First, let's mention the movie it is: <br /> <br /> 1. It's a good movie with a message. <br /> <br /> 2. The acting is just okay, dialogue slightly better, production value pretty good. <br /> <br /> 3. Rugby screens ... just barely wise. <br /> <br /> But here's the trick: it's not something Hollywood has renewed, and it's not trying to be a fake accurate portrayal of the sport. Rather, it is a beautiful representation of mostly real people, in real life circumstances, and a true story. Certainly, they could have done a better job of actually doing the sport, but my voice: doing a pretty good job for what it is going to do. <br /> <br /> (And I can't think of many soccer, baseball, hockey or soccer movies that don't belong to the sport. C'mon ... Bull Durham?) <br /> < I am not a rugby player (I was a wrestler) but I graduated from Highland, attended '86'90, and occasionally trained with the Rugby guys. However, my brother-in-law David was one of the original founders of the Highland Rugby Club in 1976. His younger brother, Billy, played the following year, as I remember. If you are interested, there is a Highland Rugby site at highlandrugby.net that addresses the team's history.) <br /> <br /> By the time I was there, the club had been around for a decade And has long built a reputation for excellence. It is a fact that they have focused on "broad" training topics: commitment, honor, discipline, effort, not tactics. I thought the rugby guys I knew were a bit off the ground, but I think I might just have been jealous. They were hard-core dedicated to the belief system that Gelwix promoted. <br /> <br /> With regard to the "cultural mix" issues raised, it may be interesting to note that while I was there in the 80s, one of the larger schools in the city was closed - South - High school - and its students spread among the other 3 primary SLC schools. To be honest, Highland pre-80s were pretty white. I have a picture of the 1977 team (who thinks) showing an * all * white club. South High, on the other hand, was a much more racially integrated school before it closed: I had a few friends from the South who joined the team, one Tongan, one Samoan. And as I remember, there were a lot of island nation players who joined '88'90. I don't think anyone has questioned the credibility of the team to accept Maori (or other cultural) traditions. If there was one thing that was obvious to these guys, they ran. <br /> <br /> And with regard to the strength of the team compared to the best high school teams in the world: yes, it is true that US Rugby, generally taken as a whole, does not particularly represent good against the best elsewhere. There are exceptions, but hey - it's a simple fact that Rugby doesn't have the prominence or exposure needed to develop the multiple traditions of excellence in the US that originate in other countries. <br /> <br /> With that said, Highland judges on its merits: <br /> <br /> - the * only * team to run every year of organizations' 25-year history for the US Rugby National Championships qualify. <br /> <br /> - a victory record of 392 wins, 9 losses. Read it again ... award-winning coach in any American sport in history. <br /> <br /> - regular international tours. <br /> <br /> - A compelling victory against some legitimate international teams. <br /> <br /> Are they the world's best? Maybe a few years, probably not the most ... but they are pretty good on a consistent basis. And it's disrespect for the game to blow them off when Highland Rugby can be the best ambassador for the sport in the US.
