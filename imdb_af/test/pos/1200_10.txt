The songs are fantastic and the story line is good. Like many other theater schools, mine also produced HAIR. For most hair production, it's a golden opportunity to make naked, but my production is fully dressed ... I don't think full-fledged in a movie or a play guarantees artistic quality. And so did the creators of the movie. The movie version is good with classic hits that follow each other, while the plot is developed into the cold climax. A great actor of actors, dancers and singers.
