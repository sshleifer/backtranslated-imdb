A poetic investigation of the human condition took place without dialogue. The anti-hero, The Man, forbids the escape of a band of marauders, from the desert of once a civilization, to the ruins of the city to survive for its survival. There he crosses roads with The Brute, brilliantly played by Jean Reno, of "The Professional" and "Mission: Impossible" fame. The Man is saved by a crazy old genius who lives in a fort of his own design. The man and the old genius can keep the Brute and his ilk in the bay, but they realize it's only a matter of time before their defense is compromised, so they pause. It is a highly understated story of the desperate struggle for life, with excellent action scenes and clever humor. Of all the movies of its kind, such as 'Road Warrior', 'Omega Man' and even 'Ultimate Warrior' (with Yul Brenner as a buff fighter), "Le Dernier Combat" is the most artificial. Copies of the video are hard to find, I'll give my left eye ball one. If your local art house ever has a revival of this movie, I sincerely recommend that you break any involvement to see it big.
