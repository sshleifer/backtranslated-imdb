Art mimics life mimics art. Atticus Finch is reincarnated in the D.A. in this tragic and exciting gripping documentary that plays more like what-it-does and how did it happen. The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals makes it a very compelling story in very low levels. Although racism is one of the themes, there are other elements such as work ethics, integrity, and the handling of sadness that has withdrawn me to see and review this film. The music is not intrusive; The pacing and visuals are such that there is no fault with the fact that they are real people through an authentic experience.
