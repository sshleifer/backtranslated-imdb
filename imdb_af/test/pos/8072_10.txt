I have not seen such a movie where the creators have put so much heart into their work and have been paying close attention to the best details for a long time. <br /> <br /> Everything was well thought out and perfect in reality. Camera work, editing and composing worked so well together, it was just amazing. The titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographed. <br /> <br /> This movie just blew me away. <br /> <br /> The "Showdown" could have been cut off by 10 or 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's an almost perfect tribute to the early silent noir. Movie stories, plays, scenery and costumes were perfectly fitting and credible to come from the times of silent movies.
