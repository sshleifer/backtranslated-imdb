I probably thought But here was a good movie. It's two great actresses, Susan Sarandon and Natlie Portman, who when I hear they are in a movie, resist it to watch. Overall it was a nice movie. It had moments. where I felt as though they were trying hard, and there were some very exaggerated and exhausted materials, but there was nothing in the movie that I absolutely hated. I even liked how they touch and effectively touch the puppet performance of the unreasonable Thora Birch, and all the little happy / sad moments. If you want to see this movie, go ahead, because although I don't recommend it, it's not something you should avoid, and a 5.9 score seems unfair to me.
