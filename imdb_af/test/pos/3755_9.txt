Thanks to the help of a fellow IMDb member, over the past two years I have been able to watch this film for the second time over the past two years. I can honestly say it didn't lose its kick. I can't believe Channel 4 makes this one disappear without a trace, as it is an extremely powerful, moving and moralistic approach to the consequences of misguided loyalty. <br /> <br /> It focuses on one-click friends over the course of ten years and their relationship with two 'outsiders' of the school; specifically how they use one and mercilessly the other. As past and present-day events unfold, the tensions are gradually thickening, unlike Shane Meadows' excellent dead man's Dead Man's Shoes. The acting, writing and direction is very fat for 1983 and still packs a wall today, despite the upper crust accents of the central characters. Yes, it may be set in the public school, but it is worlds except anything evicted by the Merchant's Ivory. I got a state education and can still draw many parables from the story. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that you will remember long ago if you see it - except probably because Channel 4 (or FilmFour) chose to bury it. On their own official website, they describe it as "an inexplicably exaggerated jewel of the early days of Channel 4" - overlooked by whom? It was one of the very first Channel 4 movies (which will later become FilmFour due to the success of movies such as Trainspotting), so someone still has to be the master of print. In those days where you can get the extensive collector's edition DVDs of more or less anything, it's a bit of a moan that they can't give a movie, but the promotion it deserves. <br /> <br /> So, as one of the Channel 4 production flunkies read it, stop making programs show people humiliating themselves in the hope of securing a tabloid deal. edition disk or something, please!
