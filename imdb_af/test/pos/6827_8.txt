Jack and Kate meet the doctor Daniel Farady first and then the psychics Miles Straume and demonstrate that they did not come to the island to save the survivors. Locke and his group find anthropologist Charlotte Staples Lewis, and Ben Linus shoots her. In the meantime, the group of Jack finds the pilot Frank Lapidus, who landed the helicopter with small damages that can be repaired. Jack forces Miles to explain the reason they came to the island. <br /> <br /> The second episode of the fourth season's return to the island, with four new characters, stops the confusing "flash-forward" and it seems that it will eventually be the beginning of the explanations I ( and most of the fans and viewers expect to be provided in "Lost". Why the interest of the government in Ben Linus, and how he is informed of the boat, are some of the questions I will see in the following episodes. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
