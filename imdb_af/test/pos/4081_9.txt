As an ex-dealer Seaman I was really interested in this movie: I was personally involved in a short cut search to leave Kingston Jamaica where one person was found. We managed to get him to shore as we were in territorial limits. On another ship I was on the veranda was found and we couldn't land him anywhere because of passport / nationality issues. In fact, he stayed for almost a year as an "honorary" crew member and worked for him. Africa is notorious for solid bakkies. There is a wonderful scene in the beginning of the movie as the bulk ship enters the African harbor: its size barred everything. The crew pops in the country for a bit of intercourse and inbreeding. So far normal. The drama begins when the stowaways enter the vast slope of the ship. Joss Ackland is brilliant as the captain with a drinking problem plagued by his Nemesis Suchet right as the Company's representative on board. The passing search is classic, but we didn't have guns. I question the use of guns in this movie. This ship had a large firearm. In my experience, guns at sea are strictly restricted due to customs regulations. There is also a dog on board. Independent rabies laws, especially in Europe, severely restrict animal transport. Anyway, Pertwee is brilliant than the bitter mate. The horror that follows the discovery of the victims is unbearable: the dark metallic background of the ships, and a feeling that there is no place to hide, adds to the drama. Some of the truck crew are not in the murder and those who get involved. is gradually being dragged into a world of violence from which there is no escape. The chase of the ship is especially the engineered "edge on the chair": the feeling of extreme claustrophobia is abundant. The feeling of metal to squeeze in and death is just a gunfire away. The movie is brutal: my girlfriend had to give up to see it during shooting and knocking scenes. While it is going to Soetet in the comfort of its well-appointed cabin being drunk unaware of the chaos 3 decks below. It's a tense movie, flawed in parts, but the real message is that we can all be so sucked in such circumstances. Slow and sure. Think of the train drivers who took Jews to Auschwitz, the clerks that worked out that train schedule. I always remember someone visiting the Dachau concentration camp at the end of the war and he said one of the S.S. Guards put a bird table outside the camp crematorium. This film is like this: ordinary people suddenly find themselves in a world of unstoppable violence!
