I will admit that I may have missed a few moments when I did not pay proper attention, but I got enough of the story to agree that it is a great family movie, by director Lionel Jefferies, who is Grandpa Potts in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang played. Basically, it starts with a happy upper middle class family living in Victorian London. One night, Father (Iain Cuthbertson) is visited by two strangers, and he leaves with them and does not return. They move to a cottage in the country, and here are the children; Bobbie (Jenny Agutter, who I first saw in Child's Play 2), Phyllis (Sally Thomsett) and Peter (Gary Warren) keep their spirits up, with their fascination with the nearby railway. They dare daily to the passengers in the passing trains, and with courage and vigilance they also avoid an accident and become heroes. Their kindness makes them friends, including important people who can help find the mystery of their missing father. Also with Dinah Sheridan as mother / wife. Waterbury, Bernard Cribbins as Albert Perks, William Mervyn as Old Sir, Peter Bromilow as Doctor Forrest, Ann Lancaster as Ruth and Gordon Whiting as Russian. It was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 24 on the 50 largest British films. Very good!
