(My Summary) Rae (Christina Ricci) was a high school slut and nymphomania who linked Ronnie (Justin Timberlake) to satisfy her needs. Ronnie must report to his National Guard unit and leave Rae alone. Rae is not alone for a long time, because she is the town gate with a powerful need to get a man. After a feast, Rae is taken home by a friend who eventually kills her half and throws her to the side of the road. The next day, Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson) finds Rae and carries her home. Lazarus gives medical care to Rae, and believes that he can also save her from herself. Rae is like a dog in heat so Lazarus puts a 40-pound chain around her and his radiator to stop her looking for men. Lazarus has problems of his own because his wife just left him for another man. Lazarus turns to his blues music to relieve his pain. <br /> <br /> (My Comment) The movie has a profound meaning when you go past sex and violence. The film has a different feel to it. The story is raw and almost puts you in the movie as if you were there. The 40-pound chain is a good metaphor, and symbolic of a chastity belt. You do not give love to anyone, but you love it for your true love. The chain could also be a parallel to a woman chained to the kitchen, but Rae did not boil. Rae just wanted to have sex all the time, while a woman shouldn't. I think Craig Brewer (writer and director) made an extraordinary film, and Samuel L. Jackson sings an average blues song. The story is emotionally loaded, and the topics of race, religion, music and sex in one. (Paramount Classics, Running Time 1:56, Rated R) (8/10)
