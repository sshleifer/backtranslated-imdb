This movie will not win great awards. But if you're an hour and a half free and have a little lighter entertainment, then you can do much worse than seeing it. <br /> <br /> The cast is mostly young and beautiful, the writing has some really funny moments and the soundtrack is also very cool. Rupert Penry-Jones as Jake looks the most fun, while Laura Fraser as Justine is sweet, nice and funny. <br /> <br /> I rented it because I like the series "Spooks" that RPJ is currently playing. And here he is young and buff and the perfect eyecatcher for a girl's night. <br /> <br /> Get some wine and some ice cream and enjoy a visit.
