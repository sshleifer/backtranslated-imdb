It's the 1920s. And a man named Walt Disney was on a mission: to satisfy the families and children around the world with one thing: entertainment. What did he do? He made cartoons! Whoo !!!!! And he made a character as big as a mouse. Mickey Mouse. Ha ha! O boy! <br /> <br /> Two films are by Mr. Disney self-signed out: "Plane Crazy" and "Steamboat Willie." This review will focus on the 1928 Steamboat Willie feature. <br /> <br /> Since I learned about this movie as a little boy, I always wanted to see this movie. Well, in 1997 I rented an old VHS that had many old Disney cartoons on them. Mickey Mouse !!!!! And guess what? It was short there and I loved it !!!!! Shortly after I took the tape back, it was on the old Disney channel early on Saturday morning. Note: the "Old" Disney Channel. <br /> <br /> Yes, it's a great cartoon; This paved the way for more Disney stuff from 1928 to 2002! <br /> <br /> 10 stars, indeed !!!!!
