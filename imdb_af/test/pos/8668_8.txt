At first sight, the Bothersome Man looks like several other movies / books that are rolled into one. Kafka's trial run, Melville's Bartleby, the fall and rise of Reginald Perrin and Groundhog Day are immediately devised. A man, Andreas, arrives in an unnamed city where he immediately gets a job in an office and gets a beautiful new girl. However, there is a catch: his colleagues are all friendly, scarce and completely characterless, and everyone he knows, including his girlfriend, seems to have only one subject - interior design. Welcome to the hell of modern consumerism, where people throw themselves away from buildings and do not give anyone eyebrows, whether they are reading furniture catalogs or eating food that does not taste anything. <br /> <br /> Andreas quickly realizes his trouble and spends the rest of the movie trying to escape in different ways. Suicide does not seem to be an option, and when he finds a new girl, she is just like feeling old. There is a wonderful scene in a restaurant where he asks her to go with him and all she can say is, "I don't mind." <br /> <br /> In fact, much of what The Bothersome Man has to say has been said before, and after about 45 minutes you begin to feel that you are a certain sense of deja vu. Yet the point that is probably worth repeating is over and over: an unexplored life is one that is not worth living. In addition, it offers a definite modern assumption on the perennial theme of how capitalism destroys our souls. More than one character reminded me of people I knew, especially his furniture obsession friend, and if the filmmakers lost their ideas by the end of the movie, maybe that's the point. There will be no end if you can't find other people who share your sense of alienation.
