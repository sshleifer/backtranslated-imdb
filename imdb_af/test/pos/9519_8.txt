Wow .... it's been a long time since I saw such a hilarious movie like this one !!!!! I have never been a fantastic fanatic of French movies, but since I fell in love with Catherine Deneuve's beauty and acting, I decided to watch all her movies ... but I didn't think this one would be no. as fantastic as it seems to be. Luckily, I bought it, even though I had doubts! It's really 'feel-good time' movie with class and quality. There are some great social topics and moral dramas that are very close to today's modern way of life, which is very beautiful and realistic. I also loved the dancing scene in the men's room! But my favorite is Catherine Deneuve's pretty effort to sing ..... she brings it as she is, with lots of grace and modesty at the same time ... very tempting! I also want to express my respect and admiration for Line Renaud, who played a fantastic role (I didn't even know she acted. I just knew her for her music). So, don't wait any longer and look at the movie ... you'll be surprised in many ways.
