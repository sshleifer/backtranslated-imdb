However, surprisingly good and fast-paced adventure that Kelsey Grammer (presumably in his first starring role) knows as an unconventional marine sub-commander who is a core component of his own will; he earned it by competing in a series of war games with a crew of untested, dubious and beloved men (and also a woman) against the US Navy. <br /> <br /> Director David S. Ward "Major League" and his authors compiled a hysterically clever and exciting comedy trying to easily understand the movie, which they do pretty well. Secondly, except for the Grammer character, most of the crew offers some or many of the film's humor, which is treated like a two-edged sword. Three members of the supporting role-players - Harland Williams, Toby Huss, and Rob Schneider offer the funniest scenes that include strange gestures, imitations, and their personalities. <br /> <br /> "Down Periscope" is more than a Navy version of "Police Academy" or "The Dirty Dozen". What the film does is to do the job the right way and I liked it.
