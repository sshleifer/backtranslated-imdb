It may be the most perfect movie I've ever seen - in acting, adaptation and direction. It's self-reliant and kind, so it's not sensible to say it's better or worse than other big movies, just that it can be a perfect artwork in itself. <br /> <br /> And it was fun to see how confused horror fans get up and running!
