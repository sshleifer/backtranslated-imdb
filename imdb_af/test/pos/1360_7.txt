Anxiety foolish anime, only six episodes, about an unhappy delivery hunt called Kintaro (well, he is called a delivery hunt, though he has to be in his 20s) and the adventures he has on his journey. Every episode sees that he arrives in a new town, gets a new job, develops a love affair before each episode ends with him. <br /> <br /> Light sexist, young, very immature at times, this is the kind of anime that just puts a smile on the face. <br /> <br /> Not one to start with if you're not a fan of anime, because it will certainly not convince you of the genre, but for those who are already converted, it is entertaining fluff.
