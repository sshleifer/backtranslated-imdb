This movie just felt a lot of truth with life. I like the end that has obviously solved without any great moments, but with very small moments coming together. You can say this is an honest love story. No matter what the 'sexual orientation' of the main characters is, it's still a story of love and understanding. <br /> <br /> There were many scenes that the family involved. The setting is during what is a very stressful time for some people. On behalf of the holidays. Christmas to be exact. <br /> <br /> Like most good movies, this one deals with aspects of love, fit, expectations and cannot be biased. In the end, Alexandra and Casey make a choice for each other because they know that love is difficult and over. Well done.
