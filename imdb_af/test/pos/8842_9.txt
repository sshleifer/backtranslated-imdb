"The Thing" is John Carpenter's best movie. Combining his talents for building tension and shocks with decent production values, he worked out a perfectly crafted sci fi / horror movie. <br /> <br /> Filming in real-life circumstances creates a very credible isolated research base that determines the tension before anything even happens. The ensemble casts well with Kurt Russell, who also proves a charismatic leading man, even under all that beard. <br /> <br /> By slowly building tension with moments of horrible horror (with grace of effects master Rob Bottin - currently decorating Freddy Jason) Carpenter creates a movie that rarely matches. Considering the same year if ET could no longer be different! <br /> <br /> Appreciate a watch / rewatch. 9 out of 10. <br /> <br /> p. The DVD is excellent. Many extras plus the best DVD commentary (with Carpenter & Russell). Plus remixed in Dolby Digital for even rare sound effects.
