I watched the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read lots of reviews for this movie. I agree the move has many opportunities for improvement, but unlike anyone looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I searched for something else and this movie gave it to me. I didn't see this movie as a critic, but as a person looking for a little hope, a little bit of courage, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and that's what I got. You can be critical of the performance of the song and dialogue, but that's not what I'm looking for when I go to a movie. I'm looking for some relief from my daily life, a little time I can look back and imagine a better life, where people love each other and help others. It is a pity that we cannot enjoy a movie for what it tells us and stop disassembling it like an English teacher reading a fifth grade. It can be very simplistic, but really, it wouldn't be nice.
