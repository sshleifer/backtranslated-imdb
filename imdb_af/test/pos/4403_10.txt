The Coen brothers surprised themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped prisoners. Although based on "The Odyssey", the ancient work of Homer, you don't have to read the "Odyssey" to follow the story. The brothers Coen appreciated a celluloid and fragrance tapestry! The soundtrack is inherent in the film, and it is as if the soundtrack is the product and the film is paper. Every character is splendidly exploited and raking back to the days of old when films were rich in character characters whose appearance in the film adds wealth, texture and authenticity. George Clooney is gorgeous as the greasy Everett Ulysses McGill, a frank franchise on the line with pumpkin linguistics and vocabulary comic and engaging. Oh Brother, where art, you are easily the best Coen movie to date, as well as Clooney's best effort. Clooney is good enough to justify a best actor nomination, such as Tim Blake Nelson's portrayal of disrupted friend Delmar, while the movie itself deserves the best film button.
