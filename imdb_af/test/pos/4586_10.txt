This movie is BRILLIANT. <br /> <br /> I don't even remember this movie in the theaters, so think it was a "straight DVD". I have fairly low expectations, although I'm a big fan of Mike. right. It has some kind of comic future satire like "Brazil" and "Demolition Man", but to the next level. <br /> <br /> Then I saw the role; Luke Wilson, Maya Rudolph and Dax Shepard, all of whom were brilliant in their roles. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, this movie has won me over the first 5 minutes, where it has above average people with fewer children and the poorest, stupid, trashy people with many ignorant children, and how it leads to a kind of reverse evolution. It takes that concept and then shows where we go with this pollution of the gene pool. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I don't think it will take the 500 years as depicted, but probably just about 50. I already see the shocking rise of "soft delay" in the general population, media and culture. People who like classical music and art are ridiculous rather than respected. The lowest common denominator seems to govern, especially in Hollywood and on TV (eg "Jackass the Movie" and any reality show where they let you eat, something disgusting or humiliating for money). <br /> <br /> All the political / social satire aside, this movie is also just LAUGH OUT LOUD funny! And I don't say it lightly; Many movies actually make me 'LOL', but this one did. <br /> <br /> Many of the best jokes are word / siggags in the background, so you really need to pay attention to get them. I even had to interrupt and zoom in on some of them (like when Joe got his government ID and said "yes" to "her" and for "eyes"). The prison also engraved on the front "House for Specific Individuals", as the police in the movie (like actual policemen) all "individuals" instead of people, and so on. Name. It was again on the screen for just a moment ... it's one of those movies that you can watch and dissect again and again to get through the layers. <br /> <br /> I also usually watch movies with the captions, and it has taught me At some jokes that pass through your ears in the dialogue mix, the police are constantly talking about people who "escape" instead of "escape" "and there are many other wrong statements that just cracked me. But again, I may not have chosen them only through the dialogue with music / sound effects; It is very subtle but still hilaries. <br /> <br /> In addition, the special effects were VERY GOOD for a sci-fi / social satire. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but overall, I think it's one of those movies, if you don't think so, it's funny, it certainly makes your pleasure! I plan to recommend it to many, many people!
