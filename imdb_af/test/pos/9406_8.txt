This great TV movie has told about the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut by a cousin of Ethel Kennedy. The use of Martha's "ghost" to provide the details was very effective and added a lot to the story. Christopher Meloni captured Mark Fuhrman's personality very well. Furhman, who has so much publicity in the O.J. Simpson's trial certainly proved his contribution to bringing the killer to court after about 27 years.
