The curse of Monkey Island has always been my favorite of the series. A lively visual look, excellent soundtrack and brilliant voice make everyone a memorable and humorous adventure. <br /> <br /> Graphically, the game is definitely not a deviation. Although some angles have been cut, the overwhelming sense of the game is reminiscent of Disney Feature Length Animations. The game is simple and even a beginner will think quickly. The game also offers a little extra for the more experienced players with its Mega Monkey Mode. <br /> <br /> The cast is one of my favorites. Dominic Armato's sympathetic voice completes Guybrush and Alexandra Boyd is simply charming as Elaine. Earl Boen makes a wonderful sinister, but top crook, LeChuck. Also the game's charm is added by memorable characters such as Wally (Neil Ross), Murray (Denny Delk) and one of my personal favorites Haggis McMutton (Allan Young, Scrooge McDuck's voice). My hat is also late, big Kay Kuter and his memorable secondary role as Griswold Goodsoup. <br /> <br /> Michael Land's tropical and amazing soundtrack again gets the Monkey Island adventure, out of some of the best songs in the business. The game is not perfect and some places are not as good as others, but I had no grip on the simple end of the game that I found very satisfying.
