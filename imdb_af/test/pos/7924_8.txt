This movie should be seen for the music, which is actually a great cantata compiled by Sergei Prokofiev. Obviously, the original soundtrack is not really hip-fi, but there are many excellent versions available in classic music selections. The cantata can be appreciated in itself, but see how the movie helps. <br /> <br /> The story itself is fairly standard Soviet war-time anti-German propaganda. An amusing anecdote is that Stalin was later so eager to buy time by accusing Hitler at the start of World War II that Eisenstein was seconded to a German movie for a short while. <br /> <br /> Prince Alexander Nevsky (honored as a saint by the Russian Orthodox), who earned his nickname by defeating the Swedish raiders on the Neva, resisted Russian resistance to an invasion by the Teutonic knights and shut down his victory with a strict warning to other invaders. <br /> <br /> An interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians regarded by the Mongolian soldiers as slaves, and does nothing to stop it, as the Teutonic knights are its priority. The historic Alexander Nevsky devoted tribute to the Mongolian khans, as his father before him, consolidating his empire's future independence.
