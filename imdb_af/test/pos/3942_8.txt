This film is adapted from the well-known sutra traveling to the west where a monk with his three students is looking to find a long lost book related to the teaching of Buddha. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not as solemn as the previous films made by legend, it has managed to bring in romance and fun humorous scenes. <br /> <br /> This real purpose of this movie revolves around the monk who is mainly saved from eaten by demonic flying creatures. One of his students succeeded in getting the monkey God out of battle in the neck of the time, but was in turn caught by the demons and thrown into the deep throat of a dragon locked in that particular dungeon is. <Br /> <br /> The monk woke up in a small town where he found Mei Yan (the so-called ugly snake daughter) who fell in love with the first sight. Although ugly, she didn't let her look, except to come to him. But a search for the salvation of his three students soon appears to be filled with stumbling blocks and each one got worse with Mei Yan who followed the monk. Problems have come deeper and that is where conflicts between the relationship get worse. <br /> <br /> The rest of the story will be available to you, but it's enough to say that this movie is not the typical story of the book, it's more for those who want to look for a funny and light picture of what the Travel to the West and love barriers really mean. <br /> <br /> By the end, the whole summary can be described. with just one word, and this is love. The monk showed the Heavenly Gates, the Heavenly Palace and Buddha itself how love can overcome even the worst fear of all and be considered the most powerful weapon that can be used against any enemy of superior powers. <br /> <br /> A wonderful creation and funny deeds await those who buy this ticket. Of course there will be no regrets, at least on my part, and those who were with me at the theater, watched the same movie that day.
