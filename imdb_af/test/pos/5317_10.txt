This movie was a masterpiece of human emotions and experience. I think many people in Leland's apparent mental illness as the storyline are trapped, but I am drawn to the relationships of many characters and what they reveal about the power of human emotions. Much of the movie's message is that we never know the good without the bad, it's a little clich√©, but what makes this movie so good and so original that it very eloquently has the crushing and destructive power that can have the bad , portray, whether you see the bad everywhere as Leland, or experience the total helplessness of unrequited love or a relationship that just won't work, no matter how bad you want it. This movie determines how helpless relationships and emotions can make you feel better than any movie I've seen, and it's such a movie as it is good.
