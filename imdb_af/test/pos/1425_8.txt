This movie was never meant to be a big-budget movie, but was a nice picture that almost everyone can enjoy. It probably won't change your life, but it's definitely beautiful and engaging. <br /> <br /> Clifton Webb plays a curmudgeon (it's definitely not new) that has a TV. But his ratings fail and he is concerned about cancellation. So he may decide that he is too much with children, because he and his wife do not have their own. So, he volunteers as a scoutmaster and regrets doing it right away right away! Remember, he is a curmudgeon and does not like children. To make things worse, one of the kids really likes him and follows him like a lost puppy. No matter how indifferent he is to the child, the child just wants to spend time with him! The child is cute and almost steals the show! <br /> <br /> What then happens and the turning and turning of the movie is something you just have to find out for yourself. Understand that it's a light, cute and yet not cloying movie you're likely to enjoy.
