It's not a movie, but an experience! <br /> <br /> Not the ordinary eyecup. I thought it would be. Too many things happen right away, your senses can hardly handle it. A product of the latest technology (we are torn between just sitting back to enjoy the show and our 3D glasses on and off to decipher the magic), the music is wonderful (it's a concert!), Die Disney characters are in it (and you're part of their world), it's funny, it's great, it's exciting - I know it sounds like an ad - but it's really great! Beat Christmas to bring the child into you! <br /> <br /> This attraction is already worth a visit to Disney. ;)
