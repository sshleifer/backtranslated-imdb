It is now 2005 and 15+ years since this cartoon was first broadcast. I didn't seriously or carefully check it over 10 years. Now I am an adult in my 30's, I can look back with a serious eye as I see the episodes again. <br /> <br /> In concept, the cartoon is partly a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes, but also its own original show. There are some episodes that are structured like the old cartoons. For example, there is a singer who attacks Buster and so he makes revenge on this singer's concert - exactly like the old Bugs Bunny cartoon. The subsequent cartoon is similar to Looney Tunes, just in another era. Looking at the old Looney Tunes, they did a lot of things, just like Tiny Toons did. The old Looney Tunes made a lot of social commentary and parody. There were celebrities. There were many funny jokes, snakes and dialogue. The comedy was surreal and funny. You can also tell Tiny Toons exactly. The comedy styling is 'spiritually the same'. This is definitely a setback for the classical artists who were not well done in the decades before the show (if at all). We recognize the cultural references in Tiny Toons and we can roll our eyes as something we don't want to come up with. But the reason we didn't think Looney Tunes is corny is because we weren't alive in the 40's. Also, Looney Tunes was originally back in those days, but today cartoons are repeated over and over. It is therefore easy to view Tiny Toons in an unfair light due to our exposure to current events and our overload to cartoons in general. There are definitely differences in many respects - the timing, the delivery and, of course, the duration of the performances. They are two different styles from two different periods, under two very different circumstances. Looney Tunes is made for adults in theaters and Tiny Toons is made for kids watching TV. Yet they did a good job of making an original show with original gags and still paying tribute to the comedy styling of the old Looney Tunes. <br /> <br /> Since Tiny Toons had much more time to play with them, there are some real moments of great animation. Just look at episodes like 1 minute to 3, the baby Plucky toilet section. There is so much more. For example, one of the best comedy dialog exchanges ever animated is in ThirteenSomething when Babs and Buster are in a split screen on the phone, hoping that everyone will miss the other. The miscommunication is spectacular. The character development in this episode and in several others (usually those of Deanna Oliver or Sherri Stoner) is especially good. The female characters were taken seriously as personalities and developed, unusual consideration of the opposite, is usually true for cartoons of that period. <br /> <br /> It was the first modern cartoon that featured much of both pop culture reference and self-referencing humor. It was far from his time. Tiny Toons really opened a door for writers to take cartoons that are so common in cartoons today, instead of doing the boring old shit, we endured as 80-year-old children. Yes, I loved Transformers and Thundercats, but Tiny Toons jumped all over. It was a fresh air. Bakshi's new adventures of Mighty Mouse may have been a forerunner, but Tiny Toons made this surrealistic comedy cartoon style a real success. <br /> <br /> As a child, I totally ignored jokes. For example, one episode is a tribute to the Marx brothers who I completely ignored as a teenager. Now I have a newfound respect for it. There are so many inspired gags I have never noticed that are truly brilliant. It's the kind of comedy that reminds me of Looney Tunes and Family Guy. I never noticed that kind of comedy as a child. I thought about it for most episodes I watched recently. <br /> <br /> You will see these kinds of things if you actually saw the show. Unlike some other reviewers here, I know it unfairly, I have seen all the episodes and thought about them thoroughly, exposed as a child and as an adult. <br /> <br /> You can say there was a terrible care that was also done with the voting. I'm not just talking about the main characters, but the characters are really good and creative. But back to the main characters, some of the main characters were brilliant. Tension MacNeille, in my opinion, had her best performances in this cartoon. She hasn't been the same since. Rob Paulsen also did incredible things here. <br /> <br /> Not to mention the show didn't have bad episodes. It had a lot. It also had many mediocre people. But by far, it certainly had very real funny episodes. Especially when it was first broadcast, it was actually funny to watch. Out of 10 I give the show an 8.5 - and kudos to push the envelope and break down the doors leading to a new era of cartoons.
