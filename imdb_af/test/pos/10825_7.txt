An interesting combination of stories, this little movie management to bring together different apparent characters and story lines all in the background of World War II and succeed in tying them together without losing the audience. I was impressed by the depth depicted by the different characters and also by how much I really felt I understood and their motivation, although the time spent on each character's development was very limited. The outstanding acting abilities of the individuals involved in this photo are easily noticed. A fun, stylized movie with lots of comic moments and a lot more head injuries. <br /> <br /> 7/10
