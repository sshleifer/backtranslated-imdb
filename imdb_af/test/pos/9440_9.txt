Rose and the good Doctor find themselves in a space station on a planet that is impossible to move in orbit right under a black hole. The crew of the station is just as confused as the two new residents. Appropriate spooky in the atmosphere and gets better than the Doctor and Rose find themselves stranded because of circumstances beyond their control and speak through the submissive alien race of the Ood, something fairly dark comes under the crust of the planet. I didn't see the second part of these two parties. I can't make sure the end is so strong. But it makes one hell of a beginning. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A
