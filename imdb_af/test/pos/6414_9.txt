(the description of the mood of the movie can be considered a spoiler - because there is not much action) <br /> <br /> Big one ... <br /> <br /> Is it me odd interest in dystopia and utopia? It's for the atmosphere of the movie. Or is there more magic? If so, this is definitely the ultimate human being ... <br /> <br /> This film is undoubtedly extremely artistic / artificial (depends on taste). I can imagine most of the people who hate to watch movies slowly (and that of Tsai Ming Liang (which I didn't enjoy other times) is one of the slowest I know of, which suffers from the movie. Yes, people can't slow down and make time pass - and see it without wasting it. One can use this piece as a torture or as a therapy ... <br /> <br /> The subject on the surface? The lack of communication - even if we live in rabbit cages - one next to each other - but not really together? People are tired, sick of something and can't describe it - just don't want to meet, touch, talk, confront others ... as they disappeared. The big apartment block looks empty and the rain is constantly falling into the strange melancholy. And sometimes it must be something abnormal, unexpected, some unwanted decay as a hole in the concrete floor - this allows us to reach each other. <br /> <br /> One of the possible ways to look at it is: Don't investigate the inner world of characters - consider the entire film space inside of yourself. And ask - why is it there? Where can these depressive states and moods arise? Is there a place for them, they don't have the right to be here? And look for the answers (if you need them) between the walls and halls of the block - instead of within the barely transparent thinking of a man. <br /> <br /> The key to understanding is not to be understood. Let us borrow a movie - as a subject of study - inside-yourself, and let's finally return to our more colorful and 'normal' viewing reality. <br /> <br /> Perhaps you will achieve - like me - the feeling of real, possible, non-pathetic hope, that in core we are still people ... and this state of mind can greatly help in this world. life.
