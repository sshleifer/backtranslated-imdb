I was fortunate to see a screen protector of El Padrino in Santa Monica a few months ago. I was blown away. You don't see any more movies like this. In the bait of Scosese, Chapa tells Kilo's tragic story, maneuvering the difficult streets of LA to rise above the ranks to become a drug lover of Escobaric relations. The characters are complex and contradictory. The emotions are real. The action is fast and furious. The stunts are vast. And Tilly is warm. She hasn't seen so well since her "Bound" days. I would recommend it to anyone. It is a fantastic tribute to the epic action films of the late 80's and early 90's. And to all the naysayers out there? see it again; Of course you closed your eyes for the first time. Congratulations to everyone involved in the film. I count the days until the successor is released. Anyone has a date on it?
