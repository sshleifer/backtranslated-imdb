Awesome movie! Great combination of talents! I'm a big fan of David Duchovny and he's great in this movie! I'd like to see him in more movies of this nature. His talents are definitely underutilized and have much more to offer than Agent Mulder (although I'm also a big fan of the series). Anyway I want to see more of him. He's easily the Cary Grant of our generation. If you haven't seen this movie, you should! Great love story that shows love never dies ... it is forever with you. Minnie Driver is good and how can you go wrong with a throw? O'Connor and Mr. Loggia and Mr Belushi contain? This movie did not get any awards, but earned one. Great work Bonnie Hunt! ** By the way, the soundtrack is good too! **
