The former director, John Frankenheimer, regulated his first feature film, The Young Stranger, after tackling live television dramas in New York City. This film came on the heels of the success of Rebel Without a Cause in 1955. James MacArthur made his film debut as a troubled teenager with a film-maker father, played by James Daly, who is not full of a relationship with his son. Kim Hunter plays the mother trying to bridge the gap between her husband and her son. The movie uses the popular youthful delinquent corner of time to tell his story. MacArthur gets in trouble at a kiosk with a surviving theater manager played by Whit Bissell. MacArthur, in turn, is dealing with a police sergeant, James Gregory, bent to teach him a lesson. The material could easily have been exploitative, laughing and sensational, as any number of others did during the period. However, under the well-known direction of Frankenheimer, the film is a sensitive portrayal of teenage and age dynamics. The dialogue is realistic and most of the screens are surprisingly good. From the scenes with Bissell, as the theater manager, and Gregory, as the police officer, are a bit overbearing and dated. However, the performances are uniformly good, which is needed for a film of this kind and about this subject to succeed. This is an impressive film debut for MacArthur and Frankenheimer. *** of 4 stars.
