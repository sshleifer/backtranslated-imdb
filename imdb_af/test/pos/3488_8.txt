A formula for murder is not a well-known Giallo, but it's not to say it's not a very good one! The film is directed by Alberto De Martino, the man behind cult classics such as the Antichrist and Blazing Magnums. The film was released late in the Giallo cycle, but more than many of the films released in the 'golden' era in the early seventies. In spite of a lack of logic in some areas, the film works mainly because of the skillful way it mixes Argento style dead scenes with some truly surprising plot twists and an army of well-defined characters. The movie may not be as exciting in general as many other films in the genre; but it is more than compensated by the assured manner in which the central situation is fed to the audience, and the tension resulting therefrom. The plot begins with a fake priest raping a young girl named Joanna before bumping a step. We then have a few years ahead and the girl is now a woman, unfortunately in a wheelchair. She is trained for a sports event by Craig; a man who also has romantic designs on her. However, his proposal is not met with joy by Joanna's personal assistant, who also features romantic designs on her. <br /> <br /> The movie contains a compromise that gets halfway through the backbone of the movie. while not exactly logical; It's good to watch and show that you're in an interesting movie. Director Alberto de Martino is clearly not afraid to show some outrageous gore scenes. The best thing about this movie is that a priest is murdered by a spade and I won't hesitate to call that order one of my. favorite Giallo murder scenes! The plot can sometimes be temporarily uneven, but overall the action is very good. The director spends what looks like an eternity about the conclusion of the film; but it is completely full of tension, and the way it plays is good because it benefits from all the plots that went for it. The musical score, taken from Fulci's The New York Ripper, also works well in this movie and, with the break of a Giallo tradition, the Martino movie also features some good acting performances by cult veteran David Warbeck and Christina Nagy in her only role-playing. Overall, this movie is not one of the easiest Giallo's to come across; but it is worth finding and recommending fans of this kind of movie.
