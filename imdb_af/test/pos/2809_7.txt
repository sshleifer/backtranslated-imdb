The movie is good and I think Tiffany Amber is very beautiful. I like the movie. Can someone tell me how I can get the songs from this movie? Even the soundtrack will do. If that is not possible, can I at least get the names of the songs from their respective singers? I tried to look for amazon.com, but it's not there. I tried a CD baby, not there either. I've been browsing Google to get details, but there wasn't any. I would appreciate it if someone could give me the answer to my question. I know the songs belong to Country Music and sung by a land artist. I just need the title names with the singer. I would recommend this movie, or rather the songs to any country loving person.
