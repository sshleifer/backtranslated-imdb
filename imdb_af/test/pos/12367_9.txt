On a dark, gloomy New Year's Eve, a sick nurse, slowing her life, demands that David Holm be presented to her immediately. We still don't know who David Holm is, or why this nurse wants to see him, but her only death wish is just one more time with him. On the other side of the town, conveniently located under the tombs of the local cemetery, Holm (Victor Sjöström, who also directed) and two of his drunk associates fervently awaiting the arrival of the New Year. "Here we can only tell when we have to drink the New Year," exclaims Holm, pointing a finger at the big bell tower blowing through the darkness. Little does he know, however, that he will not live to greet it. <br /> <br /> To pass the time, Holm recites a ghost story. He once had a girlfriend, George, a happy fellow who was "smarter than the rest of us." On a New Year's Eve a few years ago, George broke a potentially disastrous noise and feared that the final man would draw his last breath before midnight, condemned to drive the haunted car for the next year. The Death's bid will do and collect the souls. of the deceased. "And, George, died last New Year's Eve!" Happily, Holm does not like mocking the man's beliefs. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a fate, it has an unexpectedly violent encounter, resulting in Holm's death just at night. As the man's transparent spirit rises firmly from his earthly body, he sees to his horror the distant approach of a phantom car. The driver, a weakened figure - snapped a little slab in his hand - walked off the wagon and approached. We are surprised to discover that the driver is no other than an apostate George. He is preparing to give his terrible duty to this year's successor. <br /> <br /> Considering the era in which 'Körkarlen' is made, the special effects in this movie are absolutely fantastic. Combatographer Julius Jaenzon uses double exposure photography to create the ominous, haunting silhouette of the buggy and his damn driver. Even today, the end result is highly effective. A particularly impressive scene involves the phantom car traveling to the ocean floor to get the soul of a drowning man. Another scene revered for Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) in Stanley Kubrick's "The Shining," includes Holm's kitchen door with an ax to reach his wife and children. <br /> <br /> Really ominous Victor Sjöström's Körkarlen is a fine film work that successfully portrays Holm's steady alcoholic decline, his inevitable day of judgment and a final hopeful possibility of salvation.
