Take someone you love or love and watch this movie. <br /> <br /> It affects you in all the right places. <br /> <br /> All the other reviewers here said everything. <br /> <br /> Maybe the cynics won't be impressed. <br /> <br /> They look just like the things that make you depressed for days. <br /> <br /> This movie is G <br /> <br /> I am so pleased that the Director was not trained by USC. <br /> <br /> It confirms my premise that there is too much mediocrity and conformity. <br /> <br /> This is due to the USC lock style mentality and inbreeding. <br /> <br /> Hooray for Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus, cast and crew. Well done!
