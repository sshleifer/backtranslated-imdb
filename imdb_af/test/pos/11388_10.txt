The next photo will only grow as time goes on. Better than any of the best photo nominees in 97 and it rewards repeated views. I saw it three times, so I know. Anderson was compared to some of the great US directors (Altman, Scorese, Tarantino) and he could have the influences, but chances are he will be considered for a few more films as part of that shortlist. <br /> <br /> One last note: Julianne Moore's "Amber Waves" will be reminded long after the other 90's movie characters have faded. The best performance of the year - in any of the four categories.
