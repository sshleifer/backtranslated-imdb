It's a great movie for pure entertainment, nothing more and nothing less. It's nice, and a vaguely feeling-good movie. <br /> <br /> A small but annoying thing about the movie is that we don't know why Justine and Chas broke. Well, most first relationships don't work for some reason, but they look more or less like a beautiful couple. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell, it is worth escaping reality.
