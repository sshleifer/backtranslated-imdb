I saw this movie years ago and I never forgot it. The theme is very timely. It was on TCM this morning and I wonder why this wonderful movie is not on VHS or DVD. I searched extensively for this movie, but can't find it. I believe that if enough people request it, the movie will eventually be on DVD. It amazes me that such a beautiful show by Quinn and such a powerful plot is not yet available to the public. The fact that ethnic cleansing exists today in many parts of the world makes this film a must for teachers and students. This film is a wonderful teaching tool from the past, but in many ways as contemporary as 'Crash'. From previous comments I can see that this film made deep impressions on everyone. Again, bad, it's not available for sale.
