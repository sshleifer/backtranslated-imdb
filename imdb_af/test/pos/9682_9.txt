"Family Guy" is probably the most beautiful sitcom ever made. It ruthlessly makes everything he can think of, from TV shows to family drama. Best of all, this is one of the few TV shows on today that is actually funny. <br /> <br /> The performance revolves around the Griffins: Peter, the obese father whose schemes are limited by his lack of intelligence. Lois, the mother who is more or less the head of the family, although Peter sees it as such. Chris, the fat teenage boy who has as little brain as his father. Meg, the black sheep of the family, is the only one of everyone's jokes. Stewie, the baby who plans to kill his mother and take over the world. And Brian, the family dog, who is often the voice of reason, is often damaged. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" uses many tactics to laugh at the audience. Most noticeable are the regular cuts that have just been spoofed. They are effective because of the impeccable timing and how they play. "Family Guy" uses spoofs to also get humor, mostly from 80's TV shows. What really makes the show so great is that one should not be familiar with what it is. I'm sure it will help, but the material is funny enough in its own right. But the show doesn't stop there. Not only does it just spoil it all, it skewers its own spoofs! The show is filled with color humor. The only reason people are not in the arms over the show is probably because it is equal to every race, gender and other generality. There is nothing sacred here, and nobody and nothing is immune to "Family Guy's" satirical jabs. <br /> <br /> Using music numbers in a movie takes a lot of time and effort, which is a huge risk. But "Family Guy" contains some good songs. All well written and performed, and of course they are hilarious (perhaps the best known one, "The Freakin 'FCC" is both catchy and hysterical because it hits the rating board it hurts). <br /> <br /> <br /> The voice characteristics are right on the money. Seth McFarlane is extremely talented. He gives the voices to Peter, Brian (who is his own natural voice), and Stewie. Not only are the voices consistent and creative, they can change their pitch per will, so they seem to be spoken by three different actors. Alex Borstein brings a nasal move to Lois that is perfect for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable because Chris (if I didn't watch IMDb, I'd never know it was him). Lacey Chabert created the character of Meg, and while she was good, Mila Kunis raised the character with her sharp voice. Kunis gave Meg a new, sharper edge that she didn't have with Chabert. <br /> <br /> "Family Guy" is compared to "The Simpsons", which is quite understandable (and not just because it is produced by FOX). Both are satires of blue-board life, and while "The Simpsons" is good, "Family Guy" includes sharper edges. The show is completely fearless. There is no real holy cow. The showlists (physical and spiritual), ethnicities, TV shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially Catholicism), drug use and addiction, all kinds of sexual humor (including S&M), and some that are out of description. Not all "Family Guy" throws at the audience, but overall, the performance is consistently amusing and often hilarious. <br /> <br /> If there is any error with "Family Guy", the jokes sometimes run too long. Especially with the "uncomfortable moment" jokes, the rows are stretched for so long that they are not just funny, it becomes so annoying (and long) that a quick button is justified. It can be effective in about 10 to 15 seconds, but the display sometimes extends to more than two minutes. One can argue that the show rewrites its rules to suit the plot, and this often happens (for example, Brian regularly acts like a person, but he still acts like a dog when the story requires it). But this is not a problem, because the show is still working. <br /> <br /> Some people argued that the show ceased to be funny. While I agree that it's not as dirty as it was, I think FOX is not blamed for McFarlane and his crew. The show came up with FOX, but after some dull ratings and viewer emergence it was canceled. However, DVD sales were big enough to be picked up by Adult Swim. The show has become an immediate success, and it was bought by FOX again. But because the show is so big, FOX is scared to let the writers experiment and try new things. While it's still funny, the humor is not so fresh and edgy. <br /> <br /> Definitely this exhibition. It is wonderful.
