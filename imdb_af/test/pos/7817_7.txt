There are a number of reviews that comment on the movie of this movie. It's enough to say that Alex Cord plays a strong lead over Robert Ryan and Arthur Kennedy. As far as I'm concerned, many of you may not be aware of the (at least) two existing versions of this movie. In the American version, Clay McCord gets amnesty from Governor Lem Carter and then drives out of the village. I agree that termination is less than satisfactory. However, in the original Italian track, Clay McCord pulls out of town (unarmed as he used to turn to the governor in his pistols) and is amazed by the bounty hunters who slowly deployed the bandit city Escondido. The Bounty Killers are excited about the prospect of dividing the $ 10,000 reward, but are disappointed to find McCord's amnesty deal in the bag. As they move away, they are told to comment: "If this amnesty ceases, I will start hunting buffalo!" . It only takes a minute to pray ... A second to die and put it on a level playing field with movies like Keoma and The Big Gundown. As the end credits say in the Italian cut "FINE".
