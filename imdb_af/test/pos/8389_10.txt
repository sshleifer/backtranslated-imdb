Inglorious Basterds make no excuses, ask for no forgiveness, it's a no-hold bandage assault on the senses. Tarantino does not care if he is offended, if he is acting on stereotypes and clich√©s, it is the purest movie. It is wonderful to see a filmmaker whose work clearly does not interfere with the powers it is. Tarantino is a master of upscale tension and suddenly blends it with a great laugh. You are not sure if you look away in the aversion or roll around, whether it is a roller coaster or one that should not be missed! It's not for everyone, and I'm not sure how Germans will take the film, certainly if you're not a fan of Tarantino's style, it can be a bit tricky to swallow, but it's never a movie. should be seen. No self-respecting movie may miss it. And the performance of Christoph Waltz ... Oscar, you dare not ignore him !!
