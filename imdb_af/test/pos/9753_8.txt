Hunt for Justice is about setting up Slobadon Milosevic for his trial in The Hague. While it was a little too clinically present, the subject could very quickly be depressed. A Canadian judge, Louise Arbor, becomes the prosecutor of the main war crimes at the International Criminal Tribunal for the UN in Yugoslavia. She fights everyone to pull out the evidence that Milosevic allegedly sent. Not a bad dock drama with class A directing and production work. The 'evidence' was alarming by the oblique discussion of the facts, fortunately they did not go into much detail and no real pictures of the torture.
