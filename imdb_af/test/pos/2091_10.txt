When a bomber, a patricide, a pornographer and a crazy cyclist, along with several other forms of social foam, have enough of their infected cell, they sting and look at the hole. Escape from the sewer, the group of 9 souls, benefits from their newly liberated freedom and the head of civilization. What follows soon is not surprising. Complete chaos and terror in their aftermath. Everybody seems to have some unfinished business to care for. <br /> <br /> Loosely based on The Great Escape, 9 SOULS is by far the top 5 best movies I've seen this year. Running right about 2 hours 9 SOULS will deliver a story so powerfully, it will leave you breathless. The beautiful, yet subtle, use of the coastal islands offers the realism that is expected of this story. The vision of director Toshiaki Toyoda (Blue Spring, Porn Star) is completely staggering, as he imparts a sense of pity to the characters. As soon as every character understands their dream, it is as fast as it is torn from them. Now all the responsibility for the success of this film should not only fall on the shoulders of the director, but also the players must have props. This film was full of excellent acting from top to bottom. Ryuhei Matsuda (the son of Miyuki Matsuda or Audition) is delivering a star performance, and apparently some of his mother's honesty is on display. <br /> <br /> I also need to give props to Artificial DVD. It's the 6th movie of them I've seen now, and they look better and better every DVD. The sound quality is perfect and the picture; clean and sharp. It is very annoying to watch a movie that is too dark in the transmission, so the slides of these cats are nice. <br /> <br /> Bottom line is this movie will soon receive masterpiece status by viewers worldwide. Keep an eye in 2005 for 9 SOULS; It's really great movie to watch.
