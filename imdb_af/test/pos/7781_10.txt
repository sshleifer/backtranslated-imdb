This is my favorite love story. It has every element that must have a good love story. Poetry, jazz, friendships the ups and downs in relationships. Finally, a movie showing positive aspects of the black community. Larenz Tate was wonderful I can't play anyone else other than Darius. He recommended the poem as he wrote it and meant every word. I own this movie and if I had the time to watch it daily, it always makes me better and that is what a good movie should do. The character Savon could not have worked better with the subject of marriage. We all want to find a Darius there, but most of us just settle for watching this movie. My voice is 10/10
