For many years I spent all the great directors, such as Kurosawa, Lean, Fulci, Lenzi, Deodato, Peckinpah, Kubrick, and admired them a lot. My favorite movie is once in a time in America. <br /> <br /> I just recently became a fan of D'Amato, and while he was not a horror master, his films were extreme or soft core, hardcore or extreme. <br /> <br /> Porn Holocaust is now one of my favorite movies, the way his shot is brilliant and the music is catchy. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato was not a horror master, he was neither Fulci nor Bava, but he was an erotic master, no other director could shoot erotic movies like him. He also never tried to make any movies outside this genre. <br /> <br /> Long live Joe D'Aamto master of porn and eroticism!
