Over the years, I have been very interested in the life of this teen who has left such a deep and indelible mark on the world. My fascination is also born of fear, as it happens, it can happen again. <br /> <br /> And in the years to come, yes, I fear it's still around us and of course it was Long before Anne. The 'it' is, of course, can a so-called civilized society turn on its own or on an innocent land / race / continent and kill people in cold blood on the most flashy excuses? I leave the question out there. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the documentary there is a statement about leader Adolf Hitler in the fact that the only fact about Hitler who is never mentioned is that he was elected democratically and all. some of the atrocities that have been committed have been caused by the accompanying poodle press and dreadful propaganda played over and over for a difficult population. <br /> <br /> One of the atrocities was Anne Frank, who was faced with the death camps by the miracle of her diary's survival. <br /> <br /> Kenneth Brannagh does a great job on the comment and interview, he has that rare gift to minimize his own persona so the subjects can speak for themselves. <br /> <br /> Many meticulous facts and people who have never been interviewed before are brought to the heart of careful research. I will not go in here as they unmistakably add to the reality and furious sadness of the film. /> <br /> Glenn Close reads diary choices and her voice is perfect for the part, she plays a naive and freshness. <br /> <br /> Old childhood friends of Anne's are long-lived and her last days before death are well recorded and testify with her vibrant and naughty personality. <br /> <br /> It should not be missed. A wonderful and respectful film about the rarely seen Anne. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10.
