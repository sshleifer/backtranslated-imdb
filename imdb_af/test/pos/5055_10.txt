"Labyrinth of Passion" - with the possible exception of "Matador" - is Almodovar's best movie. It displays its unique personality at its best and least sensitized, before starting more mainstream. Almodovar is just about the only modern director who can approach Preston Sturges' wonderful brand of lunacy. It makes sense to try to explain what the film is about, the real point is Almodovar's willingness and skill to take his situations to the outer limits of common sense, and sometimes of probability and taste.
