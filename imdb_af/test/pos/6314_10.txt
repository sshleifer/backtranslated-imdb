I saw this movie in the Rotterdam film festival and I was pleasantly surprised. Photography is just as attractive and beautiful, and the story just isn't your average mafia movie, actually the story is in the background. It is more the personal journey of a middle-aged man trapped in a life he must be forced to live. The actor, Toni Servillo, is wonderful, he admonishes this "silent man". The girl, Olivia Magnani, is the great daughter of Italian actress Anna Magnani and lives up to the family name. <br /> <br /> If you are expecting your Italian movie, where everyone is screaming together in big families, this is not your movie. There aren't your average clich√©s and it's definitely worth seeing this one.
