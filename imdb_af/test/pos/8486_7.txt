I saw Ray when it first came out. Why? Partly because of the advertising hype, secondly because I just loved the heck-outa of Ray Charles's music. But he wasn't there, when his biggest things happened in music and his life, I wanted to learn more about the man's life. And in this movie I did. His addiction to drugs was something I didn't know, and the film tells us. <br /> <br /> But here's the thing, while it was a decent autobiographical movie ... I can't say it was a big "movie. I saw" Malcolm X "and was blown away. "What is love to do with it" and "Bird." The performances of each of those films were excellent, not only in the main characters of those films - what did incredible jobs - but also for those around them. It helps to make a picture for me. <br /> <br /> I felt that some parts of this movie were handed over for emotional appeal, and yes, I will admit to some parts of the movie I almost fell asleep, and the film was too long, and the film left several "other" important details of Ray Charles's life that would make the movie flow better. And the movie looked like it was with a calyx, not a bang - certain parts, including the end like a "Lifetime" cable network movie for me. I expect more outa theater. <br /> <br /> So - where does my ambivalence come in? With Jamie Foxx's performance. Overall he did - okay. Not Denzel Washington's Malcolm X or Angela Bassett's Tina Turner is spectacular, but ... okay. Sorry, but for me there were several points in the movie where I saw Jamie Foxx's interpretation of Ray Charles. and in others - thanks to the wonderful camera angles and lighting - he looked "like Charles Charles". But I paid attention to the ... acting. An actor must make you believe he IS the character he plays. Don't make a caricature of the character. Did I believe Jamie Foxx was Ray on the screen? Sometimes yes - sometimes not. <br /> <br /> Has Jamie Foxx earned a Golden Globe? For sure. Does he earn an Oscar? Depends on who he opposes. He has a few big competitors there, and he can just stick them out. But then again ... maybe not. If Jamie Foxx doesn't win, I won't get up and say he's robbed. I especially didn't feel like he was. <br /> <br /> It was a decent movie with decent performances and a decent story. A "great" autobiographical film from late Ray Charles? No, I feel there is a wonderful movie about Ray Charles just waiting to be made, and an actor who will blow you away completely.
