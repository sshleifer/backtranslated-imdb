It is an excellent tube dumper of the war years. <br /> <br /> John Mills leads a good film of regular British B movie stars in a solo submarine attack on a fictional enemy catcher. <br /> <br /> Filmed in black and white, it was well played and well-placed considering that there was a war at the time. As something, it shows how seriously the authorities have taken positive propaganda. <br /> <br /> The mission side of the movie takes place in real submarines. Things are tight and claustrophobic. The actors look pretty messy and sweaty without being offended by the heroine. Other commentators have already drawn attention to the authentic small details, such as decorating and forgetting to read instruments, as well as car space activities. <br /> <br /> This is probably the first movie in which debris (and a dead German) is blown out of the torpedo tube to miss an enemy destroyer. And this is the only time I've seen that part of the vessel is exposed to an incident of zinc. A high-risk game if ever there was one. <br /> <br /> I'm a little skeptical about whether or not a submarine can close its way through a rope. Submerged speed was barely twice that of human speed, and the net would have had a great deal of 'give'. The engineer was also on the same workstation and had the same levers on the surface and submerged. It also seems unreasonable, since diesel or electric engines were used and they were in different sections of the ship - or so I told them. <br /> <br /> There was a little too much coastal drama for my taste. But then it was a propaganda effort, and it was clearly a subtle message for civilians to influence their behavior, as it could affect the morale of the service and therefore the war effort. <br /> <br /> Aside from this niggles, it's a fun entertaining little adventure. Nowadays, films of such a vintage are being screened in the afternoon, while many more modern and inferior films enjoy the premier time. But then; It is no longer politically correct to call the war in the presence of our European friends (too many of them have guilty conscience), or our own left-wing fascists (no one ever fought for the freedoms they now take for granted) . <br /> <br /> As a submarine movie it is extremely collectible. Better than 'The Enemy Under', I think, although fewer demonstrations. Not as real as 'Das Boot', but not so great.
