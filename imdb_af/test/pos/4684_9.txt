Over the past few months I have seen many reviews for The Italian Job, many of them negative. The essence of almost all these pessimistic criticisms is that the film does not have enough dust for all its modernist bravado and high budget technology. Look, people, it's just a fun movie. It's the type of picture you're supposed to put back, relax and just enjoy the constant moving pace of the movie. Like Ocean's Eleven (2001), you can concentrate on the characters and the plot at the same time without doing much thought (happy for some of us). Granted, "Ocean" is a better movie, but who cares? The plot can have a few holes (there is a large one about 3/4 of the way through). The action may not be as satisfying as the trailers make it, and some of the dialogue may seem meaningless and chaotic, but again, who really cares? Cool characters, Mini Coopers, big explosions, Charlize Theron. What else do you want? I think it's time to abandon the fake Roger Ebert to Gene Shalit and enjoy yourself for once! Oh, and another thing, whatever you do, doesn't compare it to the original one, because repeating what F. Gary Gray told the press a million times is not a reminder! My advice - if you're interested in making your way through a well-stocked, fun movie, don't even see the Italian Job. But if you don't have a serious inferiority complex and / or want to see Ed Norton get a bunch of Ukranians, go ahead. The Bottom Line, my fellow filmmakers, is: Relieve and enjoy, Dammit.
