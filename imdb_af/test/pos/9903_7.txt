I was fortunate to catch this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival and I have to say I really enjoyed it. When I asked the director if he had attended Film School, I was very impressed that he had not. Movies like this don't come from people without talent. To get started in advertising and then make a heart feast, family comedy comes like this. I'll definitely keep an eye on what he's doing next. As a good indie movie, the movie is very character driven. As attributed to your average Hollywood movie, which is mostly plot driven. The film is on a Jewish family in New York, the Applebaum's, who have all returned for their fathers' suicide party. The film is stocked with greasy, fast, jabbing, dialogue. The fact that the small Jewish family is being obsessed with Jewish and anyone Jewish relies on the unrealistic situation of a suicide party in fact. Director Jeff Hare does a wonderful job of drawing the characters from the actors and letting them live on the screen. The production design brings the sets to life with great attention to small details that make the environment feel like a home that has been living for 40 years. The editing stops the dialogue in such a way that it sits on your seat and wonders who is going to sting with the next spectacular phrase or punch line. And when appropriate, the movie is delayed to dive the audience a little deeper into the meaning and motivation hidden in these lovely characters. If you're a fan of Woody Allen or movies like "So Good as it Gets", watch this movie.
