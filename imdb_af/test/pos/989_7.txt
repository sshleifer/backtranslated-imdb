Can't write very well because I can't say I liked it. But that's the story that bothered me, not the realization of the movie. The acting, direction, atmosphere, music were all good. It's just after you see a lot of people doing things you can't really endure, the movie ends. It is educational in the way it sees the horrors of war as from home, and the way feelings do not have to make sense and still be strong, but it is about it. <br /> <br /> The plot covers a period of a few years in which poet Dylan Thomas is taken under the roof of a former ex-girlfriend. He is married, brings his wife and later the child, while the ex (Knightley) marries another man. But the tension is there, Dylan is a self-managed jerk and the new man returns home from the war with a slight case of PTSD. Add in some nice temperamental characters and you have your hands full. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: You have to be in the mood to keep this movie. The hard part is to define this mood. I don't think I've ever been in it. Ever. So it is probably better watched by adults with an understanding of strange complex human behavior and perhaps a curiosity about Dylan Thomas.
