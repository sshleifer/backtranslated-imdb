Compared to the competition, soul calibur 3 is a god of games - a real art. However, compared to its 128-bit predecessors, the latest in namco-superior slash em up series is too ambitious. His efforts to improve on perfection are not entirely successful. <br /> <br /> There are new modes and game games. what I recommend to try to increase the range to new heights - but it only complicates things. Examples? Well, the character creation mode is a good idea in theory, but in reality it is full of limitations and it is not as adaptable as it is found in the wwe games. The chronicles of the sword mode are nice and thought for a while, but eventually it pulls up and feels a bit to make money rather than a really fun game. Also, the soul mode's story, which is basically arcade mode, with tiny bits of unobtrusive story and shenmue-style cast QTR bits, really feels slow. <br /> <br /> "OMG !!! YoU don't kNoW, but yoUr SajinNg" is probably what the more overwhelming of you think, but don't distort it. I don't hate this game. This game is great! It still has that classic gameplay (though some characters are moving, are unnecessarily changed), absolutely stunning graphics and the epic soundtrack for which the games are known. And also on the good side of things are the new characters (especially sasalamel) that are cool in their own way (except setuka-yes, I know I'm nitpicking). It's just what it compares to soul calibur 1 and 2 it feels like it's much more than it actually is. This doesn't mean it's not a classic, it just means that it gets a little short of its own high standards, though more characters move on stages and better graphics than ever. <br /> <br /> Still soul-calibur 3 wipes the floor with 95% of the games out there - and that's something! Oh, and anyone who notices this review as "unhelpful" feels clearly hurt that they insulted their favorite setuka. Well listen fanboy / girl: She's not real! And even if she was, she wouldn't be killed with you.
