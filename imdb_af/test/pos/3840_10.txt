This is one of my favorite movies, ever. The story is just as fantastic and the characters are so good. Unlike the other Disney movies of old age, this film never fades the audience. 101 Dalmations, Peter Pan, Robin Hood, they were all good but missing what we have here. It's funny, creative and always on the target. This movie has just one extra thing you can't learn in books. However, this is not the best animated movie ever made. The title belongs to the BRILLIANT Toy Story. But it's a respectable second, immediately followed by The Lady and the Tramp. Just to see it and enjoy that one of the greatest achievements of the theater. And at the bye, I'm not a small child, it's for the older audiences who want to revive their childhood. An absolute must!
