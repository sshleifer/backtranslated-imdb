I really loved this movie and have been trying to get it for years. It's just not available and it hasn't been on TV for many years. I enjoyed it and the songs because it had something different to say and made you think of how each person looks at different prospects. Also, we often do not appreciate anything we have until it is no longer there. <br /> <br /> My 12-year-old daughter just discovered the music and was captivated with some of the songs. One day I hope to get a copy of the movie so she can see it. (Oh, I'd like to see it again!) <br /> <br />
