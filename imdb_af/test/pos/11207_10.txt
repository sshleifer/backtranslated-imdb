For those who, like me, are used to watching and enjoying high-budget Hollywood movies, on big-screen surround sound, this movie looks so far. But it surprised me how close it can be to any person while I see it. It is so natural that you feel that nobody has written a scenario or nobody has done it. You are the director and you write the scenario while you watch it. For me, the time I spend watching a movie is the only time I go to another world. This film is the first example for me, showing that it is not always a must to watch millions of dollars of screened movies, to move the sound to another. These movies send you to another world (or maybe make you back to yourself) without millions of dollars of budget or technical capabilities. I felt like reading L'etranger from Camus.
