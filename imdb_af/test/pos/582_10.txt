Looking at Jim Henson's years of work after his death, is like looking back at another time. Unlike most so-called creative types trying to sell, or even worse, but cynically, children, Jim has never really forgotten what it was like to be a child. And if there was ever a moment in which he demonstrated it, Labyrinth was aside, this is 1979's Muppet Movie. Filmed as an allegorical story about how Henson emerged in children's television as a puppeteer and eventually ended up with a half-hour show of his own on primetime television, the Muppet Movie ended up confirming everything more progressive, comprehension forms would say children who did not reach the expected norm during the 1980s. And as we enjoy the fruits of an era in which we are dedicated to talking about anything so that no one is abused, the open celebration of the difference or diversity that formed much of The Muppet Show is presented here. I said it in other comments, but I have to say it here. A great light in the world went out that day. Jim Henson died. <br /> <br /> The Muppet Movie begins with its role-player to see the premiere that will be watched over the next eighty or so minutes. In short, exact strokes, we are introduced to the big players as well as the minors. And when the story started properly, son, we gave a good song to bring us to the moment. The Rainbow Connection painted both a beautiful and sad image of the Muppets, especially Kermit. It wasn't just a bunch of emotional puppets with simple personalities that combined to put on a show. They were living things based on a part of us all, writing just as much more boldly as we are used to. As each Muppet has been introduced to us, we have seen another reflection of a part of ourselves, and of course, the children in the audience will respond differently to each character. That's why everyone had a favorite. When Animal appeared behind a drum bag and tried to eat a symbol, I knew I found one. Nowadays, I'm more of a Swedish Chef fan, but what the hey is. <br /> <br /> Complementing the characters was a string of music numbers that further developed their motivation and personalities. Can you suggest it? gave an insight into dr. Teeth and his band, as well as the creative soul of Henson. But the most relevant song for me was Gonzo's number and asked what he was and where he came from. Many of us will spend a lifetime in the stars, and like Gonzo, we say we knew we were going to go there someday. Not that all the songs were so deadly serious, of course. Fozzy and Kermit share a number after they decided to combine their talent (or lack of it) and hit the road. If any evidence is required that contemporary "musicians" have lost the ability to use the pop structure to make something listenable, this number will be. Never before, and never again, the group would be dynamically complemented by a cast and the music so perfect. With the puppet players and voting players so perfect on top of their game, the human cast had a lot to live on. <br /> <br /> What makes it all the more surprising that the human element also lived to the end of the deal. Kameos literally paste the movie, with everyone from Steve Martin to Telly Savalas who offers their support. Even Richard Pryor, the last man to be seen in a movie about the Muppets, seems to be a hilarious moment. Mel Brooks' cameo is just as disturbing to me as an adult as it was when I was a little boy, but I suspect that is because Henson knew why I would find it now. However, the great acting strength comes from Charles Durning, who as Doc Hopper embodies everything that Henson and his audience have determined to resist. At each crossing, Hopper also comes to give Kermit the chance to betray his own kind. Or perhaps it ceases to be the right word when Hopper's efforts to ensure Kermit's compliance are progressively more violent and violent. The whole thing is one great metaphor for how each artist broke his heart through the world. <br /> <br /> Of course, Animal also reminds us that just because our friends aren't sweet and cuddly isn't their friend. In fact, Animal seems to be the best friend Kermit has in that moment. And this is the core message of every good show or movie that Henson has been involved in since then. It can literally be the worst mistake anyone ever makes to avoid or dismiss it, simply because of linguistic or cosmetic differences. There can be little doubt that in today's world where a moron in a press can tell my boys, it is not good if they have no good feelings for fifteen seasons and still have not come under the scrutiny of child welfare authorities , Henson's creativity shop could never get off the ground. To mislead the album title, it's hard to be stupid, but one thing, but choosing others is another matter. The Muppet Movie shows how Henson dares us to think, both inside and outside the proverbial box. There will never be anything like him again, but he will never want us to stop trying. <br /> <br /> That's why The Muppet Movie is the hallmark of a ten out of ten movie. If we were to send a film out of the cosmos to prove that intelligent life is worth more than being wiped out, it would be.
