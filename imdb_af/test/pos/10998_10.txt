When I first saw the movie, I thought it was sweet - a family movie. For the rest of the night and over the next few days, however, clever moments and funny lines returned in my mind and conversation. There is a lot going on, classic elements of farce, good character acting, and Wendie Malick's story line is just hysterical. To call it a "feel-good movie" believes the white and fun - it's smarter than it looks, just like "It's a wonderful life".
