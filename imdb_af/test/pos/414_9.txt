Ugh, who's an embarrassing episode last night! It was either a failed script for ABC Afterschool Special, or the product of a serious newcomer, just outside the college, honoring the classic PC anti-gun homily of 1974, The Gun. In fact, male and disappointed that the end shot was not from The Gun as it was melting in the movie! <br /> <br /> No, I'm not a NRA shill. It's just that when the manufacturer of an intelligent and nuanced series gets it in its head that I have to be subject to a didactic dramatization of his personal cause, I would appreciate it if the reading at least doesn't go through 2-by-4. ! <br /> <br /> OK, the sociology lesson is over. The message was delivered. The important episode was broadcast. Let's go back to some entertaining episodes that try to respect our intelligence.
