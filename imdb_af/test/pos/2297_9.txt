I really liked this one. (SPOILERS ??) It had a very good plot, the main lady in this movie is really kewl. Despite being the only one alive and her lover dead, it was much like Ninja Scroll. Another kick-ass movie. ;) <br /> <br /> Look in Japanese with subtitles. I don't know where the idiots who learned English speak, but for some reason get an F a F in translating techniques. The captions are correct. <br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Repeatable: 9/10
