Bergman is a sublime comedy director and writer. This fact is evident in "And reading I love", where the comic elements range from pure slapstick to deep but very emotional scenes. This film is the way for Bergman's later comedies "Sommarnattens leende" and "Kvinnodrom", all with Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand as well as Eva Dahlbeck. This is an excellent movie that lets you start your Bergman experience, depicting emotional problems of both the young and the parent. The cinematography by Martin Bodin is amazing, for example in the picnic scene. In short, the film is a perfect example of a successful comedy, with a clear depth that even surpasses Bergman's own comedies.
