I watched this film in a Singapore theater on February 4, 2006 and have a better understanding of what schizophrenia patients and their loved ones have gone through. <br /> <br /> Ms Aparna Sen should not only be congratulated on tackling a difficult subject but also treating the mentally disputed with a deep understanding of their predicament needed to help them overcome the trauma of disorientation, hallucinations and the storm of unrest in their minds. <br /> <br /> We had Hollywood movies on this subject, like "One flew over the cuckoo's nest" where Jack Nicholson wore the honors. Since then, research has helped to give more insight into the problem and to remove some misconceptions about treatment. In "... cuckoo's nest", for example, shock therapy was portrayed as barbaric, but in "15 ..." the point was made that it was not as bad as it was made up. <Br /> <br /> The other misconception is that childhood abuse is a cause of schizophrenia. But scientists like dr. E. Fuller Torrey emphasized that studies have shown that schizophrenia for children is a brain disease and presumably has genetic roots. <br /> <br /> It is now established that schizophrenia can be treated as any clinical condition and its advance can be checked if it is detected early. Even in fairly advanced stages, regular medication and counseling can be effective. <br /> <br /> The same concept shown by Ms Sen is evident in the way the actors spell out their parts. In keeping with the seriousness of the theme, the play is consistently controlled by me. Konkana Sen-Sharma's voice-oriented silence and eyes reflecting the helpless confusion of disturbed thoughts, which is harder than some of the rantings we use in most movies. Includes spiritually challenged characters. <br /> <br /> Like me, most of the audience in the theater got confused at the sudden end. This leaves many questions about the plot. <br /> <br /> Did Meethi's search end? Why is she not found in number 15? Were there children actually playing when Meethi went over the gates, with her eyes acknowledged? Can someone choose this puzzle?
