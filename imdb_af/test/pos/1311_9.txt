I originally saw it on Channel 4 (UK) and it was a fantastic movie that made me feel great. However, I recently saw it on Irish TV, and Roy Scheider has a further story ("we need a bigger boat!"). It ruined the movie for me. His drunk monologue adds absolutely nothing to the movie, and as anything from the movie takes brilliance. I wonder about the new DVD version that has no Roy (due to legal reasons?) Would people stop buying it. Well believe me, the movie is much better for that! <br /> <br /> Cheers <br /> <br /> Damian
