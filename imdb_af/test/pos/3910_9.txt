I have heard many different opinions on this film, and to find out that Paris was also in Hilton does not give me the best impression of the film. Then I was dragged by the group to the theater. from my friends and sitting there waiting a lot of pants. I was shocked to find that I was stiff, all the way through the movie ... it was predictable yes, but the build-up of the deaths and the whole atmosphere of the movie made it VERY frightening to me ... I have all the way through my fingers. So I'm going to check it out and decide for yourself and as the fact that it's a scary movie not convincing you to watch it, it also has Chad Michael Murray in it that can't be bad looking for a few hours not eh?
