I give this movie only 9 out of 10 because there are not enough specific scientific references to the amount of energy it takes to produce food to satisfy the scientific hate. mdixon seems to believe the biased commentators raise these issues, but even an elementary understanding of resources and terms of thermodynamics will indicate that they are at least solid scientific basis when declaring that we cannot rely on oil, we must transition to different types of energy, and do not have a plan that will replace the amount of energy we will replace with oil. Other civilizations refused to face the facts of life and were killed. Read Jared Diamond's "Collapse" which is a popular book, or any elementary ecology or geography guide, and you can verify the basics of this movie. Go ahead, fiddle while Rome burns!
