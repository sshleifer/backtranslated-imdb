I just saw this movie at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham, AL. It was a really nice party and was blown away by it. It was the best movie I saw all day long shot. A school-going prostitute meets with a middle-aged man and tries to end deep depression. It is an inward look at the darkest parts of human sexuality. Story comes from real-life events torn directly from the news. Raw, blunt dialogue and a killer turn to the end. The film contains graphic sexual dialogue and nudity. Definitely not suitable for children. Too depressed for the taste of some people. Definitely worth looking at in my opinion.
