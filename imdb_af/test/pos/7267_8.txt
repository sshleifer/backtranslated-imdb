.. is the princess bride met ... good train spotting. But wait, it's really a good combination! It was definitely one of the better movies I have seen long ago ... it has the kind of fiery dialogue I associate with The Princess Bride of Cemetery Man, along with the disgusting scenes of violence of a horror movie ... the heroic Feeling of Princess Bride combined with the (it's strange) lack of any very good guys who had Trainspotting. <br /> <br /> I'm not saying it was as GOOD as the Princess Bride, but it was in the arena and it shook. Some of the dialogue exceeds enjoyable brilliant, the plot is interesting, the characters - while ONLY ANCHRONISTIC - are anachronistic not because of their intrinsic nature (there were flamboyant gay people in the 18th century, as opposed to previous reviewer's remarks) ) just in a bit of the language they used. However, the anachronisms made it enjoyable, and NOT cheesy and easily discharged. <br /> <br /> If you've ever read any Simon R. Green or Gleen Cook's Garrett series, you know exactly what this movie is. Look at that. It's wonderful.
