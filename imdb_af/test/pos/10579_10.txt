I love Sarah Waters's Fingertip, and was worried about the TV adaptation because I was disappointed with the BBC's version of Tipping the Velvet (both of which are beautiful to watch, have been dropped by Keeley Hawes unable to singing, and Rachael Stirling not being able to act). Vingersmid is a very tightly written novel with breathtaking twists and turns and I wondered if it could be done within just 3 hours. <br /> <br /> I don't have to worry. The adjustment was excellent, very little cut out, and went at a creaking pace (though I wonder if you wouldn't read the book, would you miss things?). It had the look and feel of a BBC classic costume drama, and I had to remind myself that it is a contemporary book. <br /> <br /> The acting was stars. Sally Hawkins plays her heart as Sue Trinder, and slow burner Elaine Cassidy, who was glowing at the end of the story than Maud Lilley. The love, the passion, the realization of the betrayal must both be done, written on their faces. It was a joy to watch. <br /> <br /> I hope Rachael Stirling has watched: this is how you play a Sarah Waters character!
