(*** Minor spoilers ***) <br /> <br /> If there's anything in the world of silent clowns that puzzles me, it's that Charley Chase never got his well-deserved "breakthrough" in the movies. Oh yes, maybe it's not that strange, really, because he never played in a long-length feature. But when I think about it, such an explanation makes it all more mysterious - why did Chase not get Chase to get any offers to play the lead in features? One explanation is that his character, no matter how amusing, is just too realistic to adjust a longer story. Without the burlesque elements that Chaplin, Keaton, Lloyd, Langdon and other comedians possessed, it can be assumed that the comedy he made and that worked twenty minutes as well would be repetitive. I do not buy it altogether, as Chase's gag construction is wonderful and I believe the best interest of viewers can be maintained for a longer period. at least I am tempted to think so when MUNICALLY walks like the MOOSE. <br /> <br /> Mr. Moose is not exceptionally beautiful, and Mrs. Moose is hardly a "classic beauty"; He has the truly greatest front teeth of any human on the planet, and she has a remarkable big nose. Both of them take plastic surgery without the other's knowledge, and if they encounter a little later accidentally, he does not recognize his wife and does not recognize her husband. A number of hilarious misunderstandings begin, with many smart gags all the way through. I don't think I'll make anything further to make the show more enjoyable for you. Because if you are a fan of quiet comedies, or even if you are not, like a Moose, MIG offers so many unforgettable moments in such a short time that I will regard it as a fair shame to not see it ; stupid, but no less extremely funny.
