I love this movie. Shehzad Khan's portrayal as Bhalla et al. "Shut up, Robert!" was so hilarious. When he is hit during a fighting scene, you can hear him squeal. Viju Khote is the dumbfounded Robert a.k.a. "Rabbit". I love the Shakti Kapoor, a "Crime Master Gogo". Paresh Rawal's dual role is so terribly hilarious for his portrayal of Ramgopal Bajaj & Shyamgopal Bajaj. Raveena Tandon and Karishma Kapoor are outside this world. My brother had a very good aversion to Bhalla. "Relax. PLEASE PLEASE." I love the scene in which Aamir Khan gives a laxative in Salman's "Muscle" Khan's food, causing the irregular bowel movements to force him to use the toilet-wide number of times.
