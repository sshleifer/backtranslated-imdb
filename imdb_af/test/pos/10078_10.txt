It's strange how the least known movies are sometimes among the best you have seen. This movie has all the elements of a standard contemporary thriller, rifle, techno, bad, cash, etc., and yet it stands out from your average Hollywood. I would admit it to two very charismatic people. Christopher Walken has a cool confidence and Lorraine Bracco is one of the hottest and sexiest women I've ever seen on the screen. Another important reason why this film stands out is the institution that moved to Jamaica after the start. The Jamaican resort is so beautiful you will wish you were there at night by the pool with a Run'n'Coke. . . . I know I did it. I'm very happy to have seen this movie - it was just too nice to miss!
