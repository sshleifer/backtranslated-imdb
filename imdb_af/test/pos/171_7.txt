Three 10-year-olds who are born simultaneously during a solar eclipse are all starting to commit mischief. <br /> <br /> While killing childhood movies were not exactly new at the time of this twisted 80's The theme of kids as killers works well for this movie. Bloody Birthday delivers some good chills and tension while managing a capable killer thriller with some peculiarities. It has a fine line between cheesy and creepy, but it remains entertained with an interesting plot. There are some strong murder scenes as well as a good little nudity to make it a sturdy hideout. <br /> <br /> The role play does a pretty good job. Youngster Elizabeth Hoy and K.C. Martel performs some menacing acts, while emerging star Julie Brown does a striptease before an unforgettable murder scene. Veteran star Susan Strasberg does well as the teacher and Jose Ferrer has a cameo look. <br /> <br /> Although all this discount-slip re-entry is not bad, although it is not flawless, it is worth looking for genre fans. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
