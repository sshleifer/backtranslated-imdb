I was shocked to learn that Jimmy Caan left this show, does anyone know why? I see James as one of the all-time greats and was not surprised that he landed on TV, which could be better than the shit you see on the big screen. The stories are smooth and the camera faster than a speed bullet! Don't forget the rest of the cast: James, Vanessa (yum!) Nikki, Molly, Josh, Mitch. Can anyone tell me why on earth there is a whining theme on DVD sets, but Elvis's JXL remix of a little less conversation is being used on the initial NBC broadcasts ?? Isn't it sensible to use a song that you will associate with the gambling mecca of America for DVD releases?
