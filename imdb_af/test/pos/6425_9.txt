A very insightful psychological thriller! Voetspore is an attractive example of the 70-year-old powerful Italian film making. And Luigi Bazzoni, a misguided director and visually amazing 'author'. The movie develops its unusual plot with an incredibly exciting atmosphere and never disappoints, especially in its sad and dramatic final! Florinda Bolkan delivers excellent performance, rich in nuances and becomes sensitive, depicting a dark lady who is not only fascinating, but also painfully and tragically alone. But the whole role is also a surprise! Lila Kedrova, Nicoletta Elmi (the mysterious kid at the beach), Italian screen legend Caterina Boratto and the beautifully beautiful B movie queen Evelyn Stewart in the short but hasty role of the protagonist's friend! And Klaus Kinski in a surprisingly disturbing cameo! It is strange to note how incredibly well-traded movies were like Footprints! Vittorio Storaro's moody and creepy cinematography, stylized layouts and sets, Nicola Piovani's ghostly score and first of the story, so intense and disturbing, so intelligently layered and structured! A game with fantastic elements, but especially with a soul and a personal vision. I wish movies like Footprints will not be forgotten! I wish the movies were more informative and personal today because they were back in the 60's / 70's! And yes ... I wish someone would soon make a digitally remastered widescreen DVD from this little masterpiece!
