I don't know why all the critics say it was a bad movie, it's one of my best favorite movies. Tommy (Chris Farley) and Richard (David Spade) are a good match. Tommy is the stupid who spent seven years in college and eventually went with a D +. Richard is the smart kid hated by everyone in the school. How can you not laugh when the two of them "Superstar" sing passionately by the Carpenters and suddenly the hood appears? In all this is a good movie, I recommend it.
