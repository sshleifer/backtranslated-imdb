These miniseries are a reasonable successor to the original Gone With The Wind. If one considers it on its own merits (and does not immediately follow the original one), it will work out well. I'm sure most viewers will question Scarlett and Rhett's performances, but it seems unlikely anyone else could have done better. Many of the characters here are new to this storyline, so comparing these cases (Rhett's mother, Uncle Henry Hamilton, Will Benteen) is not a problem. No one will ever be Vivien Leigh or Clark Gable. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole production is the beautiful scenery of Spring Charleston and Ireland. Just look at that. It was clear that this was a high budget TV miniseries. It follows the book for a while, and then has a totally new plot when Scarlett goes to Ireland. <br /> <br /> The play is credible as nothing special - kind of the way I feel about Roger Moore following Sean Connery for James Bond.
