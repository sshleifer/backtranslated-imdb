I loved this movie for a long time. I haven't seen it yet, so I checked it again and found it even more enjoyable. I loved the Chipmunks cartoon when I was young, and of course I worshiped The Chipmunk Adventure. <br /> <br /> I honestly can't think of a better plot for this movie. It is not wildly creative, but I have always wanted to travel around the world, so I have so much fun seeing it as my desire to travel is growing even more. The part with Elenore who sings the little penguin always makes me go ... <br /> <br /> "The Chipmunk Adventure" will be a favorite of mine forever, I'm sure. I think that's because I saw it when I was so young. I don't think it will impact on someone who sees it for the first time. (Unless of course they have a young heart)
