I watched this movie with my mom. She is 81 yr .old and was educated to be a bulk. She even admits it. I don't think she really understood what was going on, she had already told her the child was guilty. Frightening. I felt for this child and his family. What torture they went through and remained faithful. This is true faith. Back to the movie. I was disgusted by the police force and their dissatisfaction. I am so glad that this public defender was chosen to work this case. It was very happy for this family that they had a person who had enough to see through the shit handed over to him. I could tell when one was lying to the police. He won't face the defender. His eyes went aside when he answered the questions. It is a pity that a black person should be punished for the color of his skin. I read the book about the black man dragged by three white men behind a truck. They were eventually found guilty after many years. I can't remember the title, but it was the same premise. Whites do what they want with blacks. I'm sure the kid in the movie will be traumatized for a long time, if not forever. I showed my mother that most series killers and pedophiles are white. No comments from her. I want to praise the director and producer of this movie. I felt the exposure they had given to this blatant injustice was an essential project. I'm a keen viewer of indie movies. I feel they are well written and have content. I'm glad I grabbed this movie on the shelf. I have been forced to comment on how strong I feel about the film and the prejudice that still exists in our modern society.
