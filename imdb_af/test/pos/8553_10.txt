This movie ... I saw it 15 years ago and in the last few years it couldn't remember, name or anything else. It was just about a Romanian country that played beautifully by Anthony Quinn. The impression I got from this drama will be forever. Eventually I got the name of the movie, I hope I can buy it. And honestly this movie worth 10 Oscars. Ten times BRAVO. I was quite young when I first saw the movie. I asked my friends if they had heard this story, but nobody would know anything about Anthony Quinn playing the role of a Romanian farmer. I remember when a German officer came, Anthony saw and told him he was a good "race", but the German was in fact fraud. For a few bucks you will not get rich if you buy the movie, but you will be rich if you have it.
