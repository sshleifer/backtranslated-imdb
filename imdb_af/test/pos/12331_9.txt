You watched this movie ... I saw it as 13 years old at the theater, on my very first date ... Fast forward over 20 years and I'm gay now (Thank you One Dark Night !! LOL!). This movie has picked up hell from me as a child (mausoleums still do!), But as an adult, the thrill of this movie is not in the storyline, but rather the hysterical laugh it holds. Highlights listen to the names the teens call each other, from "nerdlebrain" (my personal favorite) to "turkey". Also keep your eyes peeled for the scene where Carol (the blonde chief sister) is trying to hang her phone on a soft drink (can't believe they didn't resume!) ... Other highlights include Adam West's overly dramatic outbursts and the gooey bodies. If you're a fan of real horror, I'd like to introduce this movie just because it's almost a horror parody. There are def. A Greek factor and the plot is a good one, but don't see it if you want to be scared (unless you're like 10 years old or something).
