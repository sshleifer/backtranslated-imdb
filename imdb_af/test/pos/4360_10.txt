Wow.this is a touch story! First I saw 'Rescue Dawn'. I didn't keep it. And now I saw the person, Dieter Dengler, about who this story is being told by Herzog. Very impressed. Dieter is a driven person who has experienced the opposite emotions in his life on this earth. What an extraordinary life this person suffered. His story of catching the Patet Lao / Vietcong and therefore his suffering is terrible, but the most impressive is his incredible will to survive. How can he find the power? In a haunting way, Dieter tells us in full flowing sentences about his terrible ordeal during his imprisonment. He is a wonderful narrator and Herzog makes him the justice this valiant man deserves. <br /> <br /> In my opinion. "Small diet should fly" tell it all! , leaving nothing to the imagination, making Redding dawn a superfluous movie. The horror is no more real than in the words of Dieter Dengler himself. He manages to paint the picture.
