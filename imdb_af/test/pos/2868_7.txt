This is one of the best horror movies I've seen for a while. A strange abandoned house, interesting characters, gore and a twisted plot. Who can ask something more in a horror movie? It's pretty predictable for the most part, but again the most horrors you can find within the first 10 minutes so I can't keep it through. The music, camera angles and so on are excellent. The sets are good and very convincing. There were quite no subplots, but it's a horror movie too many alternative plots just take away from what, because of an abomination anyway wanted to be ... To be scared ... This one keeps it pretty simple and does it only. If I were to compare it with another movie, I would recall the memory of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Definitely a horror movie lover should see.
