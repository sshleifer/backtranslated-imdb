I first saw the "Knowledge" during a Thames Television marathon at one of the local independent stations in Los Angeles when it was new. I enjoyed it very much with the danger UXB. <br /> <br /> That one movie I saw once more than twenty years ago should be so good in my memory is proof of the originality and quality of the cast by the cast. /> <br /> I selected a DVD copy here in the US and found nothing. I eventually bought a British DVD from Ebay and was happy to find that it had no regional code. So those of us who would like to see this jeweler can get a copy.
