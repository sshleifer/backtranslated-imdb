Last time I entered here, I think there was no more than one comment. I am delighted that more people have now caught on to this movie, and even more so that you also dig it all. I caught it the night of Christmas 2004, and I couldn't change myself the channel on my TV, even though it was an Asian movie - and unfortunately I am really used to no chance of an Off Hollywood products. However, I did that night and thank God very much for that. I couldn't shake that movie out of my system - not what I tried or wanted - and it still amazes me - in a very grateful way - that such a wonderful experience in such a way, quite unexpectedly, like A Christmas Miracle. If you get the chance, look at this movie, buy it or rent it from bootleg it or whatever, but watch it. I guarantee it will affect you. I'm out of time, but I'm far from finishing my appraisal, so I'll be back as soon as possible.
