I've been a fan of Amanda since Amanda, and she's still funny. For me, it's as simple as that. If you like the Bynes, you'll love this movie. It is harmless fun and very funny in parts. We are funny Sebastian accent and ways are completely unrealistic, but have made me laugh so hard that I almost choked on my popcorn. <br /> <br /> Anything teenagers get, read Shakespeare (maybe) is a good thing for me. <br /> <br /> On a plain note, Tatum Channing is quite * ahem * freaking hot. He also does a good job with some of the movie's stricter scenes. <br /> <br /> Some of the later characters are VERY wide, but they are broad in "Twelfth Night", so it's cool.
