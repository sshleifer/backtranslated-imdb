We stumbled across this show on a Sunday morning at 6:30 am while browsing through all the cable channels and this was the best show! It is absolutely beautiful. We need such programs for kids (and adults, because I'm definitely over my childhood.) As one of the other commentaries pointed out, this presentation benefited from the simplicity of the characters and story lines. The dolls are amazingly cute, the backgrounds are colorful and although they are made from cardboard, foam, paint and pure imagination, they remind us of our own childhood when we could spend the day at our own grandmother's home. world around us. For those who have never been lucky enough to have a grandmother like Nana, this show is for you, you will make time for lost! This show is a true inspiration and filled with ingenuity and humor and just fun, for kids and adults. In other words, don't overlook this view just because you're older than three! Spend half an hour with Mona, Nana, Mr. Wooka and Russell, they'll be friends you see looking out!
