The Italian Job is a real blast to watch. It's a really entertaining movie, something you just look for its sheer enjoyment. It is not heavy with drama or emotional handcuff, it has no cosmic statements about life, and it is not violent or unholy. It's just a fun movie. Between watching the little Mini Coopers flying around the busy streets of LA and the big bits by stereotypical computer geek-twist (played by Seth Greene), I had lots of fun watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Special kudos to the background music. They really set a masterful tone for such a movie, so subtly keep you on the edge when needed. Apparently, many artists have contributed to the music, I found it to be the classic part of the movie. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. Not awesome, but a great movie at the end of a Lousy day at the office. <br /> <br /> Barky
