I was really and wonderfully surprised at "Oh, brother, where are you?" The video store was out of all the movies I was planning to rent, so I got it about this. I came home and when I looked, I got past and I laughed aloud. The Coen's made another wonderful movie. But I think the first time you watch this movie, you learn the characters. The second time, now that you know them, you laugh so hard that it can hurt you. I would highly recommend someone, because if you are not, you really lack a movie for the ages. 10/10
