For the first time in the film, I think they did an excellent job !! We need to support the emerging industry, especially from the north. It was very popular when I was in the theater, a good home and very good reactions and lots of laughs. It's a good movie and that's how I felt when I got out of the theater! It has northern humor and positive about the community it represents. The film has just been opened, I hope it is going well - people need to support this little film. I think this "quick ..." person is very bitter, about something! And get too personal ??? shame !! I say well done to everyone involved, drink a drink on me !! I'm looking forward to your next venture.
