What an excellent movie has done even more since my wife and I stumbled on it serendipitously, navigating on a nice frozen day in North Texas. Kathy Bates is usually the best of her who leads a movie of very normal and human costume through one of the most wonderful movies we've ever seen. Why this movie didn't pay attention to what it earned was difficult to understand in 2002. Why it was head and shoulders above so many of the boring pieces of garbage that were issued with greater fanfare and attention is evident in the viewing. Obviously, as a general public, we are being fed immediately, which is regarded by the powerful and influential as true precious stones such as "Unconditional Love" by playing all the spectators. Rent or buy this movie ..... you won't regret it!
