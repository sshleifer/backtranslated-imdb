Well, it was in black and white and probably on 2 "tape - which means the BBC has gone through it, right? But it has remained in my mind (1960?) For years as a perfect piece of history by the most innovative editing and great actors full of youth and bravado. <br /> <br /> I want to see it again! Read this, BBC? Find your original 2 "tapes or the 35mm movie, deal with the actors and directors for the rights, and reissue! I know some of them are dead, some of them are missing in action. <br /> <br /> Where else can I see Mary Morris as the 'snake's heart wrapped in a tiger's pit?' Where else can I see that Paul Daneman "Now is the winter of dissatisfaction ..."? Or does Robert Hardy deliver his speech on 'that idol ceremony'?
