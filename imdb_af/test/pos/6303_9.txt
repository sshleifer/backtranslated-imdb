Le conseguenze dell'amore (2004) is a beautifully crafted film that takes small, carefully positioned steps towards its end, to be used for enjoyment. From the contrasting provinces to the dense fenced world occupied by the hero, we are taken by the director and controlled from the moment we enter the hotel. We, like the hero, will never escape the suffocating intensity and paradoxical monotony of his criminal-driven Mafia world. The fact that the film is resistant to Mafia stereotypes while it is generating them makes it increasingly successful. The concrete grave, the inevitable brutal dismissals and overwhelming madness are exposed and exposed to what they are. Only brutality and business, and no more. Life is about part of the corporate machine that is organized crime and not about love or life for self, family or others. Our hero is indeed a hero by giving his life to the touch of the beautiful barman, the decision of the misery that his only neighbors in the hotel suffered and to escape his decorative prison. The effects of love are beautiful and brutal at the same time. See it !!
