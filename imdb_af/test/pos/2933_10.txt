This is the best show ever, no matter what you say! I've watched this show since Cycle 1. This show is never boring, it is wonderful how you see people's dream come true that they are a model. Tyra tries her best to help young women. don't be ashamed of their bodies and let them believe they are beautiful in their own way and that you should not feel beautiful by being anorexic. And like Tyra says on the Tyra show, what if you're crooked so, if you have a big round booty so, if you have a big nose, so what if you're not as beautiful as the people in magazines you beautiful.
