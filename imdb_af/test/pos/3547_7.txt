Robert Altman, Nicolas Roeg, John-Luc Goddard - Did you expect a fun movie that the whole family could enjoy? Of course, these and other directors were chosen because they did not follow the mainstream, but created it. For those who complain that they did not meet the original story of the opera. How often does music in a movie relate directly to what is happening in the film? This is the mood that counts. This is what I believe the directors of these movies are: creating a contemporary mood for old operas. For the most part, they succeed wonderfully. With all these operas, who will love them all. We could use more Beverly Sills. <br /> <br /> Finally, what is art (even opera) without a few naked women?
