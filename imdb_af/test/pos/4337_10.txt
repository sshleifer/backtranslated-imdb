Death Wish 3 is exactly what a bad movie should be. Terrible acting! Incredible scenerios! Ridiculous deaths! Creepy, evil-for-no reason villains! The last 30 minutes of this movie may be the best 30 minutes ever to be placed on movies, especially in the scene where the decent, hard-working citizen slips are cut across the street, breaking down the evil bikers and then shooting, just to get into the environment (!!!) in celebration. And how can I forget the elderly woman with the broom? She wiped out the scum! And if that's not enough, let's not forget how fast the punks give up after Fraker dies. I just laugh at thinking. <br /> <br /> I also love the killing of Kersey's girlfriend. He just walked away * after she saw, she was blown up. These are little things like Death Wish 3 makes such a bad movie. And I don't even mention the bizarre soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie because of Martin Balsam, who I think seriously, is one of the best character actors ever (and whose own "is hit by the scum" scene is hilarious) and I walked away with a new favorite movie. Thank you, Death Wish 3 so I laugh so hard. <br /> <br /> Some other things I've forgotten to mention: 1. The strange sound effect to Kersey says "Cash!" when he buys his used car. Ha! It sounds so angry. 2. MANDY Fraker. Mandy! Did the writers walk out of difficult old names? 3. The fact that gangs believe a loan program for a loan and lease has: "I still need guys." And it Mandy has a working telephone line in a deserted building. 4. At the end of the movie, after Kersey France surfaced, is it just me, or does the street gang seem to be about to break into choreography as they give up? Just watch it in sync after the female punk gives the "stop" signal. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. Nothing smells like Death Wish 3!
