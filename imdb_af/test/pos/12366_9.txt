Not only known as the English, American, German and French theaters, although films from the 20s were also very good, interesting and revolutionary. <br /> <br /> This is a movie by his story. The story is told in a Carol Carol kind of way in which death itself confronts the deceased with his past, present and what could have been. This is, of course, a story that focuses on morality and it does very well. The message comes across as very powerful and effective. Of course, this is certainly due to the effective directing of the father of the Swedish cinema; Victor Sjöström. <br /> <br /> The story is based on the novel by other Swedish writer Selma Lagerlöf. The story was adapted by Victor Sjöström himself, who might have taken some elements to make the story and film flow better. It may take a little too long before the movie starts to form and the story becomes clear, but when the film takes shape and fits, it becomes a wonderful one. <br /> <br /> The movie doesn't just have a great story, it's also a good one. The film uses some early and effective effects and uses a few different color filters to create the right mood and to indicate what it is, present and future. <br /> <br /> Sjöström not only wrote and directed this movie, he also plays the main character. Of course, the play in the movie is sometimes at stake, according to current standards, but not as bad as, for example, in early German movies. And after all, this movie is more about his story and morale than it is about the acting, so it doesn't matter or lead. <br /> <br /> A very large and effective underwritten silver film classic from Sweden. <br /> <br /> 9/10
