George Scott has been performing a lifetime in Paddy Chayefsky's THE HOSPITAL, a very dark drama about an aging metropolitan hospital and a middle-aged doctor on the verge of suicide. Together, Diana Rigg is determined as a free spirit to save him from himself. Their dialogue cracks, and it is clear that they are being made for each other from the beginning. But will she save him? Their one sex scene is graphic and memorable for his passion and anger. Meanwhile, the hospital is under siege by a group of agitators who do not want it to change a convicted building to a cancer center. And a serial killer is out of hospital, specializing in doctors and nurses. However, a good part of the movie is focused on Scott. As it should be. What a difference a few years ago got back when this movie was made. In 1962 we gave us the INTERNS, a hokey, old-fashioned rework from DR. KILDAR with horrible acting and a cardboard. Along came 1971 and the hospital. Less than 10 years later. Hollywood made something for a change. Look at the hospital today is a reminder of how many medical shows such as ST. OTHER AND SCRUBS owed to this enduring classic. And if the hospital reminds you of NETWORK, it should. The same font.
