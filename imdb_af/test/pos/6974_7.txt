Francis Ford Coppola wrote and directed this amazing personal story of a married woman's flight from her husband - and the reality that the young and cheerful years of her younger years are young and cheerful years behind her. We learn little about this woman's marriage, except that she made her feel independence; She also recently learned that she is pregnant, which has complicated her heart (she does not want to be a confident woman, despite the mother's way of talking to her with her husband). She meets two men on her journey: a former college soccer hero left after an accident during a permanent brain injury match, and a sexy, sturdy motorcycle man who has many problems in his own life. . The clear, clean landscapes (as photographed by the talented Wilmer Butler) are wonderfully realized, just like the characters. Shirley Knight, James Caan, and Robert Duvall each deliver strong, gripping performances, especially as they are not very pleasant people in conventional terms. Some scenes (like Knight's first call at a payphone, or her first night alone with Caan where they play 'Simon Says') are almost too intimate to watch. Coppola toys with reality, turn the winding memories of his characters into scrapbooks that we participated in. He allows plays to play out, but the editing is pretty fine and the film is never allowed to get too heavy (there are at least two or three very good moments). This is a fierce effort - so much so that the picture is still displayed at festivals almost five years later. Some may avoid Coppola's unapologetic distortion of events to underline the final with bitter irony, but the power and drive behind the picture almost destroys its shortcomings. *** of ****
