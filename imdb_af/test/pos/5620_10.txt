The story itself is routine: A boy jumps away from home and ends in a struggling children's music school. He convinced a famous violinist to sponsor the school. The film is a fragmentation of shooting in 11 weeks, leaving many amusing holes the acting viewer can find for himself / herself. <br /> <br /> But for a long time the flashes of the plot would have been, the movie was justified by its music and acting. There is a lot of music, with classical works played by Heifetz and by The Meremblum Orchestra, one of the leading youth symphonies of that day, saying music is excellent. In itself, it would make the picture worth seeing. The orders and duties were best placed: that of Alfred Neumann. <br /> <br /> The acting is a study in contrasts. The children in the orchestra, most of whom had little or no acting experience, had to get the director Archie Mayo, watched the camera, persuade the parts they had and gave the instructions too much. But the spontaneity that arises from their lack of training adds an interesting charm to the picture. The veteran actors were wonderful with the material they had to work with. Walter Brennan was perfectly cast in his role, one that he emulated in real life. Joel McCrea and Andrea Leeds were ideal for their parts. And the supporting play was real. Who is who of character actors: Marjorie Main, Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey, Charles Coleman, Perry Ivins and Porter Hall in his typical role of the heavy --- all ideally thrown. And the little players: Jessie Arnold, John Hamilton, Marjorie Wood, Jimmy Flavin, Dulcie Day, voiced the Phillips in its regular role as a policeman and much more. If you're a fan of character characters, this movie will bring back many memories. <br /> <br /> Overall, the picture is very enjoyable and recommended, even if you are not a fan of classical music. . <br /> <br /> tvcat
