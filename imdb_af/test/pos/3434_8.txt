Skenbart took place in the 1940s, just after the Second World War. Main character Gunnar (Gustav Hammarsten) finishes his work to make a difference in the bombed post-war Europe. He packs a book through his favorite philosopher, Ludwig Witgenstein, and begins a journey that will ultimately prove Witgenstein's well-known statement. Nothing is what it looks like. <br /> <br /> There are two main sections and several subplots, following this movie, which takes place on a Berlin-bound train. Author / Director Peter Dalle (who also plays the role of the conductor of the train) played an impressive role, including Swedish legends Lena Nyman, Gösta Ekman and Robert Gustafsson. Overall, the play is excellent. Skenbart offers a few, rather twisted slapstick comedy combined with more subtle black humor (like the nun that loses her faith and begins with violence). It's like Killinggänget meets Peter Jackson (Braindead, Bad Taste) in Schindler's List. I laughed at most of the movie, and when I woke up the next morning, I laughed even more. An intelligent movie for fans of Swedish comedy.
