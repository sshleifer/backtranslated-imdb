Peter O'Toole is a surprise to see in roles where the lines he speaks are good and gives him a chance to swing in a drunk stump. The stunning Susannah York offers a great movie for O'Toole's dramatic presence. <br /> <br /> The film claims it is without a single explicit scene, but it can entertain the viewer in his solid social commentary. Although not an important movie, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances. <br /> <br /> Even York, who signs the papers at the end, is a surprise to see how the tragedy radiates quietly. The possible weakness here is Thompson's laid-back direction. But the film drives because of the actors and the script. <br /> <br /> I watched the movie twice over a 20-year period - at both events called "Brotherly Love". "Country dance" is a rather boring and inappropriate title for this movie, wherever it was released.
