I saw three of the Animatrix episodes, and that's my favorite of all. The Second Renaissance gave a thin story to the already thin universe. Program was a stylistically impressive number, it just got stupid. I think giving this one the special touch is the direction of Shinichiro Watanabe, director of the incredibly popular (and good reason) series Cowboy Bebop. It has some of the best elements of Bebop: slack, sci-fi adventure, a no-nonsense, slightly apathetic hero for rent, a bounty-head (more or less) and a chase scene, all in excellent film-noir packaging. Watanabe's Tarantino-style smoothness comes through the full throttle.
