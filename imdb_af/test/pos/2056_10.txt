I supposedly saw this movie a dozen times, as it was originally theatrically released. Anyone who calls this movie dirty or horrible does not understand action movies or acknowledge a good one. Perhaps it is possible for some of the incidents and outcomes to be over, but in my opinion, writer writer Shane Black (Lethal Weapon / Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) has made one of the most thoughtful action adventures you'll ever overcome. Over the top or not, this movie flows like clockwork and the action just keeps going. The final performance is one of the best I've ever seen in any movie. The movie in this movie is cracking. Genna Davis did a tremendous performance and it is a terrible shame that there was never a "LKG" prosecution. Samuel L. Jackson is hilarious like her sidekick Mitch, a downfall on his luck, private eye to help her discover her lost past and make a few bucks. If Baffles tells me how someone can't keep this movie. It takes so much excitement and it's so funny. The erasure cracks in this film left me just as hard as ten years later. In my mind, the first Matrix movie and the Long Kiss Goodnight were easily 2 of the 90's best and most original action flashes. By the way, Shane Black made a fortune when he sold this script. At that time it was the highest selling game and it was worth every penny. It's so sad that audiences never gave this movie a chance, as they would have seen Renny Harlins' best movie and Genna Davis like you've never seen her. Long live "The Long Kiss Goodnight" !!
