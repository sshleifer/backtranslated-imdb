Definitely not just for urban legend aficionados, Campfire Tales is a often scary and always fun ride through various popular stories. It's also a movie that exceeded the (low) expectations I had. A horror movie I've never heard or read, a live-to-video release (grant, the latter often gives us a pleasant surprise, but with horror movies these days it can be all or nothing), a cast of mostly unknowns. Well, I'll leave the math for you. <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be an entertaining, exciting and overall, enjoyable experience. The four stories are good and satisfying. The only one I feel was a bit weaker was "The Locket", for the simple reason that it offers virtually no explanation for its plot or characters' actions; However, I still loved the story, the atmosphere and the end of it. My favorite was the third story, "People Can Lick Too" - the tension in it is not only tangible but educational. <br /> <br /> I found Campfire Tales as one of those horror gems that one discovers, and then recommend it to everyone. <br /> <br /> 7/10
