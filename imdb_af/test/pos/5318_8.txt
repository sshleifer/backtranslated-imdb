It should be one of the most powerful message-sending movies I've seen lately, it was absolutely flawless all the way, incredibly original and challenging. Story is unusual and original, and the characters make this story very powerful. It's about a man who kills his ex-girlfriend's delayed child and as he is sent to the youth prison, through lots of memory flashbacks, you get a grip on a story and you don't let it to the end. Murder he commits changes the life cycle of every family member and family of the deceased. And if you look and realize that everyone has their own story and own dark side, you appreciate this movie even more, it's a total tour power, because those actions can't be described by simple words. His motive for committing murder is incompletely explained, and it makes viewers feel. Acting was almost flawless, and the throw was very good, it contained many familiar faces. If you like the movies that are thought out and just make you think (like 'Donnie Darko', 'Mulholland Dr.'), then the United States of Leland is a great movie choice for you, otherwise you should succeed this movie and watch it when you're in the mood for a serious thought-provoking movie. <br /> <br /> 10/10
