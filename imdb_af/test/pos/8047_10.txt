Some of the judges here foolishly judged this silent film according to today's political correctness standards. <br /> <br /> "Battle" was an excellent movie for several reasons, correctly noted by more rational reviewers: Superb cast, lots of action, innovative editing and photography. <br /> <br /> His stars were in effect the D.W. Griffith stock company and this quiet movie lover, it is enough to watch it and enjoy it. <br /> <br /> I saw it many years ago and just watched it on YouTube; It was a very poor quality print, but along with my reminder of a good print in a real theater, I can recommend it fairly to reasonable people and film historians.
