Just read why this show was canceled, making me rather steamy. It was a favorite of mine as a child and I always looked at it when it happened, no matter how many times I saw the episode. Certainly the effects were not good, but they were not terrible either. They did a pretty good job with the costume and it donated the nice 70's. It's always nice to see and hear, as the music was also 70's. It didn't really have bad guys from the comics, but then most comic book show adaptations had no one to get very few real super villains from the comics. Spidey's powers were also a bit different here, he had his Spidey sentence and he could climb walls, but he wasn't as strong as the Spider-man of the comics. He was super strong, but if I remember an episode where he broke into a room by breaking down the door knob, he was just not the car hurler that one could be from the comic book. The show was in Los Angelos, so there wasn't like human buildings had to swing, but they did well with the web. It's nice that this show actually has the web shooters and not the organic shooters of the movie. I love the movies, but part of me wants them to start again and do the more clever Spidey pants that have the mechanical webships. This show had a good star as Peter Parker and he was okay as Spider-man. It is nice to see a Spidey who does not basically live in the slums as he does in the movies. Neither this show nor the movie has a Spider-man who is quickly offended by the one in the cartoon. Yet this show was fun without being as naked as the Batman show.
