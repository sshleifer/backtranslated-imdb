From the opening sequence, filled with black and white shots thinking on Gordan Parks' photos, this movie draws the viewer into a sense of artistic renaissance. The background of a poetry cafe called "The Sanctuary" just offers it. The jazz that penetrates the movie and cinematography will seduce you. <br /> <br /> This story of love actually allows love to grow, develop, and eventually mature, a rarity in Hollywood. Everyone can identify with each other at a stage of their journey. This story of two artists who just failed to do so resulted in a debate among his viewers. Would she have walked away? Would he have stopped her? Who knows ...? <br /> <br /> With Larenz Tate (Darius Lovehall) and Nia Long (Nina Moseley) with a theater performance by Isiah Washington (Savon) and Lisa Nicole Carson (Josie Nichols) as the Ultimate Best Friend, this movie is a romantic gem. <br /> <br /> See this one with someone you love (wink).
