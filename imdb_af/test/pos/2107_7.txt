Alexander Lou, the star of classic like the Super Ninja and Mafia vs Ninja, is sitting here in this entertaining martial arts festival. <br /> <br /> The plot involves the evil Abbott White (which boasts a little humongous and frankly a little scary white eyebrows) who use the help of a ninja clan to overthrow the Shaolin temple . <br /> <br /> This goal he reaches and wipes out most of his members, though it is necessarily one or two to survive and rather predictably kill Abbott's deadly revenge. <br /> <br /> .... Ok, the plot does not push the envelope exactly in terms of creativity, but look someone to a movie titled "Wu Tang vs Ninja" aka "The Ninja Hunter 'Does it care for such an insignificant factor as a plot? Of course not! - These are the battles in this movie and gum case - you earn your money here! There is a wonderful choreographed martial art that is displayed by everyone involved. Without a minute it seems to go without a fight that somehow breaks out. <br /> <br /> If you're not into martial arts movies at all, it's a must see!
