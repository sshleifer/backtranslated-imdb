It certainly wouldn't have been my kind of movie, but my husband saw it on TV and said it was really good. So, on his recommendation, I bought a copy because I didn't know if it would ever be on TV again. I've never heard of anyone except Armand Assante. Initially, I had a difficult time getting into the story because the first part of the movie is a jumble of images - and it doesn't make much sense. It is only later in the movie that it all comes together. The scene cut - if that is what it is called is a bit of a scratch - it looks as if some frames have been cut out of each scene, and the screens are jerky - but I think it's done to add to the unusual (if it's a word). The story is here and there, and just about the time you found everything, everything gets upside down and you have to think about who the bad guy is and who isn't. Or bad woman. The acting is very good. I thought how much Norman Reedus looks like Leo Decaprio. The end was a real twist, totally unexpected, which I liked. A good show.
