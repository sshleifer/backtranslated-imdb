Done on a savings change budget of twenty dollar tops, this inexpensive thirteen minute short merry parody George Lucas' legendary '77 sci-fi blockbuster 'Star Wars' most conceivably stupid way imaginable. Author / Director Ernie Fosselius delivers a winning and regular mix of ridiculous sound effects, unpaid action scenes, cruddy (far from) special effects (you just love the cheese-scratch-on-lasers, tinfoil asteroids and household appliances ... honor, I mean spaceships being swung on obvious wires), poorly baptized in dialogue, shameless hammy acting, and Richard Wagner's exciting piece of classical music "Ride of the Valkyries." The characters are presented in appropriate broad regions; My favorites are whiny Fluffy Starbucker, venerable Jedi knight Auggie "Ben" Doggie, and the hateful thug Darph Nader (who speaks nothing but incomprehensible gibberish). In addition, 4-Q-3 is clearly based on the Tin Man of "The Wizard of Oz", while Artie Deco is definitely a cheaper vacuum cleaner. This film's true masterpiece is the legendary voice-actor Paul Frees as the narrator; Free, deliciously rich and plump histrionic tints unmistakably add to the substantial stupid, but on the side of the female you can cut (choice lines: "You will laugh! You will cry! You will kiss three dollars!"). A total.
