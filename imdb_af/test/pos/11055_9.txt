I would say this movie is disturbing. The brutality is portrayed in a very sick way, like a psychosis in 40 minutes. At the same time, it is a cruel introspection in human behavior. The scenes are furious, starting with the butchery of the horse and ending with the brutal sex scene in the kitchen. Every emotion is exploited to the utmost, the frustration of the butcher, the love of his daughter almost offensive, the anger when he finds out she is abused, every feeling is so natural and so wrong. This film delivers the truth about human nature in a very honest and brutal way. The message of the film is that man's life can change in a second because of his behavior and that the most primitive emotions are the strongest and can determine man's acting. I loved the unique way of filming, the simplicity and the brutality associated with the silence in which only inner thoughts pierce.
