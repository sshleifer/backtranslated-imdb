There are a couple of cartoon films where animals or something that is not human depict people and I think this movie is one of them. Apart from a few points of the plot and the characters - this movie can be changed with all people rather than mainly animals. Although - it's good someone has - I feel the cats are great in this movie that depicts people! :-) <br /> <br /> This movie also focuses on a lot of adult issues - which is quite strange for a Disney movie. It calls alcohol *, shows a dog that teaches another dog how to attack people with a twitch fit. It shows a male cat named Abraham Delacy Gypsy Casi Thomas O 'Malley, depicting a female cat in a surprisingly human and mature way. br /> <br /> As a cartoon movie - or just a movie in general, I feel it's pretty good quality - the storyline and characters are especially good. The film (in general) is in France and you meet a family of cats - the mother Duchess and her kittens Marie, Toulouse and Berlioz. You also meet the kind (rich) old woman who worships the cats, butler Edgar and an old man (who clearly lost his marbles) called George. The old old woman discusses her will with George and Edgar hear that what he receives from the will he will have after the cats have it. He's innocent with it - and has an evil scheme in mind ... <br /> <br /> A very cute movie for every age - enjoy "Aristocats"! <br /> <br /> * Not included "Basil the Great Mouse Detective" and some others I can't imagine right now.
