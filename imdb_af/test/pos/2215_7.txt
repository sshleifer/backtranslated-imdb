"Admissions" is a fine drama, even if it is a few issues with the end. Lauren Ambrose plays Evie who tries to avoid college. Not to show her overworked mother, his poems coincide that everyone thinks her mentally challenged sister wrote. All the plays are the best, especially Lauren Ambrose and Amy Madigan. They both performed well. The climax is also very powerful. There are only two bad parts. First, the character of Stewart Worthy was played by Christopher Lloyd. His part is underdeveloped. The other weakness is the end. It's going around in circles, which I didn't expect with the 84 min run time. In addition, the movie is definitely worth watching.
