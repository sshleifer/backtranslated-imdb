I'm a big fan of this movie and got the TV mini series "Children of The Dust". The version fans should search. At least 20 minutes or more is cut on the DVD version of this movie. <br /> <br /> I would also recommend suggestions that this movie enjoyed watching the book. There is a more rounded story with Corby / Whitewolf and Rachel. , more about black history and buffalo soldiers. There were two many story lines for the series or this movie. <br /> <br /> Sidney Poitier just shows that he is getting better with age. The talent just keeps growing the chemistry between his character of Gypsy Smith and Regina Taylor. I also enjoyed the Billy Wirth / Joanna Going storyline, and they seem to be playing well. <br /> <br /> Of course, Billy Wirth is the "Model of Indian Vision". The look, the attitude, the dream of every woman who wanted to be in an indigenous hero in one of those romance novels. Also worked for me. <br /> <br /> Much more could be done with this storyline, but it gave the viewer a brief look at racial problems in the 1880s, taken over from indigenous schooling, lack of black pioneers to turn up villages in the west. dir. Michael Moriarty (Maxwell), as always, is a good actor as a very careful and confused teacher, not sure if the "whites" interfere with indigenous culture. <br /> <br /> For everyone who enjoys characters and watches change this movie is for you. I thought the chemistry between Poitier's character and that of the orphaned white wolf had moved a lot and thought Wirth and Poitier worked very well together. Billy Wirth worked on his best scenes when working with Poitier. <br /> <br /> I sometimes get on my nerves when you just want to stop and shake or give her a "wake up and mature" call. . But overall it was a wonderful evening of entertainment. <br /> <br /> Watching the two tire versions of this mini-series if you're a fan, you see the difference really.
