The inspiration for this film was the fact that American gangsters are well dressed, but the Aussies. Well, if you can kill a man as soon as possible, then you can be as bad as you like, and people won't criticize you. . <br /> <br /> Jimmy is a fighter, an illegal boxer, sometimes bouncer and is hosted by Pando, the local gangster boss in the cross (This is Australia's infamous Kings Cross District, not known as London's Cross if much of a British rugby player finds the difficult path.) <br /> <br /> Because of love of love he makes a little work, he loses a lot of money and must get it to Pando before Pando and his sword can kill him. . <br /> <br /> Very dark humor, interesting action, revelations about Australia's bottom and human nature. It is very centered in Australian nature and explores the nature of Australian criminals (against the American and British). One problem is that each of the elements of the story does not have enough dust and depth, but it is a painting with broad strokes that cover many areas not previously covered, so as an overall package, it is worth it was. <br /> <br /> Spend it with "Chopper" and "Dirty Deeds" for your Aussie Crime Party or Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Miller's Crossing for an International short of criminal gang. <br /> <br /> By the way, Bryan Brown is a good actor who has just done a lot of really bad movies. Here's one of his big movies.
