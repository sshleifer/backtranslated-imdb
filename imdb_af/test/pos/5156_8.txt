You can't call Roy Andersson productive, (6 films in 37 years). Also, you can't accuse him of conventional; he does not go straight ahead, at least when it comes to narration. "You, the Living", his first seven-year film, is nothing like a surrealistic documentary in which a large number of characters are observed, and if it sounds, I can assure you that it is not. This is a funny, accessible and surprisingly hot sad film, a piece of life far removed from what we normally see on the screen. <br /> <br /> Of course, cutting-of-life is hardly the right moniker to apply for this movie since most people's lives are probably not like that. The incidents on the screen run the spectrum from the almost frightening to the straight scary and while characters can flash, sometimes never be seen again, others appear as if they are anxious for approval, Andersson gives them all some kind of kind love. This, and a bit of roll music, ensures that the time we spend with them spends time.
