It may be the most stress-filled movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> In fact, it's so nervous, I couldn't see it again after watching it two years ago, but I'll have since the DVD. There were a few scenes in it, which are almost too much to watch .... so if you have trouble and have to escape for an hour and a half, this movie will come out of you. <br /> <br /> Russian actress Marina Zudina did a super job in facial expressions alone, which she had to do since her character was a dumb. She plays a cute and healthy makeup artist for a messy movie maker. After the day's shooting was done and "Billie" was leaving, she heard something. She looks at the room where they are filmed and discovers that they are shooting a "snapshot" and actually killing someone. Billie's eavesdropping was discovered and she was running for her life because the killers were looking for her in this huge warehouse-type building. <br /> <br /> There are two extended scenes in which our heroine runs for her life and both of them will carry you out. The first thing I described above. The second scene, the climax, goes on for too long and is not as good as the first. In fact, the film had to be a little cut, but generally, as it is so good to pay attention to, it served its purpose as entertainment.
