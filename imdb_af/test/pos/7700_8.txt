This story takes place in Wisconsin. I watched my band halfway when I heard the name Appleton. I wasn't sure where it happened until I heard they say Green Bay and then I thought it was Wisconsin. After I looked at it, I confirmed it. <br /> <br /> Anxiously awaiting the outcome, I really felt Corrine's frustration. I didn't know it was at the end of the fact. It kept me, but sad and wanted to know more.
