As if the reality courts such as 'American Idol' were not enough, in which judges such as Simon Cowell shoot razor-select times to try out performers of the music world, it is many times that even outstanding singers have reduced tears. after what is considered a bad performance, the "Boob tube" has been invaded over the past three years with its own version of "looking for the next big thing" in a business that observes superficiality, concepts of beauty, and body dysmorphism. <br /> <br /> A concept created by Tyra Banks, which is also a reviewer in the show, collects fifteen participants from all levels of life and puts them in countless "tasks" in theirs " talent "in front of the camera must prove and not only subject to the new-born Janice Dickinson (self-baptized" American's First Supermodel "), but equally catty Jay Manuel and Nore Marin who can focus on one girl who is not good at one point does not perform and flashes Smear her as it was bad morning coffee. As in many other reality-based shows, one contestant is voted every week and she needs to pack and leave her bags immediately (a reminder of Tyra's every time). Of course, there is the muscular tension between several of the more type A women, female bonding, tears, dramatic swings of music in key moments, and some truly stunning images that previously transform ordinary, pretty girls into unattainable goddesses. <Br /> <br /> I must admit, the performance is a guilty pleasure. Perhaps it's the state of mind that I enter, but I wondered how the vomitorium was in cases where the overall girls would have to move to make the cut and watch the judges and photographers and many fickle designers feel right for the moment. Yet, despite my previous paragraph, it made me possibly because I have always had an interest in the fashion world. I have always loved to see beautiful women being made even more world-wide with make-up and perfect lighting. But I wonder where are they going with these increasingly difficult photo shoots. It's as if they are competing with "Fear Factor". Shoots that resemble re-enactments of battle scenes in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, shoots where the models are underwater or in almost impossible situations. What's next: positioning while tied up to train songs as an oncoming Amtrak at 70 miles an hour? Or a shoot where they are chained underwater, trying to release themselves in record time while simultaneously hitting the chiffon, and never forget to smile their pearl white at that camera? How about a "Pit and the Pendulum" version of a photo shoot? <br /> <br /> In one thing, the show needs to get some kudos, and it's similar to "American Idol". With this, I am probably going to justify the hardness of both shows, and its abrasives - and basically it goes against my initial paragraph. "America's Next Top Model" is a show that is an extensive audition, such as "American Idol," and the girls will get the kind of test treatment they will receive in the real world, where prospective designers and photographers as monks like them. It may be, they will crush the drop of a hat, if they can't sell themselves as they are expected, and where one is asked to leave, another will replace her with the necessary requirements. What makes it a wonder that any girl wants to get into such a difficult media, but that's where dreams are made. <br /> <br /> In the fifth season, it is a huge disappointment with Janice Dickinson's departure; In her walk she was a tough barometer on how the girls should walk, talk, emote, express themselves, and eventually sell themselves as a living, living product. With the cold addition of Twiggy, I wonder where it will go from here - Twiggy just can't replace the Dickinson top temperament. So with Janice's absence, the performance of his rand has lost and can even make his slow down, but in the meantime it is still a catchy pleasure to watch, despicable entertainment on weekdays, if at all for the beautiful footage. If at all, it's the show that Adrienne Curry launched in the spotlight. Curry has made a name for herself because of facts that have less to do with modeling her theater love affair with once child actor Christopher Knight in their own reality soap opera.
