This existential thriller, in Portuguese with English subtitles, is a modern version of the American movie masters of the 40's, with a surprise twist to the end. It sounds from start to finish. My only criticism is its poor production values. The movie looks cheap, and it was probably so, so black and white filmmaking is much inferior to that of Godard in Vivre Sa Vie, to call another film no more than 30 years earlier. Most crazy about everyone, the subtitles are often difficult to read. When will filmmakers learn and give yellow subtitles so they can be read against a white background. I would give it a total of 8, although it could be higher with better production values.
