This DVD usually sells for about $ 20. I won't pay as much for the DVD if I knew what I got, but it is a pretty good disc. It shows the Knoop in all their glory, with footage of their concerts ... Surfacing, Wait and Bleed and Scissors among other songs, including the "Spit it Out" music video, apparently banned from MTV. <br /> <br /> Slipknot, for those who do not know, is essentially a symphony of the condemned: nine masked men showing total chaos on stage, with machine gun drums, squeaky guitar and chorus your face tear off and leave you wanting more. For those who have never seen Slipknot, I can't recommend enough to get this DVD ... probably from eBay or Amazon, so you can get a better deal. <br /> <br /> A short but well-made display of the Knoop. <br /> <br /> Seven out of ten.
