I went to see these thoughts. It would be a great comedy and a return for Robin Williams. But when I saw it, I realized I lied to advertisers because it was more drama than comedy, although it was some very good laugh in It. It feels like I've watched two movies. One was a funny skirt with Robin Williams who had to be the entire pelvis for the movie, but you also get a techno-thriller movie with political anxiety in the middle. I really don't know how to classify this movie. But I can tell you it was good and I laughed, not as much as I had hoped, but at least Williams was back in the right direction. See it before knowing it, it's not all comedy and is a bit intense.
