In the beginning, with the cautious, remote spot and wheezing metal sound, I thought of the opening scene in "Once upon a Time in the West". When it comes to the city, it begins like 'Kitchen Stories' or 'Drifting Clouds', even possibly 'Grimm'. <br /> <br /> Then it seems that it is more similar to Joe Versus the Volcano "in theme (not style). And the movie is run from start to finish the same, understated style. , blue-gray shows of the suites, dresses, wall color, furniture, bed sheets, mirrors, cars, music, background sounds and even people's expressions, then near the end there is one shot of a completely different tone - warm orange yellow with soft music and ocean splashes, kids and laughs. <br /> <br /> But maybe the observation is too long for me, I'd rather see the alternate side or what happens to the character to the final shot.
