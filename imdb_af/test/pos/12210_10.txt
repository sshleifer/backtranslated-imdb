I'm new to this, so please carry me. I'm a big fan of Surface. I thought the writing and computer graphics were exceptional, as good as any Sci Fi movie I saw at the theater. In February, the TV guide said Season Finale, the show announcer said something with the result that, "... and now for the season's final of Surface." Season Final, not a series of finals! I couldn't wait for the fall to come here, to see, will happen next. So fall here and it is nowhere to be found! If NBC doesn't pick it up, how about Sci Fi or the US? It seems to me that Bay Watch was not on ABC for a long time and then the US picked it up and it went crazy! (I bet ABC was chocking) Ha! Not a series, then at least a mini-series, to give all our loyal fans a close. What happened to our man trapped in the church tower? Was the creature in the chapel Nim? Did he have a big corner? Does the cloned man come to our side? There are so many unanswered questions. Thank you for listening to me!
