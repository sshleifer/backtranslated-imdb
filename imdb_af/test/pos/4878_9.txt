There I was on vacation when my host suggested taking this B-movie festival in Breda. I was resilient because I was not traveling to sit in a theater, but I have to admit I am not a second of this one (especially with Stephen Malkmus's contribution). It probably helped me not to have an idea of ​​what to expect. <br /> <br /> SEA OF DUST begins like a typical costume drama. We have helped a young medical student with a doctor whose town is destroyed by a mad plague (which somehow involves explosive heads). On the way, he stops to visit his fiance and the property is thrown by her father. On the way, he finds a girl lying on the road, another victim, and takes her to the doctor. Made, I thought. It was all predictable. <br /> <br /> Then everything went crazy and suddenly turned into a completely different movie. Tom Savini looks like Dracula, characters start on the "other side" of reality, and the dialogue is becoming increasingly humorous. <br /> <br /> And just when I thought it was in a groove, the picture changed, getting really dark and bizarre. I won't be visiting for the first time, but there is an incredible sequence of hollow people, many talking about the abuse of religion by society, and some over-the-top effects. And did I call Stephen Malkmus? It's not a perfect movie (if you haven't figured it out at a B-Movie festival), but it's worthwhile to make the time for adventurous viewers worthwhile. Great footage, cool soundtrack, lots of interesting ideas. The play is sometimes a bit, but I think that's the point. Funny I had to go to Breda to see an American picture that looks like a British horror movie. You figure that one out ...
