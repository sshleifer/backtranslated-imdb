There is a need for this kind of entertainment in our modern world. You can watch "Mom and Dad" with adults, with your family (kids, any age or just by yourself like me. They are gentle, but gentle is so refreshing in a society of children killing children, a terrible war, inappropriate prime television and poverty, we don't even get a hint of where all those kids come from! Give me modern plumbing and I'll be a kettle. Humor does not require offensive language. Other words are covered. Put your shoes off and climb into your couch with a nice old-fashioned glass of lemonade, don't just breathe to watch Mum eat the chicks at the table at noon!
