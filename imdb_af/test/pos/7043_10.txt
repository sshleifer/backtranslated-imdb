"Rattlesnake! Look out!" "Is this a bra you wear or do you expect a murder attempt?" "Spaz, what are you gay or what?" "You know, they are using the most sophisticated training methods of the Soviet Union, East and West Germany and the latest Olympic force, Trinidad and Tobago." "Oh, Spaz, you're an old master!" "What, no mustard?" "Oh my God, his nose is bleeding." "It's getting even bigger now." "Our political roundtable ... Henry Kissinger will appear. Yassir Arafat goes out, spends a weekend with the kids with them." <br /> <br /> These and many other good lines make Meatballs a hall-of-fame comedy. Only in Caddyshack is Bill Murray harder. He probably advertised half of the lines. The high school actors were in the same movie with him an explosion. <br /> <br /> Hilarious movie to watch any time of year, not just summer.
