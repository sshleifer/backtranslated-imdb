"Meatballs" is an ode to summer camp. Those of us who go to the camp will see many of the scenes as we remember or wish they could have been. <br /> <br /> Bill Murray plays senior boy counselor Tripper Harrison, who really manages the camp. He reminds us of the funny, cool staff member who loves everyone. Young campers are pushing for him and when he speaks to you, you feel like you are family. This is one of Murray's best roles. He drives the film with his one linen and ad-libs. <br /> <br /> Chris Makepeace plays Rudy, the lone camper that is taken under Tripper's wing and breaks out of his shell. <br /> <br /> The rest of the campers and staff in the film were also excellent. <br /> <br /> The overall theme of the movie is the stumbling blocks to finally winning. From Rudy to Spaz to the camp and even to Tripper himself, the underdogs of the movie are the stars. The movie has a heart. <br /> <br /> The movie is fun and funny without being cruel or exaggerated, as some teenage movies are today. The chosen look and act like real people. <br /> <br /> The comedy and heart draw you to the point that at the end you are just as at camp, sad to leave. <br /> <br /> In my summer camp experience that we had underwear, flag poles, mysterious meat jumped, tried to sneak a glimpse into the girls cabin, the lunatic-with-the-hook stories to drag the campfire and let people sleep from their huts. elsewhere. But we also had a dedicated camper that led us to be the best we could be. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is the CIT overnight as they sing over the lake over the lake. The one rule that cracks me every time is when Tripper announces the night before the Parent's Day and ends. "Tomorrow is parents day, and you have to look for Morty to be sent to the state official."
