I was very dismayed by the young life experiences of a man who rose so high in the academic world. A hard life surrounded by the love of a close family and an extended family of companion workers has created a person who can succeed in the world. For the most part, Spanish culture is shown, as I have always observed and admired - hardworking, optimistic and truly family oriented. The points of religious superstition were fairly authentic to the Catholic Church. Without a doubt, the actress who played the mother deserves an Oscar. Her prayers for her missing son brought me to tears. I would recommend this amazingly considerate movie to my friends and family.
