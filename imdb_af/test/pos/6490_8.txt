I'm a big fan of the $ 5.50 DVD bin at my local WalMart. Hopefully you have one at your local branch. You can find a lot of airplanes, a lot of garbage and some surprises. This movie is one of the surprises. My friend recently bought this one, and in the thought that it would be another cute kung-fu riot, I was really surprised at how good it was. I watch a lot of movies, and as a result I can almost always call a movie to come out; and if there is a plot, what it will be. Not this movie! The direction is brilliant, the plot is wonderful, and the battle is incredibly inventive. If you see this one sitting somewhere at a dirty cheap price, get it! If you see it at full price, I still recommend it.
