Being a big fan of Bergman, I literally had to look for years to find this movie (at a price less than $ 60 I mean) and eventually bought it a few weeks ago. The basic premise of Bergmans films is the relationships between the characters and how they deal with difficult situations. So this movie is the same, but it's different because the environment is very different from most Bergman movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> It is in wartime and the heroes are trapped in the middle. <br /> <br /> Again, from beginning to end, it proves once again that Liv Ullman is one of the best actresses of the 20th century. A must see.
