I didn't expect this movie to be just the basic characteristics of the characters from the comic book series: expose me to the characters and their inherent traits, suggest a plot and end with the destruction of the main opponent and perhaps Hint on the possibility of a successor. And that's exactly what this movie happens to deliver. <br /> <br /> But unlike most other cartoon films, I felt that this one did a bit of class. "Blade" offers a more limited audience with strong language and graphic fights. It offers a very modern, credible and gloomy world whose small nuances have effectively succeeded in raising a sense of fear - as little as it may have been - from a viewer who seldom ever engages in a story touch, unless it is an emotional aspect. <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie has countless plotholes contracting that no one else could use for a few thousand years. But if you have an enemy as cool as the one in this movie, and scenes are fighting with application and exciting camera cuts and special effects like this, what's even more important? It may take a little while, but for what it is, Blade is a sharp relief among most other movies in this genre.
