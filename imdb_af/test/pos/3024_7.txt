I remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it was first released and it looks pretty cool. I never had the chance to see it. When I went to Blockbuster to rent videos, I thought I should see it. After all, I loved "Silence of the Lambs" and "Se7en", and if you enjoyed those movies, you might get a kick from "The Cell". The whole story concept is very interesting. Physically in the minds of a murderer, I cannot imagine the world in which they live. Actually, the acting is pretty decent. Jennifer Lopez is the only one I have to say it wasn't so good, but she does a credible job. I would recommend for a scary thriller. <br /> <br /> 7/10
