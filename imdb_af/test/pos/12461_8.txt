Don't let the many varying reviews of the movie disregard you. You will like or hate it according to your own taste. However, if, for some other reason, you don't want to see 'Greystoke', you should experience the excitement of a good actor while breathing life into his role. Ralph Richardson was not a good actor for how perfect he could handle Shakespeare; He should rather be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed. He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor. His reading of the part of the sixth Lord of Greystoke, his last performance, is cherished by everyone who loves the theater.
