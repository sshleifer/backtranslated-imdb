Forget about Donnie Darko. I open it up because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I've read on The Box is the simple but poor argument that it doesn't hold a candle at Darko. It's not that I necessarily agree with each other. I just feel that this movie is another animal and deserves its own analysis. There are certainly points of comparison, but these are peripheral concerns if you think the key to the heart of every movie is different. In Darko the drive of the narrative is existential. In the box, the drive of the story comes from a moral dilemma. Believe me when I say that I understand the tendency to compare an innovative filmmaker movie by looking at trends and patterns, but it is important to me to approach each new movie as a standalone entity and then look out for it to knit. <br /> <br /> The box is one of those movies about which you have mixed feelings, as it seems to be in some kind of identity crisis. It is not always certain what it wants to be. The twists are numerous, but easy to follow than to predict. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a relatively credible pair of newlyweds in financial straits. A box with a "button unit" comes on their doorstep and is informed by a terribly burned man that if the button is pressed, the death of one person they do not know will cause and they will have one million dollars received. One of the things the Boxing does is to eradicate this invisible fear that our actions have moral consequences. Before the button is pressed, it has an exciting and seductive quality, alluring but sinister. As soon as it is pushed, events are triggered that cause the two leaders to question their own morality and deplore their own fatal decision. <br /> <br /> The idea that the subject is an experiment is interesting because it offers me a paradox. If there is an "altruism coefficient" based on data collected by pairs that press the button and not press, then the conspiracy sees that it is ultimately a forced altruism. Be selfless or the species will be wiped out. I suppose the couples do not know the consequences of their actions when confronted with the decision, but they have no reason to suspect that the goat can do anything, so why would they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care when it comes to a problem in our own lives? <br /> <br /> The psychological hurdles in this movie are everywhere. Press the button or not, it is likely that someone is spoiling you. Don't take the money or do it, nobody gives away anything for free. Seek the truth, the answers you find, slowly reveal your downfall. <br /> <br /> I suggest the box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. You can only choose to be free at the expense of another's life, is that freedom? No, it's just another box, because then you get caught up in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us, because we live on earth and that is another subject. This is exactly why the external creatures in the film are ultimately opponents. They demand that we comply with moral standards that rob us of our freedom. We made it to Mars, and we were burned and changed into slaves into a sick game. <br /> <br /> The references to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point very well. "You can only enter the final room, or not free." Certainly, but no matter what form we enter the room, it's a room. <br /> <br /> Trevor Nemeth
