There are few films that deal with things that I consider myself an expert. This one is. After a few years of Fantasy Role Play, we split, I'm not without a sense of shame about what I <br /> <br /> You see, these things are really canonical. This happens to everyone. <br /> <br /> First, you create a character just and die after the first attack. <br /> <br /> Then you help a little with the constitution, and while you are there, why not help with power, intelligence, intuition, charisma and dexterity? It frustrates the game master who does not know how to handle this invincible gang. And after a while it also exacerbates the players, so they are starting to create more exotic racial combinations, no matter how ridiculous it is. <br /> <br /> I created a Druedain fighter monk, not so far from the movie. <br /> <br /> And it's not all about the destructibility of the inherent dynamics of this devilish game (think of the hunting experience), but just look at the movie, it shows everything - and of course the stupidity of its most basic premises. <br /> <br /> For this purpose, there is no better job than the beard. I do not understand exactly why the bard became a character in the first place. After all, the blacksmith is nothing. But once it became one, it had to be mapped into the game flow, that is, it had to be made deadly, at least indirectly. Picking pleasure from this never comes quite and right. <br /> <br /> It's not a professional production, but I've never seen a better satire.
