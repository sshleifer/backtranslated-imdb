Back in 1983, Michael Jackson's popularity was such that if he wanted to make a $ 1m horror music video with the American Werewolf team and with Vincent Price's voice, that was exactly what he was going to do. And never have a music video created such a sensation, before or since ... when released on VHS, this 13-minute short is the world's largest selling music of all time. But the chance is that you already know it, as when there is a list of the best music videos of all time, this one almost always takes the apex. <br /> <br /> It starts with Michael Jackson walking a dark street with his date after their car broke down. He explains to her that he is not like other men, and then the full moon appears from behind the clouds. His girlfriend stood there shouting, screaming, and shouting a few more, during a cute transformation sequence like Michael Jackson being a werewolf. He chases her through the woods, catches her and us ... cuts to a kiosk. Oh, all this just happens in a horror movie Michael Jackson and his date watch. <br /> <br /> So, we're five minutes in and still no sign of the song "Thriller". Exuberant, many? Anyway, you need to know how it goes ... dance, sing ... graveyard ... Vincent Price ... zombies ... "What's the problem?" ... then ends credits. End credits for a friggin 'music video. "Thriller" is not one of Michael Jackon's most memorable songs, but even according to today's standards, it is definitely a bitch of a visual experience. If you haven't seen it in its entirety, you should definitely be one day soon.
