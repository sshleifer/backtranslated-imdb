Wow! I chose it from the rental board because I loved Robert Carlyle and Jonny Lee Miller in 'Trainspotting'. This is a phenomenal movie; It has action, romance, tension, intrigue and white. When I didn't laugh, I was at the edge of my seat. It is definitely a movie I recommend to people who appreciate an intelligent dialogue and a new perspective of the 18th century. This movie has everything to keep ME happy!
