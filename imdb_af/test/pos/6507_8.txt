The omission of Jazzy Jeff, the creator of the choir and the transformer scratched, raised some eyebrows, but it is good to see that he eventually made it to the extras of the DVD. With SCRATCH, Doug Pray, who previously wrote the '90s' grunge phenomenon in HYPE (1996), made an excellent documentary version on the world of hip-hop DJ and the evolution of turntable. His latest documentary, INFAMY (2005), explores current American graffiti culture. After a few views four years ago, my DVD has been collecting dust ever since, but recently I watched it again and I was also surprised at how well shot and edited this documentary is. Also a very pleasant soundtrack and not just heads, but lots of music, old school material, parties, breaks dance, call it. One of the best things about the movie is that it mainly explores where the art of turntable is today (in 2001 it is), without, of course, ignoring the pioneers. Good things. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 8/10
