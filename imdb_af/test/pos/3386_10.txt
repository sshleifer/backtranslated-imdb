I saw the first mini-series as a child and although I am no longer a child, I still love it !!! Professional copies are hard to find, but if it's on DVD, it's MINE !!! Great decisive, amazing plots, lots of action, romance, and even quite a bit of well-placed comedy. I'm not a historian by nature, but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction!
