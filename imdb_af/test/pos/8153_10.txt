If you have a box of tissues, a comfortable sofa, a large bowl of popcorn and no social commitment on a Friday night, this is definitely your movie! It's romantic, it's hot and challenging. For most of our gay people, religion is just one of the things we did when we were kids and probably just played at the altar boy and how cute he was! But in Last Days you see the struggle to be gay when your whole world turns to faith, which is completely contradictory to being gay. The two main roles were completely warm, but at the same time managed to catch your heart and even made me shout (I never cried in a movie!), What I thought was impressive for a B grade movie. I recommend this movie, you will laugh, you will cry (unless you are) and you will definitely sleep! I'm so fond of buying the DVD for my collection. It is truly the most beautiful movie ever
