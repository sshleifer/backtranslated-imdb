I expected this movie to be a stinker, but I wanted to see myself, but I was surprised at how good it was from a movie. I know longer movies often do not do well at the checkout, but why it was drawn and not allowed to be viewed by the public is outside me. It kept my interest throughout and the landscape and photography are sometimes breathtaking. The plot was good and the morality game was a good one. I like the realism that was in the line of "In vain". I had to rent this movie to see it, but it was definitely worth it.
