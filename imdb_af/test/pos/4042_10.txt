First, I remember that this story in the primary school is vaguely told about 6 or 7 years ago. I'm so familiar with the story. However, many of these have changed and there are many differences and errors (sometimes unnecessary) in the movie that hard fans will not appreciate. <br /> <br /> But overall, I really love this movie. I saw it about 2 years ago near Christmas (well the 1st part) and caught the previous thing again on Christmas same channel last Christmas. <br /> <br /> I was very impressed, sometimes it might be a bit overpriced and long, but with an engaging story, decent performances (especially of icy Fonda and Hobbs) and beautiful scenery, costumes and little taps of magic makes it a very special movie - which really reminds me of Cherry. <br /> <br /> Despite the differences in the book, I think the movie is good to repeat and brilliantly re-create new themes and ideas (the seasons with autumn, winter, etc. with a new thief character). <br /> <br /> I live in the UK for so long waiting for the DVD, and fortunately I saw an ad offering a series of free DVDs in the Daily Mail newspaper. does not get normally, so I did last year's edition and finally got my DVD. If you missed it and want this rare DVD for region 2, I suggest you collect and send the Daily Mail tokens because your DVD will be delivered by Christmas. <br /> <br /> So for a little escape In the Christmas season this year, sit on your fire, get cozy and watch you and kids probably really enjoy this fantastic movie. If you don't, it will probably be repeated at Christmas 4, so sign it up!
