This film is wonderful, it has the same low-budget first movie feel of 'Pi' and 'Clerks', but has the style of 'Memento' (also by author / director Christopher Nolan). The score, sound effects, photography and editing are almost 'Memento' prototypes, and the story shows that Christopher Nolan is the best when writing and directing. Don't be frightened by the low budget watching and acting, or even the short length of the movie, and just watch it!
