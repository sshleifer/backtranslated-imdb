This much anticipated DVD memento of Rush's visit to South America in 2002 may be the best rock video ever put on the slide. The picture and sound production values ​​are incredible, even more than they have the elements to bring down this production. All the tracks you can expect from the RUSH catalog are here from Tom Sawyer to The Pass, which is gloriously reproduced for the honest, orgiastic, Brazilian crowd. They actually sing for YYZ, which is an instrumental tool, and give you an indication of their fervor! disc is the concert and the second disc contains 3 multi-angle pieces -a Villa Strangiato, YYZ and the amazing drum solo, plus a 30-minute documentary on the bands going to Brazil. All in all, it is a triumph and all serious classic rock fans must own a copy.
