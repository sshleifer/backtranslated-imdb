Dr Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, left his wife, his son (an unknown James Franco), did not respect him and lost a patient he was working on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has deceived her. They must both get away. She looks over a beautiful oceanside bar in Rodanthe and at the same time makes a room. They are all alone. You can find out the rest very well. <br /> <br /> It is known as a whip or a woman's movie. It is beautifully shot with a romantic setting and very quiet scenes. There is tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an end to end (kind). The great act of Gere and Lane helps to disguise the fact that this film isn't really about much. Every single piece of the plot is predictable. I rolled my eyes very much during some of the events. This too is too short - I didn't believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. If it comes out of nowhere and moves very fast. Yet the movie works. The inn itself is absolutely beautiful and I was in tears by the end, along with most of the audience. So it's a predictable but beautiful movie with some great plays. It does not deserve all the criticism it gets. I give it a 7.
