Early in the film, Cagney's Johnny Cave character tells his curtains in the Weight and Measures Office that unscrupulous shoppers bought the US consumer more than the total National War debt! Then he goes out and sells a very greasy green grocery to sell him a bag of sugar that is four ounces (oh, the horrors!) And one skinny chicken that rather rarely proclaims his kicker's scale to be six pounds. , after which the fur - or in this case feathers - fly. There, fly. When a rocket in politicians' clothes tries to investigate poultry practice practices, our hero becomes a sole wolf who wields the war weights on behalf of housewives in America. After all, four cents here and a quarter together and before we know it we have anarchy! Word of intolerance soon reaches both the mayor and the governor's offices, and Cagney becomes a marked man. If it sounds stupid, it is not - the dishonest retail practices are just a plot tool (or as Hitchcock would say, the McGuffin) and although unknown, it also works everybody like any Treasury Agent or G-man anthology in which The battle is being taken to shady crooks who operate outside the interests of the country's general good. The production standards are definitely Grade B, but it is Cagney who enjoys this movie: it was his first film away from Warner Brothers after he got rid of his unreasonable contract in court and he looks at ease and enjoys himself immensely - The show featured here is intelligent and crackling with its unique energy and sure fire charism. Mae Clarke's presence gives a definite Warner's sense of overall production. The supporting players become solid performances and the story moves cleverly to a rocky introduction that begins three or four roles in the story - but sits back and enjoys the Cagney showcase and captivates the depression era magazine it is. .
