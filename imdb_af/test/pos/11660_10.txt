One of the best ever. Direction, photography, exciting and dramatic history, wonderful soundtrack, and especially the incredible credibility of Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn, the best and most underrated "minor generation" factor. After I watched this movie, do I think there is anyone who has no doubt about giving death to another man, despite the ugly things he could have done?
