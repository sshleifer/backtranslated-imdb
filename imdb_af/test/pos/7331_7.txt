Flipper is a nice heart-warming movie for the whole family. Of course this is not a good movie, Free Willy looks almost better in every component of movies. It may be a bit naive, and the script and script are not the best part of the movie, but it is an entertaining movie with great cinematography (including underwater shots) and important moral messages. Elijah Wood once again proved himself as an incredibly talented and underrated actor. He can watch a bad movie, okay movie - good, good - big and good movie is always classic. Paul Hogan's performance was also very good and he is perfectly suited to his role. As I mentioned above, the whole cinematography was very good. But underwater shots are definitely the best parts. So Flipper is a perfect way to see a nice, sweet and entertaining movie. If you want me to get sick and tired of modern Hollywood rubbish, filled with sex, violence, vulgarity and curse you probably want this movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7.7 out of 10.
