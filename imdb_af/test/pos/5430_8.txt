Robin Williams is a national treasure, especially when he breaks loose and sets aside his maudlin approach to drama. He manages to improve the usual barrier of Barry Levinson, and there are moments in this film when he really shines. <br /> <br /> As the coveted US president in "Man of the Year", Williams regains the hilarity. and indignation previously associated with him. What makes him so attractive is his humanity and equality. Here is a man who can clash with his audience but also love them. His humor is like barbed wire, and yet it is cathartic. It makes him very attractive to the people in the film and in real life. <br /> <br /> Once again, Laura Linney depicts an intelligent woman in need. She is a fantastic and talented artist, but I think she has packed a stereotype and unfortunately it was more interesting to have less well-known artists in this case. Walken almost walks through his ungrateful role, and the climate scene in the SNL skit hardly drives water. <br /> <br /> Get in for some hilarious moments, and it's invaluable. Enjoy Williams and forget about the deep moments that delay this otherwise entertaining movie.
