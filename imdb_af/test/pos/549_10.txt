Last night I could see "Anywhere But Here" as a free preview. I absolutely loved the movie! I was based on the realistic portrayal of a relationship between mother and daughter ... there was definitely a connection between Adele and Ann. I think it speaks volumes of the outstanding performances of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Sarandon was just the right actress to portray Adele and after I left the theater, I couldn't think of another actress in the role. Portman was also excellent as Ann. She played a sense of maturity and intelligence that I don't think any other teenage actress can do. I think it will have to give the Academy of Moving Arts and Sciences credit where it is due and nominate Sarandon and Portman for awards in the "Actress" and "Supporting Actress" categories. It would be a pity if they were overlooked.
