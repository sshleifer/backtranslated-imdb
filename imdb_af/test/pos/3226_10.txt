This show is my absolute favorite. This show is intelligent, entertaining and always full of surprises. Lauren Graham is perfect as Lorelai Gilmore, a single mother who is Rory's best friend. Alexis Bledel shines like the beautiful and intelligent Rory Gilmore and Keiko Agena is one of a kind like Rory's best friend, Lane Kim. I love the fun dialogue, that's what makes it unique about the show. Kelly Bishop is angry as Emily Gilmore and Edward Herrman are great as Richard Gilmore. Scott Patterson is happy as Luke Danes and members of the group are one of a kind to watch. The community, Miss. Patty, Babette, Mrs. Kim, Taylor Doose, Kirk and others are always funny, strange and interesting, which always stands out for the funny one-liners. This show has changed so much in the years that it will never get old. Gilmore Girls is an original and clever show that lets you look. This is how good it is. I give this show a 10/10 rating.
