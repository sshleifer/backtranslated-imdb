L'Apartment is, I think, a very purposeful Hitchcockian movie. The plot was large with symbolism (ie the white and red roses) and plot twists neatly wrapped. The look was very Parisian and has drawn you closer to the story. I saw it in London and am very sorry that it is not on the video in the states
