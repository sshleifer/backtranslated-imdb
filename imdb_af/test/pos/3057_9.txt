Unfortunately, I have never seen the full version of this movie. I saw the 87-minute version twice back in the 1950s. Even more floridly than the norm with Julien Duvivier, it is a wonderful, out-of-the-ordinary piece, full of continuous tracing, over and in Andrejew's wonderful atmospheric sets. Beautifully lit by photographer Andr√© Thomas, Black Jack is nothing if it is not a gourmet's delight. Strengthening this imaginative visual style is a script that allows a roster of our favorite actors, including Agnes Moorehead and Marcel Dalio, some brilliant bizarre, thoroughbred characters. George Sanders gives a sophisticated performance, while an eccentric millionaire (who is a competitor) is apparently played by Agnes Moorehead. Also, most of her role, Patricia Roc, realizes. The film was made in Spain in 1949.
