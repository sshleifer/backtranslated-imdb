If ever a potential movie should sound like it wouldn't work based on reading the writing on paper, it would be one. Here we seem to look like a lousy and cowardly soft porn movie, complete with the big in-the-poster, which sticks out a naked naked Christina Ricci who no one but mr. Bad Ass MF himself, Samuel Jackson, owns. But let me tell you, if it ever saves a movie on celluloid big time with psychological power, it's Craig Brewer's redeeming succession of Hustle & Flow, Black Snake Moon. <br /> <br /> Unashamedly The top of the beginning, this movie sucks you in with the opening scenes and continues to cut deeper and deeper with each subsequent frame. It is your basic story of two deeply damaged characters who find the power and courage to move in more positive ways with their lives. Previously, of course, this story, but as I have said, it is the way a story is told that gives it heart, depth, meaning and power. <br /> <br /> Ricci's damaged-child abuse of wild-child character Rae and Jackson's equally psychic musician character Lazarus find each other under desperate circumstances, and Laz takes it upon himself to help Rae. It is, in itself, relatively unique: the idea of ​​a man trying to really help a woman in severe pain rather than favoring her, and we know from the beginning that Laz's heart and heart of the movie. in the right place. The film in its core is about the redeeming, healing power of love (with music as a very close second), and the film resonates deeply with this truth - psychologically, spectacularly and brilliantly. <br /> <br /> An important reason for the film being so deep is due to the fierce, dedicated performances of Ricci and Jackson. Screens that would be so ridiculous and pathetic in the hands of lesser artists are instead powerful as everyone comes out. In particular, the movie's play in which Jackson sings and plays the title of the title alone in his home, with Ricci, amidst a serious thunderstorm and the abusive demons of Rae's passing amok in her head, leading her after Lazarus and clinging to his leg, does not come ridiculous, as it must be technically it, but rather as a rooting cathartic. <br /> <br /> All the supporting performances are also fantastic here. Justin Timberlake is completely credible as Rae's anxious-disturbed boyfriend Ronnie, and the always wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson is also perfectly thrown as a character who naturally has feelings for Lazarus. John Cothran Jr. is also excellent, such as Laz's revered friend R.L. (a nod to blues musician R. L. Burnside without a doubt). Everything works about this movie, let's see it, including the music / soundtrack, which Burnside, Scott Bomar, Bobby Rush, Son House, and most importantly, Jackson himself, whose fantastic version of Stackolee I'm listening to. There is also a very nice and moving version of "This Little Light of Mine" in the film, which has been sobering provisionally and softly by Ricci. <br /> <br /> In recent interviews, Samuel Jackson said he believes his performance in this movie has so far been the best of his career; I couldn't agree with him anymore. It is work that he can be proud of, along with everyone involved in this boring, extremely wise and deeply savvy mother of a project.
