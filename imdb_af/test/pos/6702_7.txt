I finally got Lifeforce on DVD, with the widescreen format intact and the Henry Mancini score to the maximum. Having seen Lifeforce on tape for fifteen years, I have to say that the uncut DVD version was both great and disappointing. The American version is so * much * better than the DVD (European?) Version. The American version of life force moves much faster (editing on the DVD version is terrible. Feel like an unfinished track). And the many scenes not seen in the American version add little or nothing to the final problem. In fact, a "new" moment almost destroys the whole movie when Caine (Peter Firth) meets the male alien at the cathedral. I love this scene but in the American version. On the DVD, the male stranger speaks to Caine and what he says is soooooo hilarious. This is the highlight of hilariousness: <br /> <br /> "It will be much less scary if you just come to me!" the male alien says, in a deep 1950s style voice. I was on the floor when I saw it. It just doesn't belong in the movie. That scene is pure camp in an otherwise super serious movie. I'm glad that Hooper (or anyone) cuts that scene when the movie was released in North America. There are several changes made to the American version that makes Lifeforce so much better and I wanted the DVD to have the American version. The editing is sharp and indignant without being annoying and some sites already bored in the US version are even more boring on the DVD version due to added scenes. And the opening credits on the DVD are terrible. Much better in the American version. More subtle. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. These are basically strangers making a pit stop over the earth and sucking as much Lifeforce as possible. The movie has too many flat, uninspiring rows (talking, talking, talking), but if the action goes to London, it's fun. The movie really shines in these scenes. One can see how Hooper finally does what he is wonderful: chaos, cruelty, horror! Life force had had more of these chaos scenes. They are the best apocalyptic scenes ever placed on film. It's also the best zombie movie ever. The zombies are hungry (for life force, not flesh) and they are crazy and agile and scary. Not the slow moving drills of other zombie movies. Many people have also criticized the end, but I love it. It leaves you high and dry, like one of the death-killed victims. <br /> <br /> And to think, this movie came out during the cute and cuddly 80s when people fled to E.T. or Cocoon or other sweet and boring, feel good sci-fi movies. No wonder it was bombed, because it was far from its time with its super nihilistic point of view! <br /> <br /> As for the DVD, it's not good. The image is muddy and granular and there is no extra at all. But it's great to see the movie in its widescreen format. I just hope they'll release a clean, crisp American version on a DVD, and with comments by Hooper and Dykstra.
