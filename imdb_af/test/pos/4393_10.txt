About the discussion about the South, the Rednecks and the Hillbillies ... Well, I'm from the South: Argentina, near the South Pole to be exact. Is it enough? Seriously, some stories are universal. We have never been to Greece, nor have we lived the classic era of Homer, but he is talking to us today. So do Shakespeare and Dante. And stories from far unknown places also reach us, when told with sensitivity, intelligence, humor, just like "O Brother". In addition, we all (the rest of the world) also have our own hillbillies! And our own depression era (ever heard from Argentina during the year 2001?), Our politicians and racism, our gentle souls, just like Delmar and Tommy. I loved this movie, people. Despite the subtitles, despite being on the other side of the world. (And please forgive my mistakes in English, I tried my best) <br /> <br /> PS: I believe nobody has quoted this favorite phrase: when Delmar asks George Nelson, what does he do for a life while he handles the machine gun ...
