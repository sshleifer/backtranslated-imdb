This is the best film released in Bollywood to date. The best comedy, the best acting and the best way to date! Rajkumar Santoshi's writing and direction proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry. Aamir Khan was absolutely wonderful, Salman Khan looks good as he did. Shakti Kapoor was good, but Jagdeep was wearing as usual! This comedy is still being copied by people and no other writers and directors could make this thing again! Even Rajkumar Santoshi couldn't make this cult classic again! This movie was a flop when released, but it was a cult classic since it was released and loved by all kinds of people. <br /> <br /> STAR. <br /> <br /> ACTIVITY 10/10. </ br /> <br /> DIALOGES 10/10. <br /> <br /> SCREENPLAY 10/10. <br /> <br /> DIRECTION 10/10. <br /> <br /> MUSIC 9/10. <br /> <br /> LYRICS 9/10. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is highly recommended. If you haven't seen it so far, you've missed something great! It's a laugh riot and the best comedy I've seen so far! Classic movies like Hera Pheri, Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not even as funny as it is. <br /> <br /> GREAT MOVIE, HATS OFF !!
