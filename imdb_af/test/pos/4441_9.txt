Documentaries in which boys and girls try to understand a parent and, according to the process, their own lives are not so unusual. Also, not uncommonly, results lacking in talent, a failure of introspection, an abundance of narcissism, and perhaps a priceless quest for public mocking revenge for many past, truly and imaginatively. What is unusual is a brilliant, fair and impressive portrait of a captivating parent and "My architect: a boy's journey" is that scarce performance. <br /> <br /> Louis Kahn emigrates to this country as a child, his face is irreparable and terribly frightened by an accident. He and his parents settled in Philadelphia where the talented youngster loved art and music. Soon he is welcomed by buildings and decides that only an architect's career will answer his creative abilities. <br /> <br /> Kahn has become an architect, but as this film shows, it took a long time before he caught the attention of the leaders in his field. One architect suggested he was a victim of the 'yellow bracelet', that anti-Semitism which, along with prejudice against women, has long been an indifferent aspect of the American architecture industry. <br /> <br /> When he got acquainted, he was clearly seen, as a confident, job-seeking prophet crying out, that his vision and vision were first realized. That inflexibility was the reason he made great plans for many buildings, but he only had a few buildings. The interview with an older man who fired Kahn in Philadelphia because of his unacceptable dream of a transformed urban center where people left their cars around and walked into town is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Kahn was a born teacher and some of the extensive archive material here shows him students, his voice is steady but passionate. They look respect and intensity. <br /> <br /> Many architects have been interviewed by director, writer and project honcho Nathaniel Kahn, the architect's only architect. son. Some are world famous - I. M. Pei, Robert A.M. Stone, Moshe Safdie, Frank Gehry and the still active nonagenary, Philip Johnson. Their comments paint a spectacular image of this idealistic but ultimately financially unsuccessful designer of buildings that merged the castles, fort and large buildings of the ages into designs for the present. Kahn's buildings are shown, among the most impressive of the Salk Research Laboratories in La Jolla, CA. For me, his style has a neo-romantic air that is triggered by too much empty space, rather than attracting human interaction. <br /> <br /> But Kahn's son was more than the story of his father, the architect. For many years, Louis Kahn had three families: a woman with whom he had a daughter and two long-term relationships, one of which was the daughter, the other the son. Kahn often visited his son at the mother's house, but by the end of the evening Kahn would go back to the marriage house. Nathaniel clearly wanted to know about this unusual set of relationships, but it doesn't seem to be a strange relationship for a little boy. <br /> <br /> When Nathaniel was a young boy, Louis Kahn died of a massive heart attack in the men's room of New York's Pennsylvania station after returning from India where he was one of his massive projects. beaten, another one who never was. building. At that time, his Philadelphia firm was owed at least $ 500,000 and had a trip to the federal bankruptcy court. It was probably in the way. <br /> <br /> Kahn has left several monumental structures of which the government building in Bangladesh is clearly the largest. A Teary local architect picks up Kahn because he has created a building where democracy (and hopefully) will flourish. <br /> <br /> Co-architect Moshe Safdie finds out that there was something appropriate in Kahn's mortal heart attack in a train station given his incessant globe rotting. I disagree: it is sadly ironic that Kahn should die in the faceless replacement of one of America's true architectural jewels, the old Pennsylvania station, to make room for a sterile, non-character replacement and no continuation of civilian memory. <br /> <There are a number of emotional moments filmed during the younger Kahn's journey, including his half-sisters and his mother, but they are real and moving, not maudlin and staged. Architects of architecture will always study Kahn. His son found reasons to remember him as a flawed but very iconoclastic and ultimately private man. <br /> <br /> 9/10.
