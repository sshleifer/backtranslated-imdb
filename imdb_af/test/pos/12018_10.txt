It's one of those movies that just clicked with me for whatever reason. Everything is right. Eric Roberts laconic, beautiful investigator, his narrative storytelling, the pivot, Dan Hedaya and Denis Lipscomb have good roles, the institutions, the paintings in the artist study scenes, the end-credit series and the amazingly exciting theme music that perfectly surrounds the mood. of the whole movie. If I have any reservations, it's about Beverly D'Angelo as the femme fatale, but she's beautifully playing her final scenes. I think director Matthew Chapman was trying for a kind of 'Chinatown' feel to the whole thing. It didn't work. But as a murder mystery, it's a jewel.
