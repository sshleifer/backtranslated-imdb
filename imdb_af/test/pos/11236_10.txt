Keys for the VIP, an original series by the Canadian Comedy Network (comedynetwork.ca), got huge with these entertaining but inspirational game shows. This show is presented by four funny, nice guys who judge others about their "play" (ability to pick up women). Each episode features two guys who go into several take-off head-to-head games. There are three different sections and the winner counts a night as a VIP in an exclusive Toronto nightclub. <br /> <br /> Of course, to be a guy, I find this show hilarious. We all know that it is difficult to confront women and to watch these guys obviously makes the curiosity of men. The guys competing on this show can even give you some tips - if you pay attention.
