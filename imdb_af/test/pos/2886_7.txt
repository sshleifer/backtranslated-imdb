It is a good concert that contains the best songs of the group's 30-year career. Lee, Lifeson and Peart were animated and fun on stage and delivered a good performance. That said, I think the sound recording was broken at the mixing console and / or the mixing process. However, this is not the fault of the boys. They even mentioned that the show was set up last minute, so the group and their crew did their best. They just didn't have to exhibit the public consumption exhibition. Neil's strings sound far and Geddy's bass has good harmonic content but no bottom! They had to attend this concert and wait for a better opportunity. Buy this DVD only if you are a hardcore Rushian. The quality is lacking in the audio section.
