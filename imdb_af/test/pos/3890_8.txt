Garlin did a good job. Nice concept well executed, and tightly produced. Come over as a very sincere story. As a fan of "Curb Your Enthusiasm", where Jeff was almost the straight man, I was delighted at how much depth he brought to this role in a simple but effective depiction. Much of the humor was understated and subtle and went on poignancy, which I really liked, rather than being a slapstick or over-explained. And there were some nice surprises and twists. The convenience vignettes were a pleasure. <br /> <br /> If I say it's a wonderful "small" movie, it doesn't mean budget or quality. It's simple, intimate and handmade. It tells a highly credible everyday story. Relax and see it. Let it be washed over you, and you will feel good about it.
