David Cronenberg, much like colleague David Lynch, is an acquired taste. A director who plays with themes such as reality, perversion, sex, insanity and death is planning to get the most extreme reactions from audiences. He proved it with films such as The Fly, Naked Lunch, Crash and eXitenZ (Capital X, Capital Z) and more recently Spider. It is best to see eXists with a clear mind. Try not to read too much about the plot or it will be ruined for you. What I can tell you is that Cronenberg is traveling you in the world of video games that serve as a metaphor for any kind of escapism. Living fantasies is something that people always dream about, but how far can you go into it before reality fades and fantasy takes over and becomes a nightmare? These are the themes that are affected in eXistenZ, an exploration of identity, the human psyche, physical bodies attacked by diseases and most importantly reality itself. <br /> <br /> The story and direction are excellent. Cronenberg knows his deal very well and successfully brings an artificial world to life, avoiding the usual pitfalls and cliches associated with stories like this. The movie shows some nasty things, but is extremely low key in the gore section compared to Cronenberg's other work. The shock effects he plays are never over and the plot progression is very intelligent and creative. It's not the most intellectual movie ever, but it will make you think, wonder and confuse. <br /> <br /> The play also gets two inches. Both lead actors, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Jude Law, play their parts perfectly and cleverly show off their character's shifting voices and identities. The dialogue can sometimes seem a bit clinic and clinical, but it is part of the effect that Cronenberg had on creating an outrageous and strange atmosphere that makes you very uncomfortable. Supporting actors such as Ian Holm, Don McKellar and a particularly creepy Willem Dafoe lift the movie even higher with their disturbed familiar performances. <br /> <br /> This movie is used to, but if you appreciate the dark tone, bloodshot and existential warping story, you'll love it.
