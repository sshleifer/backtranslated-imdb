For those of you out there who have seen this picture on VHS, I recommend the DVD. In fact, the VHS is unrest. The main reason is that the movie is widescreen shot (2.55: 1) and the producers lost money to make the VHS version and release it as 4: 3. As a result, several actors are not on the screen at all, and in many tractors less than half of the cars are displayed, as one is on each side of the screen. The DVD is actually a reasonable version of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many of the best scenes in the movie were cut before the final version. They were considered insulting to minority groups. In fact, the prospect of a US release has caused even more cuts in the film. For example, the Americans allegedly didn't understand words like Petrol & Strides. <br /> <br /> Mike's father and mother were meant to be hippies. The father survives in the movie as a wasteful dull smoke guitarist. But the next scene with the mother was cut. The scene took place in the roof space of the house, lined with aluminum foil, fluoro lights and filled with plants ... you get the picture. The producers rolled up many real plants in the foreground and when they saw the rash on the big sheet, they freaked and the scene was cut. Cowards! <br /> <br /> Yes, the movie is listed as an Australian cult classic. Vote # 2 in street machines on the best 100 movies of all time, miss out on Mad Max ll. The latter had more than 10 times the ROE budget. In fact, the budget on ROE was so small that the director could not afford to destroy any of the cars, although there would have been a public excuse if someone had ruined a real HO. (compare it to Smoky and the Bandit or Blues Bros where dozens of cars have been destroyed.) <br /> <br /> So there is one real GTHO and two fakes. One of the bugs was bought from the local Cobar local community after the stand-by GTHO crashed in the background of the Country Boy truck. (These were inscriptions! The car had to burst out of the truck.) Because the budget was so tight, the car was made up of plain brown masking tape instead of the golden decoration of the right thing. br /> <br /> The 55 Chev is absolutely real. The car started out as a very clear 4 door and was brilliant and quickly converted to the blown '55 in the movie. The car was a marinated 545 which made about 1000 bhp. It is reduced to about 600 for filming. The car could easily reach up to 170 km / h in various scenes in the film. <br /> <br /> Just for the record, anyone with $ 12,000 could pick up all the cars after the movie. The HO, the Dodge, the '53 Out, Rammer's 53 Chev ... the lot. Wonder where they are now? <br /> <br /> SW
