This is a good TV movie with a good story and lots of comic moments thanks to the excellent role. <br /> <br /> The only problem this movie has is that it didn't stand the test of time. <br /> <br /> In spite of that, it's definitely worth watching, especially if you're an Alan Alda or Ruth Gordon fan.
