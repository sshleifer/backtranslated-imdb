Hick Trek is clearly a jealous movie for even an El Mariachi level budget ($ 7,000). However, the creators can at times (often due to great editing), such as the balconies, the on-board situations, and Slim T. Jerk's unique way of communicating with his ship without the use of a traditional communication device . <br /> <br /> The play has its rough spots, but the portrayal of "Horns" McBoy is excellent and Fluffy is definitely not too hard on the eye. <br /> <br /> I wish the movie was longer than the approximate hour - and it should be seen as a compliment. This movie is a success because of the sincerity and hard work of those involved.
