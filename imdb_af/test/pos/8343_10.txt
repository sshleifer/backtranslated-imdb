This film is about a teenager struggling with his social status in school. He is a "Good Christian" and feels he is missing out on all the fun at high school. He therefore wished he had never become one. After obtaining his wish and trying a worldly lifestyle, he realizes that his quality of life has been dramatically reduced and wants to return to the person he was. Good family-oriented movie with a positive message to be proud of who you are, even if you are not the most popular.
