Okay, maybe Posse can't compare to other popular cowboy / western movies. But that's because the FUND didn't have those movies. Obviously, if you want to write a story like this, focus on African American historical involvement (and NO, servants and "moms" not historical involvement), Hollywood won't be too supportive. And believe me they weren't. The producers and actors exhausted many expenses to make "Posse" just to tell the story. I think it alone is commendable. Posse may not be Oscar material (and they don't like Black media too much), but it's a start. It's entertaining, and it presents us to the black cowboy, a character most of whom is unknown.
