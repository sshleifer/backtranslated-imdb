I'm not going to tell anyone what happens in the end, but it doesn't fit the movie. However, the rest of Imaginary Heroes portrayed a realistic family that goes through realistic issues such as death, drugs, relationships and high school. I could have sworn they were my own family, no joke. <br /> <br /> Emile Hirsch was completely credible as a teenager struggling with his brother's suicide and Sigourney Weaver is playing a mother trying to keep the remains of her (slightly) dysfunctional family. <br /> <br /> Although these families can handle extreme problems, anyone can relate to what they are going through, whether it is graduation, expectation or older.
