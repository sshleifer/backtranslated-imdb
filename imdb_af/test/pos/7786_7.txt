RKS after the success of GHAYAL began working on this movie that was a comedy. The film was making for 3 years and finally released in 1994 but did not work for any reason. For this movie, DAMINI (93) released and performed well /> <br /> The movie is a crazy movie like most Priyadarshan movies today, but it's funny and well-handled. The movie has a proper plot as opposed to today's movies and makes you laugh, most characters have become known, whether it is crime master gogo (Shakti Kapoor), Paresh Rawal and others <br /> <br /> The movie holds you to laugh over time, though it is too slapstick and overdone, but it is one of the funniest movies. <br /> <br /> Direction's direction is very good music is good <br /> <br /> Among the actors, Aamir steals the show and delivers his funniest performance. It was his first out-n-comedy. Salman does well, but looks Aamir's amateur front, but does a good job and their chemistry. charisma is irritating and sounds like a child. Raveena is sufficient. Paresh Rawal is too funny in both roles, Shakti Kapoor is hilarious in his over the top act. Shehzad Khan (called Ajit) is very good and Viju Khote is also funny.
