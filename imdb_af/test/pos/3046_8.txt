Martin Ritt seems to be a director who is always interested in social issues (as the son of immigrants he had every incentive to be, especially since he was blacklisted in the 50's). "Conrack" is based on Pat Conroy's novel The Water is Wide, about his own experience in 1969, teaching a school of poor black children around the world, to the chagrin of the right-wing superintendent (Hume Cronyn). Regarding the film's strength, the cultural and historical context was: Conroy (Jon Voight) tells frustration to another teacher how many of the kids don't know about Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, the Vietnam War or even where Vietnam. He continues to relieve them of all these factors. Somewhere I read a complaint that Conroy played music for the kids, he just played white music. The truth is, you can't blame the movie for this; It was based on Conroy's true experience. Anyway, the movie is a real gem.
