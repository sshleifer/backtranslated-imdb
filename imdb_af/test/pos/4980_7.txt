Stanwyck at her shameful best, Robinson looked at her - like ruthless land barons in this fairly ordinary western. <br /> <br /> Some good action scenes, strong use of place, color and Cinemascope. But why the preliminary use of stock in the stampede scene? <br /> <br /> Ford is reliable as always, and Foster is strong as Robinson's daughter, but it's the bad movie. And it's not just Stanwyck and Robinson - Brian Keith makes a surprising villain as Stanwyck's lover, and Richard Jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold killer. <br /> <br /> See it for the camp value.
