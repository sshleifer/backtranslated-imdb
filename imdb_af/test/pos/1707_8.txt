Tia Carrere was the reason why I decided to watch this movie, as neither the title nor the cover would be enough to spend my time and money on this movie? showing me and everyone that a DVD should not be judged by its coverage. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS *** The movie felt as though it were wandering, not really going anywhere. the moment ?? The inconvenience of Paul Faber (Zak Orth) that girls are almost impersonating to watch, and the edge of the otherwise attractive Kirsten Beck (like Alexondra Lee) to school-girlish is to watch. Where were those really fashionable in 1995? <br /> <br /> The relationship between Vicky Mueller (Tia Carrere) and Todd Boomer (Jason London) was tempting from the start! The first meeting on the lake? magical. What a beautiful coincidence they have to meet again just like he behaved like a full moron ("Boomer, with two O's as in the morning?") For Alexondra. It is a pity that we as the audience know who Vicky Mueller really was. (Well, the title gave it away, wouldn't you think?) <br /> <br /> What really surprised me was the play. Especially in the scene where Vicky Todd gives a metal version of his alter-ego (the dog character), in the small white jewelry box. The actors really managed to recreate that tingling sensation of a first kiss? no return point for Todd and Vicky. It is a pity that the film ends with the focus on (after getting Todd's father's Harvard row) his reunion with his friends. Can I imagine a whole new movie? Follow Vicky to New York? There must be a good art university where Todd can attend ?! <br /> <br /> However, a movie that just does what we want Hollywood to be: entertaining for the duration of the movie. Did anyone else notice how not one of the loved ones is happy in this movie? Todd's mother is slightly mad (24 hours a day), his father doesn't find her attractive. Of course, Todd's teacher is disillusioned by his wife and vice versa? Todd himself enters a wonderful erotic and daring relationship that, no matter how nice it may be, is realistically very difficult to maintain (age difference, maturity difference, etc.) And Alexondra & Zak doesn't come together because Alexondra isn't mature enough to handle no. a relationship (-> her reactions to the condom, the fraud, Zak's advances etc. are all very immature, and often keep away) and Zak himself, the poor guy? is too much of a best friend / brother-brother to even draw Alexondra. <br /> <br /> Do you think good movie already! I gave it an 8/10. Brilliant performance by the actors - bringing the writing to life.
