To be quite honest, I didn't expect much to go into 9 Souls, even after reading the hope of praise, but to say I would be surprised would be a great understatement. In short, I was completely blown away. <Br /> <br /> The basic plot is as simple as they come, nine prison prisoners ranging from a drug exploiter to several killers' escape from jail and looking for a secret stash that is supposed to be forged money that is hidden by a tenth. cracked prisoners and dragged by guards shortly before their escape, but this is the direction director Toshiaki Toyoda takes this simple story which is so brilliant and originally perfect for blending drama, comedy and violence, that creates a real one what needs to be earned. Not only fans of Asian cinema, but theater in general. <br /> <br /> Outstanding, emotional, funny, violent and sometimes very surreal. It's a movie that has everything.
