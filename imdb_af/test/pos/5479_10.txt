It's a wonderfully crafted Washington thriller directed by talented Wolfgang Petersen with writer Jeff Maguire (who has done very little over the years, so maybe he tends to make his roses). The movie has Clint Eastwood as an obsolete secret service agent and John Malkovich as a vengeful assassin beaten to each other in a massive test of wills and ingenuity where the president's life is at stake. Unnecessary secrecy and competition between rival security agencies kills the President, who is a real touch. This film was made when both Eastwood and Malkovich were at their peak. Eastwood has probably never done a better job than he did here, and it's so easy for the old pro. There are some amazing sound effects from him who are hounding and puffing as he walks alongside the President's car as bodyguard, for which he is too old. I wonder if anyone else noticed the humor of the sounds that were added. My 'guardian angel', whose name is Vigil, enjoyed this movie even more than I did, but bodyguards are very much his thing. Rene Russo was a perfect choice for the female agent who fell for Eastwood, because she is so unobtrusive, but so talented, and she shines. The tension is solid every inch of the road in this story, and Eastwood's psychological struggle to free himself from an earlier failure of protection is beautifully demonstrated by his typical under-estimate. With Eastwood, if he lifts an eyebrow with a millimeter, watch! Of course he is the master of the super-cool. Malkovich has the opportunity to enjoy all the creepiness he could wish for in the paranoid character he portrays, and he takes the man's central vanity to perfection. What a good one.
