In short, it is the best-ever TV comedy series ever. Each of them is a first-hand actor. I only know one TV series that was better (ie "Moonlighting")? The one had Willis as a lead? Yet it has Willis, while The King of Queens has a lot of actors that are as good as they can enjoy. Kevin James, Leah Remini, Jerry Stiller, Patton Oswalt, Nicole Sullivan, Victor Williams, Gary Valentine, and even the rest of them. I spontaneously and continuously and immediately liked it. The age group didn't spoil the fun anyway. <br /> <br /> In a few words, the series is intelligent and original, splendidly saved from current TV stupidity and garbage. It is politically wrong and does not put the minorities in the usual horrible way. <br /> <br /> The cartoon is very tasty and savory. <br /> <br /> I read a few IMDb authors, mostly approving, and sometimes they write about their favorite shows, although these are several, I have not experienced, at any of them, the slightest mention of me favorite TV shows (- but it is true that critics do not like those with whom he is in full approval, but those who at least have a common ground for disapproval)? What is mainly, WILL WILD WEST, MOONLIGHTING, QUEENS, FANTOMAS, the 80's TWILIGHT ZONE, Bradbury's TV show and SANDOKAN. Most of them I saw when I was 13? 14 yrs; About some of them I wrote, and I did.
