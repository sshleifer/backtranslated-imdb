The two main characters Erkan and Stefan are a municipal comedy act. I wondered if this is one of those typical slapstick movies where the story isn't important or simply doesn't exist. But when I saw this movie, I was very happy that there is a cool story and the main characters really fit in it. <br /> <br /> All in all, it is amusing and not an ordinary German movie.
