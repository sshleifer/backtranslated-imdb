Hoot was great. The owls are rich and the film shows an interesting environmental issue I didn't know. Florida is full of so many fun characters and the movie does a great job of bringing it to the screen. My kids loved all the different animals, from snakes, to owls to alligators. This is really a simple story, but also one that they should hear at this age. When children are young, it's when they really develop their values, and yes, one of them needs to care about our environment and all the creatures that live in it. I think it was great that the movie even made a conversation with them on the ride home about animals and how to help them. It was just really sweet and lasting to hear my girl talk about how she wanted to save the baby birds. Anyway, it was really a good time and I would recommend the movie to anyone looking for something entertaining and meaningful.
