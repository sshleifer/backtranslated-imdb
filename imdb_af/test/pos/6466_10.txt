This is one of Cassavetes' best achievements. The whole cast is excellent, just like Martin Ritt's sublime underrated direction. The anger, anxiety, and separation of urban labor camps are splendidly told in a way that is not intrusive or condescending. In a way it is dated with its era, but in many ways it is glorious timeless.
