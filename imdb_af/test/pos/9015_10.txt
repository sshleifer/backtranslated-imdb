I had the privilege of attending a local premiere. It's one of the funniest British movies ever. The plot is fantastic and focuses on a young girl who unknowingly turns into her ideal man at a computer show. of herself, in love with him, the film is full of jokes, both visual and audible, and has a bright and fresh feel to it, and the play is of good quality, released in the UK on July 2. This movie is a must, see it !!!
