Recovery is an incredibly moving piece of work that handles the devastating effects of brain injury on not only the individual but the whole family. Without preaching or ending Hollywood soberly, Tony Marchant's drama offers a family in crisis in a realistic way. <br /> <br /> High praise goes to David Tennant and Sarah Parish for their incredible performances. I suspected before I watched the drama that I would see their previous screen relationship in Blackpool, but that never happened. No actor is recognizable from any previous work, and I have not seen any of them as an actor who plays a role in the 90 minutes. In addition, Harry Treadaway's performance as the only boy who knew about his own university life was fantastic. He shows the torn nature of a teenager in the reluctant role of husband of the house. > <br /> Sometimes, almost every character in the play is impractical. As a viewer, I wanted to give each one a good chance of waking up, stopping, and adapting to the rotten, but very current, change in their lives. But under the same circumstances, I see myself as any of them. It varies between trying to show the stiff upper lip to despair to escape something, including behavior that is completely different to me. It is the greatest power of the show - truth, without sugar cover, to force us all to think what we can do under the same circumstances. <br /> <br /> It's a tough but must-see show. I hope this can somehow be shown in the US.
