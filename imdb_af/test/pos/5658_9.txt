In World War II in the Philippines, hungry Japanese soldiers die, grow poorly and become increasingly insane. A small group of soldiers trying to stay alive eventually turned to cannibalism. This film portrays the insanity that overtakes people under extreme circumstances. There are some humorous parts in this movie, but the majority of them are just a very slow moving and realistic movie. It follows these soldiers from one painful moment to another, and eventually to death. A very interesting movie showing death and horror, of what could be the worst war ever seen by the world.
