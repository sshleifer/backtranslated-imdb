I couldn't help enjoying the whole premise of CAT in the brain, as it made a decisive statement that a director is constantly angry, as people were murdered from previous films he made. Even everyday activities, such as cooking a meal in the microwave or drinking a tap, deliver a horrible butchery from a movie in the past. Director Fulci plays himself, leads GHOSTS OR SODOM (?) And does not seem to be deprived of his spiritual well-being of constant murder. He's looking for help from a psychiatrist who instead uses Fulci's work as a method to execute a series of innocent people, who hypnotize the director to think he might be responsible. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's a fun movie. at Fulci's image, while the themes are exploring how such a profession, which causes so much death and destruction, seldom can form and form a legacy. The film features a wrap-around story that includes non-stop graphic violence, with all sorts of ways to kill a woman who is spooky in detail. It has a murder. Hitchcock can never or directly want to. The film's cruelty complements Fulci's intellectual state's Fulci (..). Reality and film fiction have merged and Fulci cannot find escape. The end (.. the old clich√© explains: "It's just a movie") can't work better than it does here. Fulci's boat says Perversion (.. excellent touch) and he sails off. I can only wish it was his final movie because it is a perfect ending if ever there was one. David L Thompson is the confused psychiatrist who plans to kill his adulterous wife. Jeoffrey Kennedy is a cop. Fulci fears had a family murdered by the enemy. <br /> <br /> The ultra-violence in the movie has many unique ways to take off a head like the door to a chest, a crook, a chain saw and hatchback. The most brutal violence is the result of nasty chain saw activity when a dead body is crushed. (How a gardener's chain saw works on a logbook fits beautifully into one nightmare hallucination sequence). The most shocking use of a chain saw is when a little boy is beheaded! The opening scene with the puppet cat eating at Fulci's brain is a pit. The screens split into the movie, with a horrible Fulci look, are obvious, but I couldn't help it, but anyway, enjoy it.
