I saw this movie just a quarter of a century ago, but the impact never left me and I can still remember, even now, my reactions to it. I was fascinated by the breadth and the sheer beauty of so much of photography. I was surprised that an American studio could produce such a European movie with its slow pace and its unfocused plot. The lack of strong characters felt like a mistake, but I was raging on the completely unnecessary end of the yacht which seemed to be tied up to give some kind of conspiracy and was totally in conflict with the style of the rest of the picture.It was also refreshing to see a western who made no incident about the brutality and exploitation so often the unfortunate dislike of the American Dream. The western scenes and sets also had a authenticity that was completely new to me and the recent Deadwood series. The film was massively cut for the American audience and it is my very real wish that Michael Cimino in these days of director's cuts will have the opportunity to give a fresh change in the light of reflection - a cut that can make it sick filmed film in the masterpiece that had the potential to become. I've seen the original first track now and the network of relationships makes so much sense, though Christopher Walken is primarily responsible for its implementation. If only De Niro and not Kris Kristofferson played the lead, there was another massive concern to create reality and atmosphere to the detriment of good writing. Nonetheless, the camera worked so cleverly that sometimes you could almost believe that you were in the action yourself. And there were very special moments. Everyone who fights in the hall in different languages ​​trying to overcome their national differences and facing a unity of action in the face of the imminent disaster has given a good insight into the problems that the US is joining: especially when threat from a combination of the old elite and money. Nate's false approach to Ella when she first visited his cabin was in stark contrast to the violence that had to be followed and another. I had a special show with a large group of friends to watch the new track, and we all enjoyed it while they had varying discussions. This revisionist and much closer to the truth version of events was probably too much for Americans to take when the film was first. released, but we all felt that it had a tremendous merit and that his place in film history was also due to a great review
