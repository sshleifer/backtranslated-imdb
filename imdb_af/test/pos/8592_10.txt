When it comes to political movies, I usually come out empty. They usually take some moralistic stance and you have a clear good versus bad story line as if it were a kind of Batman movie. <br /> <br /> But with Lumumba, it's the first movie I've seen that showed politics. for what it is and the real issues to try to rule a country of broken people who know no other rule than violence. There was no good or bad, there were only interests and conflicts of interest. It is the only political film in my opinion that one can come to learn something. Especially for anyone with a view to politics as a career, this movie shows you, you can't rule what you want for a country, but what the country wants of you. <br /> <br /> Therefore, I totally disagree Some of the reviews that all say are bad, I think they are too idealistic. (The Belgians want the perfect colony. Lumumba wants a perfect Unity Congo. Tshombe wants wealth and wealth. America wants to be the perfect ally against communism. Russia wants the perfect aide for communism). And the Congolese? They come down and get abused. (Best example in the movie when General Janssens tells his black troops what your government lied to you and left it all in a riot). They are always drawn and pushed to support this person or another. /> <br /> This movie shows in politics a mistake can make your precious food and this movie all make mistakes to the mistake until it escalates and eventually destroys the land. Their intentions can be good (or at least in the characters' opinion), but these are everyone's mistakes leading to the demise of the Congo. I don't think anyone is bad in this movie, I just think they want too much from people who are sick to give and want to start. <br /> Overall, this is not just the best political film, it's a big movie in general. Acting is fabulous (Eriq Ebouaney as Lumumba was perfect casting, I really believe him). Script error is perfect, perfect tempo processing, and production value higher than I expected for a central African film. Have a look.
