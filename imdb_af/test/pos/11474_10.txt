It's fantastic! A sick and twisted story of coincidence and fraud. <br /> <br /> The story was built carefully and ingeniously. It's really a perfect mix: it has everything from excitement to humor and the story is told with a lot of originality ... The movie is built up like a puzzle that is set up one by one and solves the story. For the viewer there are many surprises to the end !! I also thought the director was inspired by some Hitchcock work. I also watched movies where you see the same event from different points of view, but this movie goes beyond that. In this movie, everything is built on what happens to a body that appears and disappears and appears again elsewhere. Every actor in the story has his own secret and we realize it in a way that contributes to the composition of the puzzle .... I especially loved the dark humor scenes ... that laughed the whole theater ... This movie is a must see for everyone!
