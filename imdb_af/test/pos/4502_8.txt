I didn't read the novel based on "The Kite Runner". My wife and daughter, who did, thought the movie had come a long way from the book and I was willing to take their word for it. But on its own the movie is good - not good, but good. How accurately does it describe the devastation created by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan? How convincingly does this show the intolerant Taliban regime that followed? I'll rate it C + on the first and B + on the second. The human story, the African-American who has returned to the country to save the son of his childhood, has been well done, but it is especially true that I am told that the book is far more convincing than the film. The most exciting part of the movie, however - the kite games in Kabul and later a mini-game in California - cannot be matched by the book. I want to put money in it.
