I watched this 1997 movie because I am a fan of Lorenzo Lamas (and of his father, then Fernando Lamas). According to me, Lorenzo chose his best in this movie, mainly because of his hairstyle and the preppy wardrobe that was flattering to him. <br /> <br /> As the plot progressed, I realized the movie was more than just entertainment or a reason to watch a favorite actor. The story was about a series of serial killers and the efforts of law enforcement to investigate the ring and bring the members. There was enough tension, and I believe the violence was needed to relate the story to the viewer. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I was shocked to learn that the movie is the true version of horrible murders that occurred in Utah. Furthermore, Lorenzo and his leading wife portrayed the real FBI agents who resolved the disappearance of many young women and contributed to the fear of the ring. I believe the movie is worth it as it informs the public about the dangers and abilities of the criminal element.
