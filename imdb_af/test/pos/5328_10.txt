I look at the external reviews (Ebert, etc.) for this movie and they were all pretty negative. But after reading many of them, I noticed that they all made the same point. Critics were upset that the film was centered around what seemed to be a senseless murder of an autistic child. Certainly, this is a disturbing image. Critics like Ebert want a traditional detective story to discover why the murder took place and to place the convictions in the right place. They want the debt to be thrown and solved. Well, that status quo theme is kind of what the movie parodies. Like society, the critics wanted a very quick resolution so they could continue with their next tragic opera. Perhaps there is no simple question to be answered here? There is much more to happen than what is on the surface. The film doesn't try to rationalize what's happening, but understand why. What so much about this unbeaten review is that everything they see in the march of performances is Spacey and Cheadle, which are both big (and general). But there are other great performances at work here, except just the two current icons of Hollywood. Gosling gives an unbelievable performance that can really deliver just one of his ultimate talent. Somehow, Gosling can make the killer of an autistic child sympathetic. It irritates a lot, I'm sure. But if you watch the movie, they see what Leeland's motivation is, it's wrong, but it's not angry. Malone is also on top of her game as another confused young character. The death of the child in this movie is basically not the main theme of the movie. The main theme is life itself and how people are going to handle it, the highlights and the lows, and how they sometimes try to help others handle their lives (which do not work well). There is a lot of good and bad in this world and how we handle each one has a direct impact on how much more good and bad will happen, and sometimes a confused attempt to do well can lead to a whole lot more bad. I think this is one of the more memorable movies in somewhere and has an end to something just like in recent movie history. I believe strong people should see this movie, with an open mind.
