Alice enters a world of wonder ... but not the kind of wonder you remember as a child. The Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the Queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice a few things about her body - and other people's bodies - which can be quite wonderful. A story of love and desire, as you have never seen. <br /> <br /> Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I have to say, according to the standards of 1970, it could be the most beautiful adult actress of her day. I believe it is her only movie before she goes to the mainstream, but it was pretty much the best one she could choose. (My love for Alice is no secret). Even better than "Fairy Tales" (which is not really pornography, so much). <br /> <br /> The songs are cheesy, but fit the theme of the movie. One song, "What is a girl like you doing on a knight like this?" was pretty funny, and the others had similar themes. The trial to the end was well written and fit very well into Alice's world. The logic and humor are definitely justified. <br /> <br /> What more could you say about a movie like this? All I know is, for people who are accustomed to adult movies where it is just a 30-second introduction to the generation, this one will overload you with plot and music. But personally I think there's something very special about this movie and I hope it gets a nice DVD release with touches and special features (if even possible). I can see it's a cult film.
