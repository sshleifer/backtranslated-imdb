One of the most entertaining of all quiet comedies is Pudovkin's short 'Chess Fever', a crazy story of how a rigorous intellectual board game can disrupt even the most meticulously planned central economies. Such an indescribable comic box as chess earlier found an outlet in this wonderful short. Two young men play the game seriously against an artificial background, a painted set. This is in contrast to earlier Lumiere pants such as 'L'Arrosseur Arrosse' or 'Repas du Bebe', in which human activity is deliberately framed by a natural environment. The difference in activities (of course = diet, water garden, artificial = chess) may be significant. <br /> <br /> The main contrast in this movie is between this immovable backdrop and the tranquil, tranquil play of chess, and the fiery passions caused by these latter as allegations of fraud lead to a very unworthy proximity. The intellectual game becomes a gross physical scrap, just as the pretensions of arty film makers are thriving forever through the 'everlasting' demands of the audience. <br /> <br /> What is most amusing about the movie is not necessarily this descent in slapstick. but the way it is filmed is long after the initial joke is extended; The way the camera refuses to defend the fight with anything like attention, rather focuses on the set, while we get catches to move feet and release clothes. The film's refusal to edit is mysterious, so the humor seems to be due to something other than the battle, which reflects our need for physical contact about intellectual stimulation, our reluctance to release. <br /> <br /> What is especially brilliant is the unbundling, as this top class fop is captured by the valet, which picks them up like two unashamed schoolgirls, as if they want to hit their ears. If masters are not expected to keep their place with decorum, if anyone has to do it for them.
