Looks like a vehicle for W.C. made. Fields and Carol Dempster and they dominate it. Fields has already developed its movie character well. Carol Dempster seems to dance through the movie and her acting reminds me of Mary Pickford, who also spent a long time under D.W. Griffith. Typically, later Griffith becomes technically technical. <br /> <br /> Later, as Poppy (the original title) played with Fields in the same role.
