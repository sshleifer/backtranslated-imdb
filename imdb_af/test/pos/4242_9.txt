Chucky (the murderous doll of "Child's Play" and 2 crappy persecutors) is dead. But his ex-girlfriend Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly) gets his remains and (using "Voodoo for Dummies") revives him. Then, by circumstances too heavy to come in, she is killed and her soul placed in another doll! Together they fall in love and deprive them of a beautiful couple (Nick Stabile, Katherine Heigl) to take them to Chuck's coffin to get an amulet to make Chucky and Tiffany real again. <br /> <br /> Much better than that sounds. After the last two successions to "Child's Play" (both were terrible), I was expecting the worst, but it was really fun. The movie doesn't take a second seriously (seriously - how can it?) And the lines and situations are pretty funny. Also there are some very gory killings thrown to meet horror fans and the movie never stops moving. The movie also has a few things that are not usually found in a horror movie - A gay girlfriend (Gordon Michael Woolvett) who is intelligent and not played for laughs and a sequence in which Stabile just shuts off his shirt. show his muscular body. John Ritter also has a nice cameo as a sheriff. <br /> <br /> The acting is good - Stable is young, VERY beautiful and nice; Heigl doesn't have much to do, but pulls it off and Brad Dourif (Chucky's voice) and Tilly are hilarious than the murderous doll. My favorite part is when the dolls have sex (don't ask) and she asks for a rubber and he responds, "But I'm made of rubber!" The special effects are good (no common CGI here) and it is one of the few horror movies to mix humor and violence in an entertaining way. Well worth seeing. I give it a 9.
