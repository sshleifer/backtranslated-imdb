It was an interesting movie. I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW! Other than that, I loved the scary music that turned this movie around. Chris / Izzy's parents are AWESOME! They support their children's interests completely and believe in him enough to support him - now it's AWESOME !! What really surprised me was the Chris's realization at the end. It was not quite the "Hollywood" ending on its way to self-discovery. The overall rise of the stars and its fall was quite a rollercoaster ride.
