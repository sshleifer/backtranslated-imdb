It is a beautiful film that finally balances the fragile human stories (both before and after 1945) and the indifferent war battle. The use of excerpts from Battle of Britain (a film that does not portray nearly as much from the 1940s) improves rather than detracts from the whole. A deeply impressive work, it's been in my memory for the 2 years since I saw it, and I just bought it to explore the extras. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie (movie). Like 'Aces High', it varies between visceral exciting (or scary) fighter sequences, where the viewer may experience real loss of characters they will care for, but also unpredictable ground-based interactions where skilled writers and real-life experiences inform some involvement and moving events. It also underlines the fact that for many people in 1945 not only the end of one conflict marked, but also the beginning of the other, and even today we still do not recognize the loss, courage and sacrifice of so many nameless heroes or even worse, they worsen from a distance without allowing them to be people with all the emotional weaknesses it entails - to make their sacrifices increasingly brave. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie is an experience that will love you from the heights of friendship to the depths of jealousy, and back to enduring even death. If all the war movies were like this, we would never have to fight again. <br /> <br /> Did I mention it's worth looking at? ;-) <br /> <br /> 10/10
