My response to this remake of "The Italian Job" is probably mixed up with the events that occurred in my life when I saw it; This is the first movie I've seen after having landed a job after 8 months of unemployment and going back to school for retraining. Money was still tight, but I no longer had to choose to watch a movie in the theaters and pay bills (or to eat lunch), and the feeling of relief and gratitude I felt at the time was enormous. . Consequently, my enjoyment of "Italian Job" was probably far from its real value. <br /> <br /> I used it on DVD a few weeks ago and watched it again, and I enjoyed it quite a lot. I have never seen the original (although I have heard it is an absolute classic), but its contemporary counterpart is just as glamorous if you have a taste for contemporary production values ​​applied to older movie stands and themes. <br /> <br /> What won me first at this movie was the soundtrack - IMO Don Davis writes some of the most supple, textured and aurally pleasurable soundtracks. IJ opens with a clever, witty, pulsating arrangement that combines strings, guitar harmonies, brushing and quiet moments - it has completely won me during the opening hours. And the whole movie is so - I didn't hear of this kind of sounding, chomping, sounding soundtrack music, as Stewart Copeland left the police and started making soundtracks for movies like "Rumble Fish". There are at least a dozen irresistible motifs here, along with some pop songs ranging from "everything right" to "inspired". For people whose soundtrack is important, this movie is a pleasure. <br /> <br /> On the movie: Mark Wahlberg I can leave or leave, but he is good here as the leading man, and the film doesn't ask him to do anything he can't do well. He is the worst "big" actor in the film, but that's because the rest of the supporting role is so strong, especially Donald Sutherland in a little bit. Mos Def, Jason Steadham, Ed Norton, Seth Green and Charlize Theron are all in solid, fat-free performances. Norton usually seems to call it. (Rumors have it that he didn't really want to be in the movie), but he is still a natural even at 1/2 power. My one issue with the decisive and acting is with the character "Wrench", which apparently is a male model pretending to be an actor. His part seems to be in the movie shoelace, and he has little chemistry with the rest of the movie (although you can give it a part of the size of the part and the 'run' of the character). If I were a cynical, I would wonder who slept the actor to be in such a superlative role in this movie. Nah, never happen ... <br /> <br /> Production values, camera work, stunts, plot ... everything cooks nicely together and Gray and his production crew pull things neatly (except the "Wrench") "character, see above). <br /> <br /> The dialogue has a nice, light touch that rewards your indulgence, and there are several satisfyingly large and small plot payments on the way. (My favorite moment - when Norton's character tells Wahlberg's character that he has just lost the element of surprise. Wahlberg goes to Norton's cold cock with a right cross and asks him, "Were you surprised?" Hmmm, maybe you should be there ...) <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie requires a certain level of "suspension of unbelief" to work, but if you just relax and go with it (and don't think too hard about the mechanics around) Cracking a safe underwater, or the likelihood that someone can successfully hack and manipulate LA traffic via a laptop, etc.) will have a fun ride. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job": it is lightweight summer fluff, but it is very good for what it is, and it tries nothing else. It's not good enough for an "8", but I'll give it a "7.5".
