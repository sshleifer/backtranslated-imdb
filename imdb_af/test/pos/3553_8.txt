Believe it or not, the Mona Lisa is actually stolen once and has been missing for almost two years. In 1911, Leonardo da Vinci's La Gioconda (better known as the Mona Lisa) was taken from the Louvre by a little (and former Louvre) employee. He allegedly tried to return the world's best-known piece of art to his own Italy. His behavior after the theft probably made him more likely to sell the painting for his personal profit. (Of course, he had no hope of finding a buyer.) The Mona Lisa was quietly returned to the Louvre on the last day of 1913, and since then, except for occasional lending. When "Arsène Lupine" was released in 1932 (twenty years after the theft), most role-players would have revoked that 1911 crime, and their knowledge would have given this film some degree of acceptance. "Arsène Lupine" is very enjoyable, with MGM's usual high production standards and Jack Conway's usual fast-paced direction. This movie has no pleasure; John Barrymore is the chief criminal of the title: he specializes in committing "impossible" crimes, which he makes even more difficult by announcing in advance ... but of course. he always commits the crime and misses the gendarmes. Tully Marshall has a good scene as one of Barrymore's victims. Lupine enjoys extensive disguise, enabling Barrymore (a US-grade A-ham) to enjoy his own love for tomfoolery. John's older brother Lionel Barrymore is Guerchard, the Javert-like Surete detective who swore to catch Lupine. <br /> <br /> Karen Morley was an extremely beautiful actress whose private life was full of populist political activities; On the screen she was impressive in working class roles that fitted her own political beliefs (like her good performance in 'Our Daily Bread'). In 'Arséne Lupine', Morley's natural dark hair is bleached, a hearing blonde tone, and she's all thrown into beautiful outfits that make her look uncomfortable as sexy. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS COME. Eventually Lupine decides to steal the Mona Lisa from the Louvre. He cut off the painting from his frame, rolled up the cloth and then smuggled it into a flower basket. We see that John Barrymore undoubtedly burns a piece of cloth, allegedly the greatest work of art in all human history. I had to laugh at the mistakes of the filmmakers. In real life (but not in this movie), Da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa on a plank of wood, such a thief has a hard time rolling it up! <br /> <br /> Eventually, Guerchard catches Lupine and takes it down to Le Calaboose. The scene between John and Lionel Barrymore in the police car is sheer joy, as their true love is flush with each other in their characters' dialogue. I would have found this scene impossible with any two other actors. As it is, I can't imagine, but the Barrymore brothers play these roles. Well, maybe Dennis and Randy Quaid, but just scarce. <br /> <br /> Don't look for a good plot line here, but "Arsène Lupine" is a great example of old-style movies. I'll rate this movie 8 points out of 10.
