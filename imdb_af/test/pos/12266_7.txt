Essential watching for anyone watching TV news can help to become a little more skeptical, or even cynical. On a personal note, a few years ago, I remember a TV interview interview - what to do, what not to do. The course instructors impressed us that TV news was a "show-biz" branch. That film's impression, which is even more valid today than when it was made, is reinforced by this film. Never be journalistic integrity, which counts the ability to look good and smile well. And make sure you don't sweat on camera. <br /> <br /> The interactions between the three main characters form the middle piece, each with its own ambitions, abilities and beliefs. Brooks takes these differences and puts them in the brief setting of a TV news studio, adding more than a pinch of love to the mix. The result is a complex, but somewhat exaggerated, depiction of how we compromise every day to meet our ambitions and take others with us. It is always entertaining, although the final scene may have been unnecessary that has given up before.
