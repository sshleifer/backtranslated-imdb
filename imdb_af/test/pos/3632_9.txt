Very enjoyable film, a great surprise to come from Brazil, a country that is usually exporting social themes, violence, sex ... magical realism, is a very difficult task and I believe that João Falcão made it wonderful has. It looks like he really wasn't going to make a realistic movie. Although many people think the movie has been adapted from the play, he said in his interviews that he was basically the movie on the book. Another mistake is thinking that Falcão was influenced by the series "Hoje é Dia De Maria". The TV series produced by Globo was made to the movie, but previously broadcast ... Unfortunately. <br /> <br /> The negative point is photography, by Walter Carvalho. It appears that he did not create or understand the Falcão concept. The story is fascinating and universal, despite being in a small town in Brazil. It can happen anywhere in the world. A big movie, I strongly recommend it.
