In "The Squire of Gothos" Kirk and his crew meet a powerful superhero, holding Captain, Bones and a few crew members in prison. I can be wrong, but I think it's the first Star Trek episode I've ever seen and the program that made me hungry for more. This is not one of the best episodes, but the prerequisite of a strange being that places the Enterprise crew in a corner is the kind of situation that makes the show so much fun to watch. In a way, the super-humanoid expects one of Star Trek's best-known characters, Next Generation's enigmatic "Q". This episode is also unforgettable for creating a unique situation: this is the first time Uhura is part of the action and the story allows the viewer to see how an engaging character can be Uhuara when the story allows her. Unfortunately, the show never fully investigated this iconic figure.
