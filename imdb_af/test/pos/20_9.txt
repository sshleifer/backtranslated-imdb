The many other comments about the movie all say it - just as we added we made it to about 30 at our Community Cinema last week, and it has an overall average score of 8.6. We would then recommend it 100% for today's audiences, especially if they can see it on a real bioscreen, and then it can talk to others, as we have heard. <br /> <br /> The sheer power of acting performances throughout the gang was incredible and quite spell binding. Of course, Finney and Courtenay were truly the stars. but everyone is well thrown well. For our afternoon audience, the majority of which is "senior citizens", the fact that the plot could be followed so comfortably because of the clarity of speech and the wonderful non-technological use of camera and sound was a big influence. <Br /> <br /> How beautifully many people have said to see a wonderful British movie: Britain: not yet dated twenty years: not filled with blood and intestines: not confusing because of bob over-all-the-place camera shots, and back and forth through time story lines: no healthy sex scenes. Such views have even been expressed by some younger.
