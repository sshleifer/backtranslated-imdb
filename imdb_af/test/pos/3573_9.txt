I actually went to see this movie with low expectations as it was the only one that suited my schedule. And unbelievably, I really found it original. I used to comment on other Colombian films, and I agree that Colombian movies tend to have a similar scheme, and always try to refer to the average vulgar people, especially to make jokes from the constant curse. But let's see, the language used in this movie is not excessively exaggerated. Unfortunately, this is how true people speak. The storyline and pacing is brilliant, and it can be exposed to any country in the world. The play was wonderful, and the script is one of the best ever produced in Colombian soil. I think anyone around the world can get a good one and a half entertainment, with a beautifully-directed bluff black humor comedy. It reminded me of movies like snatch, and others of that kind. I highly recommend it and hope it can be seen by more people, since Colombian movies have focused more internationally since last year.
