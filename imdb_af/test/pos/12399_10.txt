As a camera operator, I couldn't help the big picture that this photo got. The performances were excellent, just like the story. Just when I thought this movie was slowing down, it didn't. Heartbreaking excitement, a great ride through editing, and a score that knows when to stop, all come here under skilled and competent direction. The camera was always in the right place. Love it.
