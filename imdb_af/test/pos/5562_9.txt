After just borrowing the series a DVD collection from my somewhat obsessive brother, I expected to get the first few episodes and give it back. I just yelled at the screen to finish the first season on a wreath pendant - just a week later and I watched the whole season. Where I found the time for this, I have no idea. <br /> <br /> This show is great. It doesn't take too much, it has similarly well-behaved characters, and the special effects (to ignore the strange sticky puppet here and there) are "special" enough to polish it. Initially I didn't realize it was mostly filmed here, and it was strange to hear so much Aussie accent on a science show. It was the most amusing for the main character (John) to land halfway in Sydney. first season. <br /> <br /> I believe this show's greatest strength is the vision the creators of the show naturally have. They gradually introduced new aspects of the characters that explained previous actions, and John's talks with snake remain in an amusing and unmatched way. In addition, I watched the entire Voyager and Next Gen series, and I see a small plot rip-off. It kept a sense of originality throughout the first season. I hope the rest is so good. <br /> <br /> Farscape is not like any other Sci-Fi I've enjoyed in the past. I heard that the fourth season was not as good as the first three, and I am now very annoyed that they canceled it before the 5th. I hope they relive this show - with the same actors in a movie or other series. It will be a pity that so many plot lines are unfinished, as I think that with a so much thought to catch up with it, without getting enough warning, I will be robbed. <br /> <br /> Gotta go now ... back to my brother's place to hit the 2nd season. <br /> <br />
