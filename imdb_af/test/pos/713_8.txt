An interesting and relevant film about an "army" just trying to live out his days quietly. Elements of the main character appear in Michael Mann's later films, such as Thief (1981), Heat (1995), and so on. You can see this one at the UCLA teaching media laboratory - one of the only places in the country that makes copies available to the public. It's a wonderful one!
