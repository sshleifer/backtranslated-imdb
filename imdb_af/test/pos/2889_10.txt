These guys are excellent and everything they bring to the public is first class. The musical of this group is wonderful and we must all be very grateful, we live in a world where Rush exists. Future generations will never live such a mastery and see in person. Get this DVD and you'll enjoy it! I was recently able to see these amazing musicians playing in Houston, TX and being blown away. I haven't missed a show since power windows and I have to say they're better than ever. Everyone must embrace these guys and teach others what the right musicality is! There will never be such a tight and well-composed trio in our lifetime. Let's hope and just pray that they will not retire soon!
