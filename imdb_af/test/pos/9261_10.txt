Murder: The film was a great pack for a well-written, well-directed and well-directed series. Loose points were tied that were not properly addressed at the end of the final season. The whole series, and especially the film, gave a lifelike look at life (and death) in Baltimore, a culturally unique city with a very high murder rate. My attraction for the series long before I moved to Baltimore, but when I experienced life here for myself, I realized how realistic it was. And the movie definitely kept that spirit. I will certainly miss out on new original episodes of the series, but I am very grateful to NBC and the producers and give us a lasting look at the dark side of Charm City.
