Watch this movie, I can't help drawing the Wildlife Game Comparison, another thoughtful movie about teens coming from age. <br /> <br /> Like Wild Already, this movie is slow and the director won't be in a hurry. . So if you want a quick fix for things, don't see it. This movie is like a part of life, beginning imperfect and ending imperfectly. There is no solution to anything, not happy ever for everyone, just like real life. <br /> <br /> This movie is as much as it gets. The acting is surprisingly good. The director likes long, very long shots and performs actors and actresses to show subtle and inner thoughts. <br /> <br /> I love this movie. I almost didn't look at it, but now I'm very glad I did. It's not a movie for everyone, but if you're willing to grow it on you, you'll be rewarded. <br /> <br /> 10/10
