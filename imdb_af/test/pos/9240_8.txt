I must also apologize for a somewhat biased opinion of this endeavor as I contributed to the soundtrack. Yet I got my copy, stood back and enjoyed the role-play of characters that might be more colorful than the characters they made in this story of a movie sequel to Shanghai. For those who feel George Bush is a "credible Texan," one should not look beyond this film to destroy the image that Texas is full of trucking, one-dimensional rednecks. The movie features some of the most intelligent, peculiar and humorous people you will find everywhere, turning their stories of sadness, bliss and disappointment to go for a good movie sequel, no budget, guerrilla style (ie "punk rock styles" if every person helps to define). <br /> <br /> This is a great documentary manufacturer with passion and guts and all the poison you will have to break through to the other side of any industry and doubles you are dealing with (note writers, painters, musicians and co-filmmakers). It listens to the credibility of the first wave of American hardcore music when the term "D.I.Y." was the standard, a period in which courage, passion and dedication are used much more than technique, style or precious calculations. Not that there isn't enough technique or style for this ... the tone of the documentary is pretty refreshing. The editing cuts provide as much drama as the dialogue in it. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​creating a documentary from the sad downfall of the former cast, crew and director's initial intent is brilliant, totally Texas and absolutely punk rock. In the true sense of the term.
