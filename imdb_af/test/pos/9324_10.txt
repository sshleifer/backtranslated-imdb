For those who are too young to remember, or too old to be part of the "hype", the Michael Jackson dress in the early to mid-80s was at a chorus height - like the hype about Titanic, except it just didn't get up. Every song, every video, every word spoken by Michael was important. Nothing like it has been seen since the Beatles peak. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing this video for the first time at a roller-skating rink. Everyone stopped skating. There was no doubt you were a Michael Jackson fan or not; you were. Everybody bumped around the projection screen and watched the video ... <br /> <br /> It's probably one of the longest music videos ever made, and definitely the best. It always gets # 2 on the annual MTV top 100 videos (# 1 is always the taste of the month, and somehow, whatever was # 1 of all time, is past # 2, to make room for the new # 1 figure., and Thriller has become a phenomenon in itself. <br /> <br /> If you ever get the chance, watch the video. not just the excerpts shown on MTV or VH1. If necessary, look out for a Thriller at a video rental shop. Hey ... your parents made sure you watched the Beatles and Woodstock footage, because "it was important". Well, it's also important.
