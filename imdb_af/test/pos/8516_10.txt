There are many similarities between Never Say Never Again and Thunderball not only on Sean Connery, but also the story and plot. except the actors all are the same as hijacking atomic bombs, asking for ransom, trading in nukes in a ship, etc. Only difference is place of incident in thunderball plot. It's in the Bahamas. Never say Never Again it is about North Africa. And in the thunderbolt, the NATO / RAF itself loads the nukes into the plane and in Never Say Never Again it is being changed by a "raw arm of the ax" and the air stolen across the US and stolen in the Caribbean. Almost 99% are the same. If anyone wants to contest it, they are most welcome.
