it is incredible !!! There is no partnership like Errol and Olivia. there is love really! I'm 24, but this movie is so fascinating, because I'm sure it was 60 years ago. Raoul Walsh is a subordinate genius, his direction is so cattle, so wide, yet so intimate. The last scene between Colonel Custer (Flynn) and his wife (de Havilland) almost brought me to tears (Not easy for a 24-year-old guy!), It's so heartbreaking. There is also a deep Christian message, implicitly here. Faith, Custer, has glorified you and your wife's trust and faithfulness to the extent that he allows him to fulfill his moral duty to protect the innocent. civilians of certain massacres. There is no movie dealing with these issues. a must-see for anyone who wants to look at this crucial moment in American and military history from within. patriotic, for all the right reasons. I knew Errol Flynn was a star, and De Havilland was a screen legend - it just confirmed my suspicions that they were among the biggest!
