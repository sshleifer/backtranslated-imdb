I came from 'Extradition' with a list of bugs a mile long, so how is it that my overall impression is that it was a nice, fine movie? It's definitely a movie whose sum is better than its parts. <br /> <br /> Those parts include a movie by big name stars, none of them giving a memorable performance (Omar Metwally, a family member unknown, is the one you will remember); usable as unintelligible direction; and a script that is too complex and too simplistic at the same time. Metwally is an Egyptian-born American citizen kidnapped by the US government's extradition program, otherwise known as the process by which America suspects terrorists to confess information whether it is remotely wrong. Reese Witherspoon plays his pregnant wife, who, in favor of an old college friend (Peter Saarsgard), who works for a senator (Alan Arkin), helps to trace her husband. Meryl Streep plays the show program; Jake Gyllenhaal is a young agent assigned to the interrogation and whose conscience gets in the way. Meanwhile, a very parallel story follows the daughter of a top Egyptian official linked to the American extradition program and her boyfriend, who is training to become a suicide bomber. <br /> <br /> Ay-yi-yi is a lot of plot to pack in a two-hour movie, and I was about to wash my hands with the whole thing, especially the Egyptian Romeo and Juliet subplot that felt nothing more than a distraction. But then in the final of the movie, a twist brings all the plot strings together so that it reconsider everything you thought about the motivation of the different characters, and make "Rendition" a much more interesting movie as if it seems it is going be. <br /> <br /> Metspoon, Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard all look like high school students who play adults who are twenty years older than they actually are - especially Gyllenhaal, usually a good actor, looks so bored that you wonder if he is the energy will collect to deliver its lines. And the screenplay writer has to be arrested for having an actress as good as Meryl Streep at his disposal and nothing more than that one-dimensional dragonfly. The course of the course strives for relevance, but instead of addressing the intricate web of arguments surrounding the national security problem, it is predictably right in the middle of the debate. There are moments when you think maybe the film will break into an interesting direction - as if Witherspoon actually started to doubt her husband's past? What if Metwally was actually in contact with terrorists, as she accused interrogators? But no, the film takes the path of least resistance. <br /> <br /> But as I said before, I recommend this movie. I know I didn't do anything, but called a lot of his mistakes, but it has its head in the right place, and it's entertaining, or at least as entertaining as a movie about torture and interrogation. <br /> <br /> Degree: B +
