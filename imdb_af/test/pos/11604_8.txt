I've bought the DVD for a long time and finally got to watch it. I really enjoyed watching this movie because you don't get to see many of the more serious, better quality bollywood movies like this. Very well done and but I want to say you should pay attention to what's going on, as it's easy to get lost. If you start watching the movie, do nothing else! I would actually recommend reading all the reviews here ... including those with spoilers before watching the movie. Raima Sen gave her the first big show I saw. Aishwarya was easily at her best. All performances were strong, director and cinematography ... going to watch!
