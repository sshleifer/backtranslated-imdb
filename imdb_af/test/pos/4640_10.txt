Still funny after all these years. Midnight Madness is great fun for all ages. This sets Michael J Fox a typical 15-year-old problem maker. Melio and Blaylak are by far the funniest characters in it, and Leon is perfectly cast as a game maker. The nascent romance between Adam and the girl couldn't have been nicer. Fagabeefe !!!!
