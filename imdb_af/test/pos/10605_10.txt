The movie Haggard is one of the funniest movies of all time. It features the CKY film and also has a BIG soundtrack. If you saw any CKY or Viva La Bam, you'll see that everyone (of those two) is in it. Including Bam's parents and many other people. <br /> <br /> The story is about Ryan Dunn's girlfriend, Glauren (Jennifer Rivall), who cheats on him and tries to get him back. He did this by vandalizing Valo (Bam) and Falcone (Dicamillo). There are many different characters with many different stories. <br /> <br /> There is good music on the soundtrack. Ties like him and her, CKY, Gnar Kill, Daniel Lioneye. Iggy and the Stooges Pop, and New Order. <br /> <br /> If you don't like Viva La Bam or CKY (the movies), I doubt you will. If you do like those things ... this movie is great.
