As you can see, I loved the book so much. I use the title for my internet alias and have been for over 15 years. (Okay, so it must be phonetically spelled to fit the name-character limit for the BBS at the moment, but what can I do?) If anyone each finds this movie, I'd love to see it! Janet McTeer is wonderful in everything I saw about her. I think she would have made a wonderful Prue. And it even includes early Clive Owen - from before Chancer (a huge series by itself). What is not to love? I hope the powers are great and make it available to DVD soon! With some of the true baggers drying them out, it's time for well-executed productions to bring it to market.
