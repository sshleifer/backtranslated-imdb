It is a wonderful thriller that I have watched many times and never get enough of. It's all about obsessive love. 5 people have each other in Paris, (un) happy coincidences, false identities. The music makes it really gripping. There are hardly any mistakes in the characters, but the end is not very credible, but a definite "must-see" still exists.
