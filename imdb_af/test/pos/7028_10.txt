For the first time I saw this movie with my fiance, many years after it came out. I thought I would hate it, but to my surprise it is so cute that it is wonderful. We have spent many hours sharing the movie ("Sylvia? Yes Mickey?" Or "I'm sorry to see the baby. Sometimes in this world we see things we don't want."). My finances crack every time I follow Neil. The music is also classic and fun to sing together, especially on road trips. Of course I don't admit it to my male friends. It's like a guilty pleasure. I watch Dirty Dancing once a month or more and it's just as good every time. Jennifer Gray is also so cute in this movie. It's too bad to take her career.
