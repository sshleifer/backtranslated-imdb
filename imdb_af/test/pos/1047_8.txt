A magazine columnist who writes about life on her farmhouse must in fact set up a plan when she finds out that her publisher and a war hero will spend Christmas with her. After a slow start, it becomes an entertaining screw ball comedy, thanks to a fine cast. In a major departure from her previous role as a femme fatale in "Double Indemnity", Stanwyck shows a nice comic flair. Morgan is smooth as the pleasant war hero, while Greenstreet is well-developed as the publisher. Sakall, however, steals the movie as a chef who tries to master the English language while speaking with an almost incomprehensible European accent.
