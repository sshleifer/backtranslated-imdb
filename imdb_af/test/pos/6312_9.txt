This is a very visual film. By that I mean that the dialogue is sparse, almost to the point of being a silent movie for some very long tasks, starting with the opening shot. <br /> <br /> However, the silences are broken by a beautiful sound. trace ranging from discord, staccato to a ghost mix of violets, and ranges from chorus that looks like dreams. It is a feast for the ears as much as for the eyes, one of the early sculptors is a man walking along a street, so busy with his interest in a beautiful woman, that he walks in a lamppost: one of the effects of love and a metaphor for what's in store ... <br /> <br /> A long time ago, another movie ?? Love Story (1970) - said that love never has to say you're sorry. This narrative turns the idea upside down in a number of ways, starting with the main character, Titta (Toni Sevillo), a seemingly innocent long-term resident in a soft hotel somewhere in Switzerland. Every day, week in, week out, he sits at the same coffee table, enjoys the passing world, his cigarettes, his coffee, his loneliness ?? and he has been doing it for ten years. He sits and watches, and once a week he participates in three very surprising activities that you will find out about when you see this little masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Love is explored in a different way, in direct opposition to Titta's loneliness and reserved nature: two older residents of the hotel are still in love, but the man wants in a spectacular way dies when she comes, while his long-suffering wife boasts to cheat on cards with the other guests, one of whom is Titta. Now, Titta knows about their crickets, their love, the man's deception, his excuses for his wife and his groan. How? In a surprising and black-comedian way ... one of those surprise activities I mentioned. <br /> <br /> But it's not a comedy, in fact, though it is the idea of ​​human comedy in a Balzacic sense: the irony of life and what to do with it. That decision was made ten years before Titta left his wife and started living in the hotel. He keeps from time to time and it is clear that he still loves his children (now grown up) and the sadness in his voice talking volumes. But there is nothing more than sadness. <br /> <br /> Of course, such a life as Titta's looks quite boring, and it is actually from many perspectives. It is only when we learn what lies beneath his almost mortal appearance, that the horror of his situation touches the viewer. But not before we know that female bartender, Sofia (Olivia Magnani), is very interested in Titta, and goes out for her pique Titta's interest in her. <br /> <br /> And as soon as things start unraveling for Titta: finally he gives her femininity and again discovers the effects of love. Ironically, he finally realized what he would eventually do with his life and in the most spectacular way. <br /> <br /> I know that all of the above are somewhat cryptic; But to say more, the movie and story would spoil you. If you like Italian theater? I love it! ?? I encourage you to see this one. The acting is wonderful; the soundtrack cold the spine; the camera work is truly innovative; the direction shows the maturity of a true artist. <br /> <br /> I know I'll see this movie again, and again ...
