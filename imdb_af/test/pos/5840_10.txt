Tom Fontana's memorable "Oz" is one of the greatest television series ever created. Brilliantly written, performed and directed it is so close to perfection in any art form (film, television, literature, music) as it gets. In order to encourage this in extreme cruelty, a prison world is filled with different characters ranging from compassionate to terrified. It's a show that doesn't matter how brutal it is, one can't take its eyes off. The combination of professionally trained theater actors with films and television actors caters to a variety of diverse and all original performances. <br /> <br /> And while the show is widely acclaimed and has a loyal fan base, one cannot feel that it is undervalued during its television program due to other HBO dramas such as "The Sopranos", "Sex and The City "a" Six Feet Under ". And while all the performances are fine and borderline in their right hand, many people forget that it was "Oz" that was HBO's first entry into one-hour television drama series. It was a brave, risky first entry and with that HBO hit a big slam with it. It's as good as it gets.
