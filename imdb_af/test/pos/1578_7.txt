Kazuo Komizu returns with "Entrails of a Beautiful Woman", the successor of "Entrails of a Virgin". This time the story is based on a psychologist (Megumi Ozawa) who decides to accept the Yakuza to avenge the suicide of a baptized and raped patient who comes to her doorstep one day. When she gets over her head and catches the Yakuza, she teaches their treacherous flat of doping girls and sells them in slavery. This is obviously bad when overdoing the cocaine. But does she report to another body soon to be disposed of? Stupid, stupid, stupid? "Super Slime Hermaphrodite Zord"! That's it, it makes meat out of the yakuza and doesn't really save the day. <br /> <br /> Well, it's better than "Entrails of a Virgin", but not much. Most of the movie (67 minutes) consists of rape and sex with failure and the usual ho-hum stuff. Almost in the end we eventually get our gore groove up with a few cool sequences (like an Alien-inspired penis sample through the stomach scene and a sturdy suffocation), but it still suffers from a hyper low budget. make fun, but can not increase it from z-grade soft horror-core rate.
