"The Couch Trip" is one of those stupid comedies they wiped out in the 80's. In this case, Dan Aykroyd plays a mental patient who acts as a psychiatrist, and he goes to Beverly Hills to share Charles Grodin. Most of the movie's humor jumps out of their satirical look at Beverly Hills and people's empty life is there (a woman has a power struggle with her maid). <br /> <br /> This is the kind of movie you just watch for a good time. Don't expect any kind of religious experience. But you'll probably laugh a lot about how the Beverly Hills people swap their wealth. Also with Walter Matthau, Donna Dixon, Arye Gross and Victoria Jackson (from "UHF").
