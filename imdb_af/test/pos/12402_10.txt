I just watched the DVD version of BORN BAD and found that it was tense, angry and near the end, too graphic for the dull of the heart. Justin Walker (Clueless) and Corey Feldman are in superior performances. For a low budget movie, deliver this photo. The depth of character and smart dialogue are two things not usually seen in a Roger Corman picture. Check it out on DVD!
