Beautiful movie set in 1962 Hong Kong about a man (Mr Chow) and wife (Mrs Chan), who become good friends when they suspect their spouses have a relationship. Stylistically, the film is also beautiful. Wong Kar-Wai uses a lot of slow motion and close-ups on parts of the body (feet, hands, waist). The film itself has a reticence and properness that represents its time period. It's sexy without showing everything. Wong Kar-Wai also does not allow the audience to see what the wife looks like, indicating that Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan should be together. Smoking is even made to look elegant with close-ups of the curls of smoke. A very nice movie. Prepare yourself for the end. <br /> <br />
