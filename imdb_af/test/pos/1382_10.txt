Had the chance to see it today at a friend's house, and was impressed with what it achieved on such a small budget. Not that it ever bothered me, because I like low budget sci-fi like Dr Who, Blake's 7 and Dark Star. Hell, even Outland was not a big budget issue, so while money is helping, it takes more than throwing cash to make it good. <br /> <br /> The story was first paid straight with a group of mercenaries to guide a prisoner through space. Their ship is being attacked and they have to land on the nearest planet. They then discover that the prisoner made it too, it is a stone sleeves and that's just the beginning of their troubles. <br /> <br /> The effects, besides gun fighting, are minimalist and add to the movie without overwhelming It. Computer effects sometimes look a bit dodgy, but serve their purpose well and add to the story and give a futuristic feel to the proceedings. Movies like me, Robot could take advantage of this approach, instead of largely over-styling and replacing special effects for a plot, like too many Hollywood offers. <br /> <br /> Although none of the actors get Oscar material, it's written and shot and at an hour and ten minutes it's not welcome. The characters are not filled much, but they have not done in Predator, which seems to be in the feeling. The great man Mike Mitchell is a good stance for Arnie and is a good combination of brain and brawn. <br /> <br /> Some people may get worse if they aren't explained, but I like it. Unlike many movies and shows that leave things inexplicable, it is not so obscure that you can't handle it at all and I would like to see a sequel where the nature of the strangers is further investigated. <br /> A little movie of an enterprising team, done on the cheap, but a fun way to pass an hour. If so, I would like to see what they would do with a little more money, and hope that the film industry and the talented armchair critics will not even eliminate their creativity. <Br /> <br /> Recommended.
