I used to be very happy with "Terry & June". With Aunt Lucy, the emphasis was on the relationship between Terry and June, a middle-aged middle-class English couple, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and lost me very happily in every episode. <br /> <br /> The 1980s was the era of alternative comedy, but they were also the decade of choice - and Terry and June certainly had more traditional taste. And mine - and I was also a big fan of "The Young Ones"! Every week Terry came in a stupid situation and June caught up with herself and eventually had to get out of bail. How dated the shows are now - it was another world, but it is great to see the trends of the 1980s - like the CB story of 1982 (CB radio was legalized in November 1981 in England), which Terry is in seen the jail. his car in the back of a truck! I recently watched the shows again on DVD, and I still think they are fantastic! Not loved by the enlightened elite - the bells, but a great hit with the masses! Great!
