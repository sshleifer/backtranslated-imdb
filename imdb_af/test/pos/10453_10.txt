Spoilers in this review! Despite some highly unlikely scenes, including the boys in PE who measure their penises in a match and the few compulsory teens trying to get vignettes, this movie takes the painful essence of high school in ways that few teenage films ever done. It achieves this by not only smoking, drinking, but also prowl teenagers, but also the kind of friendship itself, as well as the friends of Gary, Dave, Rick, as these three friends tested their loyalty. This movie is a snapshot of the time when childhood ends. For the shy romantic Gary, when he first sees the beautiful Karen, he immediately falls in love. The awakening emotion in Gary was written big on the screen, and he proved his love for her by taking her when she was knocked by her lover. This love for Karen indicates the end of Gary's innocence, as ties with his two best friends will be tested and broken during the story. The confident ladies man, Rick, is the high school person we all secretly wish we were: attractive, cool and always have the impossible beautiful girls in a swoon. Rick seems to be a caddy, but remember that his character is just 17 years old. He panic and make a bad decision. From Rick's perspective, the story is also about finding one girl of his dreams, a bad break and then reconciling at the end. The look at Rick's face as Gary walks in and sees Karen kissing Rick shows that he finally understands that his best friend and he is the same woman. As in real life, you don't bend out, because your friend has an unrequited love. This is the drama of the movie. Rick is not a villain and constantly through the film reminds Gary and Dave that they are his best friends. However, the psychological quality of Gary's performance is at the heart of the story. Lawrence Monoson is a beautiful loser. He does everything right, his heart is in the right place, and he is consumed by love for Karen. Still, Karen is not finally moved by Gary's dedication and kindness. Karen represents all the people in the world who take in without giving back, who live in a vacuum of their own ego and never cease to realize the emotional damage and trauma they cause to others. This film is brutal in his statements about love and friendship, but it makes it unique among teenage films. It stops being a comedy and becomes a hopeless romantic movie, even though it is a tragic conclusion. Anyone who ever found the girl of his dreams and didn't win her will understand. The heartbreaking crashes of high school are just as much like the emotional tribes of adulthood, and this movie will remind you. Gary's last turnaround, while being blown away with the inscribed lock, is just like any one in the theater. One feels, after watching, that it's really made of two movies. The first part is a foolish teenage section movie, and once the story begins, it's a dramatic drama. A great movie. It should also be noted that the soundtrack was prescient in the selection of many rising stars such as The Police, The Cars, Devo, Oingo Boingo, The Plimsouls, The Waitresses, Gleaming Spiers and Phil Seymour.
