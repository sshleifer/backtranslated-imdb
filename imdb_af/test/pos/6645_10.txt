First, the story is not that simple, as many early reviewers tend to emphasize. This is actually a very complex story, unlike Bergman's other films that are more like character study. In Skammen we have two main characters, but as we were thrown into the middle of a war, we have no idea who is fighting and why everything is open to any decision. It creates a great strain and makes every event meaningful. As the story unfolds, we are introduced to many characters, which change into the symbols of mankind, both its dark and light sides. We have the example of the innocent bystanders trying to come during an absurd war, the cynical doctor who pleases his patients and the only bitter humor of the whole movie, the perverse opportunists trying to get the best of a movie. to make atrocity. event (Bjornstrand's character), the innocent dead children, the nameless figures almost touched the boat. Both are seen in one way or another by the eyes of Jan (von Sydow) and Eva (Ulmann), their characters are more limited in other Limman films (And Passion) and this is exactly because it is important here, the story is. , the way outdoor events have the ability to radically change human nature. <br /> <br /> Two years ago, Bergman made this film for Persona. where the most important conclusion from the only word spoken by Liv Ulmann's character is Nothing, nothing. That is it: the meaning of art and the meaning of life, the latter is nothing more than a play that includes all plays. But how about the war? And especially the destructive children of the XX century. In Persona, the only true emotion suffered by Ulmann's character, when she is seen as a victim of the Vietnam War, has become a human torch. In Shame, the idea is extended to a complex analysis of the dehumanizing nature of war. In an unnamed region of an unnamed country (we just assume it's Sweeden), two factions fighting the same language become an absurd war. Jan and Eva are two dreamers caught in the middle, but their dreams are woven into a kind of counterpoint. Initially, Jan is an idealist, unable to respond correctly to the world and a subject to his wife's will. By the end, he becomes a radically different personality, capable of unmotivated murder, courageous, indifferent (carefully watching the suicide on the boat. The simplicity of the act is worse). On the other hand, Eva is increasingly losing touch with reality and is eventually completely engulfed in her own unfulfilled dream. <br /> <br /> From a technical point of view, the whole movie delivers its message very effectively. Bergman puts the viewer along the character, puts the camera in the car with the actors, or in an extreme close-up behind the actor. Nykvist manages an extraordinary control of the camera, there are a few masterful hand effects, very good to make everything look real. The shots when the characters are trapped by the army seem remarkably documentary. The script is minimalist, but the story is quite complex. Actually, the whole movie is paradoxical, it has an intensity in the subject that is in sharp contrast to the cold and lack of emotional involvement with which it is directed and filmed. Nothing is melodramatic here, there is no compassion, no hope and no apparent salvation. But as in Liv Ulmann's dream at the end, it's so beautiful to help, but it's not that surprising, because it was so beautiful!
