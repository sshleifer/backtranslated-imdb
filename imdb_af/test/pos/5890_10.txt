World War II veterans return home and find it difficult to adapt to civilian life. This wonderful drama is expertly directed by Wyler and is beautifully filmed by the well-known movie maker Toland. Despite its length of three hours, it didn't drag for a moment. The Sherwood script features many human characters and a good dialogue. Andrews may have his best role as a man struggling to meet ends. Also good is Wright as a love-sick young woman, Mayo as Andrews trampling woman, and the actual veteran Russell as a man who has both lost his hands. However, top honors go to March and Loy as a long-married couple experiencing challenges while recognizing each other.
