This movie surprised me. The box is misleading, the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tones of the film are misleading. The movie is pretty good, well behaved and well shot. The special effects are in the forefront and seem before their time, until you realize that this movie came out in 1979, not in 1963, as it would suggest. It is a unique assumption on the dr. Moreau story and one of the better versions filmed. The first fifteen minutes is the highlight and the most shocking, but the film never really falls apart. Definitely valuable if you are a fan of dramatic costumes / horror classic and gore festivals.
