This movie is a ghost story of the life of the writer and poet, Mishima. It jumps through its past, through its last day, and through some of its stories, but is skillfully built as it moves from section to section. It takes the taste of the man, his work and his times ... the difficult 1960s. <br /> <br /> I think the most wonderful parts (literally full of "wonder") are the extracts from his works. . The sets (specially designed to work with the camera) are wonderful .... stylized, beautiful and effective. They can be used as an example for any set designer. I woke up at night from the Golden Pagoda. <br /> <br /> The stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art. After watching this movie, I wanted to learn more about the works of this artist. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics or Japanese history.
