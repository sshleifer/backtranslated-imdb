A very beautiful film that had a wider distribution. Ian McShane is right at home and plays the soul love DJ being canned because he won't "go with the program" and let the world know what they are missing. The supporting role is also good, and the music is the "Soul" of the movie. I just wish the movie would be released so I could get a copy of this for my movie library.
