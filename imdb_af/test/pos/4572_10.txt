I saw this movie since I was a girl, and from New York and remember how people stayed back and then brought back very good memories. This movie is not just about a fairy tale that ends, but Claudine's attempt to become a better person, woman and supplier has been. It was about the welfare system to put women in a binding situation. It was about the injustice of a system that invaded the demands of a family to stay one day. Diane Carroll was nominated for an Oscar for this role, and it was well deserved. If you want a strong family with conflicting but wonderful moments, Claudine enjoys it. Your goal as a viewer is to keep an open mind and understand the overall frustration.
