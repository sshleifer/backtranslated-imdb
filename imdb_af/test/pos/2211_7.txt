We have a character called Evie. Evie just wants to be a good person. She is nice, friendly, often smiles, but is strangely brutal. Evie also has a secret. Her idiot-savant sister repeated original poetry, which excited the community about sister writing. Unfortunately, it is Evie's poetry. While their mother is happy again and the boy next door shows his interest in Evie, Evie just tries to figure out what she really wants to do. <br /> <br /> What to keep in mind while watching this movie is who Evie really is. For such a brutally honest person who does not like to tell Ivy league, that she doesn't respect it, it seems strange she can draw a lie. For someone so happy and cheerful, she is fairly emotional when it comes to certain problems. They are not shortcomings, they are plot development, and they mean much more than they initially look. <br /> <br /> Usually this is something of a melodrama: a character lies, the personality of the other characters drives them through drama, as relationships are compromised. But in terms of writing it is very fresh and bold. The acting helps the writing very well (maybe the idiot-savant sister played better), and it is a real joy to watch. <br /> <br /> Directing and cinematography is not quite as good. . They are acceptable, and Evie's world is turned in color and light, providing great images, but not very consistent. It's not really that much of a mistake due to a low production value, but within the same value is a real storytelling and a real care for the characters. So while it's not a perfect movie, it's definitely a pleasant one. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
