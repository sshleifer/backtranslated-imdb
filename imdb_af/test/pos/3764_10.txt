Some said it was a nasal sweets patch, but short of the original dr. Hyde's fusion has not yet developed a drug that can deliver this effect. If Viagra was the mucus stage, the white sparkle is the Stephen Hawking evolutionary rung (or at least the pharmacist-idiot savant branch). This reality show is actually about the holy medicine cows, as the emperor was without clothes. Few of us want to question the health field; both because most of us would not have been to our present age, we were born of the "modern medicine" and because our subconscious hopes that we will continue to do so if we have confidence in the helping professions. So the geniuses that made this movie made jokes from Calcutta Bessy's, which gives us the sugar that allows us to swallow the modern medicine setting. The timing was right, and many could see the business side of the healing companies behind the curtain of Oz. A decade before, when George C. Scott flung the movie The Hospital, my wife and I sat in the packaged premiere in Oklahoma City. Just as in Jekyll & Hyde's remake, we were almost unable to fall from our seat and laughed and laughed for the duration. The hundreds of other audience members were deadly silent. They were shocked that doctors, nurses, and the hospital were mocked. It was as if the Pope, Billy Graham and Gandhi were sitting in the Animal House, beer-colored tea shirts and all who competed to see who could tell the funniest God who beat the jokes between belches. If the hospital was a slapstick comedy rather than a satire, they might see what was shown to them. Unfortunately, they were like Republicans on a show by Michael Moore's 9/11. Maybe smaller gold parachutes will be given to the corrupt medical corporate leaders. Health insurance companies would have had a harder time denying medical care and healthcare providers would have been disinfected earlier if George C. Scott danced a dance while delivering. its terrible truths. But - forget everything I just said. Watch the movie, be conscious as happy and joyful and full of laughter as the best Saturday night live shit, and let the subconscious suck into the underlying reality documentary. Don't make me guilty, "I gotta get it" becomes one of your words, or when "Hyde has nothing to hide", that part of your brain is now paralyzed by "It's a small world after everything ". Or if you start calling your local hospital, Our Lady of Pain and Suffering, instead of Our Lady of Eternal Construction. Even Oklahomans were changing their favorite horrible boss-eyebrow winner discussion from "Piss on him and leave him for dead", "Body in a Pit, you in it ....." The smell of death ... it's away! Chicken sushi! Mary. MARY. MARYEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
