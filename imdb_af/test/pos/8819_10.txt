A wonderful little production. <br /> <br /> The filming technique is very modest - very old BBC fashion and gives a reassuring, and sometimes awkward, sense of realism to the whole piece. <br /> <br /> The actors are very well-chosen - Michael Sheen not only has "all the polar" but he also has all the voices! You can really see the seamless editing led by the references to Williams's diary entries. Not only is it worth looking at, but it is a great written and staged piece. A masterful production of one of the great masters of comedy and his life. <br /> <br /> Realism really comes home with the little things: the fantasy of the guard rather than the traditional 'dream' techniques remains solidly disappeared. It plays well on our knowledge and our senses, especially with the scenes about Orton and Halliwell and the sets (especially of their flat with Halliwell's murals that decorate each surface) are well done.
