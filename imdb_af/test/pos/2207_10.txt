Dark and pale sets, exciting music that cuts through like a knife (or razor) a perfect throw through Broadway Greats Hearn and Lansbury. This exciting theater is transmitted flawlessly to the small screen. Sondheim is the most talented songwriter of our age and Todd is his masterpiece, from the Brechtian opening ballad to the dark humorous Law that I finalize - "A Little Priest" where Lovett and Todd fantasize about the victims who will thrill in their meat pies, play never stops excitement, excitement, and satisfaction. Betsy Joslyn also warns as Johanna, even she, because the play is going crazy. Edmund Lyndeck is in a brave performance as the corrupt Judge desiring to Joslyn and the subject of Todd's vendetta. Lansbury and Hearn recommend the show as only two good actors / stars can do. Other musical highlights include Todd's "johanna" Lovett's "worst pies in London" and the Law II which opens "GOD THIS GOOD", and it's a title to describe this production!
