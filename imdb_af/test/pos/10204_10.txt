Long do Hawke as well as Hawks in the first part of this extraordinary Western, before they start in the typical deterministic, dark and guilty Lang for the final. <br /> <br /> It's one of those movies that shows its magnitude almost instantly but at the same time very subtle. Vance Shaw (Randolph Scott) is on horseback and is being chased, we don't know why - he stumbles on wounded Edward Creighton (Dean Jagger) and decides to take his gun and horse, but to realize that Creighton is in a bad way is, decide to release him first. It is mostly transmitted through facial expressions and a very short, cut-out dialogue. In 2 minutes we know that Shaw is a prey, but basically a good guy. Shaw ends up helping Creighton on the road to civilization, then disappears. <br /> <br /> Cut for a few weeks or months later, with Creighton going and in charge of an expedition to lay telegraph wire west of Omaha. He hires Shaw as an exploration, trying to leave when he discovers that Creighton is in control; but Creighton wants to repay him anyway and experience quality. Also rented is a butter, son of a benefactor of the project, but Eastern Blake (Robert Young) is virtually competent, as he instantly points out an amusing but exciting source of use. Both of the tenants pay for Creighton's sister, Sue (Virginia Gilmore), who - again not typical - seems to be caring for anyone. The comradeship between the three men, the comic elements that include unwilling cuisine and various rough and tumble types, and the wonderfully played light romantic elements dominate the first third of the movie and remind me more to Howard Hawks' Red River 'or' Only "Angels have wings" than most Long - but they are so well played and the action progresses so naturally that it does not matter and does not change our pleasure - if it may change our expectations - like the more general Langian The themes of the ghostly past, dark mysteries and the enormous amount of easier, destructive and evil ways come to dominate the later part of the movie, Shaw's old poles come back to haunt him as the wagon train and his wires move west attack on the crew, and Shaw must struggle with what, like anything, he should tell Creighton about his tortured relationship with Jack Slade (Barton MacLane), the leader of the exorbitant. <br /> <br /> Beautifully shot in early to chnicolor and moves fairly seamlessly from sound stages to western locations. It's easy for me, Lang's best western and one of his best films, which is as strong as any of his films, the tragic inability of men to escape their past and a new future. Scott is as good as I saw him, showing more at a glance than many actors in a paragraph of dialogue can do, and the rest of the cast is uniformly good. The inevitable deposition between Shaw's past criminal life and his potential future is extraordinary, and a surprise even for a prolonged, long-committed like myself; and even in 1941 it seems that there was no longer any meaning on the part of civilization as the barber shop and the dusty street outside. You can get a shave, you can feel like a new man, but you can't really be one, as long as the old tires still hold you back. <br /> <br /> Genius.
