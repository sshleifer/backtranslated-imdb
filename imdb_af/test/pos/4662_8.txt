Well, I just discovered IMDb of my twin sister, Carol. Carol and I played the "Fat Identical Twin" in Midnight Madness. We didn't have to prepare much for the fat portion that came with us, and the rest was natural. ;) This was our first major film role and we made an explosion. We were 21 at the moment and lived about an hour and a half from The Disney Studio in Burbank and the Hollywood, California area. We grew up in front of the TV and probably from the first generation of valve key children. Twenty years later we still have lots of fun and are still 'heavy' or ever politically correct. We no longer strive to act, but knew to come back when the right opportunity came. Carol is a chiropractor in our hometown of Southern California and I am in the Information Technology field in Georgia. <br /> <br /> I might have biased, but I thought the movie was cute, clean, and fun. We knew it was not a masterpiece or an Oscar nominee, but it was and still is a movie that the whole family can see and have fun. It is nice not to worry if your young children can watch a video without progressing to certain parts. And no one was more excited when it was released on video like Carol and I. Carol found it at Kmart for $ 6.99! Now it's a cheap way to catch your memories and share it with others. <br /> <br /> Sincerely, Betsy Lynn and Carol Gwynn; The Thompson Twins
