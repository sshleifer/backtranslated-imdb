This movie was so cool! I saw it with some of my friends on Friday night. While the first credits roll, we saw that Lionsgate Films made this movie. They are the one who made the silly movie Wolf Creek, which was completely gay! When we saw it, we sighed. We thought it would be like Wolf Creek, but we were so wrong! The movie wasn't just better than Wolf Creek (it's really not that hard). This is one of the best horror movies I've seen long ago! They really saved themselves from this movie. It was stingy, clever and scary, which are the combinations for a wonderful horror movie. Kane is wonderful like Jacob Goodnight, and Christina Vidal, Samantha Noble and Luke Pegler did quite good work as part of a group of criminals cleaning an old motel. It had some gross scenes, and you actually feel sad for some of the people who die. All in all, a great horror movie to watch on a Friday or Saturday night with the lights off and with friends. Don't look at a hotel.
