** SPOILERS ** Looking for a little more excitement, then crocodiles are fed by local game reserve sisters Grace and Pat, Diana Glenn & Maeve Dermody, along with Grace's boyfriend Adam, Andy Rodoreda, deciding on a trip up take the desert and desert, of human habitation, Australian Mangrove Swamps. <br /> <br /> With their marshal guide Jimmy, Ben Oxenbuld, at the helm of his motorized boat, the four are awakened by a giant saltwater crocodile that quickly grabs and drag Jimmy into the scare with him at the bottom. . Grace Pat & Adam end up stranded on a tree in the marsh with Pat hanging on the clipped boat. The rest of the movie has the hungry and determined crocodile a cat and mouse, or a crocodile and a man, game with the trio ending in a revelation at a mudflat, where the death and hidden body of jimmy finally came to rest. . <br /> <br /> Both the director and actor in the film take full advantage of the swamp which sometimes makes it much more frightening than the giant crocodile swimming in it. We get the killer crocodile just about a dozen times in the movie, but all of them hit you, and Jimmy Grace Pat & Adam right in the gut. <br /> <br /> Always there is tension in the giant reptile that has always been damaged under its damage, so unexpectedly it has much more effect on the crowds if you don't see it, as in the last ten minutes of the movie, when you do it. You wonder right from the start what will eventually survive the crocodile attacks and eventually live to tell them. The end of the crocodile's human confrontation was about the worst and most unrealistic part of the film. <br /> <br /> The crocodile, which was both cagey and effective in the early scene, looked as if it had swam whether it had no power or speed to grab, with its deadly jaws and only survivor of the expedition. In fact, the killer dress was so ineffective that it was not just his victim or victims. This, in turn, eventually became deadly. <br /> <br /> Much like "Jaws", the movie "Black Water" has the killer crocodile, like the big whip in "Jaws", more interested in killing his human prey and then eating them. With all the food available in the swamp and rivers in which he lived the crocodile, only after the quartet, Grace Pat Adam & Jimmy was caught up in his watery domain, which he felt as the great ruler of. And to do that, they have to pay with their lives!
