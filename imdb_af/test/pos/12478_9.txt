The re-mastered black and white film Quai des Orfevres delivers the goods in spite of romance, jealousy and marriage, which just gets in the way of the truth of "who did it?" <br /> <br /> In thumbs in thumb, technique technique as experienced by experience and intuition, the patience of this master inspector etches in truth - but of course, with the help of a bag of dirty police interrogating tricks. <br /> <br /> Martineau is the centerpiece of this movie.
