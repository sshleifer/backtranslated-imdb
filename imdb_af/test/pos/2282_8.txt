An egoistic main league baseball player is forced to continue his career in Japan. He strives for a culture that is a stranger to him, a seemingly humorous driver, an attractive Japanese woman and his own professional and social uncertainties. There is a certain subtle charm flowing through Tom Selleck's performances. There is humor, sometimes moderate, as in this movie, sometimes banging like in "Folks!", But always seems to be a higher goal. Throw an individual full of self-indulgence that struggles to solve his personal problems while holding onto the right thing, and you end up with a movie, both funny and thoughtful. The role-play fits like a championship team, and even if no awards or films are won for their efforts, they will make the viewers feel good (and perhaps the best results). You will want to see this movie more than once, and each time Mr. Baseball a homepage.
