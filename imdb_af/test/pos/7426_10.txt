a nice romantic comedy. Errol Flynn shows what a great touch for comedy he owned. a talent that probably shows some of its true prankster self. the comic writer on this movie is excellent. eleanor parker does a good job as flynn's ex-wife, whose job is to win back. eleanor is also easy on the eyes. Flynn's comedic timing and white show here the full effect here, watching his dual tasks, his ability to respond orally to a strange return, or the straight man. , and its total credibility and sincerity where necessary, this guy can act on! It is a pity that Errol did not have the opportunity to do more roles like him during his career, he was very talented to the limit. If you enjoyed it, it happened one night with belt and collar or of the William Powell and Myrna Loy Comedies that you will enjoy. <br /> <br /> Very fitting and laughing. a lost diamond of a movie.
