The scarlet jacket is about bendict arnold betraying his country, but he is not really in the movie too much. The main focus is on the big Boulton (cornell wild) and the big Andr√© (Micheal Wilding) Wilding stealing the movie as an officer and a man also as a friend to Boulton. As Boulton tries to discover who Gustavus is, the man is leaking seconds to the British. Wild has with the British the suspect Dr O'Dell (George Sanders), who watches and loves each move, Anne Francis, this is a very enjoyable film.
