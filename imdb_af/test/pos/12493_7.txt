Quai des Orfevres takes too long to go, with Clouzot so fond of his background environment that he almost has the danger of forgetting the story. But once that happens, it's Clouzot at its best. Bertrand Blier (father of Bertrand Blier and co-star of his Buffet Froid) is the worldwide pianist who is married to himself and who intends to kill the silly studio magic with designs on his wife to see that someone has beaten him has. Not only that, but she's meticulously planned, but cowardly execution of alibi falls into pieces, especially when a thief steals his car at the murder tones. <br /> <br /> The movie really kicks off with the arrival of Luis Jouvet's police inspector, a rather wonderful creation half Alistair Sim in Green for Danger and a half-worldly Maigret with a better dialogue. In a neat running mouth, his investigation is constantly performed at the top of his voice against chaos and noise, whether it's the noisy typewriters of the police station or a loud rehearsal. The police station itself is a wonderful realistic creation, a wealth of chaos and tells little details that make Steve Bocchco's once-revolutionary 80's American police performances look like outdated museum pieces in comparison. <br /> <br /> If Suzy Delair is a rather unconvincing femme-fatal, supportive role supports more than remunerate, with beautiful Simone Renant a conception as the lesbian photographer who falls in love with her far and constantly wrong for Blier's lover by Delair and other interested parties (only Jouvet, similarly unhappy with women, understand and truly sympathize). With great black and white photography by Armand Thirard, it is a fantastic little excitement with a beautifully twisted and beautiful scene with a driver who unwillingly identifies Renant in a police station. (Trivia note: Pierre Larquey, who played the playful philosophical Dr Vorzet in Le Corbeau, is in smaller roles as a taxi driver in both Quai and Les Espions.) <br /> <br /> The Criterion DVD is quite fantastic. - Good image quality plus an enlightening extract from a French television program with interviews with Clouzot, Blier and Renant.
