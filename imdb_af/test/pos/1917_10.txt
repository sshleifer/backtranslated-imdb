I watched this movie on TV and loved it! I'm a real disaster movie lover, and this one was wonderful. The film is made up of some very interesting people. Connie Selleca is always wonderful. And William Devane is in his own league. He can play both comedy and thriller in the same movie as few others can. The story line is also good. The idea of ​​following a timeline of what will happen, and of using this timeline to prevent a global disaster, is an interesting idea. And this movie makes it so much that it's almost completely credible.
