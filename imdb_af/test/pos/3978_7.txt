A great movie. The movie was even better than the ads tackled. And believe it or not, it was very inspiring. I really think anyone who comes to the end of the movie will somehow be inspired. <br /> <br /> It was very chilly from the beginning but quickly picked up. I laughed. I laughed a lot. The acting is basically above average, nothing special, but better than average. I can safely say it was the second funniest movie to come out this summer (the 1st funniest is CLERKS II). So I give it a 7/10 (high seven, but not quite eight).
