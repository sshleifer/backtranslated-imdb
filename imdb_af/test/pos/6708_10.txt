One of the best sci-fi movies out there. However, it does take multiple views to understand the concept of the movie and not just appreciate the special effect, but also the main chart of the movie itself. It is my own feelings that this film movie has received such bad reviews because no one has taken the time to watch the movie as it should be seen. It does have a few moments that you want to get and pass, but they are little and far between. Hooper, who has TCM 1 and 2 with a remake of INVADERS FROM MARS, and the FUNHOUSE, does his best work here. Great score, good acting, and great effects make it a movie to add to your collection. If you get the chance to watch the widescreen version on DVD, it is recommended for anyone who is a fan of sci-fi.
