Perhaps one of the first slasher films to come out to Halloween (although made by Halloween's Irwin Yabalans), I must say I honestly find that "Tourist Trap" is scarcer and surprising. "Tourist Trap" is one of the remarkable delicacies you find every now and then, and is left with the pleasant surprise feeling. It was a destination I told you, but one night I was at my local Blockbuster (One or Two months before it went out) and had nothing. Then I stumble upon this movie, I think they look like a laughable B-Movie, I rent it and take it home, boy I was in for a good scare. "Tourist Trap" comes out as a bad movie, it is definitely stocking moments, but ultimately you have a lot to enjoy. <br /> <br /> The things that impressed me the most, and the things that made this movie one of the scariestes I saw, is number one the institution. A horror movie without a good environment is not much fun, not here. I love love for the place, it feels like we can talk to it, it almost feels like we were before. What makes it creepier. Following are the characters, not of them really stereotypical, and they all have a real personality. For example, they are not stoners, alcoholics, or even sex-obsessed people, they feel like ordinary young adults. Plus they look realistic enough, and then they are Chuck Connors. Who gives a good performance as Mr. Slausen, who also keeps us all right away, because again he is so real, he feels like the good old grandfather we worship. The last and probably the most important thing that this film does is how they let us (the audience) walk, halfway out of our seats and turn on the rights for the right reasons. For example, most of the time in horror movies we jump mainly due to a sudden change in the music field, but in "Tourist Trap" prepare yourself, that's not the case. With it's perfect use of lighting, mannequin and strangeness, you feel quite busy. Plus, I love it, because although they may be a little over the top with some things you still feel, this can happen. That's exactly what a horror movie that takes such a ridiculous performance is, and it makes us (the audience) unsafe and frightening. <br /> <br /> Overall, as far as any major issues are concerned, I have none, just that it is strange, sometimes it may be a bit strange. In the end, Tourist Trap loves a place close by and loves my heart because it is one of the few horror movies to show me and feel unsafe about traveling.
