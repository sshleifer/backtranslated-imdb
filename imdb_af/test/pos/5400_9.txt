Before Barton jumps over my comments, let's just keep in mind that opinions are like donkeys. We all have them. <br /> <br /> I loved Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Daniels. I loved the dialogue and think the acting was sublime. Downplayed just perfect and understated. Unlike some others, I didn't find this @ all predictable. <br /> <br /> I found Sigourney's role refreshingly humorous and realistic, especially her scene confronting the bully in the trailer. <br /> <br /> I found It was great and didn't intend to recommend it to anyone and everyone. That's why there are different kinds of ice cream, something to please everyone ...
