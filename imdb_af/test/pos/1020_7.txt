Do-eyed High School student Kathleen Beller is beaten and <br /> <br /> raped in the opening scenes of this for TV movie. The movie <br /> <br /> flashes back to the few days before the rape, as Beller <br /> <br /> was harassed by a stranger. <br /> <br /> Beller and Scott Colomby and her best friend Robin Mattson and <br /> <br /> Early in the day, Dennis Quaid is dating. Caller's anxious parents, <br /> <br /> laid down Tony Bill and shrieked Blythe Danner, waiting at home twisting <br /> <br /> hands and so on. Suddenly, the 1970s made its dated <br /> <br /> entry, as the young couples discuss the romance and love in <br /> <br /> "Three Days of the Condor". <br /> <br /> Beller, an amateur photographer, begins with threatening notes <br /> <br /> filled in her dressing room at school. The filmmakers give us a whole series of anesthetics: Beller's new boyfriend, Mattson's boyfriend, Beller's dad, Beller's ex-boyfriend, and then what? <Br /> <br /> excessive friendly photography class teacher who wants Beller to be a <br /> <br /> bit more sexy in her self-portrait? I knew who the rapist was <br /> <br /> because the video vision of the Worldvision Video company has a photo of <br /> <br /> the attack on the back cover, which has any tension in that /> <br /> consider. <br /> <br /> Without giving away who the attacker is, Beller <br /> <br /> starts to bother phone calls and eventually gets raped. The movie then <br /> <br /> heads south as she makes like Nancy Drew and secretly puts <br /> <br /> a time-lapse camera to hold the man who stole another student. <br /> <br /> Finally, the filmmakers stop telling of <br /> <br /> Calling the Lack of Understanding for Victims in that <br /> <br /> day and age. <br /> <br /> The stress here is really, without going over in <br /> <br /> scary movie stuff. Caller is very good, and look for her and <br /> <br /> Mattson's scene in a deserted theater. Both do good work. The <br /> <br /> movie is full of familiar faces, including Ellen Travolta in a small role, <br /> <br /> and everyone is professional. <br /> <br /> It was made in 1978. , and it shows. I'm sure no one had any idea that it would be reviewed in 2001 by an over-critical horror <br /> <br /> movie lover who has to go to bed and early in the <br /> morning, but some some of the attitudes here are embarrassing. The <br /> <br /> teacher telling Beller to be sexy is never made to explain exactly what <br /> <br /> he had in mind. Today, if any high school teacher said it <br /> <br />, it would be a TV movie on its own. <br /> <br /> After being raped, the rapist is still a part of her life, such as warranties <br /> <br /> issued, blah, blah, blah. There may not be a case, because <br /> <br /> Beller is not a virgin, and cannot prove she was raped by who <br /> <br /> she said. Many of these issues have been addressed with <br /> <br /> modern technology and policing efforts, but this film obviously <br /> <br /> knew it would have a chance to add to the reform debate. Rape is <br /> <br /> an act of violence that is not gone, but attempts to catch today <br /> <br /> The attackers are miles before twenty-four years ago. The <br /> <br /> problem is the anti-rape angle being spotted, such as a <br /> <br /> thought. Before that, we have a tight little suspension that <br /> <br /> is really honest with God characterization. After the rape everything changes <br /> <br />, filmwise and not better. <br /> <br /> I remember Beller from the 70's and 80's (and who can forget it <br /> <br /> her revealing role in "The Betsy"), but she hasn't done anything for nearly 10 years . <br /> <br /> It's a shame because she was very good. <br /> <br />. <br /> <br /> I would recommend "Are you alone in the house?!" based on <br /> <br /> action alone, with a reluctant nod to at least the first two thirds of <br /> <br /> the movie. <br /> <br /> It is an illiterate but contains physical violence, some sexual. <br /> <br /> Violence, and some adult situations.
