Vanaja is a film of superlatives. It has a particularly good reflective role. Mamatha is the crown jeweler, an outstanding production and possibly pre-production with Rajnesh at the helm, a fantastic journey from rural South India through the eyes of a 15-year-old, a remarkable mix of song and dance, traditional and modern, perfectly blended, and a beautiful backdrop of lavish color of the flora and fauna, which is a wonderful experience. What a great achievement for a debut director !! The casting was absolutely silent. I wish India would come up with more such films. This movie will remain one of my top favorites for my entire life. 9/10.
