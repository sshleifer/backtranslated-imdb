Rent it from my local as it was the only new British movie available this week. Never heard of the filmmaker before or his other movies (thanks IMDB). Over time, one made a good British British comedy that didn't have Hugh Grant or forty anything. The story is a morality story, but never preachy, quite enjoyable from a young and fresh face. Luke Goss's como was surprisingly good, but then he surprised me with his excellent performance in 'Blade'. Loved the color rating, especially in the nightclub series. Great music and a truly original voice at work here. Nine out of ten and the rent is worth it.
