This movie is a fairly fair adaptation of the Prosper Merimeé novel. In the novel Merimeé itself is a character, Don José is from Navarre (Northern Spain, and historically a Basque region, they can speak Basque language). They are in Seville (Andalusia, Southern Spain) and speak only Spanish with Andalusian accents, but they do not speak Basque, but Carmen explains to Don José that she lives in Navarre. You can believe it or not, anyway, this is the book's version, then you can't be critical of the movie about this, be with the book! You should note that the book of Merimeé and the opera by Bizet is different. This movie is an adaptation of the novel. In the opera, Don José is still Spanish from Navarre. He is never French. Why do so many people think Don José is French? I don't know, but I think because the novel and the opera are in French, but it's supposed to be in Spanish. <br /> <br /> The only major difference between the film and the novel is that in the movie Don José also the "torero" lover of Carmen murder and in the novel he does not (also in the opera). I think they wanted to keep the movie a little more gore! I think the movie is pretty good anyway.
