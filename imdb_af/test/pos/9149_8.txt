This movie is a great start for beginners who have never watched a 'Silent Film' and for those who believe the quality Cinema starts with their generations' efforts. They do themselves carelessly by not expanding their horizon. The Silent Film is an art form of pantomime that differs from the sound film and stage. It can stand on its own merits. <br /> <br /> THE BELOVED ROGUE (1927) United Artists is a fictional story of the relationship of the French poet 'Francois Villon' and 'King Louis XI'. By conquering 'Villons', 'King Louis', his nemesis 'Duke of Burgandy' will reduce the Feudal System and establish the KING as head of state and the beginning of modern France. <br /> <br /> The cast is exceptional, led by JOHN BARRYMORE (yes, Drew's grandfather). For those who just remember him for the rotting actor 'Larry Renault' in DINNER AT EIGHT (1933) or the ham in THE INVISABLE WOMEN (1940), it will be a revelation. Fit, pruning with the 'Big Profile' still in evidence, he recommends the screen. Co-Starring in his first American film is CONRAD VEIDT with his 'cadaverous spider' interpretation of 'Louis XI'. It's a duel of acting titans, each not giving the other a thumb. On a trivia note is Character Actor and Dwarf ANGELO ROSSITTO in his first film, his last, MAD MAX BEYOND THUNDERDOME (1985). There are other character factors that will continue in easy-to-pick up sound. <br /> <br /> United Artists does not save money in this attractive production under the supervision of WILLIAM CAMERON MENZIES. Costumes, props and sets are well done and not exaggerated as in a DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS productions. There is a touch of reality here. The copy on DVD we watched from 'Delta Entertainment' comes from a good master. Although it is not 'repaired', its musical soundtrack is clear and the pressure has only suffered from black spots (dirt) and falls. The only major damage at the end of the last rinse of water. 'Cinema' also has a better quality edition, as they do major repairs on their prints. Best check with them. In our opinion, this is a 'must', especially if you have no 'silence' in your collection. It's a great place to start.
