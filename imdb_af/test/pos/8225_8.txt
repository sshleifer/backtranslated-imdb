Ronald Coleman has been a star of the screen for many years when talks came in and was a boost to his career. His Oxford English accent is so exciting that I can listen to the farmer's calendar and not be bored. <br /> <br /> Coleman plays Willie Hale, a 30-year-old playboy from a wealthy family who spends time on women and gambling. Still, he is a nice villain - not only from the audience's point of view, but also from family and friends. Due to his ongoing gambling, he broke away and sold his belongings in a strange place to settle his debt and return to England. When he got there, he was first met by a father who insisted that he kick him - he had it with Willie and his ways. But five minutes alone in a room with Willie and his charm, and Willie not only been forgiven by dad, Dad gave him one hundred pounds to boot. <br /> <br /> Then Willie goes for a day's relaxation with his sister and her friend, Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young). Dorothy wants to be engaged to the great Duke Paul for so much night, mainly because her father wants royalty in the family and no one else is special in her life. It changed after her day with Willie, and soon there will be a scandal brewery, as Dorothy refuses to marry as planned. <br /> <br /> Ronald Coleman is always a pleasure to watch in these early talk shows he did. for Sam Goldwyn where he plays the confident adventurer or cad or both. He has an attitude related to Errol Flynn, but he cannot display Flynn's physical dexterity due to a bad wound he received during World War I. Coleman always remained in the physical dexterity of his soul. Loretta Young, just 17 when this photo was taken, shows the beginning of her brand-new sweet girl who can break into a fireball when the occasion asks. Myrna Loy plays Willie's girlfriend from the past - Mary Crayle - a showgirl. Here, Myrna still plays a role similar to the exotic vampire parts she so often held at Warner Brothers when she was a contrast player from 1926 until shortly before the film was made in 1930. <br /> <br /> This is actually a light and broad romantic comedy from start to finish. If you're in the mood for the kind of escapist entertainment that relieved the hearts of audiences during the Great Depression, apply this little movie to the account.
