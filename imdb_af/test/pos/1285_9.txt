It only watched DVD three times. Once with the scenes in sequential order (in this doozy of a movie noir, the beginning, middle and end of the story vary) and once with the director's commentary running. Absolutely amazing. A bones story tells with more flair, energy and dust than most major budget-remaining features are released today. <br /> <br /> I think it's an even more perfect movie than the subsequent Memento, which first brought me to Nolan. Can't wait to see what he's doing with a bigger budget (and bigger boxing stars) in his next film, Insomnia.
