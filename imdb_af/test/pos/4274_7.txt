This show is really the Broadway American Idol. It sings, the British guy, a guy who is sometimes nice and a super-beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Of course it's different because there is a sing-off, and there is dancing and some acting (we just don't see the acting). <br /> <br /> I gave this show a 7 because there are a few tweaks I know many people (including me) will do if they work for the show. The first thing that really needs to be changed is that the judges decide who is going home. I know they want the real Danny and Sandy, but America must have the power to decide who is going home. There really is no point in singing off. The person with the lowest number of votes usually goes home anyway. Another thing I want to change is to see that they are actually acting on the show. What is Broadway without the acting? The last thing to change is the song that the eliminated people end up singing. The eliminated Danny always sings the same song and the eliminated Sandy always sings the same song as they leave. As they sing it every week, these songs eventually become annoying. <br /> <br /> I admit I'm not a fan of the movie Grease, but for some reason I'm addicted. This show is much underestimated. It has so many memorable performances and moments.
