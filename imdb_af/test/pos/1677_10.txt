I see a lot of movies at the theater (103 so far this year) and I have to say it's the best movie I've seen this year, even though it was released in 1954! <br /> <br /> I got rid of and watched this work of genius and felt rather embarrassed that I had never heard of it before my local art house theater decided to show it for a week on what looked like a new picture. <br /> <br /> The best part of the whole movie should break into the 28 minutes where there is no speech and no music, just the sound of the men who hoist it. Pure quality. <br /> <br /> Although very dark, it is relieved by the dry humor. <br /> <br /> Not many movies score 10 out of 10, but it does and gets a golden star too! <br /> <br /> If you ever get a chance to see this movie, don't hesitate, it's a classic. <br /> <br />
