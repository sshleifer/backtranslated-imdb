I consider myself a great horror movie fan. One night I just wanted to rent some new horror movies to have fun. Then I rented Milo. I was so surprised by this movie. It scared hell for me. This is not something I can say very often. Usually, Halloween only scares me. <br /> <br /> Two other friends looked at me and left with a disturbed feeling. A good feeling, if you ask me, after watching a horror movie. If you haven't touched it then what's the point. <br /> <br /> This movie was original. This did not follow the normal guidelines of a horror movie. That's why movies like Valentine bombarded me. <br /> <br /> Of course there are many unanswered questions, like most horror movies. This is worth the rent.
