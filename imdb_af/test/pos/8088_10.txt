This movie is the absolutely perfect way to explain what a good movie is. It's a movie for kids and parents, and it's timeless. I saw this movie in front of Ocean's Eleven and have to admit that the actors in the OE have pre-classed, but the play of Klatretøsen is much more underground and moving. Why I say Ocean's Eleven is the fact that these 2 movies have a lot of things in common and Klatretøsen is so good! that compares with OE. The 3 youngsters play their part in a perfect way of not believing, compared to what we are used to in Denmark. The different cases of impossible acts are dealt with in a way that you will not believe from many young actors (and sometimes even from the "old boys"). The story? again things are in common with Ocean's Eleven, except for the reason to steal the money and in Klatretøsen they have to climb to the strong room. The part in which the young people of Ida's younger brother have to care, gives a fine element to the movie. Try to imagine how to rob a bank with a 2 year child with a cloth on your arm :-). <br /> <br /> This movie can be compared to most grown films such as MI2 and Ocean's Eleven. Yes, I believe it is so good. It's best to see it in a theater, as all the kids in the room notice the movie and these comments will stay in your heart forever :-). Regards Klavs.
