The year 1950 saw two very different and interesting westerners: "The Gunfighter" by Henry King, and "Wagon Master" by John Ford. The Gunfighter was historically striking, as it clearly influenced Zimmerman's "High Noon" (1951) and later revisionist westerners. <br /> <br /> But I personally find 'Wagon Master' better than its contemporary counterpart. Ford's little masterpiece is not much about storytelling; it should be thought of as a poem describing concepts of old west. Although optimistic and warm-hearted, we are deserved of naivety because it is completely free of pretentious underlining. Border landscapes are well used as they perfectly support the poetic narrative. Add natural camera work and we are transported among the travelers of the Mormon to tell western folklore what is being said in movies.
