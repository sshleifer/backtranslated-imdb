I was a big fan of Asterix comics when I was a kid and watched each one. I never heard of this movie when it was released, but I watched it with my children last night. I remembered the comedy well to know that much was added to the story for the film. Some of the changes I thought were a bit crowny (like the cousin's "modern" dance and the Viking chief's daughter - almost everything about her), but I found the most to be enough. Most importantly, as the reactions my children watched, confirmed that the film pleased its target audience. As a family movie, it works better than other Asterix titles I've seen. Many of the names not in the book I found had the same appeal as those that it was. Overall, a pleasant family movie, whether you are an asterix fan or not.
