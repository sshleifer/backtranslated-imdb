Forgive the Franklins is the best movie I've seen for years. The acting was fantastic .. especially Mari Blackwell, who was truly remarkable in the role of Peggy Lester. She brought Peggy to life with incredible skill and made her as real as my own neighbor. I also enjoyed the Robertson dean in the role of the father ... he is a true professional and has managed to pull off even the most intimate scenes with a rare grace. The performances throughout the cast were very good, excellent, but Peggy's role played by Blackwell made the movie. The cinema was done beautifully throughout and was impressive. The only criticism I have to offer is a slight weakness of the end-tones, which have been over-stretched, repetitive and a bit focused on the wrong character. I would like to see it end on a note of forgiveness. But despite the slight mistake, it is very worth watching and applauding everyone involved in making it.
