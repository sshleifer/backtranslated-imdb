I saw this movie very much like Skywalker02, but when I could see it again and had formal film training, psychology and life the time to really touch me and beat me. I really liked the movie. I remember paying for service cable channels almost played this thing to death, like poltergeist when it first came out, and many other popular movies. I felt back and it wasn't worth it and the constant "airtime" (I know the cable is not really on the air) gave it, but I was very young and adult had no drama and hadn't worked. However, the recent performance of the film has relieved me of the film. I think Susan Surandon and Molly Ringwald have probably studied the writing together, and I would be a little surprised if Surandon coached this project. Ringwald's other projects, while good, don't have her potential depth as this role. Surandon nails her, as did Raul Julia. Cassavettes and Wife delivered acceptable performances, but I will sometimes admit that the first-class acting turns are mediocre. A stable ebb and flow to the acting takes place during many scenes, but overall I can see why the story can call for the dynamic to become more subtle. <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't find this movie to "take me out and drown me" kind of boring party like Skywalker02 would believe you. I think maybe with the right psychological training and a little more hardship in one's home life strategically placed, along with some movie courses, this movie might look different. I would say if you feel a little bit of melancholy and long for a simpler life, and you had part of a marriage difference among dysfunctional family units, then this movie might provide more insight and entertainment than you might think. I feel it is a classic and find it much more entertaining than mainstream films that are supposed to share many of the same elements, such as Terms of Endearment, which I am concerned about, some extraordinary performances by Jack Nicholson, then there is ceremonial burned until nothing is left. (How can such a movie get more attention than this one. Talk about boredom.) Best thing, don't say my word or anyone else, watch the movie and support our industry.
