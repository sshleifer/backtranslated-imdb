I finally had a chance to settle and compare the two versions of this movie that is currently underway. Firstly, the good, old-fashioned Embassy VHS print, SCREAMERS, and then a new, fully-restored Italian DVD by everyone's new favorite media company, No Skand of Italy. <br /> <br /> The American "Inside Out" ads are, as everyone says, completely misleading and suggest a Roger Cormanized, who would otherwise be a superior fantasy adventure thriller for adults. The complete Italian version is a somewhat complicated, well-designed and deliberate fit on "Island of Dr. Moreau", and there is nothing wrong with it. It's a wonderful, handsome Euro Horror outing with a brain, good plot, character development, location shooting, time costs and sets. <br /> <br /> But I have to admit that the 14-year-old Knucklehead weed blower is still peeping inside of me, I got a bigger kick from the more lousy, messy and rude Roger Corman version, what " a little over the top gore, a flashy but incessant opening segment, and most of Martino's original movie, though somewhat shortened for Roger's idea of ​​entertainment. The pacing was a bit faster, the shock came closer to each other and you saw just as much of me. Bach's fantastic shape like you in the extensive Italian version. <br /> <br /> I still don't have much of an idea of ​​the specific story: there are a number of plot twists and casual characters that were somewhat difficult to keep up with. A local voodoo subplot didn't help much, and it's funny how everything culminates in just another fist fight between the noble prisoner and the mad scientist. Perhaps there are a few more views. I will say: Fans of the movie should use one of these PAL inputs and watch what is actually a movie rather than just another dark old home video. The widescreen shot compositions reveal that Martino had an eye to filling his screen with interesting stuff. No one gets their heads off as the SCREAMERS print, but these are still interesting things, and once again prove that while its standards were quite limited to the gutter environment, Roger Corman made new good trashy fun when he made it has. for him, and next to each other, it's actually better movies than they should be. <br /> <br /> 7/10
