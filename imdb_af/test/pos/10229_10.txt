As an avid reader of Clive Barker, I expected this movie to be released. I was not let down. "Nightbreed" is a different color horse. Rich in the underlying decay of Western civilization and dripping with alternatives exist in a way we have never seen before. Barker is at his best when he allows us to look into his world of unprecedented horror, but we point the other side of the coin. Here are the "monsters" the spectacularly beautiful creatures, while the people are the deceptively ugly creatures of self-confidence. We soon learn that we were wrong throughout. By far my favorite show by the often used Craig Sheffer, and the additional bonus of David Cronenberg as "Decker" is the best seen and believed role. The "Monsters" are depicted flawlessly by a company of English creators, who also brought the "Cenobites" into the "Hellraiser", including "Pinhead" himself Doug Bradley. "Nightbreed" is an absolute must see for any fan of the horror genre, and anyone who needs a little (something) more from their horror story. This is Clive Barker at its best.
