1981's Just Before Dawn is one of the best stories of wilderness curry out there. This is one of the best slides of the 80's and it doesn't blow flashes like The Final Terror, Do not Go in the Woods or The Prey out of the water. <br /> <br /> A group of young adults come and look at the mountain property that one of the group just bought. However, they are not alone in nature. A creepy killer who appears in two places at the same time is hiding and believing trespassers. <br /> <br /> Director Lieberman, who gave us such great B movies like Squirm (1976) and Blue Sunshine (1977), also does an excellent job with this clever thriller. The film is beautifully atmospheric, with a creeping sense of tension and some strong tension. This film even makes the open wilderness look scary. The Oregon sites are beautiful and well captured by clever cinematography. The music score is truly original and awesome as opposed to the picturesque visuals. <br /> <br /> Deborah Benson is a good lead, her presence was fascinating. Gregg Henry delivers a good performance as Benson's lover and Chris Lemon offers charisma a few times. The supporting role, especially veteran actor Kennedy, is also doing very well. <br /> <br /> A true jewel of the slasher genre, which needs no tension. Definitely worth looking for treasure fans and horror buffs. See it! <br /> <br /> *** 1/2 from ****
