I will never forget the absolutely absorbing effect this show had on me when I first saw it. From the moment the master is frightened by the Clown, to his painful attempts to make sense of the situation ("We are alive, we are human, we must have memories!" Inactive quote close), to his clever attempt to to improvise an escape, it is a sounding drama. <br /> <br /> Little looks at the viewer after watching. The moment the beautiful ballerina dances for everyone, after the knob, screaming packs of the Scottish musician; The tramp's capricious remark, "A lady is as good as a mile", the Major's shocked conclusion that they should be in hell. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant episode, beautifully written and performed. The stunning beauty of Susan Harrison adds to the memorable of the strange, touch of the story.
