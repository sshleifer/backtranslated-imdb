It's a ghost, it's an intelligent comedy, it has a pathetic action and choreography (and it is deliberate), good hummable songs, good cast throughout the cast, brilliant by Amir, Salman and Paresh and all over A script It is also so scarce in the Indian movie which is also in comedy (see David Dhawan, Harmesh Malhotra, etc.). Story is of two bruises whose sole purpose is to become rich and famous in any way. They come in such a way when they find out that a rich NRI is going to marry India. The rest of the story is about the sole proprietorship and how these shoots try to meet each other. The whole cast was perfectly thrown right from Deven Verma to Viju Khote. Songs are rightly placed and funny. Surprise package is Salman, acting with perfect timing and this particular action has given him his style of comedy. <br /> <br /> All a fum movie you shouldn't ignore if you want to watch Indian cinema.
