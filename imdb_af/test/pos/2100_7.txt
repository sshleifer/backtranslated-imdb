Beautiful combination of giant monster and samurai genres. The giant monster, Majin, the god of the mountain, is a disapproving and forbidding figure who comes much like the Old Testament God and rains destruction and punishment on those who profane his holy ground - but it is interesting to note that which ultimately wakes him is not the suffering of the people, but a sharp and personal insult. It is beautifully photographed, with solid acting, great miniature, and a wonderful score by the great Akira Ifukube. Majin is not a 400+ foot monster like Godzilla - he is 2 1/2 times normal, so the evil samurai he bumps into the ground gets a good look at his contemptuous eyes as he goes on their fort and defeats it to smithereens. Not much in terms of extras, but it's nice to see this forgotten minor classic saved and get back to the digital format.
