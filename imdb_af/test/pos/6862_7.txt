I found the movie very good for what I expected. Although I am tired because I have a fear of injection needles, I expected to come when they came. So if you're not in needles, blood, the human body, and some good medical fun, put this movie back and hire another. As the other user told me, I was also happy with the German attempt to use a treasure movie. I'm an American who just moved to Germany to stay with a family and see it on the shelf. I love psychological vibrators, and I will say it is somewhere along those lines. A character falls into places and feels wrong. While trying to dig her way out and finding truth for a situation, things get a little tough and others aren't so sure she's on the right track. So in the film you are kept informed of whose anatomy you can get a look and who finishes the next corner.
