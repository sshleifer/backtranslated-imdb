I found this movie as one of those great heartwarming jewels. The story line is tightly woven and the character development is fantastic! Anyway, I'm a big fan of non-American movies and it's right there with: "Happenstance", "The Closet", even "King of Hearts." Vlastimil Brodsky as Fanda is fantastic. It is a love story in the true sense of the love of life and the twists needed to understand / enjoy the viewer of Fanda's life view (which almost costs him <br /> <br /> he is willing to give is wonderful. His co-star, Stelle Zazvorkova, is unforgettable as his brave wife. I recommend this movie to the whole family - my kids love it.
