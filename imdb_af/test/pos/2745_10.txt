Every Saturday morning at 11 am I watched Superstars. All the biggest events took place at this time. Challenge, which was broadcast on Sunday morning, was also decent, but all the great things happened on this show. Wrestlers will do all their interviews with Middelgen on a platform next to the live crowd or talk on their own on the screen before a background they have promoted. The matches were usually squashes, but sometimes you see 2 middle cards square in the main event. There were also maintenance courts that usually led to violence and therefore set up a feud. These segments ranged from Pipers Pit, The Body Shop, The Flower Shop, The Snake Pit, The Brother Love Show, The Funeral Parlor, and The Barber Shop. I don't remember any titles that change hands on this show. This usually happened at pay per view and Saturday night's main event.
