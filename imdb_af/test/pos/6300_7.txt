The movie is a very well made one, which is good and looking and passionate. You can say that every shot is done over perfectly. For the lovers of the theater it is especially good to watch and they should especially appreciate its beauty and the passion for the cinema that is placed in it. <br /> <br /> This movie is hard to put under one label. It's not really a drama, it's not really a thrill and it's not really a comedy. Instead, it's more of a movie with its own style, it does things its own way. It does not necessarily follow the rules of the theater and combines many different elements from many different genres. <br /> <br /> But just like the movie's main character, the movie becomes so slow and dull in parts. The artistic style of directing tries to conceal that the story is actually a very simple one and it is more like the movie relies only on its style and overall atmosphere created by the movie. It doesn't make the movie terrible or anything, but it just keeps it from being a real absolute. In parts, the movie also feels as if it is too poetic and tries to make the images speak for itself too much. It just feels a bit exaggerated in parts, but for most of the movie it works pretty well. <br /> <br /> It features some fantastic camera work and some unique storytelling, which also makes it an original as well as a good movie to watch. <br /> <br /> 7/10
