Why do people follow the herd's masses and critics? RANDOM HEARTS, directed by brilliant Sydney Pollack (which also plays a small role in the movie) is another Harrison Ford vehicle. As such, it is fairly good and entertaining. Certainly, anyone who is going to see it has it in mind, or read the book that is not better. Even Kristin Scott Thomas supporters, who I included myself, knew it would be a variation of her who would play the love of her oldest uncle again. Even so, the film is satisfactory. What's so bad about this movie that is much better in the other (much higher rated) Harrison Ford vehicles? This movie is not a masterpiece, but it is not as bad as the masses would believe the potential viewer.
