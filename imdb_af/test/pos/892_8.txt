Like NIGHT STALKER and then X-FILES, the show created a fantastic situation and the main characters had to choose it. In contrast, the hero (s) are not left to hold an empty pocket. They usually had tangible results. It has also been made clear that the 'good guys' were in a dirty occupation where they sometimes had to do some nasty things. Imagination, white, acting that hasn't always been too serious ... I miss it. One reason for this, I am very busy thinking of too many performances - BANACEK aside - which has done so well to take the viewer and grab their attention to the right of the bat. The authors excelled at drafting extremely unlikely, if not straightforward, situations, after which the characters had to get an explanation. Explanations that have often taken 90 degrees are in the clearly unexpected case, for everything that still made sense. Also, I agree with another reviewer that the Anabelle character was somewhat underutilized, but when she was on the screen, it wasn't just for eye candy. She was properly competent in her own right and rose to the two male leaders when she felt the point she justified. A rarity in those days. Sullivan? If he wasn't in the department, he would work for the KGB or CIA. He is such a cold, efficient, relentless type. He knows how the world works and realizes what it can do to get the job done. King? This is clearly a game for him. One he excels and he writes in the ideas for the detective / spy novels, he writes as his seemingly 'real' work. He is probably the best looking of the three, although they all have their moments and often as well. I agree that the ultimate spin-off series with only its character lacks the importance of the original.
