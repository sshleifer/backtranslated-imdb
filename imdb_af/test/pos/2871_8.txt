There is a brand new killer asleep, and he does God's work. Yes right! This killer lets Jason Voorhes look like a lot, and Freddy Krueger looks like a rag doll against this guy. He is Jacob Goodnight (WWE's Glen "KANE" Jacobs), a 7 'monster wearing an ax, and a hook and chain. Those weapons are nothing to him, his real coach makes eyeballs out of the victims. It's totally methodical! When the meeting happened 4 years earlier, Jacob killed a vegetable club and mutilated the veteran after putting a bullet in his head. How on Earth did Goodnight survive after 4 years? Now he is in the convicted hotel called Blackwell. And this hotel has many stories to tell. I thought this movie was so interesting and interesting. I like the part where Goodnight checked one of the girl's tattoos on her back. And Goodnight himself is really awful thanks to his manic mother. If you think something was 13 on Friday, you think better. This movie will leave you on the edge of your seat. And I think the eyeball rip was bone chilling. This movie proves it shows, and it wasn't a waste of my time. I enjoyed it. The title is not lying! Rating 2.5 out of 5 stars!
