Okay, I don't know if it counts as a spoiler. I picked the box anyway to save the hassle. <br /> <br /> I noticed that the views on this movie look fair. Personally, I loved it, though I have to say I think some of the cameos were there to have a cameo. (Peter Kay?) Personally, I'm just grateful that it wasn't the Edward, Tubbs and Papa Lazarou performances and that they chose the 3 best characters in the series to copy the movie, especially Sir Goeff Tipps. the funniest of the forest. <br /> <br /> Actually, it's less of a summary more of a rather blunt bloglike thing, but what the hell, the movie was great, and I think that's all that matters.
