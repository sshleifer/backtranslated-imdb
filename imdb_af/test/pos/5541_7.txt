I'm not a fan of this kind of comedy - stereotypical characters who work their way through a police and robbers farce. But there are plenty of nice characters to maintain interest. Michelle Pfeiffer is wealthy, but the person who really carries the movie is Dean Stockwell, who steals every scene as the killer (named Tony, no less). <br /> <br /> Stockwell's performance is why I am writing this review (and the only reason I would recommend it). You will be beaten by his screen time. He plays the boss perfectly, with comic touch in the right places, to prevent him from getting a click. In fact, Stockwell is a complete delight to watch - a master of the 'double take' and a true 'looker' in that elegant suit and fedoras. <br /> <br /> Meesa Says: A great movie to watch while folding or eating laundry.
