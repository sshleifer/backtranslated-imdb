"Five Fingers of Death" is a classic of the 70's kung fu cinema. If the movie that is out in the HK cinema in the west, it is a must for a serious fan of the genre. It is also a damn, entertaining movie, with a loud attack, non-stop action, solid and mostly credible combat chorography and an excellent over-the-top 70-era dubbing ("Oh I see ... so you want it the hard way! HWAA !! "). <br /> <br /> "Five Fingers" is an eye-for-eye revenge story ... and I mean literally eye to eye! It's great to see Lo Lieh a hero. He played so many bad guys later in his career, including Pai Mei in the classic FIST OF THE WHITE LOTUS, which was one of the characters Tarantino used to create the Pai May of KILL BILL. <br /> <br /> My only complaint is that I wish there was a better quality DVD - the mine seemed to be a VHS transfer. Overall it's a great movie - don't miss it! <br /> <br /> Bart Blackstone Film Club - Hollywood, CA
