I was 10 or 11 years old when this movie came out, and it has stayed with me for 35 years. When the movie came out, all the theaters in the St Louis area, as a lure, spread a pack of flower seeds that the film, etc. Had in front. On the back of the pack, it reads in so many words .... plant this seed at midnight. If a white flower grows, you are saved ..... but if a red flower grows, you are doomed !!! Suffice it to say that for an eleven-year-old child I did not plant the seed for fear of what might appear. Here's the spoiler: As the movie begins, you see a small toy bowl moving in the dirt. On a small road, a family town leaves, and suddenly the camera turns to the tank, and it's full size. It rolls over the car, and you see bloody limbs sticking out of the wreck, then, just as suddenly, the tank is small again. <br /> <br /> The reason why this movie was held with me for so long was because I have an exact toy tank than the one in the movie !!!! Unfortunately, I don't know what happened, but I've had a careful eye on the thing ever since! <br /> <br /> Turn off the lights, sit in the DVD, make a sandwich, and watch This movie. It's very good !!!
