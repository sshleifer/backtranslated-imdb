I loved it. Others have revealed spoils, but I won't. It was an unusual condition, actually kind of weird, but I went with it completely. Camille was a difficult part to pull off convincingly; Maybe that's why some people hated it. But I think Sienna was excellent and her acting skills enabled her to nail the part perfectly without being maudlin or ridiculous. I don't know why she's even interested in a loser like James Franco, but has married him anyway. I love him as an actor and also thought he did a tremendous job. He has nothing to be ashamed of. There are movies with similar essays, eg. "Ghost". I simply like Sienna Miller and went along with the situation as written in the script. I feel her great acting talent is largely underestimated and hopes it will be recognized more by the public. I thought all the actors played their parts very well, hoping that more people would watch the movie. I highly recommend it. I was surprised that my local Block Buster store had about 10 copies available. I'm definitely planning to buy it.
