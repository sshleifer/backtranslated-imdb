This film, without a doubt, is the clearest example of the British humor that the Germans cannot understand. One-liners run in a movie that is one of the greatest series of films in British movie history (St.Trinians). The story of bureaucratic incompetence in the midst of post-war trials enables Frank Launder to target maximum talent from all cast. It's probably the only movie in which Margaret Rutherford meets her match in Alastair Sim for strong characterization (she still wins). Joyce Grenfell (bless her) and Richard Wattis both deserve pressure in Dighton's English label masterpiece and tight upper lip. <br /> <br /> No Rutherford / Sim / Grenfell fan will be without this in their collection. Absolutely brilliant. Why 9/10? Only 83 minutes long.
