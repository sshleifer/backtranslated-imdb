I have to say that I know Mr Ã–rnek's documentary documents and therefore I knew that I would get a very well-made piece of film documentary. I was not disappointed. As a history nerd - I've seen hundreds of documentaries and enjoy the different approaches to this work. <br /> <br /> The director and his 17 consultants (historians, veterans families) have tried the reality of the gallipoli through the letters of both sides soldiers. So, history is followed by British, Australian and Turkish soldiers. <br /> <br /> This document is enhanced by their large voices by Jeremy Irons and Sam Neill, who reinforce the intensity and emotionality of these documentaries. <Br /> <br /> I watched this movie in a theater in Italy in Dolby Surround. I bought the DVD last year and will wait another 3-7 years for the next work of this talented director and his very good documentary. <br /> <br /> Summary: Well done. Intense. History with emotions - wrapped in a war documentary with great narrators
