Often TV series are transferred to the big screen, they lose their appeal. Not in this case! The historical accuracy of costumes, equipment and general art movement, such as the TV series, is outstanding. A great example of comedy and farce, with excellent script and comedy actors in real parts. Based on a classic TV series that stands alone in British TV comedy history.
