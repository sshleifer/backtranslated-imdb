It's always hard to bring a 450-page booklet to a three-hour movie. I read the book before, and I found the BBC production that handled the problem in the best possible way. The qualities of the book are not lost: the dense and lively depiction of a finger-knit patchwork family in London in the 1860s, the cold and obscene cruelty in which Maud is educated, the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking, the unexpected and surprising twists and turns of the story, the way the movie makes the spectators look like on the same screens as they are first told of Sue's point of view, then of Maud's one. The main actors do very well and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed, with a first highlight in a very loving scene between the two and ultimately forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and with each other. do, because they are still loving each other. <br /> <br /> For each of her books, the author, Sarah Waters, thoroughly investigated how life in the British 19th century was. While in the Velvet Tipping, it was the world of vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements, in Affinity, the terrible reality of women's tribes and the fashionable spirit ability. In Fingersmith she shows the public ceremony of people in London and the inhumane treatment of people who are supposed or condemned in asylum based on reading sources and scientific research. It is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high degree of historical truth. I recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful Victorian atmosphere, vibrant emotions and tension.
