I have to admit that I am a fan of the Cheese 80's cartoons, but this is one of the best. Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer are one of the most viewable and entertaining of the Rainbow Brite cartoons, and are much better than the TV series. I especially like the relationship between Rainbow and Darian and find it very amusing. My favorite character, however, is Starlite, which is definitely the most beautiful horse in the universe! <br /> <br /> I also recommend Rainbow Brite: New Beginnings, which tells how Rainbowland originated. Have a Rainbow Day!
