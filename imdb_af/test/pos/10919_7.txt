In & Out was a funny comedy with good performances by Joan Cusack, Tom Selleck, Matt Dillon and Kevin Kline. The thought that Kevin Kline was gay was very funny. If I were him, I'd hate to say I'm gay at his own wedding with his family, friends, and he'll be a wife there. Very rarely will this ever happen. I also loved it when he was dancing when the voice spoke to him on the radio. I would say that In & Out was a stupid comedy with lots of laughter and giggles. This is a recommended comedy and Kevin Kline had a good performance as a gay man. Trust me you will like this movie. <br /> <br /> 7/10
