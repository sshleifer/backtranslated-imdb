Do exactly what you expect, and then a few. The first movie was a step out of the TV program with smoother stunts that spread uncensored air and a gnarly factor that increased. Surprisingly, Jackass number two is even more twisted. <br /> <br /> The stunts have become more dangerous and spectacular, with a few thoughts that have painfully antique sprinkled with good fun sketches to change the smile into a horror of horror. <br /> Knoxville, as always, dominates the proceedings, but this time he has reason to take the middle stage, as he volunteers for the most dangerous and idiot of all the stunts, with Bam Magera also proving himself as wild as ever, despite his image printed in 'Viva La Bam'. Surprisingly, the renowned Wild Boys (Steve O and Chris Pontius) seem to be participating in less of the sketch, despite the focus on previous trips. <br /> <br /> If you like Jackass or Dirty Sanchez, you'll definitely enjoy this movie and at least explain it for 100 minutes. If you see it as childish, disgusting or a sad snapshot of today's youth culture, you will always consider it offensive. So f ** k off.
