It should be said that The Cell's director, Tarsem Singh, has established himself with his first function. It is considered one of the most visually stunning films in contemporary theater. <br /> <br /> The Cell is more of a visceral experience than a movie. As an excitement, it rises above most of its peers, with skilled editing and a cold score that effectively delivers exceptional excitement. However, it is ultimately Tarsem's skill for elaborate and disturbing set design and imagery that carries the film's frightening sense of terror. <br /> <br /> As with several recent films, I am shocked by the frightening hypocrisy among those who comment negatively on The Cell; In defense of the film, I will address some of these issues. The plot seems to be the biggest concern, and while it is not revolutionary and borrows heavily from the silence of the lambs, it was never the most important aspect of the movie; the plot itself is a vehicle through which Tarsem's vision - at the same time horrible and wonderful - is presented to the audience, in the same way that the plot of The Silence of the Lambs is secondary to the fascinating study of its two main characters, Lecter and Starling. While the silence of the lambs is clearly the superior movie, it is irrational that one condemns the plot of the cell and praises in the same breath the silence of the lambs. <br /> <br /> My final concern is the mention of "MTV styles" directed. It hurts me to see the condemnation of directors using innovative camera and cinematography techniques. A camera has the potential to be much more than just a tool to record events; corners, pans, color matching and so on, are all used to their fullest extent in The Cell for the purpose of creating a dreamlike state that could not otherwise be achieved. This is essential for the movie, as the whole point of departure is the visualization of a serial killer's subconscious. If you just want a series of static shots, stick to plays and give up theater. <br /> <br /> It's said The Cell is thoroughly entertaining, frightening and breathtaking in its pacing and design. Anyone who can see the hidden movies of the year 2000 may not be over.
