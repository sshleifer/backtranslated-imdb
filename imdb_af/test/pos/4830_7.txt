This is definitely the biggest surprise of the festival so far and definitely the best thing the festival had to offer. I went in this movie with little or no expectation after learning that the director was responsible for the terrible vampire movie The Forsaken. and I was pleasantly surprised. The movie star Lori story of In Crowd boasts as a young mother whose husband is just over. She moves into an old family home in the mountains with her two daughters next to a mine that is a tombstone for overworking children back in the day. Unfortunately for them, the children come back with a revenge that kills and eats everyone in their path. The film works on many levels. It is well done, exciting, especially for good cinematography and capable performances by Compton. The atmosphere is ghostly, but slightly understated, the score is decent and the makeup effects are gruesome and simplistic. The film shows a cunning and disturbing tone and the children themselves with light skin, torn lips and hollow eyes are pretty scary and unrelenting. The film is original and inventive without being artificial or complicated. I can't see this movie, but it makes it a great release without a little pruning and a little fine tuning. But they certainly have a good product on their hands and should pursue a kind of theater distribution. But the theater in which I saw it was terrible. The sound was very messy, which I felt was largely taken off the movie and it stopped in the middle because it couldn't center it on the screen that killed the mood a little. All in all, it was the most satisfying of horror festival entries, perhaps because it had the least expectations, but it was a welcome addition to genre films.
