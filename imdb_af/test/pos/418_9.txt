It is NOT your running police story where the characters were only secondary to the gunfights and car hunters. The episodes have so far been more realistic and intelligent. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for something with a very kick-Rambo style cop story, you won't find it here. <br /> <br /> I got it a 9. I wish this series was alive. Morse is excellent!
