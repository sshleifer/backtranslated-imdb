The internet is a wonderful thing isn't it? I watch a loaded episode of one of my all-time favorite documentaries, "Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War", from my DVR in Florida USA to my laptop in Kuwait; I'm writing a review on this series and just read another review from someone who actually lives in Vietnam! Amazing. I just want to say that Minh Nguyen argues that America has brought the war to Vietnam is one-sided. I know America was the main player in the west, but it takes two sides to wage war. The Soviets and the Chinese were major arms suppliers in the North, so why did Mr. Nguyen doesn't call them partly to blame, is an ignorance. (Well, I think we all know why he didn't call it, or ignorance to be resurrected in a communist system and his political dogma, or because he was afraid of the truth because of fear of arrest.) Also, Mr Nguyen, I think the northern parts are the main aggressor. The whole war was not shown in your country, so America blamed, showing ignorance. Regardless, it's interesting to read a review from Vietnam (of course, it can also be compiled, but I'll really take it), at least the communist east is somewhat open. As for the mini series; why do I like it? It focuses not only on American involvement. It was a war that began 15 years before America became involved and the series covers every facet of history, which is a real plus. The material used is the first time. All of the Vietnam war programs you see now will use the same image, so you won't miss out on watching this older series. The date this series was made is another plus. It has interviewed all the big players that you can't do now, because they are out of age, this is an important historical reference. Thirdly, Richard Basehart adds a very distinctive narrative voice, his voice sounding as exquisite as James Earl Jones's voice, and I think it's very steep. I don't think you can find a better war documentary ever made, it's like taking the relatively modern technology of 1980 and transplanting it after the 1950s and around all the generals and politicians on both sides of World War II. to maintain. This means the Vietnam War. <br /> <br /> OK, I see a bias, its subtle, a subtle bias from the 1970s like NPR "All Things Considered" bias where it all looks so straight, but when you shine you end with the head shakes. In this case, the later episodes do not show much about the role of the media and propaganda in general, all the useful tools to influence the outcome of a war, DO NOT THINK? <br /> <br /> 30 years later, an OIF war veteran goes through the same thing.
