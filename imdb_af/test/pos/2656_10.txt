Spoilers for. <br /> <br /> 2001: A Space Odyssey is without a doubt the most challenging and successful movie of late Stanley Kubrick. It's not a movie you're watching to be entertained or entertained. Instead, it offers you a meal for thoughts, images that are long in the mind's eye, long after the film itself is over. This is a movie you can meditate with. <br /> <br /> The film deliberately gives us more questions than it can answer. It is made to puzzle and mystery, yet leaves the viewer with a sense of awe and reverence. (which allows him to watch it, the enjoyment of this film is a bit of an effort on the viewer part). The questions it poses are great and ominous about the origin and destiny of humanity. ultimate place in the cosmic design and the existence or lack of creative intelligence behind the structure of the universe itself. <br /> <br /> The first of the films Four Quartets gives us a clear picture of the species past. We see our distant ancestors, half-monkey half-human, in a state of near famine. The climate has destroyed most of the plant life and vegetarian animals are near famine. An outdoor object, a perfectly smooth and angular black monolith, appears and the animals are simultaneously inspired by the presence of tools and violence. They are transformed overnight into carnevores, and when two tribes meet one another near a source of water, the trunk that has developed the capacity of tools, as well as location, destroys the neighboring trunk. The new head of the winning tribe, empowered by the first remnants of technology, triumphs the leg he used as a weapon in the air. We see the leg transformed into a swinging satellite, which contains nuclear weapons. We soon learn that the world is being torn apart by nuclear paranoia. The features inspired by the appearance of the monument we have ever helped to survive now threaten our existence. <br /> <br /> Once again, humanity is in a crisis, again the inexorable presence represented by the black monolith will enter humanity. In the next step in its development. An exploration of the Moon reveals a monolith identical to the previous one we saw. The governments of the world, usually mortal enemies, secretly met to discuss the implications. A mission is arranged. The monument is busy with some kind of radio communication with Jupiter. A few men will travel to the destination of the transfer. Most of them will be kept in a state of suspended animation for most of the time. The spacecraft pilot will be HAL a super computer programmed to imitate all the characteristics of people. <br /> <br /> The movie has many outstanding rows. As usual for Kubrick, the use of classical music is outstanding. The most memorable is "Blue Danube" and "Also Spake Zarathustra" (especially suited to the film's theme to convey the ordinary consciousness.) The cinematography is also excellent. After a single viewing, the last 30 minutes of the movie will haunt you for the rest of your life. <br /> <br /> The character of HAL is the most important of the view of the film's central thesis. To imitate all the characteristics of people, he also comes into their negative traits. The paranoia he develops that almost leads to the abuse of the mission is an exact mirror of the paranoia that allowed the political situation on earth to reach a point of desperate crisis. The film indicates that this is the trait we need to leave if we move on to the next stage of our evolution. <br /> <br /> The architecture of the film is also significant. Many of the spacecraft's designs are intended to represent reproductive organs and the process of birth and regeneration, the central motif of the movie. The end of 2001 is the most spectacular and triumphant ever filmed. <br /> <br /> This movie sees life as being presented in the poetry of William Butler Yeats and James Joyce's novel Finnegan's Wake. It is a pattern of history and human evolution that is cyclical, but progressive, repeats the same events at great intervals, but with the human race as it evolves according to the will of a being with a larger purpose in mind. Although we never learn what this purpose is, the film assures us that the human race is not intended for failure, but fate is beyond its ability to think. It amazes me that, despite this film, many people still regard Kubrick as a misunderstanding. <br /> <br /> This is a religious film, not in the conventional sense of adhering to any particular belief, but because of it is calling for wonder at the vast panorama of existence and It is involved in the deepest and most important questions of purpose and truth. <br /> <br /> In the hands of any other director, it might just be too much. Hollywood's view of life is punishing, usually to cover the grandeur and intensity of a vision like this one. But Kubrick was a visionary, straightforward with confidence, not only that he could handle such material, but that he was the only one to do so. The process of making this movie has used all its creative resources. The writing partnership with Arthur C Clarke is the most fruitful in film history. Kubrick had to find out about the special effects used in the movie's amazing climax. The resources to bring his vision to life did not exist at that time, so he established them. <br /> <br /> 2001 is an absolutely unique movie experience. Those who miss it do so at the expense of their own intellectual and imaginative abilities.
