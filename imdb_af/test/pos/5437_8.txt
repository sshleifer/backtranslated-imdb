Actually, I will admit that I am a political junkie, so it has reacted to me but the volatile nature of me. Green (yes I know what they did to her), but the end was such a copout and totally contrary to the movie. why. <br /> <br /> Why can't Barry L and crew just wonder what he's going to do? Let's discuss it. <br /> <br /> Instead, they have this "oh I'm not worthy" bullshit ending and it just shows that when the slides were off, it's better to leave the table instead of doubling. Stop the Disney end and put a bow on it. Life is not easy, they had to have the courage to give the main character a backbone. <br /> <br /> We had to listen to the whole movie to the rhetoric ... and then it cut and the stupid, Inane behavior by Mrs. Green (when the crap was out of her system) just made for a ridiculous, close end of the movie.
