A young Frenchman disrupts himself when he becomes an Erasmus exchange student in Barcelona and returns a better man. Sounds bored? Not at all! The film is filled with colorful people, all stereotypes (the British two and her racist brother, the sexually liberated dean, the ultra-organized German, ...). In this case, however, the stereotypes were done brilliantly. You feel like you know such people (I know one arrogant doctor and his trophy wife, and they are just like the characters in the movie!), They feel like real people! <br /> <br /> See this movie and enjoy the captions!
