I don't really know when TV stations started choosing to have handsome men as their reporters - regardless of man's IQs - but this was clearly a problem at the time Broadcast News came out and did the movie " a very good job to see it. While a love triangle between the white boy chief reporter Tom Grunick (William Hurt), the intelligent but nerve reporter Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) and the producer Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), the movie does not pull. Probably the best rule in the movie is when Tom says something: "I don't really understand what I'm reporting." And in the era of FOX News and such things become a movie like this even more important. <br /> <br /> All in all, definitely a movie I recommend. Also starring Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack and Jack Nicholson in a supporting role as the anchorman.
