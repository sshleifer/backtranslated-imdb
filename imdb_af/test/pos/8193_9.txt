The Emperor and the Assassin (with English Subtitles) at 161 minutes is long, but the time is full of a story that hardly fits into it. Golden hued palace scenes and dusty yellow panorama of Chinese landscapes background a true story of China's unifying King, about 300 BC. An intricate plot with a multitude of twists and turns is played out with excellent casts by the cast. King Qin's simple desire for a united kingdom for his ordinary people is fulfilled, but not without betrayal, plots and opposites and oh yes, bodies. Many bodies. This epic story of China's beginnings is a great way for Westerners to see little-known Asian history. Emperor Qin's legacy includes the thousands of terra-cotta figures of life-size excavation today. As a historical person, this film makes it clear that Emperor Qin must be seen with George Washington, Napoleon Bonaparte, Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan and Julius Caesar to name a few of the world's greatest victors / statesmen. I recommend seeing the emperor and the murderer, especially on the big screen.
