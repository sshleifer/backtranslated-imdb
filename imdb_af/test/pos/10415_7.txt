This photo is an interesting saga of the battle of pioneers led by Daniel Boone in the wilderness of Cumberland Gap while being threatened by hostile Indians. A treacherous Frenchman is the cause of all the troubles between the settlers and the red men while Boone tries to convince the Indians that the pioneers just want to build houses and live in peace. The film has a certain appeal because it is not a polished production, but there are good action scenes, although it is somewhat violent for its time. The role-players consist of B actors, but they are all good, especially Lon Chaney as the Indian chief. Bruce Bennett is good like Boone, but is a bit too clean and gentle to be credible as a boundary. The dialogue is fairly thin, but the landscape lends itself to the realism of the Kentucky backwoods.
