This is my favorite movie ever! <br /> <br /> I remember it when I was younger and since then I fell in love with it. I hired it so often from this one video store that used to carry it. And when we moved, I couldn't find it, so I go back until it's far away, just so I can watch the movie again! <br /> <br /> Eventually I got it for sale and I bought it and watched it over and over .... great movie! <br /> <br /> Since then, however, it was my first DVD that I found after getting my DVD player. All right, I got them at the same time, the quality on the DVD is better, I couldn't believe it! You must see this one!
