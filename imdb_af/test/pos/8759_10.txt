I can only agree with many observers that Traffik is one of the most memorable dramas ever made for television. I saw Traffik when it was on TV, and I just watched it again. I am especially surprised by the haunting original music of Tim Souster, and especially by the mad tribes of Dmitry Shostakovich's Room Symphony in C-minor (the music about the credits and parts of the film). The music exacerbates the despair of the characters while following their sad fate. The music is powerful emotionally. This arrangement combines two of the symphony's movements, but I recommend listening to the symphony itself.
