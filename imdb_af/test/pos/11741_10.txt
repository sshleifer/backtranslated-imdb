This star war correspondent William Holden divorced, falling in love with a beautiful Eurasian doctor Jessica Jones against the beautiful backdrop of Hong Kong. The cinematography is beautiful as they see a hill overlooking Hong Kong. The story is about racial tension, the society that rinses on mixed relationships and out-of-weddings. But what I like about it is the strong character of the heroine depicted by Jessica Jones, who is a Eurasian doctor who remains humble and steadfast in her altruistic mission and remains true to her love. In spite of this she is dismissed at her hospital because he is stolen with a married man by shooting a high ranking. One day, William Holden is called to the Korean war he covers and then that bad day, she gets the news of his downfall. Of course, the end is tragic, I cried when she went to their hill. It was a very loving love affair. It succeeded all the chances, the fact that she was fired from her job, how his wife would not give him a divorce, but their great love persevered - they had a great love in spite of everything. Personally, I do not believe in extra-marital affairs and think he should not have started something when he was bound to someone else and she should not have allowed her to make it happen, but despite that, it was a wonderful movie. I think the heroine overshadowed the hero. Jessica Jones is sultry and has delivered a beautiful performance, although I thought it was strange, they did not hire a real Asian actress or anyone with Asian blood. I agree with one review, Jessica Jones shaves sexuality when she falls to the ground and watches William Holden talking calmly, but her eyes come, take me now. <br /> <br /> I feel sorry most of the big movies were made before I was born, it looks like there are many Hollywood movies in depth missing, great acting and totally dependent on stunts and heavy sex scenes. It is truly one of the greatest boring love stories in movies.
