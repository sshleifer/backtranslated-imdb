This movie was wonderful. It has everything that a real action fan can have. Many people are shot and / or mutilated, a minimalist romance that includes sex, a hero that can be identified at multiple intervals, instead of a useless plot that only stores one scene at the end, and villains just asking. Bronson seems to be at its lowest level of tolerance in this movie and it shows. Ed Lauter made a big policeman and worked seamlessly in Bronson's plot without stealing his spotlight. The movie does not include a plot that is so boring or over-consuming that you will never see this movie again and again. On the contrary, you want to see Kersey in action and the storyline just gathers it. These are good things.
