A wonderful film in the best Scandinavian ouritch-magical tradition, with many suspicious analyzes of many of the big problems we are just facing. <br /> <br /> Must be mandatory for all politicians. <br /> <br /> Choose from privacy, core sustainability, global climate change, quality of life. <br /> <br /> Recall Thoreau's Walden, but with modern strife and considerable humor. <br /> <br /> I'm not Finnish, although I've traveled there and had good Finnish friends, but I found it quite accessible, and also culturally informative.
