After watching this DVD, I was on the floor. It's so wonderful. Not only does it take Led Zeppelin while facing performances, they stretch over a few years. It just shows the growth of the band, and the growth of their BIG music. This DVD is a MUST! The DVD is more than 5 hours long, with extras. The extras are also good pieces, some are from the group operating in Denmark, and other different promotions. It contains once lost images, gratefully restored and carefully restored to 5.1 Dolby Digital, under the direct supervision of Jimmy Page itself! Include many timeless classics, such as, Trap To Heaven, Go to California, What is and what should never be, Moby Dick, and so much more. Great acoustic songs are also included. It will correct any prosperity that Jimmy Page is not a supreme guitar legend!
