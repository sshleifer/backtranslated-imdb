I think every critic who posted "Tommy Boy" when released in 1995 should go back and watch it and learn it's not a bad movie at all. Each critic posted Chris Farley and David Spade's movies. Yes, "Coneheads" was funny, but some of them have a joke and "Black Sheep" I agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made. But "Tommy Boy" does not fall into the category of "Coneheads" which could have been a bit nicer and "Black Sheep". It is very funny and entertaining. I agree with the critics that Chris Farley was not John Belushi or John Candy because he claimed that the guys were idolatry and the guys had a genius for comedy, but Chris Farley was very funny and I wish he was longer to critics that Yes, he was not John Belushi, or John Candy, but he was very funny. The scenes between Farley and Spade as nemesis are a spectacular spectacular spectacle. It is very sad that Chris Farley is no longer here to make us laugh, but we have films like "Tommy Boy" to remember how really funny he was. Tommy Boy is one of the best comedies of the 1990s.
