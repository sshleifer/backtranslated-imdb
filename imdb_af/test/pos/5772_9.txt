This zany movie has the Ghost and Mr. Chicken as one of Don Knott's best movie shows. Knotts is an accountant for a Podunk Town Hall that is good for the swindling of citizens. They burn the "three skilled bookkeepers and keep the stupid one" (Knotts is of course the stupid one). When his rubbish removal cohort accidentally empties the wrong rubbish bin, Knotts finds himself in a bizarre trap set by the city council. Funny moments in the movie include the Bowling Alley Restroom scene, and the cemetery is absolutely hilaries. Typical Knotts, the nervous play is well used, and as usual, it is surrounded by very crazy characters from the sixties. Such actors as Frank Welker and Pitt Herbert add to the murder. As one can expect Knotts to be armed with a big car, a pretty girl, and no real idea of ​​what he is doing. Fun for everyone, especially nostalgia buffs, but just about everyone will love it.
