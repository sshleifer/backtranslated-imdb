Chris Nolan's labyrinth like noir about voyeurism and identity is incredible from start to finish. A first movie is as complicated as 'Memento' or 'The Prestige', although a bit harder to get a handle. Yet, it boasts originality and creative driving, and has a "twist" as intellectually challenging as it is realistic pulp. Few filmmakers made use of their editors and paid attention to Nolan's narratives. The story is about a bored writer who likes to follow random strangers in the street until he follows someone who has pursued him and pursued him, hence the complexity escalates and identities rearrange. More naturalistic and realistic than Nolan's later work, but just like razor sharp.
