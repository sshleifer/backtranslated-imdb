At first I didn't have much confidence, but as a Costa Rican resident, I can confirm that the movie shows the reality we live day by day and shows many things about our culture, like our way of talking, our music, our way of standing up for our rights without any fear, without any weapons. <br /> <br /> I am very proud of the work they did and how they didn't forget the message. they wanted us to receive, not care about the money, but actually work with a short budget so we can appreciate the beautiful scenes and the great photography. <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend watching this movie, you won't regret it.
