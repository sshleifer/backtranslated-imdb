Many animated buffs consider Wladyslaw Starewicz the great forgotten genius of one special branch of the art, puppet animation, which he found almost uniquely. . . And as it happened, almost by accident. As a young man, Starewicz was more interested in entomology than the cinema, but his unsuccessful attempt to fight two stag beetles led to an unexpected breakthrough in film generation when he realized that he could simulate the movement by manipulating and reprocessing carcases photograph a frame at a time. This discovery led to the production of Starewicz's incredibly elaborate classic short THE CAMERAMAN'S REVENGE, which he made in Russia in 1912, at a time when the film animation of all kinds was in its infancy. <br /> <br /> The political stir of the Russian Revolution caused Starewicz to move to Paris, where one of his first productions - by chance? - was a dark political satire, otherwise known as "Frogland" or "The Frogs who wanted a king." A thrill of black comedy can be found in almost all Starewicz movies, but here it is very dark, more aimed at adults who can appreciate the satirical aspects as children. Who will probably upset the climax. (I'm middle-aged and find it quite disturbing.) And indeed, prints of the movie intended for English-speaking viewers of the 1920s, filled title cards filled with lashes and quips around the sharp end of the final. <br /> <br /> Our story is in a swamp, the Frogland Commonwealth, where citizens are dissatisfied with their government and called a special session to see what they can do to improve matters. They decide to beg Jupiter for a king. The crowd is impressively animated in this opening sequence. It couldn't have been easy to make so many frog dolls alive at the same time. Jupiter, for his part, is portrayed as a drop of white-haired man in the clouds that looks as if he'd rather take a nap. When Jupiter sends them a tree-like god who cares them indifferently, the frogs decide that it is no improvement and demands another king. Frustrated, Jupiter sends them a stork. <br /> <br /> Look forward to this formidable new king who is above their towers, and the frogs welcome him with a delegation of formal dressed dignitaries. The mayor steps forward to give him the key to the Commonwealth, as newsroom recorders record the event. For everyone's horror, the stork eats the mayor fast and then he goes on a cheerful rampage, swallowing the people at random. A table card reads urgently: "News from the king's appetite spreads throughout the kingdom." When the newly created frogs again ask Jupiter for help, he loses his temper and pushes his community with lightning balls. The moral of our story, delivered by a fearless frog just before being eaten, is: "Just be enough." <br /> <br /> Considering the period that this surprisingly small film was made and the fact that It was made by a Russian emigrant at the height of the beleaguered country's Civil War, it would be easy to do so as a to see parable about the events. Starewicz had or could not have considered Russia's turmoil when making "Frogland", but whatever its choice of material, the film stands as a cautious story of universal application. "Frogland" may be the Soviet Union, Italy, Germany or Japan in the 1930s, or any country of any era that abandons its surveillance and is overwhelmed by tyranny. It's a fascinating movie, even a beautiful one in its macabre way, but its message is no joke.
