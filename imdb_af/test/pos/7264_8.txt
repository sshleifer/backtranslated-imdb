If you like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, chances are you will also like this. Although I think some of the British jokes (such as calling two London characters Dixon and Winterburn, to Arsenal's soccer players) may be losing some, it's still entertaining, which really pumps with vitality. <br /> <br /> Carlyle, Miller and Tyler are all excellent, bringing depth to their characters, and the interaction between the two main players is always well judged. Indeed, Scott's direction is very sure, as it is his first feature film and proves he has his father's talent to put us in an unfamiliar environment at ease. <br /> <br /> Hell, I have convinced myself. I'll see it again!
