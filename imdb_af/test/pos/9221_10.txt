I loved it, but I'm an 80 year old child. I loved Rainbow Bright my whole childhood. I don't know if little ones were interested in the show these days, mine. (But that's right, I bought it anyway. I just brought the little one so the man at the cashier's stand would not see me funny.) I love the non-violent drama and the colorful landscape. It only reminds me of a simpler time before cartoons had more violence than our local news could legally point out. :) Although I might just be a little bias on the subject. Then I was Rainbow Bright 6 years in a row for Halloween ........ I wonder if they make a Rainbow Bright costume for adults. Lol.
