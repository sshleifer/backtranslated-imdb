... scratch it. Just as Africa's rhythms created with the donkey's jaw and Virgin Islanders welded oil drums into overall steel straps, the urban DJ's gland also demanded the pursuit of new methods of creative expression. "Scratch" is a totally non-ranked documentary that will bring you to the heart of the hip-hop / rap movement and the emergence of turntablism, the art of scratch vinyl and the ultimate DJ / MC contempo exploration of amusement. The film unveils some surprisingly intelligent and articulated "Scratchers" with incredible unique capabilities in concert and competition where the rhythm meets the street. Good things for anyone interested in grass roots or ghetto gutter movements in art. (B)
