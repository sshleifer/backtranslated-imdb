Make it short and to the point. This movie was fantastic! I love it! I actually chose it on a Hollywood video for $ 3 on VHS and it has been around 5 times over the past few weeks. I'm a big Bogart fan and I just closed this movie. I thought the song was funny and now has it as a ringtone on my phone. Robert Sacchi is big and pulls off a good Bogart. His nose is a bit big, his voice is a Bogart-Columbo mix, and he does a few things that are uncomfortable, but otherwise he was fantastic and this movie was great. No one can be a perfect Bogart, but he was wonderful. Remember, Sam Marlow is a fan of Bogart and won't do everything he did. He calls many other movies and does a few things that were never part of the true Bogart character. But it's so funny and hilarious and has a good role, including beautiful women. Watch it and enjoy it!
