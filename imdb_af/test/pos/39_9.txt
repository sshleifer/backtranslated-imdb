Since the Divine Me. Merkerson as a sex therapist in Spike Lee's "She's Gotta Have It" first met, I was sold to the series of this highly gifted, terrifying actress. She received an Emmy for her portrayal and to say it is well-deserved is a masterpiece of understatement. <br /> <br /> Here she simply shines as the guiding force and gives her community. It was especially pleasant to me, because I grew up in this same period. The production detail was phenomenal and has wooooooooooooonderful memories of life and times during the 50's and 60's and of women like me. Merkerson depicted. She was thorough and accompanied by a warm, warm casting with performances that one would enjoy over and over. I first saw Macy Gray's name in the credits and went. Her performance was so good, I didn't even recognize her about a third of the way through. I am particularly proud of the obvious care and attention to detail to produce a very tastefully created feel and look of another beautiful era in African American culture. <br /> <br /> Another very interesting aspect is that the project was less worried about the racial fabric of the times, but infinitely more focused on the wealth of characters and the emotional diversity they offer to illustrate that it is ultimately about the choices we make and to what extent we accept responsibility for those choices. <br /> <br /> It's a worthy, elegant presentation of African American life and surely destined to become classic. You owe it to yourself to have it as part of your collection. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
