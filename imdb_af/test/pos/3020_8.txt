The cell is poor on plot, filled with holes and has rather bad acting. but none of this, because director Tarsem Singh has given us one of the most visually stunning films ever. the whole plot is just an excuse to make you foolish and bring you into the minds of a serial killer, bringing the spectacle of shocking, pleasing, breathtaking and sensible images. <br /> <br /> The images of this beautiful movie will stay with you for a long time. This movie is a perfect case for the "suspension of unbelief" theory. Forget the stupid plan, let your senses be overloaded with the images. and J.Lo looks great enough to add to the rest of tarsem's work. cinematography is harrowing, the music haunting and the costumes just gorgeous. <br /> <br /> The movie is less of a movie and more of a work of art. It's just that the medium is no longer cloth, it's the big screen and celluloid. one of the most refreshing movies of this decade. The cell is a must see. A brave new step in making movies. <br /> <br /> An exciting 8!
