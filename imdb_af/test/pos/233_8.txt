I'm not a big fan of musical, but I was always awarded to me. Hayworth's body, so I thought I'd try it. <br /> <br /> It can be the best showcase for the multi-talented Ms Hayworth. She never looked more beautiful in a movie (with the possible exception of 'Gilda', where she is a gender symbol). <br /> <br /> Rita is more than bravely assisted by Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. The comedy can be dated, but it is quite amusing. Kelly does one of his tour-compelling dances that dance with the image of himself from a window. <br /> <br /> But Rita drives the whole movie. An excellent cast, with Otto Kruger and the always wonderful, wise Eve Arden, doesn't hurt. <br /> <br /> Rita sings, Rita dances, which seem impossible! The music may be short of classic, but the lyrics for most of the songs are pretty clever. <br /> <br /> I find this movie works better than 'Gilda', which I consider a defective movie. For Mrs. Hayworth's credit, she also drives 'Gilda', and Gilda drives some red-blooded male insane. <br /> <br /> The movie has been doing well over the years. Many sweets for the male audience are a great bonus!
