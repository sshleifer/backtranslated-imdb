I forgave and loved the Franklins at a Paramount screening. I must be honest. I really didn't want to go and I got pretty nice about the movies made today. I have to tell you. Forgive The Franklins were fresh and wonderful together I laughed my ass. It was a wonderful storytelling. I couldn't believe two guys shot it and brought the whole thing. I thought if these guys could do such a movie with this budget, they think what they can do with big money behind them. And then I thought the scratched guy would probably be the studios ... anyway. It is said thanks guys who I lost and in your movie and therefore I go to the movies to forget the world for a few hours.
