In an era where almost every major horror movie of the sixties and seventies is played for audiences, fired on today's horror slips, it's not nice to look back at John Carpenter's 1982 OPUS THE THING, which itself remake - from a childhood favorite of the director, Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi / horror classic THE THING FROM OUTER SPACE. Although Carpenter's film wasn't initially as big as a box released in the middle of 1982, it has since become a huge success. <br /> <br /> In fact, Carpenter's movie is less of a remake of Hawks movie. if it is a rework, as he goes back to the original idea put by the source material, namely the John W. Campbell story "Who Goes There?", in which an American scientific crew in Antarctica is threatened by a form changing alien after 100 000 years from the ice thaw. Kurt Russell, who explored paranoia in the director's 1979 television movie ELVIS and the 1981 film ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, a movie of stalar character characters including Keith David, Donald Moffat, Richard Dysart and Richard Masur. form-changing "thing" that first comes into their camp in the form of a guide dog trying to kill a Norwegian team, one by one. It is not long before everyone in the camp starts to trust his fellow man. The end of the film, in which Russell and David remain the only one, has a disturbing and cold ambiguity associated with the similar codice to both the BIRDS and POWERS. <br /> <br /> Almost universal, when the subject of the thing is bought, the emphasis is on the extremely gory special effects makeup and alien designs created by rob botin that worked with carpenter on the 1980 horror classic THE FOG and on Joe Dante's 1981 werewolf film THE HOWLING. These effects are indeed very spectacular and graphic, and even today they can be quite tummy. But all this will make Carpenter's movie nothing more than a high-end explosion epic as the direction, the story and the acting were not sniffing; and every one of them is happy. If he does not focus on the enormous gruesome transformation sequences, Carpenter builds tension in the same Hitchcock-influenced way, bringing his previous films HALLOWEEN and THE FOG up to date, with Dean Cundey's cake maker, especially through the station, a meaningful help. The play improves both fine screen matching by Bill Lancaster; And we also get a solid score by Ennio Morricone, whose work on Sergio Leone's director Sergio Leone's classic Italian Spaghetti Western 1960s is all known, including of course Carpenter himself. The DING also features extra-fine visual effects from Albert Whitlock (who has worked on many Hitchcock movies, including THE BIRDS), and Roy Arbogast, who worked on CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND and JAWS 2. <br /> <br /> Carpenter's film was not the success it could have been, as Universal chose to release this graphic shocker just two weeks after he released Steven Spielberg's much more family-friendly ET: DIE EXTRA TERRACE (not surprisingly, critics and audiences at the Spielberg excellent film about Carpenter's equally excellent but very different one). Also, most of the horror movie box office business in 1982 goes to another Spielberg-made film, POLTERGEIST. As a result, the DING suffered a lack of attention in its time at a cost of $ 15 million. <br /> <br /> Over time, however, many people came to see Carpenter's movie for what it is. stingy but extremely intelligent combination of science fiction and horror, with a great deal of flair and a true understanding of the psychological paranoia at the heart of his story. Although it is quite horrible, the DING must be remembered so much for the skill of the story as it is for the greedy alien designs and make-up effects; because it is the storytelling skills and the tension that makes it so memorable in the final analysis.
