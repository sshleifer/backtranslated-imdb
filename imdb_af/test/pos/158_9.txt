Thirst <br /> <br /> I found this movie beautifully made. The cinematography was well above excellent. I can freeze almost any frame, and you will have a beautiful photo yourself. The use of color comes out most. In many cases, the camera was thrown through the scene and the work was flawless. <br /> <br /> Park Chan Wook's direction was fantastic. He firmly believed me in his secret universe. There were some touches of verbal and visual humor (of a dark nature) that only gave a different depth to the picture as a whole. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't mention the play, but it suited the movie well and worked well. enough. <br /> <br /> For me, the only place this movie lacks was in the story. Sometimes I won't lie, but the runs between characters just didn't make sense. Sometimes the story flow was clunky. Overall, I was disappointed with the muted story, and I felt it ran a little too long. <br /> <br /> But I still recommend this movie, for its vision, its visual thriving, its dark humor and at the end of the day, it's an interesting movie, even if it's imperfect. 9/10
