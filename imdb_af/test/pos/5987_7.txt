I was glad this movie did without all the suspected depth of too many pseudo-serious interracial movies. race was a problem, yes, but so was class ... and loyalty ... and honesty, etc. <br /> <br /> I also had the idea that the love affair is not only in the 'decorative' aspects of any character's appearance. are not our divorce courts (on both sides of the Atlantic, I dare!) filled with enough couples who thought "look good together." Is everything needed to make a solid marriage? Anyway, the softness and sensuality of both characters was thick enough to cut in love scenes that would bring a rainbow on a brave day! In other words, a light film that is not a light weight at all!
