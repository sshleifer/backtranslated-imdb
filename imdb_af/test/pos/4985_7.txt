It is another western about a greedy cattle baron to express peasants and farmers. This has probably been done before and before. But the violent men are something special. <br /> <br /> What makes it special is Barbara Stanwyck who plays the role of vixen, as she often did in her later films. She is married to cripple Edward G. Robinson, who is the cattle baron here, but Robinson is crippled and there is a hint that his injuries may leave him incapable. No matter for Barbara, whose needs are met by her brother-in-law Brian Keith. It's not good with Dianne Foster, who is Robinson and Stanwyck's daughter, or with Lita Milan who is Keith's Mexican girlfriend. <br /> <br /> The infidelity subplot almost takes over the film, but Glenn Ford as the stalwart peasant who is a Civil War veteran comes west for his health to keep his own here. He's every inch the quiet western hero who makes people mistake to press too often. I almost expect those famous words of Wild Bill Elliott to come out of Ford's mouth, "I'm a quiet man." This would be very applicable in The Vioilent Men. <br /> <br /> The fifties were the age of western western, themed horse operas not previously investigated. The next year, Glenn Ford, would do another western, Jubal, one of his best, also investigating infidelity as a plot component. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of traditional Western stuff in the Great Men and enough for those addicted to soap operas.
