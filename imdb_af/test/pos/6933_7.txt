I'm a glutton for B-movies. I love the old Drive-In prize like this movie. This movie, which is made for very little money, looks like it does one thing that some bigger budgeted movies fail. This is cheezy. It's gory. It didn't have a real plot, but it entertained me for an hour and a half. I laughed or covered my eyes. There are a few big effects like a shot of INSIDE an old man's mouth when he is stabbed by a knife in the chin and pierces it through his tongue and hits his mouth and hatches with a guy that ran out of his eyeballs. But there are also many zombies, and a few psycho-killers have patterned on the jaw saw massacre of Texas and a devil had scarecrow. I loved the dialogue that kills murderers if they torture and kill people. It has a great camera work, and some cool editing tricks. This one is more original than the first Bloodbath, and the undead seem better, but it is still patterned to the so-called trashy zombie movies of the 70's and 80's. It still has a very strong cheeze factor. Don't expect Romero, just two-day Fulci. I will say that Horror fans will enjoy it, and it's funny and cheesy and a fast ride through B-movie Land.
