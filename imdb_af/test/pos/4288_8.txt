If we could have 'Separate Tables', why not 'Separate Lies'. <br /> <br /> This is somewhat involved. A housekeeper's husband is killed while being hit by a car during a bicycle. The culprit seems to be the woman she is cleaning for. The latter had a relationship with a friend and was driving the car with the loved one in the car when the accident occurred. To further complicate matters, the housekeeper once worked for the old man's parents and he captured her for the steal. Therefore, people would hesitate to believe that it was his car that caused the accident. Sounds like she wants revenge. <br /> <br /> It's all over. When our housekeeper discovers that her boss is driving the car, she has returned her testimony very much to the dismay of the officer working on the case. <br /> <br /> As if that wasn't enough, a few months later, our loved one (Rupert Everett) is terminally ill and our wife (Emily Watson) leaves her husband (Tom Wilkinson) to care for him . <br /> <br /> The play is pretty good here despite the ever-ending "Peyton Place" theme as Tom Wilkinson is a lawyer trying to protect his wife. <br /> <br /> The movie is a good one, but we could have done without the terminal illness, well, marriage ended anyway.
