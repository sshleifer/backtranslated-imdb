This film is not only the last piece of the Tri-color trilogy, but also the best of the three and one of the best films of the 90's. There is hardly any movie so wise and consequently demanding humanity and respect for every human being. <br /> <br /> Valentine (Irene Jacob) lives in Geneva, where she works as a model. Although she has a boyfriend, it looks like she's quite lonely. One night she crashed and injured a dog and led her to his owner, a retired boy (Jean-Louis Trintignant), who was cynical and spied his neighbors' phone calls. He became disgusting to her and couldn't get away. Two lonely souls meet and become friends and develop a deep love for one another. <br /> <br /> The story itself is too complex to tell completely. There is another connection between them in a young man who represents both the judge and Valentine's true love and there is more to their relationship than just friendship. <br /> <br /> The actors are wonderful, Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant, who develop a deep and authentic friendship. <br /> <br /> The topics have endless validity, brotherhood, not only in contact with each other, but also in respect of the right to privacy. It seems frightening to lose this right, which makes movies like this even more important than it would have been in 1994. <br /> <br /> Red is one of the strongest colors that exists, representing inner turmoil, love, anger and passion. Use here as another protagonist, this brings an unprecedented depth to the movie. A masterpiece!
