I previously heard about "gaming" and "dungeons and dragons", but I knew it could be as I saw in the "Gamers: Dorkness Rising." These guys are so funny and fun to watch. Especially the man who plays the "bard" or "minstrel" or whatever, he has a gift for physical comedy and timing. There are so many background humor and energy in some of the screens that make you think at least part of it is improvised. The special effects had to be worked on a bit, but I saw it at a convention last year and that is one of the things they said they are going to repeat and improve, so it's probably angry now!
