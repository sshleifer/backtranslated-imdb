It was Libby who talked to Desmond in the jump-back, and if someone confused her past (such as how she came to the same hospital in Hurley was in) then you should know that Libby disappeared in season 2, the character will investigate be. more in season 3 and we will get answers to questions about her. <br /> <br /> VAT, major episode. It had a very big stone hanger and had some interesting questions ... like I had with Eko and Lock and what about the four ton image? <br /> <br /> I can't wait until season 3, just lose rules !!! I hope all the unanswered questions will be answered. I loved how they explained why the plane actually crashed. Desmond did this when he couldn't type the numbers in time. 4 8 15 16 23 42
