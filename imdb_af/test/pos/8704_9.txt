I was ten years old when I saw Subspecies, I immediately had the dots for Michael Watson and Laura Tate, they really have a big screen chemistry in the earlier parts of the movie. I ordered a copy of Full Moon in 1993 and I learned it: Ion and Rosa, the servants, have much more roles in the script with the king. What most people do not know is that there was an alternate sequence that would happen in the final scene: Michelle and Stefan are left in a room and Michelle has the idea that Stefan will make her a vampire to help fight Radu and her demonic controlled ex-friends. But for some reason the scenario never made it on camera. Another scene in the screenplay, which can be confirmed from the original trailer, shows Stefan drinking blood from a wolf, or actually in the trailer, seeing him with blood on his chin. <br /> <br /> This movie gets a 9 because it is one of my childhood and I attached good memories to the characters; although my favorite characters were Stefan and Michelle, I think Anders Hove's Radu is pure feeling-evolutionary acting, so much feeling in his work there.
