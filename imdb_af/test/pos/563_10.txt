Very good movie. Very good documentaries. <br /> <br /> Very good to see those pest detectives humiliate and invented as hidden, narcissistic, heartless pigs, their single-parent parents, community and environment they have. <br /> <br /> I think of my cover for Pat McGuinness. Can we get this decent man on some sort of 911 commission or inquiry? We need its integrity, endurance, intelligence, clarity and spirit to fight the real game of world politics and big business. <br /> <br /> All the animals come out at night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venals. One day a real rain will come and all these bumps off the streets. Pat McGuinness should be the first drops of that real rain. The people who control this earth are animals. They must be drowned. <br /> <br /> I'm just in shock. Walking the night is frightening. The inhumane weeping and lashing of detectives, in Murder on a Sunday morning. In Pat McGuinness's burning spotlight, they look terribly captured, terribly guilty, and ready for a just and terrible drowning. <br /> <br /> In a world where punters play a game, see justice done and see that every narcissistic criminal is drowning like the pathetic human rats they are. <br /> <br /> How does it feel that you are the railroad, horrible, messy fingers of the law? How does it feel that you found out your regular persecution, your dedicated confession, your contracted investigations for what it really was? How does it feel? <br /> <br /> I hope it turns like a knife, you're unlucky, one eyewitness.
