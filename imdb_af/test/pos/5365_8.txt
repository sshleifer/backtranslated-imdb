I saw it at the 2004 Stony Brook Film Festival in NY and it is getting very hot. In this pre-WW2 movie, a few German rocket scientists work on the Scottish island of Scarp as war guards on the horizon. The characters found on the island are invaluable in their creation and depiction. Shauna MacDonald is particularly memorable. <br /> <br /> After gaining speed at the "Scootish" events, the viewer feels right at home with these entertaining people as the Germans connect their island to the continent via a rocket-based mail delivery. As impossible, this movie seems to be based on a real story. <br /> <br /> All in all, an unforgettable movie that has stayed with you for some time, thanks to its casting, its story or its scenery.
