I actually first watched One Dark Night in the theater and wrote a review of the movie for my high school newspaper. I loved it and I still love it. The storyline revolves around two people. First, one woman learns that her father has telecommunications after his death. She then felt herself about the strange powers of her father, even in his death. The mousepad is buried in the play for the other main character. A high school girl does anything to come in with a group of girls just wanting to worry and dare to stay in the muzzle all night to join their group. They go back at night to scare her and scare themselves. The film is led by Meg Tilly with supporting roles by Adam West and one of my personal favorites Elizabeth Daily aka E.G. Daily. Going out if you love 80's movies and cheese-like horror movies, you won't be dissatisfied.
