Having recently seen Grindhouse, I was watching Video USA for some of the movies that have been playing in real-life movie theaters over the centuries. The Hong Kong action movie Five Fingers of Death looked just like a picture. The cartoon-like sound effects and the quick jumps were initially a bit distracting, but after a while I was so involved in the story and the characters I didn't care about. Parts of the music score sounded like the "Ironside" TV theme song that was later used in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies. Some scenes of the hero's fianc√© are parody, but they were so short that they didn't destroy the movie. The most exciting parts include the tournament and some vengeance segments thereafter. Worth seeing for kung fu fans!
