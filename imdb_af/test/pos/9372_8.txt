"Crossfire" is not remembered so much because its three stars all had the first name "Robert", but one of the first Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism. <br /> <br /> The story opens With the murder in the silhouette of a man who later teaches us, a Jewish man named Joseph Samuels (Sam Levene). Pipe smoking police captain Finlay (Robert Young) was assigned to the case. An ex-soldier, Montgomery (Robert Ryan), arrives at the murder scene and teaches us by flashback that he met Samuels in a bar, along with other soldiers who were out of service after World War II. . <Br /> <br /> According to Montgomery, he and pal Floyd Bowers (Steve Brodie) followed Samuels and Cpl. Arthur Mitchell (George Cooper) to Samuels drinks apartment. Montgomery tells Finlay that Mitchell first left the apartment and that he and Floyd soon followed Samuels still alive. <br /> <br /> Mitchell can't find him, and Finlay suspects him of the murder. He remembers Sgt. Peter Keeley (Robert Mitchum) to help him find Mitchell. Mitchell, meanwhile, wonders the streets in a dazed state. He meets prostitute Ginny (Gloria Grahame) in a bar and establishes a friendship. She gave him a key to her apartment and he went there to rest. An unexpected man (Paul Kelly) is looking for Ginny. Mitchell, still in a haze, departs and returns to meet Keeley and his friends. Keeley manages to keep him from police and hide him in a whole night filmhouse. <br /> <br /> From Mitchell's perspective, we learn that Montgomery hates the Jews and is probably the killer. Finlay began his investigation on Montgomery trying to prove his guilt. He arranges to have one of the soldiers, a child named Leroy (William Phipps) has a trap for Mongomery. <br /> <br /> "Crossfire" is considered one of the best of the "film noire" genre. In fact, it has won several Oscar nominations, including Ryan and Grahame for the best supporting actors. It was made on a modest budget in about three weeks. <br /> <br /> It has all the elements of classic "movie noire", the shadows, low key lighting and the story that mostly spells out at night. The required "femme fatale" of the piece is Grahame's Ginny who plays a small role but is still your classic "femme fatale". The nameless character that Paul Kelly (played in an excellent way) chewed and spat out by Ginny and was she planning to do the same to Mitchell? <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan steals the picture as the brutal Montgomery, though it would be similar in style for the coming year. Robert Young makes a good low key detective, but Robert Mitchum is a little different from being a Mitchell character. Others in the film are Jacqueline White as Mitchell's wife, Lex Barker (who will be playing next year as Tarzan) as one of Mitchum's soldier pals and Richard Powers (formerly known as Tom Keene) as Finlay's assistant. br /> <br /> Director Edward Dmytryk will soon run from the House's Un-American Committee with communist affiliates and spend a few years in prison.
