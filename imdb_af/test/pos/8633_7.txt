Having read so much negative pressure on this movie over the past few years, I have always avoided it, but the advent of the cheap public domain DVD encouraged me to finally watch it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it was transferred from a poor copy. The modern prequel, shot at tinted stock, is vague and the contrast does not exist. Faces are sometimes hard to figure out. That said, the real story is entertaining and Lou comes across as a perfect actor, more than in many of the boys' movies. <br /> <br /> Once the movie switches to the Jack story, the movie has changed to "color" and I use the term loosely. Most colors are orange or brown. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Ford as 'Polly', the giant's daughter, was a big plus to me because I enjoyed her in an early Andy Hardy look. <br /> <br /> With so many negative comments on the real quality of the print, I'm still happy to give this movie a 7. It laughed a lot to me and it is more than the majority of comedies I watched. manage the decades. <br /> <br /> One to see if you get the chance.
