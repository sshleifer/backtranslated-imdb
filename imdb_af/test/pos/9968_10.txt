I saw the Venice dealer in London last week. Great plays by Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Finnes and Lynn Collins. Compare with other films based on Shakespeare's play, this production made the game so easy to understand and follow. Bravo to Michael Radford to direct such top actors. The costume and scenery are wonderful and as it is filmed in Venice, it gives the film and authentic fragrance. I read the play at school thirty years ago, and the emphasis was on the characters' anti-Semitic behavior towards the Jews and the cruelty of the Christians. I don't know if this movie is going to be controversial, but anyway, I'm sure it will get little Oscar nominations.
