This was the third time I tried to watch this movie. The previous two times I found the beginning so sickly sweet and "schmaltzy" that I just stopped watching. However, being a little older and more compulsive, I forced myself to watch the movie and I was very surprised to see that I really enjoyed it. So I look at the movie the same way I will watch the swim in the ocean when the water temperature is 70 degrees (that's about 21-22 degrees Celsius for all the metric loved ones out there). Certainly, the water is extremely cold and shocking at first, but if you stay in the water yourself, you get used to it. Resist that urge to jump right away! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a long exchange between Flynn and his daughter, played by a slothful Patti Brady. Some may find there conversations very cute and engaging, although others may find them a bit difficult as these moments are so cute! In a way it was a wonderful thing by Flynn, because it is difficult to imagine him in real life with children or actors, especially that he wants to be true to one woman in this movie - now it works! NEVER say GOODBYE about divorced couple, Flynn and Parker, and their mutual desire to remarry. As they both love each other, as well as their relentless child, it seems like a preliminary conclusion that they will tie the knot again. However, there are some serious issues that stand in their way: Lucille Watson (who plays her regular transferring and controlled mother-in-law), Flynn's girlfriend (he is Errol Flynn and he is divorced, so you should expect him to be a girl there must have) and a marine (played by Forrest Tucker). <br /> <br /> Not all of these things are coming to an end and everyone is happy to live. Despite being formal and predictable, the movie is a winner because it's so much fun to watch. Flynn, despite his reputation as an action-adventure hero, is very good at comedy romance and it's just a lot of fun to see him. The movie also has the cold hugs Sakall - he is just as gosh-darn cute and sweet that he is perfect in this kind of movie. And in spite of the sweetness, the film was written fairly well. The bottom line is the movie is fine. <br /> <br /> So my recommendation is that you watch this movie and force yourself not to touch the sickly sweet aspects of the movie. Once you've got this, the rest of the movie is a photo worth your time.
