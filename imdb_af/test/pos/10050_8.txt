The Custer Legend, a la Warner Brothers Epic. There is no casting present here, with flamboyant Flynn as the flamboyant Custer in this exciting tribute, not only for Custer, but also for the men of the 7th Cavalry. The story traces the life of the famous 'Boy General' from his turbulent days at West Point to his last battle at the Little Big Horn. Great freedoms are taken here with facts and we are presented with a Custer that is much more sympathetic to the condition of the red as far as history is concerned. But this one was done on such a large scale, the fighting tones only worked for every extra in Hollywood. Down beat ending and it's great!
