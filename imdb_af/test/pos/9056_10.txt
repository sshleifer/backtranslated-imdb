I usually keep away from Film Festivals and don't enjoy a slap comedy, but I have to say this picture was good. I immediately recognized David Krumholtz of the TV show "Numbers" and Lorraine Bracco, Roseanne Arquette and Karen Black. It is comedy at an incredibly high level with visual, spoken and satirical interactions retained by the audience, and I laugh at a rather deeply rooted plot. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Mr. Parness for dealing with a delicate, but truly, subject in a way that can be enjoyed by every audience at every level of intellect. The plot remains throughout the film and the comic relief adds the message without being so thick that it twists. The mixing of segways is done beautifully and the overall product is wonderfully tasteful. <br /> <br /> I can certainly say that this movie is one that goes a long way and should be seen by audiences of all ages; the problem is real and so is the powerful impact of this production.
