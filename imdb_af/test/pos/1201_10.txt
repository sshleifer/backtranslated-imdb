I'm not a big musical fan, but it's one of the few I really love. Unlike many other music, such as "The Sound of Music," none of the songs is about gratuitous stuff. Each song is social commentary, intelligence on war, sexuality, recognition, spirituality and freedom. Especially amazing songs are "easy to be hard", "age of Aquarius", "hair", "flaws / 3-5-0-0", "walk in space" and "hare crunch". Totally revolutionary and wonderful. I can't wait to see one day!
