It is a funny, intelligent and, in a sense, realistic comedy about a 14-year-old trying to experience her first love on vacation, as well as the complex, sometimes amusing, sometimes touching relationship between divorced father and her growing daughter ... and how far a woman (not just Nicole, the teenager) can go to get the man she loves! I laughed a lot at this lively scenario that never dragged on.
