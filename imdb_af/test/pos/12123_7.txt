I don't know if it's fair for me to review it. I'm not a fan of gratuitous violence. I have never understood the film industry that makes heroes out of mob members and cold-blooded killers. When the Godfather came out, I thought they broke the shape, but the decade made a series of well-known gang movies with big stars and directors. This one is, of course, low budget, but it is certainly well done. At some point in all these things, I feel like I want to shower. If such characters actually exist, it is difficult for the soul. I always know that mankind will rise above these kinds of things. This kind of litter should be stopped. I hope the people who go to movies are more voyeuristic and less vicarious. I feel similar to slasher movies. Why do we have a fascination with death and dissolution? In fairness I judge it on the play and direct it, and for what it looks, it looks good to work.
