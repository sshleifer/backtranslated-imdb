This film is full of interesting ideas. Some scenes are really hilarious. The dialogues are greasy and commonplace. The tension in the movie doesn't come as much from the "murder mystery" plot as to the relationship between the characters. The film tells two stories in parallel. <br /> <br /> The first story involves the characters played by Trintignant and Kassovitz. Trintignant is an aging driver, with a somewhat ridiculous macho toughness, followed by a naive young man who is played by Kassovitz with many benevolent smiles. Many good moments in the film come from the contrast between the two characters, for example when Trintignant tries to teach Kassovitz how to intimidate. <br /> <br /> The second story tells how a salesman, played by Jean Yanne, gives his work and wife to find the murderer of a young friend. Yanne plays the part with some kind of aggressive irony. I wish I could describe it better. <br /> <br /> After a while, the viewer understands how both stories are connected and finally they meet in a surprising but also logical end. <br /> <br /> The film is a successful blend of the spectacular but superficial gangster movies written by the director's father (renowned Michel Audiard) and the "typical French film" with many psychological depth and great care in the display of emotions.
