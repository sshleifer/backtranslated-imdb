"Tipping The Velvet" is one of the modern television productions that shows that some television can be as good or even better (as it is) than you see at your local theater. <br /> <br /> If you want to read the plot, read it and if you want other details, skip to the next paragraph. This is the unforgettable portrait of an unconventional young girl named Nan who works as a na√Øve oyster girl until she discovers her oppressed homosexuality when she falls in love with a successful woman named Kitty, who is her stage profession as a man Dress. The young girl soon joins the act as another male imitator and they are a big hit. Soon they both start with a soft case. Kitty is eventually wrapped up in a comfortable marriage and ruined young Nan's heart. From then on, Nan works as a male personalized prostitute to men looking for sex with boys, then she becomes the private sex slave for the evil and sadomasochistic Princess where Nan experiences severe emotional abuse. When it ends, Nan is back on the streets where she remembers a young woman named Florence; a good socialist who had the real potential to be a great partner. This is where Nan will discover the power of socialism and learn how to become known again. <br /> <br /> The transfer of region 1 is of exceptional image quality, there is a very good choice of scene, an eloquent photo gallery and a fun interview between novelist Sara Waters and writer Andrew Davies. <br /> <br /> The sets, costumes, cinematography and music are beautiful. The acting, writing and directing are extremely strong and filled with realism, class and originality. I loved the movie and the novel. Section III in the film is very different in the film than in the novel, because section III of the novel is well written down, but is not screen material. I will be brave and say that I love the movies very much. <br /> <br /> This stunning historic kitchen combines Drama, Comedy, Eroticism and Romance into lively perfection in a way that is both deeply moving and spiritually uplifting. For every adult and open-minded adult who ever felt the pleasure, the pain and the power of falling in love and life is full of it. A revolutionary production; an absolute must-see!
