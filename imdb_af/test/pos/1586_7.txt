A cooked but funny little distraction. You have to see it from the beginning to follow what is happening, but every report on earth has its own little joke. Nice good special effects for a very low budget sci-fi. Show. It's fun to watch. Kind in the ear of Red Dwarf, but even lower budget. For someone who just enters the middle of one of the episodes, you must realize that these guys are incompetent, because they were brought to the order of the order because the other officers were dead. Also, the main guys are from the laundry corps, so they have everything in the laundry. If you like Red Dwarf, you will probably like this. Slightly different t.v. concept, because everything you see is the commander's report every day. <br /> <br /> It would be better if it was explained more, not just in the beginning of the first episode, but then it was pretty difficult to determine what also happened in the Red Dwarf, if you didn't tell is not.
