I saw this movie many years ago and it made my list of best movies ever. When I first looked at it, I just started what became a lifelong passion for justice. It gave an interesting perspective of the death penalty and also gave me some things to think about. <br /> <br /> If you play such a role, it is right to assume that it will not do anything. Fantastic. It is by far the best role I have ever seen playing Sean Penn (along with me is Sam). He nails the role, does not glamorize his actions while doing so. He manages a level of debauchery throughout the movie I think was very important. To the end he tried nothing more than he was. He is a sick man who regrets his past but still makes excuses. He ends up delivering his sense of self-worth as much as a guilty (and guilty) killer can use through Susan Sarandon's character, Helen Helen Prejean. Her character taught me about goodwill toward others, without letting me forget how terrible a person's actions might be and without making excuses for them. <br /> <br /> The supporting role was also top notch. I was surprised to see a little comedy from Jack Black in this movie, given the funny man he became today! I loved this movie for both personal reasons and just because it was a work of cinema. And I think it's one of the rare exceptions when the film was far from the book.
