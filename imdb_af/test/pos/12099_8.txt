German-born Turkish director Faith Akin captures in his film the endless variety of different styles of music and songs in Istanbul, a city that is a bridge between East and West, a city uniquely situated on either side of the Bosphorus. is. Europe and Asia. Kurdish directly represented by Aynur, who performs her own brand Kurdish gospel music, passionate and melodic. We are introduced to Romany instrumentals, to Orhan Gencebay, who is called the Elvis of Arabic music. Sounds of music are heard all over the city, as Faith Akin takes us to underground clubs, street performers and recording sessions. German bassist Alexander Hacke who comes to Istanbul to play and learn about Turkish music quotes Confucius, "To understand the place, listen to the music it plays." Akin's fine documentary does just that - give us 90 minutes of music that helps cross the bridges. For me, the movie was especially interesting because I recently visited Istanbul as part of my holiday and spent four days there. The city fascinated me with its images, colors, crowds, vitality and visual beauty. Now I can add the sounds of music to the ever-changing portrait of Istanbul.
