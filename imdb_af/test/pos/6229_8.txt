A group of young adults are stranded in the back, where the only place in the area is a museum full of laundry mummies, and the only form of help is lovely local mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors). As the night falls, the children are picked up in record time. <br /> <br /> A strange, freaky B movie combining the creepiness of backwoods settings with the all-vibrant mannequins plot device (making it a good thing to update the "bodies in the wax museum "genre", it is an intense feast in the line of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre". (It will be no surprise then that TCSM art director Robert A. Burns repeats the duty here, and his eye for a great decoration always comes close.) Pino Donaggio's score is neatly cooling; accompanied by the dark photography of Nicholas von Sternberg, it soaked the film in an oppressive atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Plot turns vary in level of success; there was one I saw to get a mile away, and one that really surprised me, and I was happier for that. One of the best moments is almost right with us, as the first victim is trapped in a room with objects moving towards him. The Capper is a great impalement through the pipe with blood that drowns from the end. <br /> <br /> Star Connors offers an engaging performance as our good home parent agonist, while the younger co-stars, predictably, can't cope at the same level, although Jocelyn Jones is an enjoyable and definitely victorious lady is having enough appeal to judge as a sympathetic girl in need. Mrs Tanya Roberts (a brunette in this movie) is good at supporting. (If I had one problem with this movie, it's just that the victims are a bit too stupid. Then it doesn't make much difference to many horror movies of the 80's.) Future notable names under the credits are future directors Ted Nicolaou, who was the editor here, Ron Underwood (who made a big debut almost a dozen years later with 'Tremors') as assistant director, and veteran maker Ve Neill, who has done many films and have won three Oscars ever since. br /> <br /> Although some horror fans may be disappointed by the lack of nudity and sexual elements, it is otherwise a nice surprise that debut director David Schmoeller delivers with conviction and gusto. Recommended. <br /> <br /> 8/10
