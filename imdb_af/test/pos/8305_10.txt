My dad took me to see this movie when it was released in 1976. I was just a kid and it scared the shit out of me. So much so that I had to leave the theater during a particular claustrophobic tunnel scene, because it was too intense for me !!! I went home for the safety of my family. I've been through the movie while I got older and thoroughly enjoyed it. Shame on the guys in monster packs. If you overestimate and deepen the cost of production, you will find an excellent performance by Cushing, a beautiful opening, a fine photo and the ever-reliable Mr.Douglas McClure, my childhood hero! British police constables guarding the Whitehouse. the end! Titty bang scared cave woman! Samples with beaks! Actors in monster packs float on wires! This has it all! Excellent.
