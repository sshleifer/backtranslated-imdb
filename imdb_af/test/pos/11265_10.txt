This performance leaves you without hesitation. We saw it in Offenbach, Germany, and it's amazing. We only got the cheap tickets on the far side, but still have a view of everything that happened. If you ever get the chance to see this life, go! It was worth the trip and if I were you I would have to wait half an hour to cool down. The performances are breathtaking and everywhere in the tent there are colorful dressed artists out there to help, help, smile, and let the whole tent live in general. The music - live music !! - is as good as the CD version: perfect! I later bought a DVD, but the show had less colorful costumes. It's the atmosphere in the tent that wipes you off your feet. A great trip for young and old, and also a good movie
