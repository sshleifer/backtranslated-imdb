okay ... only after Anne Rice BOOK fans .... <br /> <br /> sure that your eyes are not blue ... sure he is not blond in this movie ... but Marius not the first time is not maker ... even though they have completely changed the story ..... <br /> <br /> how can you say it's not a good movie. <br /> <br /> This movie ... is the BEST vampire movie I've ever seen ... and trainings are perfectly presented here ... maybe not their features ... but I don't think one can " find a better thing .... the way he speaks ... and the way he looks at mere mortals ... his arrogance. and mere love for fame is depicted flawlessly. <br /> <br /> Once you ... just watch a movie ... and try and connect every scene to the book ... you'll love the movie as much as I do. <br /> <br /> Now ... to the non-readers. <br /> <br /> Be prepared to fall absolutely in love with this movie .... it has everything .... and the goth music ... is like an extra treat ... the dialogues ... is beautiful ... and catch ... and even though it's a vampire movie. you will smile yourself ... on the white of the characters ... and you will sympathize with the vampires. <br /> <br /> overall ... one of my fav movies ... !! 10/10
