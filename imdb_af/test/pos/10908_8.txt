The first, and much better, of Kevin Kline's two gay roles. (The second is the dreamy "De-Lovely" in which he played Cole Porter.) Inspired by Tom Hanks's emotional acceptance speech for Philadelphia, in which he released his high school drama teacher, the nominated film in this release was of course more "Forrest Gump "as" Philadelphia ". Here is the Hanks character played by Matt Dillon. <br /> <br /> The reaction scenes in most of the movies are very funny and, as often pointed out, is particularly effective as done by Kevin himself, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck (a brave move because he was himself the target of such rumors, which he denied!), Bob Newhart and Joan Cusack as the eventually dressed bride. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks's real teacher criticizes the graduation ceremony that says people are not acting in real life. But it's a farce and not real life. It is said, it is not as effective as it may be, and the misdirection of the final "wedding scene" that seems like Tom and Kevin are about to get, I have rather useless, annoying and found a policeman. <Br /> <br /> The highlight of the movie for me, of course, is Kevin's scene with the how-to-a-real-band soundtrack and it's hilarious but certainly not realistic when the band responds to Kevin's actions . <br /> <br /> Overall, a hoot!
