It's a great horror movie for people who don't want everything that gets inflated. This movie has equal amounts of horror, tension, humor, and even a little light nudity, but nothing great. Linnea Quigley is not over, because she was in "Return of the Living Dead" where she danced naked on a crypt, but she is still the same finite character. Cathy Podewell is a virgin and social character before going to Dallas, and we are also introduced to Amelia [soon Mimi] Kinkade, the sexy and sinister dark matron of the house. While she and Linnea owned and took over the house, they made the dead bodies of their dead friends scare the boundaries of the survivors. I heard a lot of people comparing this movie to "The Evil Dead", but if it was, this movie was a competitor to one in the same way that Freddie survived with Jason. However, this movie is much better than this one!
