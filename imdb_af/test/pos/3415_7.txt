Red fabric is both well behaved and well made, but what the film is about, I think will endure many viewers as it did to me. There was a movie mentioned earlier "in my country" with Sam Jackson and it wasn't so well received and both films were about the same thing. I think Red dust was better because of the more interesting performances, especially by future Oscar winner Chiwton Ejofor, but the plot is just missing, it starts pretty strong, but then the movie gets the viewers with many uninteresting court sessions. It can be a good movie if the writing is not so lacking. But look or see for the performances.
