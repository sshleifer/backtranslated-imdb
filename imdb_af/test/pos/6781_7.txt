A copy found in a bargain selling this ancient time classic. I played it with a dose on a vista machine without any problems. It's graphically dated, but what do you expect for a 12-year game! The game is a FPS / Adventure game hybrid. That's what I call pseudo 3D, you can't look up or down, just turn in 360 (think Wolf3D). Games can be difficult with a very limited amount of health pots, and a somewhat average interface (Hint: Press I), but generally it is sensible. <br /> <br /> One of the key strengths of the game is the mood. There, the game plays a lot of video, and while the play is b-grade and the plot is very hooked, the game as a whole feels sincere. It also makes a good job of questioning the 'good guys'. Do they really help or are they just waiting to put you in the back? The other big selling point is the game length. There are 18 chapters of memory, which vary in game time of 10 minutes after possible hours. My first play took me a week with a serious dedication of time. <br /> <br /> Dated, yes, but if you missed these years and could get it for $ 5, give it a look. Cheaper than a movie, and more entertaining than most movies.
