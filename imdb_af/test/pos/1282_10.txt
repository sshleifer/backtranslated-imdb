Even with just $ 6,000 and a part-time actor, Christopher Nolan was a master. Nolan is, in my opinion, the next big one and our first taste of Nolan does not contradict it. <br /> <br /> None of the problems that constantly characterize and discredit the low budget picture, Nolan and crew haunt. Our actors are inexperienced and young, but they deliver and engage us in this story. In all honesty I think Following is Nolan's best script because it is the one he had the most control. It's a beautifully imagined movie. It takes us into a world where we are not limited by budget constraints. That dialogue and atmosphere is bold and intelligent. <br /> <br /> Nolan's branding method of telling the story in continuity is being used for the first time, and this is done in a way that pours out the story for you. . With Memento and The Prestige you have to think a bit to really get a complete understanding of the genius, but Nolan doesn't try to confuse people with his prototype film. We can distinguish time by the appearance of our protagonist. This method of telling a story is both creative and enticing. I'm glad Nolan has had so much success with it because his films are more than they can with this method. The remuneration in the Prestige and Memento would not have been excited if the film was told in a conventional format. This idea was previously done with moderate success, but Nolan really made it. <br /> <br /> The writing here is Nolan's best. I had doubts about his writing abilities, I imagined all the ways his brother Jonathon was the writing talent, but he was wrong with the following. This is a thought-producing story that makes interesting observations of people and how they function. Cobb's hacking attacks and how it can lead you to discover what makes people tick, probably sound. <br /> <br /> My only real complaint is that the camera sometimes gets shaky, but it doesn't take the story or the acting. <br /> <br /> Following is the first film of the man who will best personalize the 21st century's film-making.
