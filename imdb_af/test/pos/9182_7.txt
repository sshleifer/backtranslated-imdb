Will Smith is perfectly pleasant as the "Relationship Doctor," here to heal all your confusion. <br /> <br /> I expected it to be a standard RomCom with little to enjoy. I'm glad to report that I was wrong. Will Smith is delightful and unexpectedly "fresh" in this Andy Tennant vehicle. Surrounded by a great supporting role, an interesting story, and fed with a witty dialogue, I was deeply engaged. <br /> <br /> We found this one cute, cute and inspiring without being preaching. <br /> <br /> It's a 7.4 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> The Enemy :.
