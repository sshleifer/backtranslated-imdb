As Warner Brothers' second historical drama with the Civil War and the Battle of the Little Wheat, General. George Armstrong Custer, baptized with their shoes (Warner Brothers, 1941), far more accurate of the two; especially in contrast to SANTA FE TRAIL (Warner Brothers, 1940), which really did not set the beam very high. <br /> <br /> However, both photos were major role models for Errol Flynn, there was a change in the casting part of General Custer While it was "Dutch," Ronald Reagan portrayed the flamboyant, egoic Cavalryman in the earlier picture . Mr. Flynn played Virginian and later Confederate Hero General, J.E.B. (or Jeb) Stuart; Errol took the Custer part for them with their shoes. <br /> <br /> The Warner Brothers' propensity to use a large number of reliable Warner Repertory Company character characters is once again serving the movie as a kind of authenticity, and everything happens right before our own eyes. Important roles are taken by some well-known actors and actresses, such as: Elizabeth Bacon / Mrs. Custer (co-star Olivia de Havilland), Ned Sharpe (Arthur Kennedy), Samuel Bacon (Gene Lockhart), Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn), "Californy" (Charlie Grapwin), Major Taipe (Stanley Ridges), General Phillip Sheridan (John Litel), Callie (the Bacon's Maid, Hattie McDaniel). <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is just full of unknown but skilled players like Joe Sawyer, Eleanor Parker, Minor Watson, Tod Andrews, Irving Bacon, Roy Barcroft, Lane Chandler, Spencer Charters, Frank Ferguson, Francis Ford, William McNeil, George Eldridge, Russell Hicks, William Hopper, Hoppity Hooper, Eddie Keane, Fred Kelsey, Sam McDaniel, Patrick McVey, Frank Orth, Eddie Parker, Addison Richards, Ray Teal, Jim Thorpe (All-American, himself) , Minerva Urecal, Dick Wessel, Gig Young and many, much more. <br /> <br /> The movie moves very fast, especially in the early times; then it is slowed down by necessity, as the story moves to the Post Civil War years, the mission of Custer as colonel in the 7th Cavalry and the ultimate fate at the Little Big Horn in Montana. Under the direction of director Griffith Veteran, Raoul Walsh, the film strikes a wide variety of emotions; of the very serious, exciting tones and convincing historical scenes; watch as if they were Matthew Brady Civil War Photos. As with most of Mr. Walsh's movies, he breaks out a lot of a scene with a bit of humor and accelerates it. But don't go overboard, and thus put the risk of making the movie into a comedy. <br /> <br /> As mentioned before, it's much more factual than its predecessor, SANTA FE TRAIL (last time we'll call it, honest Schultz, Scout's Honor!). However, it is not to say that without a few small pieces of the "Artistic and Literary License, as indeed, it will not have any Biopic. It will be impossible to make any similar kind of film as indeed every fact and fact. The incident will be attempted to be included in the roadmap, perhaps the most faulty inclusion as well as the most obvious incitement of the Literary License is that the Custer's business is inadvertently promoted to the rank of Brigadier General. but the "gag" both helped the film to move along, emphasizing the whole light, the carefree feeling the early part of the movie spent. <br /> <br /> DIRECTOR Walsh and Mr Flynn collaborated to give us what seems to be a characterization of this legendary Civil War hero, who was very close to the real life man, and this did so on the occurrence of an incident, the Massacre by the Lakota Sioux, the Ch eyenne and the Custer's Fukowi and his 7th Cavalry at the Big Horn At the time of his appearance, June 25, 1876, Custer's Last Tribune was so much a shock and shock to Americans' national psyche as the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941) or the Horrors by the Islamic Fascists to New York's Twin Trade Towers and the United Nations Armed Forces Headquarters in the Pentagon, Arlington, Virginia on September 11, 2002. <br /> <br /> Just Like so many movies of that period of World War II (and years before), there were so many incidents in it that, if not deliberately done, were demonstrations of virtues that would be needed in the time of another worldwide conflict, as we were at the time of them. THEIR BOOTS ON was finished with its original Theatrical release period. <br /> <br /> POODLE SCHNITZ !!
