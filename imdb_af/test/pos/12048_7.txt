I have seen many of Shahrukh's movies and this is a very good role for him. He has so much versatility, but remains largely in positive roles. Like Rahul, he is very dark and disturbing, but I found that he had experienced much of the movie. If there is nothing else, look at this movie for Shahrukh. He plays a very complex and true character very convincingly. The story is very typical and has been done before, but the character development is very strong and entertaining. The opening is a bit confusing, but eventually it doesn't matter. The songs I found very nice and provided insight into which characters think. Very smart. I think this movie was great and recommend it to all Shahrukh Khan fans. This is a must see!
