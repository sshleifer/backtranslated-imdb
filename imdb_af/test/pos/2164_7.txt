Don't get me wrong, it was fun to watch. It has a nice animation with the exception of strange search bugs, and some nice music. And the striking scene was definitely Elmer, Bugs and Daffy's dance on the floor, it was such a nice and fun touch. In fact, the whole cartoon is nice to look at, but it's not me who calls exceptionally like Carrotblanca. There are some very nice gags, but they were used before I felt, and there wasn't much I would consider screaming. And Daffy joins forces with Elmer? Somehow, as he was a target of the hunter, it didn't feel strange that he would be friends with him. Although I would admit it was nice to have Daffy there. The voter was also above average, but somehow I missed Mel Blanc. <br /> <br /> All in all, indispensable but very nice cartoon. 7/10 Bethany Cox
