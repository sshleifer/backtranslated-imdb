Another "must" movie. Henry Brandon is a favorite! I was so surprised when I learned years ago that he was from Germany because he sounds and looks so typical of American! And wasn't he big in "The Searchers" as Chief Scar ?? !! Another of my favorites, I have it and watch it over and over. Now that I could add this one to my collection, it would make my day! It's a great game story and movie for all ages. The scenery is so absolutely beautiful and the fate of the endangered snow leopards is told with such a great emotion that it will spark the interest in endangered species in anyone, especially children. If I could, I'd give a copy of all my grands & great grands!
