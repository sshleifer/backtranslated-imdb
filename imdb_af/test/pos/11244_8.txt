This is a good performance despite many negative user reviews. The purpose of this show is to entertain you by making you laugh. Two guys compete against each other to get a girl's phone number. Simple. The fun of this show is to watch the two men try to reach their goal. <br /> <br /> Some people seem to hate for various reasons, but I think they misunderstood this as an educational show on how to pick up chicks. Well, it's not, it's a comedy program and the whole point is to make you laugh, don't learn anything. If you didn't like the show, because it doesn't teach you anything, don't see it. If you don't like the whole thing, don't look. If you don't like to socialize, don't look. This show is a comic show. If you look down to look at others, pick up girls, don't make it laugh for you, don't see it. If you are so disappointed after watching this show and realize that you do not have the ability to get a "pick-up" girl, there is no reason to hate the show, just don't look !
