Prue and Piper bring Dr Griffiths to their home to save him from the Sous assassin Shax. While Phoebe in the book of shadow looks at how to defeat the devil, Prue and Piper and Shax fight on the streets chasing him. However, they are filmed and exposed in television news as witches. They become national sensations with a crowd in front of their home. Phoebe relies on Cole and goes with Leo to the underworld to ask him to call Tempus and return while a fanatic woman shoots Piper, who dies. The source suggests Phoebe to stay with him and he will save her sister. Phoebe accepts the deal, and time is back to the moment Shax Prue, Piper and Dr. Griffits attack. <br /> <br /> "All Hell Breaks Loose" is a good but incoherent episode. With Piper's death and destroying the power of three, why should the source return to save her? But this dramatic performance is definitely one of the best of the Third Season and lets the viewers anxiously wait for the next episode. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Voltando no Tempo" ("Back in Time")
