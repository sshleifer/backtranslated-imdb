I tend to fall in love with anime, as the more you see the more, many examples are just bad copies of the few jewels or rehashes of old formulas. But each time one of the true jewels comes together, and the originality just keeps you away. Haruhi is really one of those shows. Many anime series are originally manga and sometimes the translation into an animated display is rather poor and does not use the benefits of animation over static drawings. Haruhi is basically based on a series of light novels and fires on all cylinders, beautiful animation, great voice workers, good music and a complete and thorough story. Look, you won't be disappointed, and I suggest watching it, it works so much better that way.
