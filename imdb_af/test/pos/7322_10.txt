It's a specific Stooge card that actually uses satire in combination with slapstick, a rarity. As mentioned earlier, the title and concept for this short "borrowed from a feature film of the same year" was borrowed with Clark Gable called "Men In White." It's basically about the trials and tribulations of interns and their sacred cause for " duty and humanity ". I saw it recently and almost treated it like the Stooge version, because it took itself a bit too seriously. Anyway," Men In Black "was so well written, directed and not originally mentioned , it did not borrow a thing from Chaplin or any of the others, that the Motion Picture Academy named it as the best short, comedy of 1934. Some smelly shorts called "La Cucaracha" surprised it and Someone's son-in-law needs to be at the Academy's ballot, "Men in Black" are the same as the Marx Bros, and the whole concept of the medical profession must be the same. , but I can do the Marx Bros in this see short. In fact, in their function a day at the race, there is a scene where medical issues are involved and this usually causes anarchy. My guess is that this particular card was judged in this line and therefore why it was nominated in the first place. Really try it: first look briefly and then watch "Duck Soup" or "Day at the Races" with the Marxes and see if there is not the same great quality comedy.
