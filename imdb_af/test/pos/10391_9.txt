I saw this movie for the first time last night. I thought about it all night and this morning. I can't say it was my favorite movie, at least not yet. I have to see it again. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is stunning. Each shot has a lyric that you can expect in a movie called Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> It is always tempting to see the Chirico in any picture of rows of orders disappearing in the gloomy, but in this case the analogy fits. In many ways, the figure of Malkovich walking through the fog and wind of Ferarra echoes the shadow of the off-canvas statue that Milan haunts in the great works of the Italo-Greek painter. He is slightly threatening, a presence that looks and, in his capacity as a film director, exerts influence on the whole story. <br /> <br /> The dedicated Wenders fan can't help but think a little Damiel and Cassiel are wandering through the streets of Berlin, watching everything except directly with the residents. And, following the Himmel Uber Berlin metaphor, the angel (or, in this case, Malkovich gets the director) communicates with one of the stories. <br /> <br /> At this point, I have to bow to this line of criticism. I have to see the movie again. I'm pretty sure it's the thread that Malkovich's monologue will bring along. <br /> <br /> Perhaps its mockery and pontifications are pretentious, empty-sounding, but may not be analyzed in real-life communication. Maybe it's the whole point. No one can make that judgment with any certainty or authority until he has done his homework. <br /> <br /> We should be careful when throwing the word "pretentious". It is easy to write off anything that predicts the intellect, but it leads to a terrifying state of mind, of which the only talk is genuine, earthly, or authentic, the most banal. When we reject all discussions of philosophy, God, existence, meaning and all the brain candy, we set up our culture to die a slow, stupid and ugly death. Maybe it's the warning that Wenders and Antonioni are giving us. This is certainly not the only theme of the movie, but I don't think it can be ignored. <br /> <br /> The other (and most obvious) search motive is that of satisfaction. There is much about this and a thorough review of all the subtleties and effects of developing this search motif will exceed the 1000 word limit for this review. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch the movie. But I offer a caveat: it's not an autonomous movie (at least I don't think so). Some movies interact with the intellectual and artistic thinking of their time so much that the viewer must have a background in the Zeitgeist before approaching the film. Par-dela les nuages ​​is one of those films.
