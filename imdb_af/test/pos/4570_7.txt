It has recently been caught after James Earl Jones's name is labeled. It was better than I expected. Of course, it's very old in the early / mid 70's, but it's actually a decent drama. It runs fast 90min or so and shows good performances by James Earl Jones and Diahann Caroll. The plot is generally conventional, but tells by the perspective of a single black woman in welfare who has 6 children and tries to deal with all the problems that persist. It makes for an interesting view ..... also in the fact that the writing is not too sentimental or over-dramatic - it's almost like looking at a part of the past. All the 70's styles are abundant. The end is nice though. .... would probably have been better without the theater.
