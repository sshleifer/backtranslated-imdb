"Hoppity Goes to Town" was the second and last full-length animated feature created by Max and Dave Fleischer, who created a parallel universe to Disney. While Disney's movies are well remembered, both Fleischer films are "Gulliver's Travels" and this one is forgotten. <br /> <br /> "Hoppity" is a spell binding original, not an adaptation like the first photo. It's a big plus, one would think. No, the critics, who rarely started on the Fleischers sides, tore it to them. Yes, the story is not as strict as "Gulliver", but how can you hate a movie that welcomes it so much? <br /> <br /> It's filled with great musical numbers and a very important story that would be a crime to reveal. The characters are lovely and charming and there is heart in this movie. <br /> <br /> The Fleischers really left them here and never did it again. Most of their time will be devoted to one-reel after thinking at the box office. It is a pity that they do not continue to perform functions. Who knows? Their next attempt may have become the masterpiece they are aiming for. <br /> <br /> **** out of 4 stars
