This sitcom was a great crowd in 1984-1985. It was a time when people could see deserted streets in most of the crowded Indian cities when sitting on the Indian television screens. All this was the result of setting up television sets across the Indian nation. This was one of the essential elements of the modernization of the Indian television network strategy adopted by the then Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It was also continued by her son Rajiv Gandhi. This series provided clean entertainment, which watched a large majority of Indian television watch their black and white television sets. A funny thing about this series is that it is sponsored by a local Ayurvedic-based company. A few days ago, I saw some episodes of this series, but the overall lag comparison was missing. It continues to prove that the changing course of time entertainment material can lose its charm and get hold of people's minds.
