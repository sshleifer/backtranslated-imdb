Some aspects of Punishment Park are less than perfect, especially some of the plays. However, I feel it is probably the most important movie of the "war on terror" era. I hated big hippies and in some ways I still do. It was only when the United States began the path of an unnecessary and fraudulent war in Iraq that I saw the world through their eyes. I can feel what they felt. Although the movie is somewhat dated, it is uncomfortable to fix emotions about our current situation. Clearly early in the film, Punishment Park is designed to be a concentration and death camp for all the "unpatriotic" elements of American society. This is definitely an exaggerated and extreme view of our polarized society, but it is CREDITLY. Sometimes I feel that the US can easily slip into fascism. As I watched this movie, I could only imagine hearing almost every day similar sentiments of people on either side of the political spectrum. This movie is a raw, concentrated distillation of America's current political scene. I am both impressed and sad that something relevant (and yes, accurate) was filmed more than 30 years ago. If you take a more moderate view of the movie and choose to believe it can't happen here, look more closely at Guantanamo Bay, some of our "hostile fighters", the rumored secret prisons of CIA and the many incidents similar to the one in Greensboro, NC in 1979 (8 full years after making this movie).
