I'm not sure I like this movie or not. I think it's creepy and totally weird. Crispin Glover always delivered a good performance like Layne. I think his performance was really good and one of his best, but I don't like the character at all. Keanu Reeves's performance was really good, and I really felt like his character. All in all, I think the whole role has produced good performances, as the characters really were. I didn't like some, but really felt sorry for others (Keanu Reeves). I would like to know if it was the original end that the movie was supposed to have, as it didn't end my expectation. I was disappointed in the end and I didn't feel it did the rest of the film justice. If you're into creepy, weird and very different movies, go for this one. If you like things that are normal, please stay away.
