Yes 1939 / Robert Donat-Greer Garson version was the best ... Perfection..Donat won the Oscar in a very difficult year. Go in GWTW & James Stewart as Mr. Smith. were 2 of its competitors. .Was it been a rough year. Most critics in NY hated this version. so.didnt see in the theater! Eventually this A.M. on TCM and enjoy. Peter O'Toole was excellent and glad he was nominated Oscar for this one, and especially pleasant Oscar gave him a special award over the past year. Petula Clark was good as Mrs. Chips, but her character, I feel was poorly written ... Some good songs esp. You and I ... sung by Ms.Clark and later recorded by many others including T.Bennett / S. Bassey & Carmen MacRae .... the B&W version was more authentic. But it's a great movie beautifully photographed in color & panavision ... enjoyable to see & Bravo, Mr O'Toole!
