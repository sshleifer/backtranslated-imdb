Interesting cartoon, included on the DVD of "The Lost Skeleton or Cadavra". I especially like the way the color used in the background art - very artistic to Columbia, whose cartoon department generally had a very low budget (and the results look like it!) <br /> <br /> I wonder, But how a certain ... um, finger gestures ... ever past the sensors. Granted, the particular gesture was seen much less frequently in 1937 than today. You would think of someone except what the animators would have noticed, though - especially as it is seen three times in that particular scene! And based on the context, I suspect its inclusion was deliberate, something the animators just slipped to see if the sensors would see it!
