This is the greatest movie if you want inspiration about following your heart and never going up on your dream. Elizabeth Taylor is Velvet and Mickey Rooney is in her foremost (of her childhood) a cynical friend who eventually becomes her coach and they go out to the Grand National steeplechase with her beloved horse "The Pi" - short for "Pirate" - not to become Velvet the jockey and have a chance to win. For those of you who have not yet seen it, I will not end, but you must see it and as soon as you will love it. Note a very young Angela Lansbury as Velvet's oldest sister.
