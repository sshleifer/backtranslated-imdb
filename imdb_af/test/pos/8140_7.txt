I'm so happy not to live in an American small town. Because when I am shown a small town in the states, it is populated with all sorts of monsters, among which flesh hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless. In this movie, a former doctor, who just did time for an unfortunate death of his wife in a car accident, sent his steps to the nearest small town. He should never have seen a movie in a small town in his life be the Purgatory Flats. And of course, as soon as he arrives, hell breaks loose. He meets a blonde chick who from all creatures looks most like a cow in facial expressions and in brain functioning and immediately falls in love with her. But there is a small disability, she is already married to a very small drug dealer who, in a minute, does not get himself dead. To know what came from that, you should see the movie itself. I'll just tell you it's a little reminiscent of You. By Oliver Stone, but is a way of all the artistic features.
