* May contain Spoilers <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie was when it was released on the video when I was about 8 years old. Now I'm 17 and still watch it when I get a chance. "The Aristocats" was a cute heart warming movie that I immediately fell in love with. I loved the songs about it, especially the one that sings the kittens at the piano. In fact, I even sang it in a talent show with my sister and friend, because I loved it so much. All three kittens are so cute and their mother is one of the most beautiful cartoon cats I've ever seen. The Ally cat had a good voice! <br /> <br /> My favorite part of the movie is when the kittens play the piano. The part is rich in treasure. I also enjoy their trip home. It's incredible. This is one of the best Disney movies I've ever seen and one of my favorites. Everyone should see it. I give this movie 10/10 stars.
