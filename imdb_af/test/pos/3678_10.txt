When I bought this movie, I had my doubts about it, though the movie was pretty impressive. But after I saw it, I really didn't regret the money. In fact, I'd like to spend it again and again on movies like this .... An absurd combination of humor, drama, excitement and the big questions. That's exactly what makes it a big movie. Well, some may not enjoy what they see, and some may even switch it off after a while. your loss. It has a great way to deal with the problems we've all experienced in one way or another, and the characters you think you won't enjoy the whole company seem to be the one you really love. a short while. For anyone with an open mind, and a sense of humor and life - look at this movie, I promise you you won't be disappointed!
