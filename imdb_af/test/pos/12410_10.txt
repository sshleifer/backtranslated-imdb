My wife and I loved this movie. Smart dialogue, good characters, smart construction. The pacing in this movie is non-stop. Couldn't even come to the kitchen. We have never seen Corey Feldman this funny. Taylor Nichols plays a good Fed ... my wife loves him on the "Married Man" HBO show. The ensemble cast was all strong. The turn at the end cheered us. That's why we give this movie a "Standing O."
