The songs are the best aspect of this television movie, though better than average production values, but much surface and slightly altered biography. Dramatize Richard's discovery of "We've Just Started" and Karen's Marital Problems (the Superstar montage was a good touch), but especially the exposition of Neil Sedaka, the contribution of Tony Peluso's guitarists. Off. Gibb is sweet in her Karen persona, but it does not include the tomboyish and grim sides of the actual Carpenter's personality. Anderson is in fine shape as the creative and take charge Richard, and Fletcher makes her mark as the loving but remaining Agnes. The most haunting moment of the original broadcast is the use of "Goodbye to Love" in the background of a commercial display of an anorexia hotline.
