Although not the first movie I bought for myself, it's almost certainly the one I watched the most. The animation was well drawn by the experts of Tokyo Movie Shinsa, and the animators regularly used clever techniques, such as having the sun's "lens flare", to make the camera drench (and with the "camera operator" s hand "clean the lens!) etc. While avoiding becoming an "animator's gadget feast", the surprising but generous application of such techniques has made the film a much more 'realistic' feel than the typical cartoon. <br /> <br /> The story has many interweaved plots that don't seem to have much to do with everything until everything comes together, in a way that even the authors are self-confidently confronted. Each of the great plot lines has its own music theme, ranging from "Pop goes the weasel" [Hamton & Plucky], to the love theme of "Romeo and Juliet" [Fifi & Johnny]. The transitions between plotlines are slightly varied, but consistent. <br /> <br /> Actually a great movie; There is not much original music, although the new lyrics to "Spinning Song" are clever and enjoyable. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
