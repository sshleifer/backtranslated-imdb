There are many things to admire about this film, but the thing that got me above all other people was part of an eccentric entertainment, the kind of role that Hollywood loves and romanticises, but which is absolutely convincing and unlike any with any character I have experienced in film or in life. Also a very convincing and disturbing portrayal of Tourete's syndrome
