It's a modest, modest traditional Western with a formula plot on opposition between farmers and crop farmers around the city of Liberal, Kansas. The story is mostly routine and contains a number of classic Western conflicts. There is the farmer opposite the catleman; There is the clash between cultivated land and "civilization" trends on the one hand and the wilderness / frontier ethos on the other, and what ultimately represents, is the opposition of two value systems - democratic and community values ​​as opposed to rough individualism. /> <br /> Randolph Scott plays legendary lawyer Bat Masterton who travels in Liberal at the request of a land agent (Robert Ryan) to help him sort out the bad guys who are the hard drinkers. The two men quarreled, but reunited to tackle the difficult elements in the village. <br /> <br /> The script is clichéd, but the action is powered by director Ray Enright and solid performances are red and red. In addition to rugged performances by the male lead, there are comic enlightenment played by George Gabby Hayes, an oily villain played by Steve Brodie, and attractive contributions by Maggie Meredith as a primitive and proper oriental winner of Ryan and Anne Jeffreys as a salon. singer As long as you do not place a premium on originality, it is good, solid entertainment for Western lovers
