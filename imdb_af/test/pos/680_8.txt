I can see that the ratings for this movie are not so high for this movie, so I have to be in the minority to love this movie so much. Well I'm right and everyone else is wrong (just joke). I think I like it because I am a psychology teacher and I really liked the brilliant character Ryan played. While he is really dangerous as well as VERY threatening, you can't hate him because he is clearly mentally ill and is probably suffering from some brain trauma. And wow Ryan did a very good job portraying this man! You really feel yourself for Ida Lupino because he destroys her life. So with such an intense acting and threat, why is the film rated relatively low? Well, probably because it's not exactly credible, but the boy is entertaining and creative. Give it a try and don't believe the score of 6.4. That's much better than that!
