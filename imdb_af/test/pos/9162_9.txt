From the first to the last scene, this film is made very realistic, even realistic, that sometimes we can't see in the night scenes (it's dark as the right night), in the desert (sunshine is as strong as in the real desert ). <br /> <br /> Essay and actor play is also very realistic. Shots and episodes are edited not to "show" things and events effectively, to "explain" or, as many Hollywood movies, to entertain viewers. Changing here is to represent the events as if it really happened in Afghanistan. The camera is sometimes far from dying soldiers, even when the main character Major Bandura is shot dead. <br /> <br /> This method reminds me of masterpieces of Italian neo-realism. And the construction of the story here is based on the same principles as Pais√† or The Bicycle Thief. The chronological set of episodes of "true to life" and a few pathetic moments, which initially seem sudden and illogical. but have inner reasons. <br /> <br /> I think the inner reason of Major Bandura's suicide death is religious emotion. Repentance for innocent people's death (not just his accidental murder of family in the village, but also the death of soldiers under his command). He is not portrayed as an avid believer. On the contrary, he is portrayed as tactful and responsible officer. Precisely for this reason, his last decisions (going back to the devastated village and turning his back to an armed boy whose family he killed) seem an act of repentance. <br /> <br /> The Russian Orthodox Choir, which sounds "Evening Sacrifice", is another context through which all the film can be seen from this point of view.
