I loved this movie as I was a little kid. I remember the night my mother brought this movie home for me. I loved it and I still do. I think it's very funny and original. There are also some very catchy songs in this movie. Lou is also a surprisingly good singer. The actors depicting Prince Arthur and Princess Eloise are also good, but Abbott and Costello are the best. Former heavyweight boxing sensation Buddy Baer, ​​also brother of former heavyweight champion Max Baer, ​​is good at this movie as police and giant. He is a better actor than boxer. He had a natural talent. The start of this movie is hilarious as Lou Costello crashes the car and how he gets into trouble with Buddy Baer. The slapstick in the house is also good. I especially like the comedy in the Giant's castle. My favorite parts are; The part was that Lou climbed the bone and they all sing as a farewell. Jack sings back to them that he is coming back. Lou Costello is a very good song. My other favorite part is the part when Jack fights with the Giant. I like when Jack explodes eggs and when he tries to make an omelette, they explode. Abbott and Costello are hilarious and the best comedians of all time. It's just one of their big movies that I love and cherish. The reviews for this movie are not very good and I can't understand why. This is a very good Abbott and Costello movie. I also love how Lou Costello finally comes to reality and thinks he's back in the dream when Bud hits him. He started singing and singing with an attitude like no one would push me. Very good movie.
