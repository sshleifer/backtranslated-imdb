If you think of a brilliant Australian comedy, don't think of Skit shows (Although I'm totally partial to a bit of 80's and 90's Full Frontal) or even Sitcoms - think of SATIRE! Something our Australians really know how to do well. (Eg: Front Line, The Micallef Program) We know how to take the pi $$, and The Chaser's War on Everything is a classic example of how to do it and how to do it really well. <br /> <br /> I've been a big fan of Chris Taylor and Craig Reucassel for a long time. I remember listening to them at Triple J's afternoon show. They were and remain two of the funniest comedians. <br /> <br /> Although I was sad when they left Trip Triple J, I was excited to find out how much time they spent investing in what they had to do. (They did CNNNN and Triple J at the same time, so I thought it was something much bigger) And what an incredible HILARIOUS show Chaser is. It is best to contribute political and social satire. <br /> <br /> I am also pleased to have received a much better time slot than Friday nights and moved to Spicks and Specks on Wednesdays. THANK YOU ABC !! Finally, I don't have to paste it! :)
