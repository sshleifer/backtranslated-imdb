Fran√ßois Villon was a real poet and villain who lived in Paris in the 15th century. But most of what is portrayed in this historic film is actually fiction - from a play created in the early 20th century. As he met in the movie and became friends with Louis XI, he actually died in his 30s and was never involved in all the intrigues he was in this movie. In fact, he wrote a beautiful verse and was often on the wrong side of the law - not the combination of a patriot and Robin Hood character as he is in the movie. With the idea that you know the movie is almost 100% fiction, it's worth seeing. Don't just assume it's a good history lesson. <br /> <br /> In the BELOVED ROGUE, Villon is played with a wild abandon by John Barrymore. I was also very excited to see his three friends all played by well-known faces. Angelo Rossitto, who was the dark dwarf, played in tons of movies over the years and had a very long career. Slim Summerville was a character actor known for adding a comedy to movies. Mack Swain is known as the silent film film in many of Chaplin's short films and plays his partner in DIE GOLDRUSH. All four of these men had a good job and had no complaints --- even with Barrymore's rather over-the-top reminder of a Douglas Fairbanks performance. The show I had a serious problem, however, was Conrad Veidt as King Louis XI. To call this "unsubtle" will be a gross understatement. He played the role of a high school who thought he should be the stereotypical Richard III acting and acting on a demonic caricature. While Veidt was wonderful in many, many movies (both quiet and sound), but here he is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> As far as the story is concerned, it is full of fun adventure and action - like a swashbuckling movie minus the sailing ships. The sets worked out well for all this, as they used to return the other year. Both films were set in the same period. <br /> Overall, this is one of the last big silent movies. There is a lot to keep and the movie is a beautiful combination of romance, comedy and action. It is worth seeing, but it loses a few points for Veidt's record, as well as the way the movie plays and dissolves quickly with history. <br /> <br /> By the way, this movie was also made twice as though I was KING (1920 and 1938) and apparently these two films are closest to the original play. In total, however, there are six films about Villon and tell more or less variations on the same story!
