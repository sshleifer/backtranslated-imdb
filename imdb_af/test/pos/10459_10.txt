One of the greatest films ever made. Worthy to work with such European masterpieces as the rules of the game, great illusion, NOSTALGHIA, ANDREI ROUBLEV, 8 1/2, desire of longing, viridiana, the night of the shooting stars, LA STRADA, ORDET, the passion of ARC, THE FOUR HUNDREDS OF BLUE AND MADAMA DE ... Both a blessing ... and an almost perfect work of art.
