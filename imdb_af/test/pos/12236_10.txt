In the changing world of CG and not of cartoon animations etc. Etc., Faeries was at least a warm welcome to me. I think it's important to show these kind of movies once, to keep them and to remind us where the originality and pleasure of cartoons come from. People talked about how boring it is because of the graphics and things, but hey! think of the movies that will be considered boring if every movie looks like the latest state of the art that everyone and their mother make these days. Call me old-fashioned but I like it. It is a wonderful story about supernatural beings and people and all that it really needs from its audience is their imagination.
