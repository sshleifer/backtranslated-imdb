Wow! My mom bought me this movie because it was really cheap in some stores in my town and she knows I love scary movies. First I look at the cover and sigh and think it is a normal B-movie that is frightening. I was so wrong! I made the big mistake of watching it alone, my parents and my brother fell asleep and it was very late. After I saw the movie, I was so scared I was shaking. I didn't even dare to go up and take the videotape from the VCR! I slept with the lights ... <br /> <br /> This movie's main story is about some teenagers driving off the road and spending the night in the bush, telling stories ... The first story is very scary and it makes you a cushion really difficult if you see it alone. The second story is also scary, but not the same as the first one. The third story (my favorite) is really scary. It scared me most of all stories. It's about a man riding a motorcycle around the country. One night when there is a storm outside, he goes to the nearest house and knocks at the door. A girl opens and she is dumb. Don't want to tell, but you will get chills if you see it adding that my heartbeat was really abnormal when I watched it). "Campfire Tales" main story has a very interesting and surprising end. I know some guys said it sucked, but I, my boyfriend and my friends, loved it, and it was long ago that we were scared. Rating: 10/10, oh, by the way, it's NOT like an urban legend at Everything, it's so much scarcer.
