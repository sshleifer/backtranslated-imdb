"Goodbye, Mr. Chips" is a beautifully written and photographed music version of the classic 1939 movie. In addition to Peter O'Toole's wonderfully controlled, underrated performance as the pedant schoolmaster who finds love and changes, the film features hundreds of beautiful visual arts, from Greek ruins to London's side streets, to an extensive rural setting. The music and lyrics of Leslie Bricusse have been criticized as dim or non-on-par for film musicals, but they are used to improving the story rather than telling it. Many songs are used to emphasize settings or scenes; the few who are not tempted to show "biz numbers". In this way, the songs do not touch this delicate story, but increase what the characters think or feel. "Where did my childhood go?", "Walk around the world with me" and "You and I" are especially effective. A summary, brilliant performance, directed and written film.
