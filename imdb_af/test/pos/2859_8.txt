Neil LaBute takes a dramatic turn from his first two films, In The Company of Men & Your Friends and Neighbors, with this funny and original thriller / comedy / road movie. When Betty (Renee Zellwegger) testifies to the brutal murder of her non-good husband (Aaron Eckhart), she develops a bizarre kind of memory loss, and flees into his car without knowing that there are big drugs in the trunk. Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are the hits that follow her. <br /> <br /> What Betty is chasing, except for a new start (although she can't remember old life) is her beloved, David Ravell (Dr. Greg Kinnear). Only problem: Dr. David is not, he is a soap opera character on the show "a reason to love" and he is really a selfish actor named George McCord. <br /> <br /> To say more about what would evolve would be too much, but nurse Betty is definitely original. His hits are, like the hired killers of pulp fiction, violent, but philosophical. They take soup action with a tremendous spoof material, and the play is the best feature of all. It must have been one of the best films in the past year. Ren√© Zellwegger is ideal for Betty's nurse, with the constant shine in her eye pursuing her quest. Morgan Freeman, at the end of his career, brings his constant mercy to the role of a murderer, and Chris Rock is his partner, a man of anger and impatience. Greg Kinnear is at his comic best as the avid actor / soap opera doctor. There are also big supporting performances by actors such as Emmy winner Allison Janney (The West Wing), Harriet Sansom Harris (Frasier's agent Bebe Glazer) and Kathleen Wilhoite (Chloe on ER). Actually, the supporting cast is a Who's Who of the best TV actors in television. <br /> <br /> A unique movie that is funny for a moment and the next chill, Nurse Betty is a mix of great acting, decisive and a fantastic script.
