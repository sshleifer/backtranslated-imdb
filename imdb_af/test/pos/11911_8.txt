At the moment this movie was released, my flat mind probably affected, but it's not a bad movie yet. It's a movie about a hostage situation where a prep school is to some extent filled with satisfying teenage boys who can't get out of trouble. What's wrong with that? It has no great special effects, but what? Who needs special effects? The deterioration of the movie began around the same time that special effects were made popular. A coincidence? I do not think so. It has become films with potentially good plot and feelings and made them into a vast, immeasurable light show for innocent children and self-medication. Well, you don't know, not all movies need special effects. About three-quarters of the movies on the IMDb top 250 are without special effects, but almost all the Top Grossing movies of all time have some special effects. Think about it: Star Wars, E.T., Ghostbusters, etc. All the good movies, but the rest of the top producing movies are usually cut with non-sensual plots and lots of eyebrows. Well, some movies don't have to be that junk. <br /> <br /> Excuse me for getting on a tangent, which I usually do, but I just love that special effects junk. Back to the point: Toy Soldiers is simply a good movie. I admit that a bit of the content is a bit crunchy and ripped off, but so, what makes each movie a little off. Think of Resovoir Dogs. Countless "appreciation" sites dictate the fact that beloved Quentin Tarentino, whom I admit I love, copied many movies in the making of his first big film reservoir dogs. Many say the whole plot is almost a scene for Japanese and Chinese gangster movies that Mr. Tarentino so loved, and probably still. Sorry again for the tangent. <br /> <br /> Toy soldiers are fun. It has the entire insubordination of teenagers to unwanted members of authority, ie hostages. It is nice to see how children take over when they are kept on something they don't want to do. Hell, teen-inspired rebels were the most important topic to a large majority of 80's comedies. In addition, there is tension and excitement that the characters use firearms and the bad guys, etc. Etc. There are some emotional points to the movie. When one of the characters dies, the other has to handle and adjust. It's not perfect acting, but it beats most other teams out there. <br /> <br /> In short, Toy Soldiers are exciting, interesting and fun. How do you dare a bare blowhards, over which this movie is weak! Shame on everyone! <br /> <br /> Personal Rating: 8/10
