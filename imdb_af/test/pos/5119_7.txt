This time, the lovely dimwit is called for jury duty, where a corrupt lawyer notices that he looks like a prisoner who wants to break out, so the two are switched. Of course, most of the movie is a series of gags; in "Ernest goes to jail", most gags relate to electricity. I kept the whole vacuum cleaner series in time. Overall, the tip of the movie is just having fun, and I'm sure you'll. It is possibly the ultimate movie you watch with a button. It's pretty safe to say that Jim Varney will really be missed. Knowwhaddamean? FYI: The only other role player I recognized was Randall "Tex" Cobb, who played Lyle. You've seen him somewhere.
