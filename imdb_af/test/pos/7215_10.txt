It was the best movie ever seen at Germen's Cine Club (Buenos Aires). This movie is a realistic critic of the past and next century society. It gives a very good impression to all Germen's Cine Club partners. I recommend this movie to all the fans of Troma and to all the people who love the good movies, not the commercial movies.
