Christopher Nolan's director debut is a memorable one. The film is very well received and land contracts help to make and execute 'Memento'. <br /> <br /> The following is an excellent example of how films should be made. No fancy effects or blood-dripping gore ... just brilliant writing and good acting. Nolan manages us again with his writing. The actors, all unknown to me and I suppose most people, did a good job of living the characters. They were all credible and that is all they should be. The movie is confusing because it plays a lot with chronology, but ultimately it is very rewarding. The movie is a bit short to be a full-length feature, but any additional length would have ruined the movie's style and the shine of the writing would be reduced. Although short, the film has every aspect that makes a movie attractive (IMO): an intriguing start, an exciting means and a surprising ending. <br /> <br /> I dare say: Follow is almost as good as Memento, his best movie by far. The curly chronology is equally masterful in both films, the incredible plots are present and the play is very good. <br /> <br /> This movie is made with just $ 6,000, but the quality is much higher than most (almost all) million dollar box hits. Using b & w can be a hard pill to swallow for the big audience. Nolan especially follows his skills at the studio base :-). And what skills they are ... seldom, I really enjoyed writing as much as in 'Next'. Even Pi doesn't even get close to IMO, although it's also very good. <br /> <br /> It's a movie that shouldn't be missed by any self-respecting movie maker. If you like Memento, "Follow" is definitely for you.
