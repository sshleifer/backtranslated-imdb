I love everything about family old. <br /> <br /> My favorite characters in family are Brian and Stewie and I like the episodes when they know them mainly like "Road to Rhode Island" (Season 2) very well. The comments they make are just stings. Peter's actions are also very funny, as some of the things he does "are just as brilliant that they are delayed." The vocalist is excellent, especially Seth MacFarlane, as he provides the voices for half Griffin's family as well as their distorted neighbor Glenn Quagmire and how he manages this series (especially with singing). I just don't know. He earned his two Emmies for providing the voice of the evil baby genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his funny and totally crazy ordinary character, the Mayor of Quahog. What I like about Chris (pronounced by Seth Green) is what he says, looking at his father when it comes to intelligence and common sense. <br /> <br /> The only thing I've found is annoying The British Fox has decided to change the seasons to increase DVD sales, which in no way reflects the program itself, but rather the marketing. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy Family Guy, I would recommend Seth MacFarlane's other US project. Dad who uses a different style of humor, but is still extremely hilary.
