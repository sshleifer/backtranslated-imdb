Yes, it is Sean Connery playing Bond again and looks more alive and in his part than ever since the first time they made this film, in 1965, when it was called Thunderball. But the tongue is so stuck in the cheek, but wondering if Connery doesn't use some noticeable tricks from his friend and more humorous successor, Roger Moore. Moore is my favorite Bond, but Connery makes a strong case for himself in this unusual outing. The only serious Bond movie that was not created under the banner of the classic Eon Bond series never says never again is a relentless return to the pit. Soft on action, it is strong on character and smart dialogue. <br /> <br /> Bonding, it is immediately made clear, is a man in discomfort. No matter how many times he saved the world, his new boss thinks little about his style. "Too many free radicals, that's your problem ... Caused by eating too much red meat, white bread, too much martini." "Then I'll cut off the white bread, sir." Bond answers smartly. <br /> <br /> An early battle series in a spa represents the movie's high point action mode, with Bond and an attacker fighting their way out of a kitchen, bedroom, and lab before Bond Eventually his opponent expires immediately, ironically with no help from those free radicals. Humor is being used liberally in the film, rather more cleverly than most of Moore's outings, though Connery seems more fun to send himself because of Moore's less selfish example. Was it because he was making a good part of the gross? Or was it for less solid producers? Either way, the screenplay serves its relaxed style well, and the result is richer and more entertaining than Connery's previous two Eon Bond outings, "You Only Live Twice" and "Diamonds Are Forever". <br /> <br /> The 1980s were not a good decade for Bond, whether it was Connery, Moore or Timothy Dalton. Leg warmers, video games and ugly sports cars are all in evidence, and the Bianca Jagger sunglasses Klaus Maria Brandauer are dressed in his first scene and do not favor him. Forget first impressions. Brandauer's role as chief cork, Maximilian Largo, is one of the best in any Bond movie, with Brandauer playing his character's threat and mania enjoyably. At one point, he lets Bond roam free in his situation room, with a martini to boot, and his dancing eyes and crazy, engaging grin make the whole company compelling. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie, except Connery, is the Bond girls, with more attention to personality than normal in Bond movies, a will to filmmaker Douglas Slocombe and director Irvin Kirshner. Barbara Carrera was nominated for a Golden Globe for her role as the villain Fatima Blush, each as crazy as Largo and even more beautiful to look at. She doesn't like the whole movie; you almost need her to focus on the other. <br /> <br /> Kim Basinger's breasts and buttocks had to have their own agents for the screenplay they get in this movie, but I don't complain. Basinger is a rare beauty that in this early role as Largo's mistress combines incredible enjoyment with a childlike vulnerability that brings the Bond into me, and many others I suspect. (Her lips and cheekbone are also beautiful.) <br /> <br /> It's not a well-made movie. It's a knockoff of a better Bond movie with a messy story, a horrible score and a flat end. But it has Connery, and proves he is the final secret agent that is definite, even if he sticks a page or two from my 007, Moore. The end result is enough, so I don't complain.
