The marriage of an exciting New York City couple with a child falls apart when the woman wants ("It had much courage for her to walk out that door!" A neighbor tells us); The busy, derived man takes in the "maternal" responsibilities and grows closer to his son, but soon the woman comes back. Highly manipulative picture does not give us a very realistic family unit (with young Justin Henry definitely not looking at the product of a marriage between Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep!), But the dynamics are intriguing and involved, and director Robert Benton keep the pace dolls with great clever, wonderful classical music, cans of editing and surely pieces of humor. Stripe's character is designed to be a cold, self-centered witch, but I was ready to feel more to her than Benton's would have wanted. Everything needs to be painted black and white, good and bad. Hoffman learns how hard his wife had and gets a second chance to be a good parent. The movie never falls out of its path, and very good acting almost saves it, but I don't know where Benton manages the film in the final performance, and the closing scene is very sudden. *** of ****
