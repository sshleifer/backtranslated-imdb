I really enjoyed watching this movie! Only a few parts were slow, but it just sat and acted. I thought this movie was very educational, it taught me more about my Croatian heritage. I also learned more about Louise Arbor, and I can say she has a huge influence on me. Journal named Louise Arbor one of the world's 100 most influential people in April 2004. I recommend this movie to people who like historical movies (of course). This movie was very dramatic but still told the truth of events in former Yugoslavia. Louise Arbor is a brave hero, and I'm glad they made a movie that honors her. If you see the movie, I hope you'll enjoy it.
