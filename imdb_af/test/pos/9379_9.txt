Edward Dmytryk's Crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller, an unlikely "message" movie using the noir cycle look and devices. <br /> <br /> Bivouped in Washington, DC, a company of soldiers dealing with their restlessness by hanging in bars. Three of them end up at a stranger's apartment where Robert Ryan, drunk and belligerent, kills their army (Sam Levene) because he is Jewish. Police detective Robert Young investigated by Robert Mitchum, who was assigned to Ryan's outfit. Suspect falls on the second of three (George Cooper), who has disappeared. Ryan hits the third mate (Steve Brodie) to ensure his silence before Young closes. <br /> <br /> By a superior script by John Paxton, Dmytryk carries precise performances of his three great Bobs. Ryan, of course, does his prototypical Angry White Man (and to the hilt), while Mitchum underestimates his characteristic vigilance (his role is not central); Young should never have been better. Gloria Grahame gives her first full version of the clever mouth, vulnerable tramp, and as a sad sack in her life, Paul Kelly haunts us in a small, peripheral role he remembers. <br /> <Politics fiancÃ© Dmytryk may be inevitably dedicated to preaching, but it is actually limited to Young's remembrance of how his Irish grandfather died in the hands of bigots before. It also stretched chronology to the limit. At least there is no attempt to give an explanation, but why not, Ryan hates Jews (and hillbillies and ...). <br /> <br /> Strangely, Crossfire even survives the huge change that has been made - the novel It's Based (Richard Brooks' The Brick Foxhole) tackled a gay-bashing murder. But homosexuality in 1947 was still out of the pale. The news from the Holocaust, however, began from the ashes of Europe, so that Hollywood felt to register its protest against anti-Semitism (the studios always faced the prospect of insulting any potential ticket buyer). <br /> But while changing homophobia to anti-Semitism in general, the details don't fit as smoothly. The victim who arrives at a lonely, drunk young soldier and then invites him back home seems strange, though (or especially since) there is a girl in the tow. This raises the question of whether this scenario is accidentally retained or left as a discrete tip-off to the original engine that generates Ryan's murderous rage.
