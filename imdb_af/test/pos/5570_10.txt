I must admit that I was initially worried about Farscape. The opening segment was not very strong, and I started to worry about what had to come. However, if combined in the well-known Henson area with the sense of humor, the unique and enduring characters, and the compelling story, it made an excellent piece of science fiction. The story follows John Crichton (played by Ben Browder) a scientist who developed a spaceship and theory that relies on instant messaging. In the first test, however, his vessel is experiencing an unknown magnetic field, and is tackled in an unknown galaxy, in the midst of a battle between escaped prisoners (on the starship Moya) and the peacekeepers (human enforcers). He is literally drawn into the prisoners' ship, and after many turns he finds himself united with the prisoners (Ka D'argo, a Luxom warrior; Pa'U Zhaan, a Delvish priest; Rygel XVI, an apostate ruler and Aeryn Son, a peace maker who has reluctantly joined the crew. With excellent special effects, moderate makeup and dolls and robots that exceed the Henson standard of perfection. as well as a very well-written story, and character-driven plot, FarScape seems to be a fantastic original, creative and clever science fiction series.
