For the first time I fell in love with the vampire with my daughter, now 13, years ago. we both thought it was a top movie, then look at sub 11 and then under 111 now i find that there is sub 1v i can't wait to get my teeth, and there is also a fifth in the pipeline. if no one saw the movies. this is the best of the best. I think it's a thousand Oscar's. I can see it from morning to night. I would like to have a set of nails as he did, looking forward to girls. I love it because all the story lines of film after film continue. These ant typical vampire films are better. I would like to live in the life of the movies. it will make all my dreams come true
