On my way back in 1996, one of the pilot aircraft pilots where I worked, gave me a copy of this movie. He told me it would make me cry. I never believed him and we even made bets. After I watched the movie .... I cried a bucket! Even after I saw the movie, I found myself in the bathroom. It was actually the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. I like the part where Dexter's mother confronted Eric's mother. The line went like this ... "Your boys' best friend just died today. And it won't be easy ... if you ever lay your hands on him again ... I'll kill you!" The last part where Dexter took Eric's shoes was a never-before-seen scene. Honestly, just to think about it, make my eyes slow. A story of what true friendship is all about. My girlfriend also loved it ... She hated me to show her. I cried a bucket, she cried a river.
