Even if it's not marked as a Slasher movie, it has all the elements. The fact that slashers are known for its low budget, lame plot, cheese effects, and everything you can add doesn't mean there aren't any good slasher movies. "Opera" fills in the description. Although it is part of Italian giallo; Dario Argento proves he deserves the label of one of the best directors in Horror. It's far from a slasher subgenre. <br /> <br /> Dario Argento proves he deserves the label of one of Horror's best directors. "Opera" is one of the most attractive Horror movies of the past 30 years. Although the film takes place in a beautiful spot; The situations and gores make it one of the scariest places ever used in a Horror movie. <br /> <br /> I think of "Opera" as a stylish Slasher, though in depth a plot and character development. The cheese factor often used in most Slasher movie is not present here, but in return we have an exciting, visually stunning gore story. The movie's plot is simple (as in every Slasher). There is a psycho in the opera that is somewhat obsessed with the main actress / singer and forces her to see horrific deaths. The dead scenes are extremely horrific and are the best aspect of the movie. The notorious "peep-hole" death scene is, in my opinion, the highlight of the movie. It's a terrific death scene that no one but Argento can release. The knife through the neck (and mouth) is another gruesome scene, but less violent than the scissors death. The gore in "Opera" will please the wicked and lovers of violence. <br /> <br /> What I don't like about the movie is the lack of coherence or logic. I mean, after I first watched the death, the female, calm down as if nothing had happened, had a ride home and didn't make much of a big deal about what she saw. She was also left alone in the house and did not take security measures. Still, the tension in the movie lets you forget the lack of logic. Argento knows how to create tension and how to scare the subconscious. For example, if Betty's friend tells her that someone's looking at her from outside, she whistles out and puts stress in the event that something happens. <br /> <br /> The direction of the movie is great. For an Italian giallo it is excellent. Argento's creative POV shots are impressive. The rawe also had a creepy feel to the movie. Argento adds its unique spice. <br /> <br /> "Opera" is one of the most underrated, but popular by the Horror community for these reasons, in my opinion: the candlelight deathguard (brilliant); the rawe eventually falls to opera setting - the knife through the neck and mouth - the heavy metal score combined with opera music (this music has never spoken to me before) - the killer's anger <br /> <br /> The only thing I don't like about Opera "is the heavy metal songs used in death. It's right to disturb the audience, but I think the Opera music could have a cleaner feel. Yet the" shocking " "Using heavy metal a particularly disturbing aspect in the movie. <br /> <br /> See" Opera "even if you don't like Gore. is not a "Suspiria", but it also deserves Argento's best.
