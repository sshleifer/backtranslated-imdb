Initially I honestly thought it would be a maize movie. But after I saw it, I was quite surprised. Amanda Bynes was convincingly funny with the supportive cast (especially the character played by "Bullet Tooth Tony" by Snatch. What a contrast between the two movies!). Now, I am not one to say whether an actor is good or not, or not, but especially her act was enjoyable. Although the plot in a teenager-upper-love triangle (although very funny) has been transmitted halfway into the movie, I feel that it shouldn't be discounting and what I think is the movie really: just entertaining. So if you fall to stumble upon it, whether through DVD or theater, I'm confident you'll enjoy it.
