The stars and planets must be all in the right alignment, the day THRILLER is invented. Michael Jackson's album killed the cards. John Landis still wanted to build on his genre, "An American Werewolf In London", and his choreographer Michael Peters was also not known for his classic comedies. create some of the most innovative and influential pieces of music videos of that period. <br /> <br /> Not before or since has one MJ's incredible talent or the more "extraterrestrial" aspects of the relief, exploitation or accentuation of MJ's incredible talent. his persona likes THRILLER, the world's most successful (if not officially the first) long-form video, and most lovingly remembered. Also the most expensive of the time, but every penny and all the talent behind the creation and execution is there on the screen. And how would that not be done without the "rap" of the original song presented by the late, big Vincent Price to add even more closet to the cold fever there? <br /> <br /> The glory days of one of the world's greatest artists have long since passed, but no one can ever diminish the man's high performance, which is probably the most memorable one. If you don't think so, remember: Halloween is coming. I won't be a little surprised if it goes back like other Halloweens before decades, it appears on some Saturday Night Creature Feature special. <br /> <br /> Like next year and the following year.
