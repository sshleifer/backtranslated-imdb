too bad they showed palm trees that could no longer be inaccurate for Connecticut in October. It was filmed in New Zealand. This Martha Moxley case was cold for 20-25 years. Her family worked hard to keep it alive and when Mark Fuhrman decided, he didn't just want to be remembered for his involvement in the Nicole Simpson case .... which could harm his reputation (if not already) . Anyway, he then tried to get enough information to write a book. ... with the use of flashbacks, we can see the relationships that Martha formed ... Unattended boys of old without mother to help and a father who has always walked. <br /> <br /> Plus depicting the right Martha as if she were a movie star ... she was a cute sweet girl next door. Other than that, the other characters were very good, especially Jon Foster and Toby Moore, who played Michael Skakel and Tommy Skakel respectively. They were also good, the customers had to watch it all in the 70's and back to the 90's .... <br /> <br /> It kept me interested even when I caught up with the Link guy. ..
