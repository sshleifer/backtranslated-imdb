I was fortunate to see this movie on pre-release last night and although I didn't expect it, I really enjoyed the movie. The rescue and marine prospects were great to watch and definitely gave the front of the seat time, probably more so knowing there are guys doing it for a lifetime. The weaker parts of the movie are mainly stereotypical scenes. I'm not going to spoil the movie, but it really follows the lines of an officer and a gentleman, and those moments give it a bit of a cheesy aftertaste. <br /> <br /> As I said about this movie, it's pretty good and worth checking out as long as you can get to the clich√©s.
