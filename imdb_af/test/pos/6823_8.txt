I think I was one of those people who found this other one of Roth's pearls. His performance, as awarded, was stunning. The story that Francis Ford Coppola has so eloquently told 25 years earlier, really develops gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop. Roeg again proves that it should not be a war institution that will be interstate. In a wonderful place lies a story of contrast. Ruthlessness and beauty go hand in hand, while loneliness becomes your best friend. It shows a more sinister past of a small golden age empire that lands on a coast full of wealth for a 1st world country, if you send the right men. All in all, a beautifully directed film by Nicola's rogue, with a sublime role.
