The film opens in a stuffy British men's club full of men in cigarette smoking chairs. This is Denistoun's world. A messenger gives him a small box that he opens to find some gold earrings. The place of the earrings reminds us of the time he spent in the company of gypsies. The rest of the movie is a flash. <br /> <br /> Gold Earrings is a long favorite of mine and is probably the most romantic movie I know. Dietrich plays against her usual type. Here she is dark hair, nice and not least secretive. Instead of a femme fatale, she puts a tower of power and energy to use all her resources to help Denistoun survive and reach his goal. To make sure he is a very convincing gypsy, pierce his ears and wear the golden earrings of her dead lover. With his clothes and a little fat, she changed him from a good British man to a wild and sexy man. <br /> <br /> When I grew up, I heard the song "Golden Earrings" sung in the movie. I think the melody is a bit like Dietrich's mind. / There is a story the gypsies know is true. / If your love is wearing gold earrings / She belongs to you.
