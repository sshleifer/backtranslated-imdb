Every year there is a very expected red-hot-big-budget title with the right combination of star, director and topic failing at the box office. This year it was Superman Returns. In 1982, it was Blade Runner. In 1957, it was Billy Wilder's Spirit of St. Louis, a movie that had everything - top director, big star, best selling truth about an American hero - except enough of an audience to cover its cost. Perhaps the public still remembers Lucky Lindy's anti-Semitism and his great admiration for Nazi Germany's pre-war achievements (not covered in the film, which ends with his arrival in Paris before the legend has strangled). Maybe because they thought they knew the story or that it was just one man sitting in a cabin for two hours. Certainly, Wilder and co-author Wendell Mayes are aware of the dramatic pitfalls of Lindbergh's relatively inevitable flight, ranging from a well-executed retrospective structure to key points in his life and building up the flight himself. Once the movie is in the air, it is surprising and exciting, and finds a real drama in its efforts to stay awake and without proper instruments. <br /> <br /> It also builds a very remarkable sense of fear that is different from anything else. In Wilder's filmography, linked to a true sense of the epic: shots like the ominous storm clouds over the hanger, the dark dawn before the flight, carry a huge cold of pre-war to them. Even the typically muted and problematic WarnerColor adds to the movie rather than detracts from it. Along with the brilliant use of CinemaScope, there is a remarkable score by Franz Waxman: majestic, exciting but filled with oppressed threat, and clever use as part of the material of the film, rather than mere musical accompaniment. The film lost points to imply, though it was never quite clear, that it was a race to conquer the Atlantic. Lindbergh was the third man to fly across the Atlantic after being surprised by Brits Alcock and Brown. flight eight years earlier - but it is still a remarkably tense and exciting adventure story that has earned the success it never found.
