Should we take the opening shot as a strange frame ??? I think we should. Anyway, two women are behind a closing column, they walk to the talent agency and we go with them ... and then they are never seen again. Okay, how come it's not in the place, at the piano or even outside with the tone of the piano, then track inside and over, a la Hitchcock ??? So I think Clouzot already tells us in a not very subliminal way that we follow a segment of post-war society: especially how he then uses a Citizen Kane song that is cut in about five pieces to show the lady who sings from the talent agency all the way to her first roses and applause from her Vaudeville debut. Then, we are ruthless observers of more or less disgusting details of a devastated country that gets its war-torn, bruised knees. And no one ever had a little embarrassment than Clouzot. In fact, he never tried Sartre's Nausea. Almost everything we see after the first few minutes ever makes us so sad. .... okay, okay, I'm very overstated, let's just fix for a general feeling of much of the movie. Look carefully, and you'll even see one of the police picking up his nose. And in how many films did anyone ever do. Then there is a very hard nasal bladder before the photographer's lesbian by the head, and sees that she doesn't literally cut an eye or raise an eyebrow. <br /> <br /> The point of all is an almost feverish dip in presence, apparently, until you can smell and see almost every scene. <br /> <br /> As far as the other aspects of the movie are concerned, others have covered in much more detail than I do. But forget about the mystery here: it's the ultimate McGuffin. Clouzot is about as interested in the real killer as the two women arrive in the first few seconds of the rain and are never seen again. From the beginning to the end, all he wanted to do was a lot of people around, not even very interesting about it, and here follows the woman's jerk, the man's pants in all their meanings, years and years before Tina Turner was singing, we didn't need another hero. Even the forced end of the end is slender in a dilapidated part of Paris, and quite a bare, open-walled apartment. With just the couples love each other to see them, as if you have to say that there are two or three million as you should be throughout the city, work your fingers down the day for a little love at night. <br /> <br /> From this it was just a short walk to Loon of Fear and the ultimate despair. <br /> <br /> They don't even know how to make movies like this in the US. They didn't even know how to do it in France too much, much less now. The ruthless detail of gesture even makes the neo-realists of Italy look like bad psychologists. What I think makes Clouzot a kind of Rosselini at speed. <br /> <br /> Very pleasant nonsense, this movie. The only mistake is for me, and as another viewer pointed out, the main wife is somehow not right. Everyone else in the movie will be thrown over perfectly.
