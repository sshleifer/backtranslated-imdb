This was the first direct work by Sebastian Gutierrez, the writer of Slange on a plane and Gothika. Anyone who has read my reviews knows that I love hijackers, and it was a dead end. An abduction and a woman shot in the process. The FBI has Emma Thompson on the kidnapping case and police chief Roscoe Lee Browne gives Alan Rickman the assassination, which is a senator's (Hal Holbrook) wife. These two make an excellent pair as they work together. <br /> <br /> The kidnappers / killers have Simon Baker (Land of the Dead) and the ultra-hot Carla Gugino (Sin City), along with some partners. They kidnap a Hotshot computer mug and they run his accountant all over town before they get the dough. Things are moving fast from there, as new twists and turns are being introduced. The whole thing is brilliant and definitely a "piss in your pants because you can't go to the bathroom or you'll miss something". <br /> <br /> To be honest, I would have given this movie a 10 if there was more of the movie watching the security guard in the opening. I'd love to see more of Beverly Hotsprings and Yvette Lera, but it wasn't part of the hijacker; just cakes on the cake. <br /> <br /> Thompson and Rickman should definitely make more movies. One Treat: <br /> <br /> Agent Hawkins: Then fill me in. Detective Friedman: The comment can be misunderstood as sexual harassment, Agent Hawkins. Agent Hawkins: Let's get it out of the way: you've never worked under a female superior. I came where I was by printing paper and playing well. I've never shot a gun. I'm just in this job to prove to my dad that I'm not coward. I give a decent headline, so I have all promoted to fellatio before all the deserving candidates, all of their husbands, but there was a gender quota to fill. I'm also stupid and idealistic; you are hard and cynical, and usually right. I'm secretly in love with you, but I find it hard to show it. Did I have anything left? <br /> <br /> Damn, it's a good dialogue! Gutierrez not only leads a good movie, but he can also write! <br /> <br /> And, I said Carla Gugino was hot? <br /> <br /> Put it on your list.
