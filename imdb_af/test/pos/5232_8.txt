My movie with a score of 8 is relative to other 1930 movies. According to the standards of films made just a few years later, this movie can only get 6 or 7 points - mainly because the sound quality was so poor. Now it is possible that the movie sounded better and the Fox Movie Channel showed a degraded print (it has lots of lines and scratches), but I guess the sound problem was always a problem. This is because the sound in movies was another novelty in 1930 and many of the 1930s Hollywood pictures sounded awful - with background characters, the leaders often drowned, merged characters to make sure they were picked up by the microphones or conflicting quality (as seen in the BISHOP MURDER CASE, HELL'S ANGELS and other films of the day). It's all made much worse in THE GREAT TRAIL because most of the movies were shot out - something unheard of at the time. Completely an innovation, but also something the talents of the sound engineers really stretched out! So, while the movie was very difficult to listen to, I realized they had to start somewhere, so I can forgive it - especially since the outdoor screens are breathtaking - a major innovation for the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The plot is rather similar to CIMARRON - a Western that came out the following year and caught the Oscar for Best Picture. Unfortunately, CIMARRON is not as nice as a movie and I actually keep the BIG TRAIL more because of the size of the movie. While some are moving at the BIG TRAIL's slow pace, I saw it as a good history lesson on the hardships traveled by West on the road. In addition, the whole thing looked just as beautiful, as director Raoul Walsh had great difficulty filming on the spot. The BIG TRAIL looks almost like a movie version of some Ansel Adams prints. <br /> <br /> Regarding the acting, it was pretty good. It was a big break for young John Wayne - as his previous screenings were at best small and unbeatable. Here he took the lead and did a foolish job - although of course he was young and a little less John Wayne-ish than in his later films, as his screen-son was not yet firmly established. Another interesting part was played by Tyrone Power II (Tyrone Power's father). He doesn't look like his very handsome son and looks and looks almost exactly like Bluto from Popeye cartoons! He made very few sound films - just a year after he made this film - so it's a rare opportunity to see and hear this once-known actor. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie is worth seeing despite some sound problems and a few excessive scenes here and there. For 1930, it was a remarkable achievement - more so than the well-known and award-winning CIMARRON made the following year. Much of the reason why the BIG TRAIL has not won an Oscar is because ALL STANDS ON THE WESTERN FRONT came out the same year and this is really one of the big movies.
