Although it's definitely a pleasant way to spend a few hours and it's always worth making a watch, this movie never meets the targets it needs for two reasons. First, after the first forty-five minutes, it focuses heavily on Helen and Johnny, who are less interesting characters than most others. Janet, Jennifer, George and Miss Scattergoods are much more seductive. Although it initially works, because in life we ​​don't always know everything about everyone, and because the point is that Helen might be involved a little bit, it quickly gets thin and we want to see more of the other characters. <br /> <br /> Second, the film seems to lose its way in terms of plot in the second half. The letter itself has much less significance than what it did in the first half, and although it works well in some ways, it seems strange to leave so much of the potential in the first half. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is sweet and cheerful, with some truly hilarious moments. For example, Janet explains spices for an avid audience. The lazy but quiet, desperate atmosphere that Helen feels is heavy and the feeling of living in a small coastal town is accurately portrayed, but the film is not quite as intelligent as it is trying. It just misses a light romantic comedy and is a smart portrait of life. However, it is still good and if you get the chance it is definitely worth seeing.
