Roy Anderson's film 'You, The Living' consists of a series of fifty sketches, snapshots and vignettes based in a Swedish city. Some characters are on the screen for a few seconds, while others appear in many scenes and are sometimes seen in the background while other stories unfold. Many scenes are drawn from the dreams, nightmares and fantasies of the strange but credible characters inhabiting this world. This is a fascinating approach: each of the screens can be enjoyed separately, but together they have a powerful portrait of what it is human. <br /> <br /> For the first half or so, "You, Life" is wonderfully funny. Much of the humor is on the members of a copper group, whose music practice infects the neighbors in their apartment block. The comic highlight, however, is provided by a horribly wrong menu track. However, after this hilarious introduction, the sphere of the film worsens considerably. The dinner dream becomes fierce when the unfortunate protagonist is tried for his life. He puts a mixed tone of absurdity and despair for the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> In the subsequent screens the unhappiness of the role of characters is becoming increasingly apparent. They are a world where people cannot interact with each other, where talk of dreams, nightmares and fantasies are widespread, but where no person can be comforted, even when others reach out to help them. The weary woman with the "No one loves me" remembers, and the young girl with unreliable love for the rock guitarist, Micke, is archetypal characters. <br /> <br /> The world of "You, Life" is also thrown through selfishness. An elderly professor is breaking the warmth of a large banquet to answer a call from his turbulent money-grabbing son; a thief steals the purse of a relentless CEO; An arrogant and impatient businessman insults a Muslim captain and receives his arrival. In the film's darkest moment, a woman in the church tells the long list of human sins while her fellow congregation members leave at the closing time. <br /> <br /> Yet, for all dark moments in this film, the shared chorus of 'Tomorrow is another day' indicates the ability of people to live, despite much misery. The soundtrack offered by Benny Anderson (from ABBA celebrity) seems to be inappropriate jovially, but makes more and more sense as the film realizes that this human capability persists. <br /> <br /> "You, The Living" have an extraordinary visual style. The same washed out, pale green colors repeat throughout, and there is no shadow in sight; This makes the characters look extremely messy and creates the sensation that human life is being exposed for investigation. Almost every scene is trapped in a static camera frame, as if it is bringing pictures to life. The few opportunities where the camera moves are becoming more and more unusual; The contrast between life and the movement of the large banquet forms a spectacular contrast to the death of the locker room. In the most intense moments of longing and despair, the characters are conveyed by the viewer by looking directly at the camera. They know they are being investigated and have a few moments to throw their hearts out to us, the viewers. <br /> <br /> It's a wonderful human movie.
