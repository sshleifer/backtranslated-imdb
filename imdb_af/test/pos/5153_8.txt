You, the Living (2007) <br /> <br /> Mordant. I have never written the word before, but it comes here in mind. Let me look up. Well, that's part of it - quoting, but also funny. So corrosive funny. It's a dour movie, with certainty, with so much dry dry, dry white and sincere humor, it's impossible to keep it on one level or the other. In a very sparse style, often with a static camera and straight-balanced, stable compositions, such as theater stages, we see a short display. <br /> <br /> But it makes it look ordinary - what it isn't. Ordinary life seems to be frumpy, ironic, beautiful, concise and depressed. And impossible. We, the living, must live, and since we live, we can also take note. Something like that. I think it was Ebert who said you found yourself laughing and didn't know why. Exactly. And the promotional material said somewhere it was a cross between Bergman and Monty Python and what they meant was that it had the dry, quiet, exploration of Ingmar Berman's well-known Swedish films, but it did somehow the zany elements of British comedians. <br /> <br /> I would say, definitely, look at least half an hour. There are some of me who thought I was then - the rest is going on in a similar combination of small sketches and moments, and they are gradually evolving, but there is no big plot to follow or climax of the ordinary . There are a few good moments later, just the attention to the thunderstorm, which brings us out of everyday human events. <br /> <br /> The filming is beautiful in its classic control, almost like a series of Gregory Crewdson scenes (and the photographer actually surpasses). And the acting, with all its very ordinary, non-shiny fullness, is right. A spectacular, beautiful, strange experience.
