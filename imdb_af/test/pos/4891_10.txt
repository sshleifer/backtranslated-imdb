As an American fan of The League of Gentlemen, I had to wait months to watch this movie when it came to DVD, but it was worth winning the (rude) wait. "Apocalypse" is fantastic-funny, freaky, smart like hell, full of jokes and cryptic references to the television series; basically everything you expect from the Lord. <br /> <br /> The plot has already been discussed in other reviews, so I won't bother it again, although I will say when I first read it, I was a little hesitant. Clearly, these device-fictional characters entering the real world to confront their creators have previously been used, especially in West Craven's underrated "New Nightmare" and Stephen King's "Dark Tower" books (where King himself character). The Lord has the fun of breaking the fourth wall, adding even a new element: a second fictional world ("their days"). Soon all three realities have woven together, and the result is exciting: Geoff Tipps is plagued in the middle of the century (trying to court Queen Victoria Wood); the true League of Gentlemen in Royston Vasey, confronted with characters such as Pauline and Dr. Chinnery; David Warner summons a homunculus outside Bernice's church. I heard that some people didn't have the "King's Evil" chart, but I found it hilarious, especially Reece's character (which Judith could channel the "Witch" of series three). <br /> <br /> Talking to the characters, I was relieved to find it, although Hilary Briss, Geoff and Herr Lipp were firmly planted in the film's core, other more famous characters were given to them. Bernice's confession at first was hilarious, listening back to the faster, more sketch-oriented feel of the first series. Pauline and Mickey have cameos (no Ross alien), although I like more of Mrs. Campbell-Jones would like to see. Papa Lazarou is accountable, such as Tubbs and Edward. All three are used very sparingly, which gives their meager screen time an almost magical feeling (and just what the HELL has Dad patted, like an obscure hairball? According to the DVD comment, a fatter of fatty pubic hair). /> <br /> The movie looks incredible, but then, what's new? The music, as always, is breathtaking. I was delighted to hear Joby Talbot's new interpretations of the theme music and his light reworking of the majestic, beautiful piece that features both "Apocalypse" and the last episode of Series Three. <br /> <br /> I have had a few small complaints - it would be nice to see more of the old, well-known Royston Vasey, and I felt that the moving creatures (pretty, casually) were a was a little underused. However, both of these issues can be justified by the film's budget so they are understandable. Yet, as much as I loved Bernice's new church, it would have been cool to see the final battle in the high street (the gentleman's original vision, according to the comment). Overall, "Apocalypse" is amazing, especially if you are a fan of the series. I can't recommend it highly enough. 10/10.
