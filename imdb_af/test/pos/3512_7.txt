I was fortunate to see the DVD version of the "Horror Classics" of this movie before being mysteriously removed from the 4-film DVD and replaced with something else. The picture and sound quality of the film on that issue was in itself a nightmare. Yet the version is even better than the one with the deluxe DVD treatment. This is due to Brad Fiedel's special edition DVD's maintenance segments. He took note of what I found so first about this film. This is the use of music in moments of inactivity in the film, but leaves the moments of activity in silence, giving the horror scenes a stronger feel. The problem with this reissue is that it carries the extra movie score used to fill these deliberate gaps in the score. Fiedel complained about this and made it clear that the filling music was not his. The music actually sounded much like Howard Shore's Videodrome work. I'm sorry that I'm also a big fan of that movie and have to associate the two. <br /> <br /> The movie itself has managed to add some interesting realistic elements to the genre horror movie. A group of friends went up a mountain, one of them was inherited. On the mountain they are confronted with a family with a nightmare secret. The movie is moving at a great pace. In fact, every time I saw it, I still feel shocked to see 45 minutes have elapsed before the campers really went wrong. <br /> <br /> While the Horror Classics version is filled with gaps, the fact that there is no score associated with the horror screens is what makes this movie intelligent and even better than most slasher movies I've ever seen. Director Jeff Lieberman earlier made some unique horror movie. This one makes the most common and yet very different from the main stream at the same time. It's a great fun movie with startling performances. The new upgraded DVD version is worth a hire, the new collection item Horror Classics version, now OOP is worth the hunt.
