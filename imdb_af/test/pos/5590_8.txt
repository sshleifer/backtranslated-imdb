Who won the best actress Oscar for 1933? It must have been Laura Hope Crewes for her beautiful portrayal of the most beautiful mom ever. She is truly one of the great character trades of all time. She played the frivolous Prudence Duvernoy in "Camille" (1936) and her best remember role is Tant Pittypat in "Gone With the Wind". Irene Dunne was the "official" star of the film, but her scenes with Laura Hope Crewes were dynamic. <br /> <br /> David (Joel McCrea) is in Heidelberg when he is offered a job in New York. His wife, Christine (Irene Dunne), can continue her studies at the Rockafellar Center. Their first stop in America is a visit to David's mother, Mrs. Phelps. To say that Laura Hope Crewes dominates every scene is a sub-statement. From her first entrance - in a beautiful attempt to greet her "big boy" - everything is on her. Even sitting around the tea table, forgetting her existence, even forgetting how to take her tea, you know something is not quite right. (Hester has been living there for a while.) <br /> <br /> Frances Dee is completely sweet and so right in her role as the beautiful Hester. Her performance in this film, especially the scene where she was hysterical and the aftermath, shows how underestimated it is as an actress she was. <br /> <br /> All the young role players are excellent. Eric Linden is beautiful as Robert, the younger son who realizes that his mother is terrible, but can do nothing about the escape of his mother's game. Joel McCrea, at one point, says "rose on bathtub - it's more your style". There is a very subtle suggestion in the film of Robert's sexuality. <br /> <br /> Irene Dunne is great in any movie or genre she tried.
