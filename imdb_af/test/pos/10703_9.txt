For those who expect documentary documents to be objective creatures, let me give you some lessons in American movies. <br /> <br /> Documentaries are very dependent on casting. You choose and choose characters that you think will improve your movie's drama and entertainment. <br /> <br /> After shooting a ton of footage, splash it up to make a movie with up and down, turning points, climbs, etc. If you are having trouble with existing footage, you also shoot something that makes sense, look for inventory, or be clever with your story. <br /> <br /> The claim that filmmakers do not share locals' material in the film (favelas along beautiful beaches) detracts from the value of the film as a dramatic piece and the particular image is one that resonates enough justify its non-just inclusion. Anyway, you use the images you can. They did not have the police's material for that particular area. Doesn't that mean it and just talk about it or put some animated animations so that the audience doesn't get "doped"? Um, no. <br /> <br /> As for the hopeful end, why not? Yes, Americans made it. Yes, Americans are optimistic bastards. But why end a subscription? Just because it is being posted almost in a foreign country and foreign films? Show foreigners the dim view of life. <br /> <br /> Let us Americans think there may be a happy ending in the future. There can be only one.
