I have to say this is one of the best movies I've ever seen for Naruto. The action was much better than the first movie because it had much more fighting space and it reached you faster. It was wonderful, the choreographer was excellent as well as most visual effects. <br /> <br /> The story line is something new to Naruto. but it's basically the same as the first movie. In the series you see them fighting against other ninjas, but in the movies (1 + 2) you see them fighting against mass destruction machine. It's nice to see they fight something different than ninja, and it was great to see other power than chakra. and how other people from other countries are fighting the sea. Sakura also eventually killed someone who died stronger than her. (She really got strong) It was much better than the fillers on the range I was watching now. If you watch this movie, the quick action scene will surely make your heart. With new jutsus and garra in the movie, you know it's good. and the music was good too, but I find it missing something. But the end theme song was a plus. (dind dong dang) I think was a very good song. I totally recommend it. <br /> <br /> All in all, I give this movie a 10 because I just love it. If you decide to watch it, enjoy it. lol
