A young couple - father Ben (solid Charles Bateman), wife Nicky (beautiful Ahna Capri) and their daughter KT (the cute Geri Reischl of "I Dismember Mama" boast) - find themselves trapped in a small desert town in California. by hysterical lunatics. Worse still, there is a malicious satanic cult kidnapping small children for their own diabolical purposes. Director Bernard McEveety, working from a horrible and inspired script by William Welch and L.Q. Jones (the devil Times Five director Sean MacGregor performed the bizarre story), tells the compelling oddball plot at a slow but steady pace and suddenly makes a creepy, mysterious, yoga bow atmosphere. Strong Martin delivers a wonderful and robust performance as Doc Duncan, who is the nice sinister leader of the evil sect. The best role players of excellent character actors qualify as a substantial asset: Jones as gruff, no-nonsense Sheriff Hillsboro, Alvy Moore as friendly local Toby, and Charles Robinson as a sharp, devout, dedicated priest Jack. John Arthur Morrill's bright, polished widescreen cinematography, Jamie Mendoza-Nava's ghostly score, and wildlife, exciting climbing black murder ritual, are all about. The idea that toys come to murderous life is simply ingenious (the opening scene with a toy box that really comes crashing and crushing a family in their car is really jolting). Nice honesty ambiguous end too. An enjoyable idiosyncratic and undervalued winner.
