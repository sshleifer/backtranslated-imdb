Most people attending this film have no idea of ​​the great novel by Miller Miller. It is a novel that has to be read by more people to see how prejudice affects and changes people's lives. <br /> <br /> In the beginning, Lawrence Newman is an ordinary man. The glasses that his boss makes him change, everything he worked for, and his whole world fell around him. There could not have been an actor better suited to bring this intelligent performance to the screen than William H. Macy. Not only is he a talented stage and screen actor, but he develops honesty behind every character he plays. He is an everyday man caught in his own uncertainties. His anxiety worsens as he walks out of his work. Suddenly he must confront the issues he has been trying to avoid all his middle-class existence in the Brooklyn of the 40's. Is he Jewish, isn't he? The cinematography in this brilliant and atmospheric film, handled by Neil Slavin, reminded me of some Edward Hopper's paintings, especially a series at the beginning of the movie when Newman steps outside a building and shot the night when he and his wife followed with long black shadows behind the couple, threatening and expecting the confrontation with the bulls. Laura Dern, David Paymer, and especially Meat Bread, which gives the incredible depth of the bully next door, is excellent, but they are all pale compared to William H. Macy's star turn (H must be first class.) If you Not reading the book, I would really recommend it because nobody wrote more and more convincingly than Arthur Miller did.
