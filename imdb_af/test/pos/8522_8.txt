You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, calculate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are some things one can expect, even the demand for a Bond movie and every individual effort or not. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond movie a Bond movie. And even if it never says technically again in the official Bond filmography, the mere presence of Sean Connery back as 007 makes it more than just an honorary member of the series. Anyway, how about a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Title: NEVER SEE AGAIN: The clever title has no clear link to the real storyline, but is rather a in-joke reference to Sean Connery's vow to never play OO7 again after being lured back to DIAMOND once earlier. Whatever the case, it's a catchy title. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Pre-Credit Teaser: Possible to avoid any obvious parallels with the official EON series Bond movies, there's no Teaser; the opening styles are just behind the credits. And even that is disappointing: another "oh-no, Bond is killed" fakeout. 4 points. <br /> <br /> Initial Credits: Unlike a screen full of small 007s, they didn't even bother trying to jazz the credits with graphic or split screens or interesting camera angles. 1 point. <br /> <br /> Theme Song: As written by Michel LeGrand and sung by Lani Hall, "Never Say Never Again" will make a perfectly enjoyable part of a particularly long lift. As a Bond theme, it's just okay. 6 points. <br /> <br /> "Bond, James Bond": Since this film sees Connery being chased back to Bond after a decade, the story begins with 007 asking whether Bond / Connery is still working. Fortunately, Connery more than proved himself ready for Bondage again. Although he is a little grayer, exercising a little more perimeter and wearing a slightly more obvious toupee, he seems to have no trouble going back into action. All in all, it is one of Connery's best, and most relaxed, twists and turns. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Babes: Even in the best of Bond movies, the female characters are not given much dimension; they consist largely of needed props for Bond's use. Future Oscar winner Kim Basinger gets a big gap in creating her character from Domino Petachi and the movie is up to it. She does a good job - and she is not bad at looking at either. 8 points. Bond Villain: The reports of his death are apparently exaggerated. Blofeld is back - at least for the moment - showing he has more lives than his valued pussycat. Once Jesus's depiction-turned-stereotypical villain, Max von Sydow, is not much to do in the role, but is a silver presence. But he is overshadowed by a wonderful performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer and Maximilian Largo. After a series of banal Bond villains, Brandauer is so refreshing to produce a show that is both subtle but colorful. Funny without being campaigning, relentless without seemingly cartoon; his Largo is up there with Auric Goldfinger as one of Bond's best villains. 10 points. <br /> <br /> Bond Baddies: Fatima Blush! What can I say? As played with the brave style of a particularly flamboyant queen of queen, Barbara Carrera bursts through the film, showing a mixture of self-inflicted evil and more than a little pure psychotic madness. Bond has crossed paths with a variety of femmes fatales, most of them so easily cared for to be more than a nice eye candy than characters. But few risked displaying such a flare for the dramatic or such fiery determination. Even her untimely demise is spectacular, even according to Bondian standards. 10 points. Sinister Plot: As a remake of all kinds of THUNDERBALL, the film looks a bit like that: nuclear weapons are stolen and huge properties are going to sleep if all the countries in the world don't pay a multi-billion dollar ransom. But at least producer Kevin McClory was happy to adjourn himself to restore one of the worst Bond adventures. Through comparisons, this attempt blows THUNDERBALL out of the water. And, despite the absence of many Bondian brands, the film succeeds on its own. 9 points. <br /> <br /> Production Values: The movie starts with an uncomfortable style, like a TV movie that's more than it can. But as the story progresses, the movie gets momentum and a sense of purpose, making it a better adventure. 8 points. <br /> <br /> Bonus Points: There are several strange changes that this Bond movie apart from the official series. Miss. Moneypenny is barely recognized; as played by Edward Fox, "M" is a fiery old grouch, without respect for the "Double Os", a shadow of how Judi Dench would play the part later; and "Q" suddenly has a cockney accent and is all girlfriend with Bond. And there is a strange sense of nostalgia throughout the film, such as the replacement of Bond's Astin-Martin with a vintage Packard and a tango dance number that is cleverly inserted into the story. And a great rescue near the end is a horse, a tribute to the RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which was itself a tribute to the Bond films. 5 points. <br /> <br /> Summary: NEVER NEVER NEED a mixed bag. In the very important areas, it's more than his own thanks to the hero Connery, the villain Brandauer, the assassin Carrera and the girl-in-emergency Basinger. But the devil is in the details; as seemingly insignificant as the opening credits, theme song and the like, the film is missing due to their absence. It all comes down to a faux bond film; a very good replacement, but a substitute. <br /> <br /> Bond o-meter Rating: 78 points out of 100.
