Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, respectively, the second of the Universal series, where it is again determined by a written prologue that the well-known detective is legendary and spending time. This helps to make things comfortable in the "current" era of the early 1940s. <br /> <br /> In this presentation, Holmes goes through a few different disguise (with Rathbone's very prominent features, it is likely that people would not really recognize his true identity?), as he is a physicist from the protect Nazi hands, as well as Holmes's biggest nemesis Professor Moriarty (now played by Lionel Atwill). The scientist developed a bombshell that would largely help with airborne bombings, and he promised his plans to the British. But Moriarty wants to get hold of it so he can sell it to the Nazis. <br /> <br /> A good entry has strengthened somewhat by the proper ominous participation of Atwill, now being thrown as Moriarty (although George Zucco was not towed) himself in the adventures of Sherlock Holms). It is always interesting to look at Holmes and his greatest enemy who work together in a spectacular trigger ("the needle to the last, among others, Holmes?").
