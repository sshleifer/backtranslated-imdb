The Railway Children, at least this 1970s movie version written and directed by British character character Lionel Jeffries, is an unprecedented ... classic. It tells a children's story with great simplicity and charm; the sentimentality is subdued; childhood evoking is involved; and Jeffries brings smartness and style to his production. <br /> <br /> The Waterbury family leads an idyllic life in Edwardian London. The father is prosperous, the mother is beautiful and loving, the children are kind and loving, their home is warm and cozy. Then there are two men on the front door one evening during the Christmas holidays, talking quietly to the father and then taking him away. In a moment, the lives of Mrs. Waterbury (Dinah Sheridan) and Bobbie, 14 (Jenny Agutter), Phyllis, 12 (Sally Thomsett) and Young Peter (Gary Warren) change. Only their strength and good spirits are going to look through them. Mrs. Waterbury, who is now in poverty, takes her children to live in a stale old country brick house near a railway line, not too far from a small train station town. The kids discover the railroad and regularly sit on a small hill to venture with the passengers as the train pierces. One day, an old man looks at his business in the city, looks out of his newspaper and finds himself back. It is not long before he will play an important role in the story. <br /> <br /> As time goes by, Mrs. Waterbury has all her love and intelligence on her children. She starts writing stories to earn money. She teaches them their lessons and offers a home of warmth and security to them. However, the story is about these three children, especially Bobbie. At 14 she is old enough to share her mother's concerns, but young enough to enjoy the adventures she has with her sister and brother. They get a poor man at the station who can't speak English. They discover that he is a Russian refugee who no longer knows where his wife and child are. They insist that he come home with them, and their mother take him in. The children have long been writing a big sign to the old men on the train asking for his help. They help a young man who participates in a steeplechase who breaks his leg into a train tunnel. Soon he was restored to their home. They decide to have a birthday party for the stationmaster, a man with few friends and several children who are a sticker for his dignity. It's not long before the kids help him realize the difference between friendship and charity. In other words, the three children experience all sorts of problems in their youth adventures and are instrumental in seeing that all the problems have happy ends. <br /> <br /> What about their own problems? Bobbie finally learns from her mother that her father was taken away for accusing him of giving state secrets to the Russians. Will Bobbie find a way to help? Will the old man be more than just an old man on a train? Will their father's case be reopened? Will there be a happy ending? <br /> <br /> Jenny Agutter was nearly 18 when she filmed her role; She plays Bobbie's 14-year-old with great naturalness and charm. As important as the other players, especially Dinah Sheridan as the mother, Agutter is at the heart of the story. For me it is Jenny Agutter's talent and Lionel Jeffries's style and restraint that makes this movie so memorable. The story's problems come with no serious doubts, but they will be solved. And Jeffries not only gives us a knowledgeable custom and focused movie, he adds what is barely noticed, but loves us. It may just include a split second of a freezer, as two people speak; or a slow close-up of a small, yellow wildflower in the grass outside Bobbie's house, then a slow retraction of a yellow oil lamp to turn inside; or the realization that a lovely indoor shot or view of the green countryside or a view of the train station from a hill ... suddenly remembers those beautiful Edwardian hand-colored drawings of a perfect time. <br /> <br /> Perhaps this soft story can't compete for the time children need to improve their Nintendo sample crushing skills today. I'm almost positive that it will never get the attention of most of their parents, especially those wasted on Batman and Leone. Yet it is a perfect movie compiled and should not be forgotten. Aside, 19 years later, the story was recalled as a television program. This time Jenny Agutter played the mother.
