Scott, Bernard Hughes to name a few. <br /> <br /> I have accumulated more time in hospitals and with doctors over the years than I care. <br /> <br /> This comedy attacks the pump and pretense in all aspects of our society, by setting up one of the "most haughty" institutions ... the medical <br /> <br /> <br / > <br /> The idea that such actions might be possible may be shocking to some, but is a pleasure for anyone with the experience of experience. <br /> <br /> Dr Brock (Scott) is experiencing a mid-life crisis of monumental relationships before our eyes like us and he is enchanted with the prospect of his involvement with me. Drummond (Rigg). The thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mix in the form of the irony that the hospital apparently kills its own workers because they are mismanaging their affairs. <br /> <br /> The climax is unpredictable (unless you say it) and even more hilarious if you guess. <br /> <br /> It's not everyone's brand of humor, and it's definitely an unfortunate, "Dark Moments" when you're open. </ br /> <br /> I loved every minute and was delighted to see it on DVD.
