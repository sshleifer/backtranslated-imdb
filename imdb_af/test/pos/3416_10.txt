We saw this movie in Toronto at the Film Festival last year. It was a real moving experience. I heard about the Truth and Reconciliation process, but as others wrote, I didn't know much about the details of the process. This film demonstrated the process and the growth that can occur when people can see their past understands the events from the standpoints of others involved and drys together. Archbishop Tutu and the others involved in the development of the T&R process deserve recognition for their understanding of human emotions. To see this movie gave me hope for the human race. If we can do T&R, we can't destroy ourselves. People will look back at T and R as the first step from human adolescence to adulthood. <br /> <br /> Of course, as a movie, there were errors. I had no major problems with acting, directing or writing, but for the first time in years I was completely lost in a movie. Maybe I didn't see it. <br /> <br /> See this movie. The audience in Toronto will not give the stage for the next film, we had so many questions and comments for the stars and director. Tom Hooper, Jamie Bartlett, and Chiwetel Ejiofor went to the pavement to continue the conversation. People just came to shake their hands and thanked them for the movie. This has moved us all.
