One of my favorite non-MGM music, it's a classic!> Rita Hayworth is in top form, her beauty jumping off the screen. Gene Kelly shows off his dance skills and introduces musicals to his edgy and innovative choreography that will eventually change the way musical choreographer changes. Phil Silvers is the perfect second banana, and Eve Arden injects this movie with many classrooms. <br /> <br /> The structure is so theatrical that one has to wonder why, in this era where big Broadway shows come from the movies, Cover Girl is not adapted for theater.
