Imagine a world in which everyone is spoken beautifully. No dirty word is ever spoken. Office biking is inconsistent and your boss regularly runs the office people to self-cooked meals where you can talk about the latest interior design styles. Everything is neat, nice - well, just nice. In other words, you are in hell. After the mid-thirties, Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag) began in the mid-thirties to start a new job as a bookkeeper in a small, clean city. From the beginning he feels strange in this proper, impersonal world of superficial friendliness, surrounded by pleasant but inanimate interior architecture and also colleagues. Food doesn't taste anything, drinks don't get you drunk, no kids; After initial steps in, Andreas seeks ways to escape the mere new world. He doesn't know where he came from, but still remembers rich taste, true feelings - anything beyond the unpaid flat line life he now leads. THE BOTHERSOME MAN WHEN HOME FLOOR AND CAFKA HOFFIE, but here the cruelty is the ubiquitous, insignificant cleanliness. Unlike PLEASANTVILLE, it's not about the sensible joist, more a fable of our urban free world civilization. It usually reminds one of the ingenious FIGHT CLUB scene, in which Edward Norton goes through a spot IKEA catalog. Plucked with macabre humor, this Scandinavian laconic story convinced at every level: story, characters and relevance. A real screen jewel. 8/10
