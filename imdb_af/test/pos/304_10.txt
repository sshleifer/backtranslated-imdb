Even with all the theater dealing with the trauma of the Vietnam War (Jacob's Ladder, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Taxi Driver to some extent), one feels that we don't even know half what has happened. Even the horror considering, feels inhumane. And a progress - or withdrawal? - The inhumanity that it requires is an important part of the Apocalypse Now, Coppola's biggest and one of the most important films ever made. Based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 classic, "Heart of Darkness" which rests on the loss of common sense and corruption of morality remote from civilization. It is a superficial civilization like a lower flies. the story of a physical and psychological journey to Vietnam. The story is from Willard, a general who commissioned a special mission to Cambodia after serving his first service in Vietnam. Willard at the start of the film is stuck in Saigon, psychologically unable to return home - Nicky in The Deer Hunter honestly. He is therefore contacted: his mission is to kill an apostate Green Beret who isolated him in a remote outpost on the Nung River, and who apparently became totally insane - worshiping as a god by natives and reluctantly killing. This man's name is Colonel Kurtz, played by Marlon Brando in the second best role of his career (the best is Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire). As Willard travels up in an army boat, with a couple of soldiers being escorted, he leads to the horrors and insanity - and its overwhelming meaninglessness - to an ominous sympathy and identification with Kurtz before even meeting. By the time they do, Kurtz's methods do not really look wrong or they should, and they certainly do not look too unusual or out of place. Apocalypse - a place above morality, the outpost at the end of the world. The loss of civilization, the loss of judgment, of self. Kurtz's monologue about an atrocity he saw as a green cup, and his later revelation, is one of the most diverse and benevolent speeches in cinema history. The film is about trauma, about the human spirit and its breakpoint. Here it is much like The Deer Hunter, and just as well. Apocalypse, however, takes the limits of what we can endure on a global level - Coppola's filmed footage of the humid, dark forest of Cambodia and an opening sequence of helicopters amid explosive forests and an orange sky - on a strange fit door. soundtrack - as well as cold scenes on the river and an air raid on a village with Wagner-blasting speakers (a scene that has ever descended as one of the most chilling, dark humorous and strikingly useless war styles) - it all adds up to the meaning of the apocalypse - the end of the world - and not at a distant point in the future, but the Apocalypse Now and Forever. The deer hunter is much more close and personal, you can even say by the title and show the total effect of trauma on the individual psyche, breaking down the human soul and its ability to completely surrender to the powers of darkness, or to stop. That's why both films are equal - these are two parts of the same thing. In 'Heart of Darkness' Kurtz is shown as a conflict between morality (civilization) and its inner wilderness. In Apocalypse Now, Kurtz has left the conflict behind. He is above good and evil. He released the morality, like a drowning man in the moments before his death can go a saving hand. Kurtz is just waiting for death, with the quote of T. S. Eliot in his temple for himself, lost in the jungle. His last words, and the words echo at the end of the film, are: "The horror ... the horror." He refers to the infinite existence of existence, of the human psyche, and of the pitch of black emptiness within his own mind, where atrocities are born again. It is impossible to express in words what the experience is about watching this movie - the experience, briefly, that Willard experiences on his journey. The last part, at the outpost, almost comparable to his brother's scene in The Deer Hunter, is one of the deepest, quietest and most seductive things I've ever seen.
