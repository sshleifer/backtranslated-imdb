Don't ask me why I love this movie so much. Maybe it came in a while in my life. I wanted to fit in desperately, maybe it's the wonderful monster effects, maybe because I enjoyed the novel "Cabal", but that's probably because I love Clive Barker. I think it's fair to warn the movie and the novel has no real solution and you will probably have a WTF moment to end. At least two successors were planned, but never happened because the movie got lost for a few reasons. The studio made drastic cuts to the film, which cut a good 30 or so minutes from it and did a terrible job of promoting it. The ads made it look like it was just another cheap treasure that shows the "Button face / Mask" Decker character. It's a movie about the monsters! About fantasy! About a place called Midian! It's a story where the monsters are the good guys. There is really nothing else out there! It's not a movie for everyone I think, but it's one of Clive's great works. Sit back and be ready to be taken to Midian - where the monsters are.
