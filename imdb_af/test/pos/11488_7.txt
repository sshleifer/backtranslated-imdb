"Committed" is all about Graham as an indisputable optimist looking for her self-estranged man, who is looking for himself, all of which leads to a kind of cookie, fascinating comic odyssey that includes a bunch of characters and issues. A fresh, fun and unpredictable little movie, missing 'Committed' in a story makes it into good nature and subtle moral and maximum. If you enjoy this little chick fly, which has been slightly above the average reviews by critics and the public, you might want to watch Lisa Krueger's hit Indie "Manny & Lo" (1996). (B)
