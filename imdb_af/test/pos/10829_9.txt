Director and author Jean-Pierre Rappenau was 8 years old in the spring of 1940 when France's Third Republic dissolved in a few weeks. It was a time, he said, when "all the adults were a little sick." He and the production staff have lovingly and carefully recreated the world into a movie where all the characters are essentially fictional. The structure, a classic farce, is ideal for the period, as several plot lines zip and cross only to come together in a logical, satisfactory conclusion. The plot for this plot is Frederic, played by brilliant newcomer Gregory Derangere, who plays completely against Adjani, Depardieu and Ledoyen. The real strength of the movie is in its supporting actions. M. Rappeneau sold out the film with actors who volunteered ideas for both action and dialogue and who know and prove that it is possible to fully realize a character with just two short sentences of dialogue. Although not as widespread as Renoir's Game Rules, Bon Voyage deserves a classic companion. Although much of the audience demands, give it back a lot. One of his claims is the tolerance for some kind of favor and deception about the exact genre we are watching: a crime melodrama, no, a spy riller, ah, a romantic comedy. Recommend it to make friends. Make sure they discover for themselves that this is a romantic comedy.
