The successor is exactly what you will expect to be. And it is good enough that everyone who wanted it should leave it happy. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie that will win an Oscar award. But it does take what the Jackass TV show and original movie made a success, and that makes it a joke. It is more beautiful, more brutal, and more disgusting than the original. And I loved it every minute. <br /> <br /> The original had some notorious stunts, and at least one stunt that this movie will be remembered. You will blow, shrink, look away and laugh very hard. <br /> <br /> Anyway, you probably won't have to read this review or anyone else to know if you want this movie. , unless you've never heard of Jackass.
