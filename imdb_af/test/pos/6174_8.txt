I missed it at the theater and rented it on DVD. If you get the chance, I would recommend it if it's better than almost everything I've seen at the cinema or DVd this year. That's not to say it's one of the best movies ever or anything, it's just me I saw a lot of garbage. <br /> <br /> Can't really add what's already been said except 8/10
