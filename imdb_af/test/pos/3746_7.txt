Gerald (Richard Carlson) and Kitty (Veronica Hurst) just celebrated their engagement announcement in France with family and friends when he received a letter asking him to visit an ancestral castle in Scotland. Gerald's uncle allegedly fell ill and asked that Gerald, the only heir, be present. Gerald goes to Scotland, leaving behind his future bride. A few weeks passed and he didn't come back. Worried, Kitty sent out telegrams, but didn't hear her fianc√© again. Four weeks past and Kitty finally got a strange reaction from Gerald, the fiancee and told her to continue her life. Not ready to give up her relationship and look for answers, Kitty hopes on a plane and decides to visit Gerald. Her escort aunt Edith (Katherine Emery, best known for her lead in the classic chiller ISLE OF THE DEAD), is with her. When Kitty and Edith arrive at the MacTeam estate, they immediately suspect there is something strange. For starters, Gerald seems to be twenty years old in a matter of weeks. Secondly, this one-time beautiful and charming man has turned into a complete jerk that repeatedly demands that they leave the castle and never return. When Edith comes down with a soft cold, Kitty uses it as an excuse to stay there trying to get the bottom of things. <br /> <br /> Why was Gerald so cold and cruel to the woman he had just married? Why is Gerald so angry that he has a company? Why do the house rules say that guests should be locked in the night? Why are guests banned from entering certain areas of the estate, such as Gerald's bedroom and a large fence maze? And what makes those weird drag sounds every night? These are just a few of the questions the MAZE asks. The movie actually does a fine job building up mystery and plot. You are really interested in what's going on and patiently waiting for the decision to explain the strange events taking place. And then it happens ... I definitely don't want to ruin the final of this movie, because you're better off not knowing, but it takes one of the most incredible and mostly weird twists I've seen in any movie . . It's amazingly ridiculous in a way, but it also takes a nice, sturdy little b / w riddle and sends it straight into the Z-grade beating area. And yet, this end is so out of place, you won't probably forget it when you see it. <br /> <br /> Despite the end (or maybe due to the end), I really enjoy the strange bird. It is very talky and slow moving for the duration of the run, but it has managed to keep my interest throughout. Director William Cameron Menzies (who made the best-known INVADERS OF MARS the same year) is known as a two-time Oscar-winning art director and his set designs here are also very interesting. There is almost a silent movie feel, with modeling for some foreigners, some painted backgrounds and sparsely decorated interiors with very high ceilings. As with any good castle there is, there are secret passages and long stairs. This one also throws some customized rubber bats. <br /> <br /> A few of the actors are a bit stiff and uncomfortable, but I like most of the cast. Hurst is one of the dark and mostly unknown actresses who unfortunately never looked, although it was beautiful and talented. Emery, which is also portrayed at the beginning and end of the film at the beginning and end of the film, is decent enough as the excessive and cautious aunt. My favorite, however, was Michael Pate as the silver-hearted sinister servant doing every step of the way doing this hilarious upright zombie walk. Also in smaller roles is Hillary Brooke (who played the title role in the Sherlock Holmes mystery THE WOMAN IN GREEN) and Lilian Bond (Whale's THE OLD DARK HOUSE). Of course, Carlson also stood in IT. GETTING OUT OF SPACE, CREATING THE BLACK LAGOON and some other horror flicks, so you have a pretty decent role to play for genre fans there. I say check it out!
