Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are excellent in this 1970's melodrama. The sumptuous settings, the haunting music and plot twists make it a very interesting movie. I saw it when it first appeared on the TV. Once again it was sowing when I had a video recorder, but I didn't have the chance to paste it. Will love it on VHS if someone has a copy. Apart from the stress (which worked beautifully), I feel the story is unique, and is very good with the book, MRS. MAINLAND CASES by Margaret Lynn. I would say that it has overlooked one of the many best films from the 1970s made for movies. I gave the movie a # 10 rating because it's done with so much originality. There is a real pathos and air of romance that sympathizes with the culprit.
