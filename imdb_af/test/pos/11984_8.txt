This B&W movie reached the Spartan film house of my Frisian village about 18 months after the release. In those days, many of our full-fledged comedy transports from Denmark (Nils Poppe, someone), so this movie hit like a thunderbolt - it made me cry with helpless joy, ROTFL, as we would now. OK, so some of the siggats were actually recovering vaudeville 'schtick', but how was this 'barefoot with copper cheeks' to know it at the time? Anyway, my favorite scenes have Jerry's unique brand of reckless clowning, such as the Hawaii boxing match. <br /> <br /> Seeing "Sailor Beware" again fifty years later, I was still going hard. Admittedly, without the nostalgia component, it would probably just be another fair comedy. But then the Spike Jones outing "Fireman Save My Child" once had a film that let me down. It now seems dated and isolated from some short orchestras and Doodles Weaver scenes. Must be a special ingredient that keeps Martin & Lewis's product longer. For me, this one is at least eight out of ten.
