Traffik is an excellent miniseries dealing with drug trafficking in Europe. It is the European manufactured PBS series based on the Oscar-nominated movie traffic. If you loved Traffic, Traffik is a must see. Overall, I would highly recommend this miniseries to anyone interested in seeing drugs from a social point of view. The script is exciting and unexpected, as it weighs on the lives of drug dealers, traders, farmers, politicians and police officers. Unlike other movies that censor the problem of drugs, Traffik offers it as it is.
