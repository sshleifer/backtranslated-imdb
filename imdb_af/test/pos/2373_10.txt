I love that kind of movies. Blood, revenge, lots of action, very dark, cheesy and more. But this one does not deliver the genre you can expect. When I saw Kite Birds and Ichi the Killer before, I enjoyed watching, but why is this one? Dead or Alive: Final is a decent anime and it's not hardcore and doesn't even expect nudity in this movie. Make at least a little more action to entertain the audience. Even the drama wasn't so good. Well, I don't want to spoil the movie or the plot. But I felt the Death or Alive: Final is a little nerdy. So, without doing any further. I do not recommend this movie to everyone, but I recommend to those who love decent and well-directed anime. <br /> <br /> Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne
