The first time I saw this fantastic movie and Alyssa was my star *, playing Frances Ella Fitz, so nice in this movie! It was just as real and her puppy so cute! I saw it for the first time when I was 11 and it was the best movie I've ever seen, and you know what? I still think so! 10/10 ********** = greatest ever!
