After the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), Walt Disney Productions continued to produce quality animated functionality children's films, of which I still had no pleasure to watch. "The AristoCats (1970), led by Wolfgang Reitherman, was the twentieth film in Disney's official canon. This is a romantic musical comedy that surrounds a family of aristocratic cats who worked in Paris in 1910, in the mansion of the older Madame Adelaide Bonfamille (pronounced by Hermione Baddeley), her lovely cat dogs ?? including Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three young kittens ?? are the main inhabitants. When the cute butcher Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby) learns that the cats surrender the whole lady's entire fortune, he sets off the pet and sells them in the countryside far from the big city. Lost and confused, duchess and her children are acquainted with a lovely street cat, Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris), who agrees to show them the way home. <br /> <br /> Animation mode, "The AristoCats" is not something special, with many earlier Disney movies like "Snow White ??" and 'Fantasia (1940)', which shows a similar or even better visual style. But the story is interesting and exciting ?? especially for younger audiences, will I be betting? and the music numbers (which I wish were more numerous) are great. For the sake of trivia, I will call my two favorite songs as "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and "Ev'rybody want to be a cat," the last of which is a psychedelic throwback to the late 60's, with a swinging jazz -band and surprising flickering colors, led by a trendy kitten called the Scatman Crothers. The family's journey back to Paris is gifted and adventurous, and we meet such friendly characters such as Amelia and Abigail Gabble (two speaking geese), Uncle Waldo (Georges Hautecourt, Bonfamille's ancient but tough lawyer) and Napoleon Lafayette (two-dimensional dog dogs) with a hunger for the butler's cross}.
