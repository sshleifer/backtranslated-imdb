Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding Jr., who played perfectly in this role. It's a heartwarming story that confirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care. I think there was a lot of realism with the characters. The scriptwriter did not include racism in the movie in a way that most films do, which I thought created a more realistic storyline. <br /> <br /> Writers tend to spray racist incidents in an attempt to create realism, but usually go overboard. <br /> <br /> There are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously. Ed Harris had to be nominated for an Academy Award because he was wonderful as a leader and coach, realistic as a father, and showed a warm care when supporting Radio.
