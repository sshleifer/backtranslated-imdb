As a fan of Wm. Faulkner since school, I was especially pleased to see intruder in the dust and for other reasons. My grandfather, also known as Clarence Brown, like the director, grew up in the Oxford area, near his birth in 1888. We attended a week-long family reunion at Oxford in July 1964, just 15 years after filming. the movie. It still looks mostly like that in the movie, but goes through a period of civil rights revolution as the site of Ole Miss. My reminder is that this is a pretty little college town this summer, but I was just an 18-year-old college hem and white. I then began to see the injustice of segregation and prejudice, but still have a long way to go. Anyway, the movie is worth watching, but the filmmakers had to have a tight queue to make it there and I'd like to know more about the story. <br /> <br /> Now days, Oxford is a bigger, modern college city with all the bad things going on with such things and I hope to return again to see how socially in the past 40 plus years have changed. . Juano Hernandez definitely had to be nominated for the Oscar for the Oscar, but Hollywood still had to be about to make it happen. Other Faulkner stories are filmed, looking for them and comparing. One of the best was a PBS treatment from The Barn Burner from about 1985 or so with Tommy Lee Jones. It really captured the intensity of rural southern whites that Faulkner wrote so scarce.
