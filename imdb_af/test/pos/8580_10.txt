* Warning! Some spoilers! * <br /> <br /> Matt, a rich writer, is actually just a boy in his behavior. He does not care for anyone else but his own needs and cannot care less about the consequences of any of his actions. Just as he gets to know Nimi and her ties with her family and her community, he begins to feel that something is missing in his life. <br /> <br /> He starts to realize that he is actually lonely and stuck in impersonal structures that are just comfortable, but lacking in heart and dedication. Nonetheless, he shunned any liability and was reluctant to change his life. But will he be able to settle again in his old life and ignore the bonds he has unconsciously formed? <br /> <br /> Nimi's situation is the absolute opposite. She is used in the regulations of her Nigerian community, his prejudices and his medieval values. Being a single mother, her position is difficult and it gets worse when she falls in love with Matt, a white devil (as the referrer would say), a man who can't commit. The community's women are planning to marry her to end her status and give Sammy a name. But that will mean that Nimi has to give up all independence and self-determination. But is there an alternative to her if she wants to accept Sammy and be accepted as a respected community member? <br /> <br /> This movie has everything: a very sensitive and sensual love story (with many sexy scenes of Matt and Nimi) and an engaging child who eagerly adapts, a beautiful landscape in vibrant colors. <br /> <br /> Colin Firth (* swoon *) and Nia Long show good chemistry. It's just fantastic to see it. And Fissy Roberts as Sammy is just dying. You just want to accept him. I just love the way Sammy and Matthew talk to each other. They are in the same level in different ways. Especially when Sammy asks Matt about sex. This scene is absolutely adorable! <br /> <br /> Virtually nothing to complain about .... wait! That's not true. One thing is not good: That movie is not long enough! (Well, and maybe the Reference is too bad and too stupid to be convincing ....) <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10, anyway!
