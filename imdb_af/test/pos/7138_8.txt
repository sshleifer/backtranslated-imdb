I loved this movie! Markie Post is really good at it. I've seen it at a lifetime, and it's in the same entertaining class like movies like: 'The Betty Broderick Story', 'Locked Up: A Mother's Rage', etc .... (which, incidentally, is also very good, entertaining Movies!} It's a top drama, about a single mother trying to break away from her middle class, predictable personality. This movie is just pure entertainment! It doesn't have to be a realistic look at heroin addiction. An "ordinary" middle-class person can (and they do!) become addicted to heroin. Junkies are not just homeless untrained people on the street. {By the way, if you look at it, watch the child spend his mother! Spoiled!} 8 out of 10 stars.
