Gary Busey's best performance in a nice flowing biography. Since his musical background he was able to do his own songs and it really works. It's always good to see the good actor, Don Stroud (one of the cricket) and Charlie Martin Smith. <br /> <br /> An 8 out of 10. Best Show = Gary Busey. Fortunately, Mr. Busey Oscar nominated for this and lost Jon Voight in COMING HOME. A pretty low budget flick that doesn't disappoint, with great songs by Mr. Holly. I hope it made a lot of dough. Busey was never popular again for several reasons, but thankfully, he has this one good one on his CV.
