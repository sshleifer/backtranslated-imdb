These three directors are down to Good Beginnings. The three stories are remarkably well done for independent productions and catch the traumatic feelings of "coming out" when you're not really sure it's a good idea. I laughed at the covered tins around the dressing room in "Pooldae"; I smiled at the idea that the fans of Bette Midler, Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand are gay in "A Friend of Dorothy" (that is, browse through the CD music series); and I sounded about the "jock" in "The Disco Years", whose memory of sweet sex was now corrupted by liquor. It was all so real. I'm looking forward to more offers from this trio of directors.
