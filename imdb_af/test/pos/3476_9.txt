Okay. You've seen the movie and I've seen the movie. Where? If not, there are many summaries about it, and there is absolutely no reason for us to waste time on any poor attempts by my to create another. <br /> <br /> The most wonderful aspect of the movie is undoubtedly the actions of the two young men and the young lady in the lead. Their emotional honesty was so compelling, if not more so, than any show I've seen in recent months. I found myself laughing, screaming and cuddling, and it says a lot, because I'm often called a cowardly and cynical jerk. <br /> <br /> As one would expect, the story is full of clich√©s. and I think it's the Achilles heel of the picture. This is a story we have all seen many times; we all know how it will end from the moment they launch Rory. Although you may not know the exact mechanics, you know there will be a transforming friendship, a bittersweet romance and a slimming conclusion. If it wasn't for the strong cast and director, this movie would be nothing more than the sophisticated swill containing eighty percent of the Hallmark Channel program.
