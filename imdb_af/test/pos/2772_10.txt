I love this movie. Is it more on the air? What can I do to get it back on the air, because I miss this movie when does this movie again? I love this movie so much. does anyone know how long it has been since Disney last? It was a very long time and I am so sick to wait! I want to see Susie Q again. I swear, they take off all the good movies and play new silly gay people who are fake and delayed. I miss this movie, wish on a star, Kazaam with Shaquille O'neil, and a lot more. where did all the good movies go? I want them back. I miss all the good movies and they no longer have them. If someone finds out if Susie Q or any good old Disney movie comes out, please let me know, my email is girlygirl148@aol.com girlygirl (no space) 148. Thanks and I hope you want this movie again. good day
