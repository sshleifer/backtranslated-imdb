Let me waste a moment of your time explaining how I approached this movie. 1st I dismissed the trailers because the film was an unknown remake of Aliens, which I consider to be one of the worst movies in the Alien series. Stupidly dismissing the movie after hearing positive things from people whose opinions I trusted, I completely missed the theater. I then hooked up on Farscape in the 3rd or 4th season at the time and got Pitch Black on the cable, one night in bedtime - so I said, "Oh, why not, it has Claudia Black in it." Soon I recognized Keith David and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why should this surprise me, I don't know). I was enchanted. I've been handcuffed for four years now. I just watched the movie for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it. <br /> <br /> It's not an art film, not an independent, and it's not quite original, but where it fails a lot of new ground, it manages interesting, realistic characters , hard-working action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; An absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully special effects. Sounds good to be true? Don't take my word for it. Look for yourself. <br /> <br /> The film also highlighted the charism of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, which introduced Richard Riddick's character. Diesel would die in its somewhat Riddick-ulous Chronicles (which I also enjoyed, though she recognized big mistakes) and is now something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big and so interesting to see that it's easy to ignore being not only a talented actor but also a smart man. The performance of the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the sound remarks, can only blow you away. <br /> <br /> The movie is about the crew of an inter-system transport vessel stranded on an unknown planet after an accident landing in which their captain was murdered. The new commander is inexperienced, but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - an abundant hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically changed to see in the dark ( diesel). Is this all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry. <br /> <br /> As original and unlikely as some of these may be, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well-told and performed very well. Don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to think much, but don't have fun with these modern sci-fi action classics.
