I had to call my mom (a WASP) to ask her about this. Was it really so bad in the 40s in New York? Surprised, she can't remember. So I told her to see the movie. Arthur Miller, not a screenplay, but a NOVEL for a change, was 30 when he wrote it in 1945. This is a painful portrayal of anti-Semitism. Still oddly, there is a soft story of human relationships (Finkelstein, the Jew, with Newman, the non-Jew, mainly) underlying the cruel story. The play is competent and cinematography is very good. <br /> <br /> The only reason I can think, because it doesn't make it big in the theater, because it's aaagh << controversial. <Br /> <br /> I actually give it ten out of ten. Maybe a little high, but it's so worth seeing.
