I am writing this after seeing only the latest episode broadcast in the UK, and for me it must be difficult to keep the standard. The last episode called "Blink" has elements of gothic horror, all to do with images that don't seem exactly what they look like. The doctor and Martha don't appear much, but it doesn't detract from a well-crafted episode. The general standard built on a high level and the last three episodes, the two parties with "The Family" and the latest, were the best the current team ever did. <br /> <br /> It's not Just David Tennant holds it together, the entire supporting weekends, week-out helps as well. For those waiting for Serie 3 overseas, the guard is worth it.
