Yes, it feels and plays mostly like a "after school special", for a slightly more mature audience, even though it may have been a teenager. But add in Bill Murray (who's already dramatic as well as his usual comic talent), a nice supportive role, and an unexpected sweet about how to grow up, and remember the great, or not so nice, days at the summer camp, And you get a heart-warming, funny, sleeping place. <br /> <br /> It gets a little too grim for its own good, but it is also one of its charms. If you hear the title "Meatballs" and see the poster, you expect a teen sex skirt, but what you get is a sentimental, but sometimes it is sometimes sexy to look back at those formative years at the summer camp. The sentimentality, and the remberances of simpler times, reminds me of "A Christmas Story", which I also like. The remembrance of summer camp was never said so well. The only movie I've seen comes close is "Indian Summer", which I love almost as much as "Meatballs" and also star Matt Craven. Let's hope he completes the trilogy. Maybe he can come back for "Return of the Meatballs", and bring back some dignity to the franchise (Meatballs 2 through 4 has no match with the original classic). <br /> <br /> "Meatballs" are easy on my Top 10 Guilty Pleasures of all time (not really guilty). It's a wonderful little movie that always makes me smile.
