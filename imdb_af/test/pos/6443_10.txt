An orphaned son, Tom (Tommy Pender), who works for some shady chimney sweeps, is falsely accused of being out of the house where he works. Grimes (James Mason) - the real thief - and goes on the run. Tom's only alibi is the cousin of the homeowners (Samantha Gates, a slim blue-eyed blonde, with long wavy hair, of course I was the primary reason I repeatedly saw it as a boy). He and his dog jump into a river and a witch turns them into the water breathing cartoon characters! While underwater, he befriends and saves a group of water-breathing children known as sharks' water babies. <br /> <br /> A very interesting and always fascinating fable, based in 1850, must appeal to all children. The animation (42 minutes of the 85 minute HBO VHS print) is just average, but it's better than most modern animations - even computer animation! My only true grip is a plot hole caused by a deleted scene. At 42:06, after the first verse of "High Cockalorum", the film cuts to a hippo-swim scene, followed by Tom and Jacque's meeting with Terence. This leads to a scene in which the killer shark (pronounced by Mason) leads our heroes into a trap. The shark then greets Tom, "Young Tom, so nice to see your ugly cup again" - but this is the first time in HBO's pressure that Tom meets the shark! Most reference works list 92 or 93 minutes of running time and were previously available from Sultan Entertainment and Nelson. It is therefore very likely that HBO's printing will be edited and / or compressed. MGM released a fullscreen, 76-minute print on DVD in 2002. Let's hope that a restored version will appear in the near future. <br /> <br /> The movie is copyright Ariadne Films 1978. "Ariadne" is the water baby pronounced by Samantha Gates. Bernard Cribbins, who plays Mason's partner in crime, also agrees with the electric eel. Also known as Slip Slide Adventures.
