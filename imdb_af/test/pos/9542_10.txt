This wonderful movie never made me move. The color, convincing role and beautiful scenery all make great contributions. This production, in contrast to later remakes by Carlton, is more impressionistic and is more out of the children's own perspective. It focuses on certain episodes of E. Nesbit's beautiful story rather than making a somewhat more documentary "wart-and-al" style adopted by Carlton. Above all, the wonderful musical score of the late Johnny Douglas supports the whole story and adds that extra emotional depth. The net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that provide the gripping story of "The Railway Children". <br /> <br /> One uncomfortable factor for the viewer to think through this movie is how things have changed since those times - and in many ways, for the worse! Yes, maybe many of us should not use toilets and ride in horse-drawn carriages, but what about the quality of life in general? Think of the erroneous celebrities who now make our TV screens "grace". Their language is now believed to be perfectly acceptable. Also consider the fragile "today, tomorrow away" aspects of so much of today's "partnerships" and all single mothers - whatever happened to the "marriage" institution, when people accept each other's mistakes, but have always stayed together to love their children? These details add extra piquancy when you watch this wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> I hope kids, like generations, will still be able to enjoy this movie. Not to mention some adults!
