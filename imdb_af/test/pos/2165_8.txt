Although it is a good, pleasant cartoon, they did much better later, like Carrotblanca. It's almost like the first Star Trek feature, which is welcomed with open arms and joy no matter what, just for existing ones. It's really a patchwork of old pieces with a few nice touches, but nothing special. Remind me a little of the hunting trilogy in patches and the end is priceless. Available and definitely worth watching just for the novelty and the good bits. Recommended.
