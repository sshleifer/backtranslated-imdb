One of the other reviewers mentioned that after just watching an episode of 1 Oz, you will be requested. That's right, because that's exactly what happened to me. <br /> <br /> The first thing that struck me about Oz was his brutality and unwavering scenes of violence coming directly from the word GO. Trust me, this is not a show for the weak or the rogue. This show does not draw any punches on drugs, sex or violence. It's hardcore, in the classic use of the word. <br /> <br /> This is called OZ because it is the nickname given to the Oswald Maximum Security State. It focuses mainly on Emerald City, an experimental part of the prison where all the cells have glass front and face, so privacy is not high on the agenda. Em City is home to many people. Arabs, Muslims, gangs, Latin, Christians, Italians, Irish and more .... so stupid, starving, dodgy transactions and shady agreements are never far away. <br /> <br /> I would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it is where other performances would not dare. Forget beautiful pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget about charm, forget about novels ... OZ doesn't spill around. The first episode I've ever seen affected me so much, it was surreal. I couldn't say I was ready, but when I looked more, I developed a taste for Oz and got used to the high levels of graphic violence. Not only violence, but injustice (soldiers sold out for a nickel, inmates who are killed on command and get away with it, well-mannered middle-class prisoners are overthrown in prisons for lack of street skills or prison experience) If you watch Oz, you can get comfortable with what is uncomfortable to look .... it's when you can get in touch with your dark side.
