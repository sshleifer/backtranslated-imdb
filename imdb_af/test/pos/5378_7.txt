I didn't know what I was going to see when I decided to watch this movie and to my surprise it was just an extremely well-made horror movie that is easily one of the best of the 1970s. Film is, of course, a low budget and this is an excellent example of how the story and style of a movie creates chills, not special effects! Strong Martin is one of the great character players of all time and he has a rare lead role here and the movie also star Martin's good friend L.Q. Jones and "Green Acres" Alvy Moore. Jones and Moore also made this film. TV veteran Charles Bateman is the star and "Enter the Dragon" beauty Ahna Capri is his girlfriend. Capri is in the beginning of the movie in a bikini and she is just beautiful to look at! Movie does a wonderful job of staying with the story and not adding a bad feeling with good end and I really like the way the movie ends. Great atmosphere, interesting story and well directed by Bernard McEveety. What's more, Martins' performance is also because he doesn't give back at all and really throws himself into the role of Doc. Good and understated movie!
