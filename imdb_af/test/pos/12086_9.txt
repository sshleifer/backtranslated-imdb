Forget all the juicy romantic movies with notebooks and lip-closed couples who somehow go to the big past to a screen age of over-simplified unrealistic romance. Forget all that shameless "dog gives his life to save his family" flashes (though I have to admit that I have a soft spot for them myself). Remember that Ricky Schroeder is already showing a tendency to persuade at a good age (now it's one shameless!). <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this TV movie, which is unfortunately never broadcast again, is the all-time champion of tears, hands off. And a well-written and well-intentioned story to start. Ann-Margret had a great chance to play this role. Nothing flamboyant or sexy about her here, and it is a monumental achievement in itself. Based on a true story, she plays Lucile Fray, a terminally ill mother who chooses to contend for her dying breath to get good homes for her ten children, instead of leaving them in the hands of unpredictable government agencies. Frederic Forrest does a good job as her husband, the kind-hearted but unreliable breadwinner, whose paralyzed arthritis and personal demons do not allow him to care for the children. <br /> <br /> The movie takes us through Lucile's heartbreaking interview interview with prospective parents and then watches her children go home. It also gives us the perspective of the children themselves, and of the father - who grieved the tragedy now and frustrated the one who is sure to follow, over his inability to do more. The scene in which the youngest of the children (Steven) are taken to his new home is the most sad thing I've ever seen. Now I grew up as a "hopeless romance," and have had a harder, more cynical shell for years. I usually find more to mock than to empathize with the sentimental filming that we spent today. But this jewel of the early 1980s still makes me dead. <br /> <br /> I really wish someone with a marketing sense leak would release a DVD version of this drama. Among the special features, the Emmy Awards should be included next year. A-M was nominated for this role, but best dramatic actress award went to Barbara Stanwyck for "Thorn Birds". In what is one of the biggest moments in what is now a dignified award show, Stanwyck has gone into tears during her acceptance speech and stormed out, "Ann-Margret, I love you!" . <br /> <br /> A final note. The IMDb rating for "Who will love my children" is 6.4 of this writing. But more than 75% of the ratings are in the 8-10 series (mostly 10's). Whatever the disability system that uses this site to change the overall ratings of the movies listed by IMDb, it misses the point entirely on this one. This one is the "weeper" of all time, and a darn good TV movie to start.
