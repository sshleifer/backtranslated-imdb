It was a good movie. It had a "so-so-nice" outburst. Plus, there were some very intense (drama) scenes that made it inappropriate for younger viewers, under 6. <br /> <br /> For an under the radar movie, the play was pretty nice and touched in our family room. an almost perfect landing. It kept the attention of our entire family and we were sorry to see it. <br /> <br /> This movie had elements of spy schools with young people saving the day, but gave a bit more credible scenario. The dream scenes were initially a distraction, but did much to establish the plot. The pranks and hi-jinx were also quite amusing. <br /> <br /> We hope you keep as much as we did.
