I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Ten years ago I read the book a good read and was intrigued by how it would translate into film. <br /> <br /> The script is very true to the book I am fond of - it is a rarity in itself these days. The characterizations were solid and credible, and the stroke count shifted me into my perceptions, although I already knew the end of the book. <br /> <br /> An intelligent and well-crafted film.
