Some people are moving through life, moving from one thing or one person to the next without hitting an eye; Others hold on to a matter, another person or principle and remain determined, dedicated to whatever it is - and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it. But we're all different, 'Made of different clay', like one of the characters in this movie, it makes it so interesting. Some people are just crazy, but - and maybe that's the way you should be under the masses. Who knows? Who knows what is needed to make things - life - work? Author / director Lisa Krueger takes a shot at it and uses a light approach to explore the thin line between dedication - and how to "be committed - and obsessed, in" Committed, "starring Heather Graham as a young woman who is dedicated, dedicated, obsessive and maybe just a little crazy. Her name is Joline, and it's her story. <br /> <br /> Although Joline has always been a dedicated person; in work, relationships, in life in general. She is a woman of her word that sticks to it, no matter what. And if she marries Carl (Luke Wilson), it is forever. The only problem is that someone forgot to tell Carl - and 597 days in marriage he was gone; to "find" and portray it all. When Joline realizes he's not coming back, she refuses to give up her or her marriage. Maybe it's because of that "clay" she's made. Regardless, she left their home in New York City and sat down to find him, what she was doing - in El Paso, Texas, from all places. But once she knows where she is, she keeps her distance, gives him his "space" and doesn't even let him know she's there. She regards Carl as a "spiritual coma", and it is her job to keep a "spiritual watchfulness" on him until he comes to his senses. And while she was watching and waiting, her life was nothing but sowing, as she met a young woman named Carmen (Patricia Velazquez), a waitress at one of the local eateries; Carmen's "Grampy" (Alfonso Arau), which is something of a mystic; T-Bo (Mark Ruffalo), a truck driver who has Carl issues; and Neil (Goran Visnjic) an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy for her. For Joline, this is a journey of discovery, during which she learns a lot from Carl, but even more about herself. <br /> <br /> There is a touch of humor, a touch of romance, and some insights on human nature in this peculiar movie that is more about characterization and character than plot. And Krueger offers it very well, and delivers a film that is entertaining and entertaining. Her characters are very real people, with all the needs, needs, and imperfections that make up the human condition; a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story. We see this from Joline's point of view, as Krueger submits to Joline's thoughts and therefore her motivation, which places a definite perspective on the events as they unfold. This, along with the deliberate fit she sets, enables you to create the atmosphere and provide the atmosphere she creates for a very effective storytelling. There is an underlying seriousness on this topic, but Krueger chooses to avoid something heavy or too deep and rather focuses on the natural humor developed by the people and situations Joline meets. And the result is a well-drawn, influential and constructive look at the thing we call life. <br /> <br /> Heather Graham takes this role from the first frame of the movie to make Joline a character of her own. creation. She immerses herself into the part and gives a show that is convincing and credible, adding the small personal features and nuances that make a difference between a representation that is merely a representation of a person and one that is real . And for this movie to work, it was imperative that Joline was viable and credible - and Graham succeeded on all fronts. Her screen presence has never been more tempting, and her lively personality or even as she uses her eyes is enough to draw you completely. it is all part of the character she creates; There is a call to Joline who faces out of her face, who she is inside and out. She is a pleasant, pleasant person, and because you shared her inner thoughts, you know who she is. It's a good job all the way, starting with the way the character is written, to the way Graham brings her to life so vibrantly. <br /> <br /> As Carmen, Patricia Velazquez is also doing quite a bit. Her performance is very natural and straightforward, and she uses her instincts to create her character effectively. She has a charismatic presence, but is less than flamboyant, and it gives her an aspect that is attractive downward. She is refreshingly open and at the front; You get the impression that Carmen is not one to keep something back, but is completely honest on all fronts, and that is also part of her appeal. And as with Joline, this character is well written, and Velazquez convincingly brings her to life. <br /> Overall, there are a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this movie, including those of Luke Wilson, Casey Affleck (such as Joline's brother, Jay), Goran Visnjic, Alfonso Arau and especially Mark Ruffalo as T-Bo, who with very little real screen time manages to create an unforgettable character. <br /> <br /> The supporting film includes Kim Dickens (Jenny), Clea Du Vall (Mimi), Summer Phoenix (Meg), Art Alexakis (New York Car Thief), Dylan Baker (Carl's Editor) and Mary Kay Place (Psychiatrist). A movie that says something about the value of the jump to consider the Great Picture - think about who we are, where we go and what we really need - `Committed 'is a pleasant experience; a trip that is definitely worth it. 8/10.
