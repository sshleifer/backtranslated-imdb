To me, the Tempest and its characters (with which I mean the admirable people) are like old friends. Since I started playing the play through theater classes (I played Ferdinand), I immediately got caught up in the fantastic world that Shakespeare created. One day I can remember one student who decides not to play Ferdinand, and so I took the stage and had the honor of playing an excellent Miranda. <br /> <br /> One of the virtues a good friend has is that you can never fully know them - there is always something you can discover about their character. A movie production of the Tempest of Quality is like a visit to an old friend, love your heart. Every visit provides a new perspective on the memory we have had of the job. With Prospero's Books, the ritual and elegance of the play are emphasized, the exuberant celebration of art within the arts. Here we see a vision as esoteric mysticism, with lovingly crafted interiors full of candles and chalk charts on floors, more Aleister Crowley and Naples nobleman. It also made me reconsider - why was Prospero thrown out of Naples? His magical power is so striking in this production that it is wondering if it was just politics that condemned Prospero to exile, but rather the fact of his difference from his peers. So, in the real world he suffered. Was ejected, powerless to change the wrong right. All the villains in this play, whether they realize it or not, are in harmony with the creation of a more painful, hell of a world - it is always in the interest of the oppressor to bring life to Earth closer to hell to make. But Prospero is able to bring these earthly villains into his island, the area where he has (absolute) rule. <br /> <br /> Shakespeare brings his audience to the theater, the area where Shakespeare outcomes events, words, words. Shakespeare is, of course, Prospero - but what this film adaptation really honors is to make Prospero so sympathetic to a reason, despite being surrounded by which society irrational (astrological texts, alchemical symbols, magical diagrams, etc.). Is it more rational to be a man of the cloth and murder, or to be a heretic and to work for the right of injustice? Prospero IS a heretic because he leaves his magic, not because the books will lose their value in Naples, but because they are no longer needed - the world itself - has become the magic of the books. <br /> <br /> In Hamlet, Hamlet presents a play to his friends. The play accuses his fellows of conspiracy against others for their own progress. The response of the audience ranges: while Ophelia is surprised, Claudius reacts with a shocked shock. This happens within the play, and then Shakespeare performed this play for the men of his time. Did Shakespeare look at their reactions? In the storm, Prospero lives the play he builds, and we live with him. How do we respond? Do you react with simple joy to the happy end? Are you upset and shocked at the peculiarity of this production, which is quite appropriate with the source material? Do you feel sad about the fact that this little life, the play, is rounded off with a sleep, as transient as it is forever? The tragedy is that Shakespeare creates a paradise of reason and hope for mankind's life on Earth, but man is weak and unwilling to realize it in favor of small-scale struggle. We have Claudiuses. <br /> <br /> Like a good friend, this movie is not without its faults. I disagree with the choice of painting some scenes entirely in blue. The dance of the marines is quite tangential. But in the heart, it's really The Tempest, and one of its many faces.
