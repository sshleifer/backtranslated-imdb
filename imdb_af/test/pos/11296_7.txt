I just picked it up in a decent, or non-outstanding DVD version for one dollar at Wal Mart. <br /> <br /> Run it and buy it. <br /> <br /> I'm pretty sure this version is the short, incomplete version released in the late fifties against the animator's wishes, yet at a buck it is an incredible * bargain. <br /> <br /> This film is syndicated in small pieces as a series of local TV stations in the early sixties for the child's performances that almost every station arrived on weekdays in the days - "Mr Bill and Bozo "" Monty's Gang "(Channel 4, Greenville SC) and" Captain Grady "(Channel 13, Asheville NC - which is where I saw it). It made such an impression twelve or so old that I recognized it immediately when I saw it at Wal Mart and grabbed it. <br /> <br /> Wonderful. You gotta get it.
