When Liv Ullman's character says, "I feel like I'm in someone else's dream and they'll be ashamed when they wake up." She not only refers to an unwilling player in society's war games, but refers to being an ignorant participant in life itself. At the end of the film when she says she had a dream that she had a child and she was trying to care for it, but she forgot something else, the implication is that she forgot what she had learned in the war she is just. survive, like her own mother before her, she will not be able to give any important lessons to her own child. And therefore the cycle of shame of ignorance will continue ... ad infinitum ...
