Keira Knightley and Sienna Miller stars in the story of two women in the life of Dylan Thomas. Knightley is Thomas's boy-love heart he meets at the Blitz. At a bar they meet again, but things get complicated when Thomas brings his wife (Miller) next time he meets her. The women turned it off and things went on fast until the trio joined the man who would become Knights' husband. This further complicates this, as jealousy begins to show its face. Beautiful to watch, extraordinarily written and performed wonderfully (all disappear completely in their roles). It is a great feast for the eyes and ears. It's so nice to see a movie about adults who are adults. On a purely visceral level, I really enjoyed watching the movie because the film is so artistically pleasing. Rarely have I ever seen a movie this beautifully crafted. <br /> <br /> The problem with the movie is I'm not quite sure of everything that happened. Something was missing and a few times I had to play the movie again to see if I missed something. It's not bad, but it's not quite satisfactory. (I tried to look right to see how much of the movie is, but I couldn't find anything). Yet I think it's a movie worth seeing. It's a beautiful movie for adults with probably the best acting leaders that did.
