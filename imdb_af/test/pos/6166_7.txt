It seems that no matter how many films are made on the subject, there is no shortage of stories that originated from World War II. This is the reason why a conflict on such a scale as global warfare will take the imagination of filmmakers everywhere and provide them with enough material on which to story. In a different direction to most mainstream war movies, Dark Blue World, a film that does not deal with traditional war battles, does not tell the story of many of its great figures and does not even focus on soldiers of any of the most important allies or forces. Dark-blue World instead goes into the world of refugee soldiers who are in captivity for their occupied nations. <br /> <br /> The film does a wonderful job of challenging the challenges that Czech pilots under the British Royal Air Force have faced. the frustration they both felt in the language barrier between them and the other kites, but also to refrain from taking revenge on the Germans until they were trained. <br /> <br /> Dark Blue World also works very well outside the arena of the war film is a story about human relationships. A love triangle develops between the two main characters and an English woman who complicates the teacher-mentor relationship of the two indignant soldiers. This relationship performed extremely well and in many cases developed almost a father and son relationship. <br /> <br /> The airline in the movie is the best and is also very interesting to explore the cultural challenges. mentioned above if the men struggle to fly their machines, fight the enemy, and divert commandos and answers into an unknown language. The tension and struggle of these scenes remains the tension between the men on the ground, just as the tension remains on the ground that feels in the air. <br /> <br /> It shouldn't be a movie for everyone. The hardcore war film buffer can scare off its exploration of relationships a bit, but it's generally an excellent movie, regardless of the bellicus element or not.
