Like one of the other judges (maybe @ Amazon), I first introduced to Tourist Trap through the beloved, exaggerated WOR-9 in NY, around January 1983. Devil's dog: The Hound of Hell, which I have been waiting for to watch since it began on Halloween 1978, has just ended and I thought I had filled my horror for the day. Stop laughing. The three-o'clock Borgost monster I set up in his room is scary. <br /> <br /> As far as I still enjoy Richard Crenna from his made TV horror hat, it was the first 10 minute Tourist Trap that followed the devil's dog that day. brand - and months later it eventually became the first movie I've ever fired from TV. WOR has it fairly regularly, often as the Saturday afternoon Million Dollar Movie, as others have seen. This is one of the offers that offers powerful horror punching, a true left hook - and then practically starts with the rest of the roll, dances and jabs, and brings the openingstone a wider context along the way and then moves to the real climax (see the night of the living dead, re animator). <br /> <br /> Two paragraphs and I didn't mention a single model. See it - the damn things are scary enough, without the music and the writing. I can also remember some terrible clothes dummies and so on in the family's loft cellars and cellars, and say what you like about how relatively simple Schmoeller and Carroll's approach is - nobody played so well before or since. In real life, a good mannequin will do you a double job - and here is the last thing you will probably see, if you stay at Slausen's defective wash museum and highway. Yes, there's a point ("I loved her very much"), where Chuck "Slausen" Connors tries to pass Vincent Price. Yes, the plot has already recorded the beginning of a paragraph; I can't see the writing being so thick. It does not matter. From direction to skillful play (Meryl Streep is not explicitly present, and here it helps instead of barriers), to another useful and effective Pino Dinaggio score (see Carrie and several other De Palma movies), after several reliefs , movie supplies, use of different sound levels ... I can go on - every element of this low budget production comes together and you get a job much larger than the sum of its parts. <br /> <br /> Did I call it scary as hell? Stephen King spoke the film in Danse Macabre a year or so after his release, and for good reason. Like many of his work, it may not be good art, but it does tell a terrifying story and does it well. The rest of the cast can be relatively unknown (wasn't Jocelyn Jones in the Texas car racing game?), But Chuck Connors and Tanya Roberts were and are just known enough for audiences to make you think - Stephen King style - This can happen to you or people you know. <br /> <br /> Equations with Psycho (plot) and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (overall look and feel), even if they are not the first associations in me. thoughts are valid. I just wish I could comment on the DVD, which I look forward to buying, since Tourist Trap is stubbornly finding video since the near completion of independent video rentals, where it had a home apart from WOR and cable in the 1980s (although TMC / Showtime seems to pick it up and play it regularly). No, no pampering here, I'm scared, no plot break. Go see it for yourself. Well, there can be a small little one, so scroll away if you want - better safe than sorry. The mannequins are scary and I'd rather show than to say ... :) <br /> <br /> For the record, Tourist Trap is also full of good lines, of "we're going to have a feast! , how am I?! "," you are so beautiful "," you can't hurt me "," I must not hide it - it feels good! "(listen for that Vincent Price bow there again), the inevitable "you're crazy!" (delivered at the right moment and in the right tone) ... and try - just try - to keep the hair on your arms when you hear the mannequin's head screaming "Molly!" - especially if you realize whose head it was ... :) <br /> P S ... Charles Band was the producer on this, I believe, and probably has the rights to Dinaggio's music. Band, of which I understand, was the brain behind Full Moon Entertainment, which can both explain the music's subsequent use in Puppet Master, and the 40 commercial approach characterized the entire moon by the enjoyable Puppet Master and Subspecies franchises, after, uhhh ... Trancers and Bad Channels (sorry, BOC).
