There are some excellent scenes with Keanu Reeves, and the dysfunctional family he lives in. his 11-year-old brother goes out to waste; the mom has no idea what to do - spends her time drinking with her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> This movie was a little ahead of its time addressing the problems of lower class American society; these children had no outlet; What is available to them in this waste water town? . A few interesting social commentaries are being offered, and there are no solutions. 9/10.
