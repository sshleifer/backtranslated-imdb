Peter O'Toole, one of our best actors, is beautiful as a reserved schoolmaster dedicated to teaching young boys. He meets a show girl and falls in love. The story is one of love and dedication. Petula Clark adds spirit and sensitivity, not even a remarkable voice. You will enjoy this movie, though the end may not be happy. I enjoyed it.
