Two hands are a very pleasant Aussie crime captain, who ultimately manages the way the film quickly combines tense dramatic moments, with many funny characters and situations, to give the film the right balance and feel. The comedy of the film comes naturally, and the laugh is not too elaborate and is not workable. It's really funny, thanks to the fact that every character in the movie is superbly cast, and that every actor / actress recognizes and can relate to Aussie humor. They represent it very well and very realistically. Of course, they are greatly helped by a fantastic script by author / director Gregor Jordan. I read another review of this movie by an American who saw it, and he critically criticized it, and basically conveyed it as a Pulp Fiction clone. I think it's just junk. This film does not try to be pulp fiction, the feel and style of each of these excellent films is quite the opposite. Without sounding better or arrogant, I think to fully understand this movie; the humor, the sincerity, the characters, etc. .... you must be Australian, or at least understand the culture, which the other man obviously did not have the faintest idea. Some Americans, whose reviews of some non-American films, seem ignorant to anything that is not a US product (and difficult to understand). It's a real shame because it's a very good movie. The love story between the main character and the girl is also portrayed in a very real, sincere and sweet way. I'm very proud to have this movie in my collection. 4.5 out of 5.
