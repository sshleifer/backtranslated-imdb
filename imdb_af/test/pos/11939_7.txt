- The best bit: When the dull gangster (Nicholas Turturro) comes to the runaway (Matthew Modine) "Shane! .. Come back Shane!" and when the older wise man asks him, "What are you doing?" he simply repeats "Enjoy My Time!" Actually love me right now! <br /> <br /> - The most beautiful part: I've been watching all the time: where did I see that girl before? where? where? Until I found out while the final credits. OHH MY GOD! She's (Elizabeth Berkley). From the showgirls' fiasco! But I couldn't recognize her with her clothes! To tell the truth, I felt a short tremor. She is really cute and nice, but maybe Hollywood is not at all! <br /> <br /> - The most sexy bit: When (Berkley) says: "Do you mean the things that give you a Boner ?!". <br /> <br /> - The most dull thing: The delayed assistant after a day and a night in the back of the car is still alive and healthy at the end !! ?? Furthermore, the Mexican smuggler had 3 bullets (at the same car!) And he is also not dead ?? <br /> <br /> - The Most Ugly Thing: All the people who were murdered as well as the many (F) went into boring! <br /> <br /> - The most beautiful thing: The crazy, clever manuscript with all the funny characters and the turbulent situations, the acting also looks great, especially from (Paul Rodriguez) who stole the show (as he does best had the dialogue too!). <br /> <br /> - The most disappointing thing: Although the direction was not up to date with the story's whiteness, but at the same time it did not give it a unique touch, an unrelenting signature, " some kind of insane Hilarity like the one in the story itself. Maybe the low production did well! And of course, the easy tasteless music that can be so because of cheap production! <br /> <br /> - The most confusing part: (Matthew Modine) is a talented guy, but what exactly did he do to be out of Hollywood's A list of stars? What could be the thing he made (or didn't make it!) To end up in a light independent kind like The Ship? <br /> <br /> - The most absent scene: Where did (Jose) the Mexican smuggler finally go? I thought we'd see him again in the end, smuggling it again as the surviving little criminal who, in a short search, could cause the continual disorder of such a world. <br /> <br /> - The most question I had after the end: When will we see (The Shipping - 2)? Since I'm so keen to see that fine, little comic, hurly-burly atmosphere again! <br /> <br /> These were my own answers.
