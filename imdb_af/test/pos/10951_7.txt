A vampire prince falls for a human girl, unaware that her brother is a well-known vampire hunter. This is the underlying theme of this martial arts skirt that lends ideas from "Underworld" and "Buffy The Vampire Slayer" but manages to maintain its own style. I was bemused by the UK and Hong Kong title "The Twins Effect" because there are no twins involved in the story. It appears that the two main female characters are played by Hong Kong pop stars acting as "The Twins". Don't let it leave you. These girls can act (at least good enough for this type of film) and add a lot of charm to the proceedings. Jackie Chan comes up with a few cameo appearances that add a dash of his own slapstick mayhem brand to the proceedings. All in all, it's great fun for those who love their vampires, with the help of tongue-in-cheek humor.
