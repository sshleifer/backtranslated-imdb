Isabelle Huppert must be one of her greatest actresses or any other generation. "La Pianiste" really confirms it. As if that wasn't enough, Annie Girardot plays her mother and Annie Girardot is one of her greatest actresses or any other generation. So, as you might imagine, the pieces of casting are worth the horror we are placed on. Isabelle and Annie play characters that we have never seen on the screen. A mother and daughter yes, but with such a virulent fearlessness, which I sometimes couldn't shine or breathe. Personally, I do not believe in the director's intentions, I do not believe they (the intentions it is) go beyond the shocking anecdotes and the end made me shout with frustration, but I was cut through the story written in the face of the sensational Huppert and the strength of Girardot's power. I highly recommend it to movie lovers everywhere and to the collectors of great performances like me, you can't afford to miss "La Pianiste".
