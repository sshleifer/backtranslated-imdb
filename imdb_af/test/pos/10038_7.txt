Of course, along with all the others, I was justified in expecting a lot of Hollywood fantasy revisionism in them with their brothers about Custer's legend. Just playing someone like Errol Flynn Custer is enough of an idea that legend has precedence over the truth in this production. And for the most part, my expectations are fulfilled (in a well-known and entertaining way). <br /> <br /> But even in this clear bias (and much criticized) narrative of the Custer story, I was struck by some of the points made in this movie, sometimes subtle but firm, against the typical cliches of a clear destination and unfinished heroism that usually occur in the western of the early 20th century. <br /> <br /> For example, even while this movie was trying to whiten it, some scenes still suggested the more flawed and foolishness of the actual Custer: <br /> 1) She Initial entrance at the Westpoort front gate, in which its arrogance and pumping position is a clear aspect of its character. <br /> <br /> 2) His unlucky record at West Point, apparently attributed so much to Custer's impeccability over military service claims as any other factor; There are moments in the way Flynn Custer plays at West Point where he looks straight stupid. <br /> <br /> 3) Custer's promotion to general is not just a ridiculous mistake, but it plays like a slapstick comedy. I half expected the Marx brothers or Abbott and Costello to go astray in the scene. <br /> <br /> 4) Custer's position against Jeb Stuart at Gettysburg is not discolored as a brilliant military tactical leadership, but is presented as reckless and very happy. <br /> <br /> 5) Custer's drinking problem is definitely not ignored. <br /> <br /> And although the music and some of the ways in which the Indians were shown in this movie, definitely reinforce the racist stereotype of the ignorant, it still surprised me that the movie actually went into detail about why the Indians were justified in attacking the whites moving into their country and blaming the battles for the battles. in the Black Hills at the foot of the white man. In fact, no one can argue that the clear crook of the play is not Anthony Quinn as Sitting Bull, but Arthur Kennedy & Co. as the white devils who make the false claim of gold in the Black Hills. Sure, that part of the story is true, but I didn't expect to see it so unambiguously in a movie like this. <br /> <br /> And another thing: usually in these movies it is the Indians who portray as much as drunken animals, seemingly unable to avoid the basic common sense of getting drunk when they come near alcohol no. In this movie, it is actually the troops of the 7th Cavalry, not the Indians depicted in at least two scenes this way. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie rolls into a few surprising moments in the middle of the Hollywood bunk.
