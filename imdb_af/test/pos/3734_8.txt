Hey, look, you're not watching this movie to change your life! But if you're especially a woman and have always had a thing for Richard Gere; This movie is up your street. Diane Lane and Richard Gere went on screen for chemistry. 'Nights in Rodanthe' is not an Oscar winner movie, and it will probably be forgotten sooner than later, but if you want an atmospheric, beautifully shot love story between MIDDLE AGED nice people (they don't turn your stomach around not and even when Gere is 'top', he doesn't look jowly), then it's the movie for you. I loved the theme of the story and it was very relevant in many ways. Of course, the whole thing was presented in a superficial way, shifted and not really handled. I mean I wanted to know more about the relationship between father and James Franco, but the story was really about the idea that a great love can change you for the better; whether it be a lover, a child, a friend, etc. is. The theme of the movie is about love and its mysterious ways. I was so surprised that James Franco took such a small role in this movie, but he's always good even for a few minutes of screenplay. I really like this movie because it was moving and sweet.
