Like the first one, the JACKASS team is back to try and kill themselves in whatever way they see. And it fits you into a tractor belt and rolls down a slope. To deliberately strike yourself through a bull. Or something even worse. <br /> <br /> The first one was crazy, and that's how you can describe it. It was also very hard film. But this one is completely nuts. It has even more dangerous stunts, and even harder laughs So, I think stupid idiots to kill themselves, will be the funniest thing this week. <br /> <br /> So, before BORAT comes, I'll leave my A **.
