I watched this movie for a while and can't seem to. Does anyone know what I can get? I feel it is worth seeing again. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to say that I've never heard of Chloe Nicholle about this movie. Yes she can act. When I first watched this movie, I missed it for another of her movies, Sex Spa. The plot looks similar to me, but the roles are reversed. <br /> <br /> This is the first movie I saw Dru Berrymore. I watched some of her other movies and I feel she looks better than a blonde. <br /> <br /> I agree this is a good introductory movie. Not too soft. Not too difficult. You have to start somewhere.
