It's a great movie! It reminds you of your parents. How we all have fragile relationships we all have with them, unless we really try to know who they are. And just as importantly, we must remember to open up and show them our own, not just who we think they want us to be. Definitely this documentary! IMDb makes me write more text before posting my comment, however strange. Usually online comments should be short, and here I am asked to write more! Well, I went to see the movie with my parents. I thought afterwards they would like to talk about their parents, but my dad still wanted to talk about himself and things in his life, he felt he was screwed. It was unusual, my dad is not an unwilling man, but I was surprised he wanted to talk about the mistakes he thinks he made. Mike and Kitty came to the movie to do a Q&A and there was a hilarious moment after my dad talked to Mike while my mom was talking to Kitty! Just ignore my last sentences to fill this comment, and just remember '51 Birch Street, 'it will see!
