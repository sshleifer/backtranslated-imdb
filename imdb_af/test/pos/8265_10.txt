I'm happy to get a good copy of my VHS on DVD so I can watch it again. The characters were played so well. I can't fault any aspect of the casting. OK, so there are a few differences from the book, but the old clich√© of love that conquers all is so vividly portrayed that it makes no difference. The reality of rural life in the early 19th century England is beautifully confronted by the changing seasons, from the bitter winter to the glorious summer days, and this is reflected in the different characters, from Prue's bully father to Kester's all-encompassing love. A story that changed my life.
