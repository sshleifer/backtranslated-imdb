You can't watch this movie for a history lesson. It was the first thing I heard from the Ma Barker saga, but I could almost immediately tell that the facts were far away. And with a little internet research I realized I was of course right. Mom Barker, sure if hell is not the sexy, billing woman, the film suggests her, and apparently has not orchestrated all the bank-raising schemes, kiddnapps or murders her criminals have performed. <br /> <br /> But don't expect a brilliant crime drama. The writing and acting are adequate, the gunfights are excessive and mostly unrealistic, and there is a very laughable slow motion death scene. So why did I give it a 7 out of 10? <br /> <br /> Because it was entertaining. The gunfights are fun to watch, but there are some deeper themes that come between them. The film has a strong sense of ego intimidation under the alpha-men's movie, each with its own agenda. And I appreciate the minimal use of sores for the period. The kitsch is great, and it is a convincing 1930's. <br /> <br /> So look at this movie as if you wanted a cult movie, and take over the excessive bloody and ruthlessness against the cheesy ultra-serious comment of the FBI man who wants to reduce the Barkers at any cost . Inotherwords, don't take it too seriously, just enjoy it. And if you like this, you'll love serial mom.
