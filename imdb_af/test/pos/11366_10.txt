I followed this whole series when I was a child in graduate school, according to choice, not because it was needed for the school. I read the plays in the pace of the series. The experience gave me a lifelong love for Shakespeare and history. It even gave me a bit of an acting error, although I am just at an amateur level. When I read any of Shakespeare's history games, the images that come to mind for the first time from this black and white production, seen on a large "furniture" TV set with a rabbit ear antenna, with all the "ghosts" "and wobbles that go with that. <br /> <br /> Although the sets were minimal, if I remember correctly, it was completely irrelevant because the acting was so good. Then I had no idea who was one of the actors. Now I see that many of them have become known over the years. I especially enjoyed Hotspur and Hal, which I see now, played by Sean Connery and Robert Hardy. I would love to watch it in video, especially as many of the plays are rarely performed and even less available on video. It would also be valuable as a document of middle 20th century television production.
