The third film I watched at the philly film festival was this outstanding drama from Japan. After the outbreak of the prison, nine escaped prisoners are planning the "key to the universe" that a tenth condemnation that did not break out told them. Along the way we learn to know each of these men fairly well. Everyone has their own dreams. For many of the movie, it seems to be mostly a comedy, but a shift occurs that results in a tragedy. All the actors give good performances. I can't say much more without spoiling the movie, but it's enough to say that you feel for some of these individuals. At 2 o'clock, this movie is a bit too long, but no less good. I did not recommend any malice with the warning that it was a little disturbing for the grief. Toshiaki Toyoda ran out of the house this time and it allows me to search out his previous films, and I look forward to his future. <br /> <br /> My Grade: A
