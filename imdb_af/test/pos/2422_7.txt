I was 19 when I first saw this movie in the theater. I have a lively reminder of another end. Not quite different, but significant. I watched the movie last night and I went wrong, so I think the following can't be called a spoiler, as it never happened. The end I remember was that the boy in the house was hiding completely naked, Frances Austen found him very easy and after confronting him, she slowly sank to her knees and found him. Only his face was in the frame and it was pretty obvious, he made it happen, even if it was against his will. But nothing like it appeared in the movie. Sandy Dennis was 32 years old when she made this film. Michael Burns was 22. In the film he complains to his sister that Frances is too big about sex. Yes? Well then, go with her husband and get it over. WTF?
