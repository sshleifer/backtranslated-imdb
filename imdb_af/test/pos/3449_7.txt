This movie highly recommended it. The paintings, the music and David Hewlett's naked buttocks are all beautiful! The plot, a story of salvation, forgiveness and courage in adversity, is also very interesting and touched - and it is not predictable, and it says a lot about a movie in this day and age. But the acting is mediocre, the direction is confusing, and the writing is just strange. It often felt like a parody, but I never figured out what it was trying to be parody * of *. And if it's not a parody, well, it remains a movie with great potential it didn't live on.
