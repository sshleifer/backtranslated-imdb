Great Corporations Vs. Conscious Do good people. We seem to see events (both real life and real life) of this kind and most of the time, greed has won by using all means (dirt) and the truth is suppressed. At least in this movie Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) paid and paid for his points. We've seen more movies of this kind made in recent years, the most memorable of which was The Insider, where Russell Crowe played a scientist from the tobacco industry who tried to blow the whistle and claimed the industry was more nicotine in cigarettes added. make smokers addicted. There was also this reporter-protagonist angle where the reporter seeks the kicking of his / her dreams and the protagonist is confronted with this moral dilemma where he / she should choose between justice and his existence and sometimes his / her life. br /> <br /> Jane Fonda has perfected reporter Kimberly pits. She plays a reporter who wants to follow serious news, while her bosses appreciate her more than an 'Eye-Candy'. She and her crew (the cameraman played by the post-'Coma 'Michael Douglas, who is also the producer of the movie) testify to a nuclear power plant accident while visiting. Cameraman Michael Douglas is illegally / illegally recording the event on tape, despite being a no-photography zone and smuggling it out of the station. The station refuses to air it and informs the corporation owned by the nuclear station. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, chief engineer Jack Godell is launching an investigation of his own and discovering many irregularities in the equipment used for the reactor. It all starts with the dirty politics of corruption and greed. <br /> <br /> It is a good thriller and it has managed to create a lot of tension in the audience to the end and the funny thing was that there was no background score to present all the terrifying moments . Now it's great and unusual in movies. Performances were all good and I love Jack Lemmon. We know him mainly for his comic roles, but he is equally good at dramatic roles. I give this movie an 8/10.
