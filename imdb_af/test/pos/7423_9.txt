One of the most unfair malicious programs of all time, 'Terry & June' was also one of the most popular sitcoms of the '70s and' 80s. <br /> <br /> It started life as 'Happy Ever After' but when Eric Merriman decided he didn't want to write anymore, it changed, so the death of Aunt Lucy and the Fletcher's rival. <br /> <br /> Yes, it was nice, household, middle class stuff; The plots ran the spectrum of bosses from the boss to supper, the minister organized a jumble hall and unwanted family members arrived the weekend. It was definitely not 'terribly lazy comedy'. Since it wasn't smart, it wasn't meant to be. It was funny and well done, and it was enough! <br /> <br /> I also had the '80's' alternative' tree ('Spitting Image', 'Black Adder', 'The Young Ones' etc.) but also enjoyed conventional things like this. If nothing else, it offers alternative comedy with something to be an alternative. I found it sad when Ben Elton liked both this and Benny Hill. Well, family-oriented comedy has disappeared all but our screens, but where did it leave us? Look at the latest T.V. schedules. All soap and reality dross. The few remaining comedies are aimed at adolescents, meaning they are jams with hardship, bodily jokes and explicit sexual references. And they're not funny either. <br /> <br /> The 'alternative comedy' tree was good in many ways, but had a dark side. It exhibited conventional sitcoms, chased away talented writers and artists such as Spike Milligan and eventually led to such an unspeakable drive such as "Little Britain" and "Tittybangbang". If it's not broken, don't fix it!
