First, let me review the movie. This movie crawls me out and I don't even believe in strangers! However, the movie has its faults. <br /> <br /> There are three acts on this movie. Law One is perfect. It sets the movie up, and really builds the crawling factor. I have to say the score is great! Everything is set up and it's perfectly set up. <br /> <br /> Act Two begins when Jillian, Sherry Burton plays, shrinks. They hypnotize her, and she reminds of the kidnapping. Law Two ruins the movie when the aliens appear. "Scream Mad George" had the effect for strangers. I must say they did a good job, except with their depiction of the Gray strangers. No offense, but the Grays looked like inflatable prices. <br /> <br /> On a synot I liked how they treated hypnosis in Acts One and Two. If you get attention, you'll see that the husband and wife had two different memories. In the man's version of events, the blue light zaps them and his wife says, "Someone is here," or something like that. It makes sense. The man is worried about his wife. "Someone" can hurt her. That's his problem. But in her version of events she says, "Help me!" She didn't say "Somebody's here." It also makes sense. The strangers are after her. Helping her husband save and save her is her problem. Now back to the movie. <br /> <br /> Act Three turns the movie into a gore. It starts with a "strange" ultrasound procedure. This is a typical gore festival, but it has a surprising end. I won't ruin it because it's actually an interesting development. <br /> <br /> The DVD and commentaries take themselves too seriously, but if you think Wilford Brimley says "Horsesh **" is funny, you might want to check it out in the selected interview section. Now to my praise by Jillian McWhirter. <br /> <br /> I could only hope Jillian would read it. I have never seen her, but wow, what a show! Let me tell the rest of you. First, it is supposed to be a serious movie. The details I now describe can sound like camping and fun like "Humanoids From The Deep" (1980), but it's really not. Have this? Good. <br /> <br /> Jillian is warm, of course beautiful. She's naked for much of the movie, a good thing. Unfortunately, she is usually assaulted, terrorized and raped, a very bad thing. However, she has to act naked in many of these films. She gets points to overcome it. She must be happy, sad, horny, scared and physically hurt in a few moments. The reversal of emotion is amazing! She must encourage joy when she learns that she is pregnant. She must scream in terror when strangers take out her intestines. She must act very angry when her husband suggests that the baby is not his. She must act like she is in denial, and say nothing is wrong with her baby if her husband says otherwise. A denial, I should note that it is really forced upon her by the strangers who control her. I'm talking here with Oscar caliber performance! <br /> <br /> Then there's the rape scene. It's upsetting, but since it's just a rubber alien, it's not bad. In this scene, the alien is not a "Gray" alien, so I'll describe it. The alien has tentacles, and it's like a table. Jillian is on the table-like part, held by the tentacles. Against her head is the stranger's head. The stranger's head is long and it flips off so that his head is now above Jillian's legs. Then the alien hey-nanu-nanu comes from his forehead. This is forehead! Sounds nice camp, right? Well, Jillian plays it straight, and she pulls it off! She must act like a stranger, raping her honey-nanu-nanu coming from his forehead, and pulling it off! It's a very intense scene, but it's not what it does. You see, this scene is done in a jump. What makes the scene is Jillian's performance that remembers these events. She is just lying in a hospital bed under hypnosis that remembers the alien abduction, but her play is more intense than the real rape scene! How many actors can draw a performance in a scene that describes a rape that is more intense than the scene of the rape? Not much! Jillian does, however. <br /> <br /> I can go on and on. Jillian, if you've ever read it, I want you to know I, alias of MegamanX-1 (remember name), believe you are the best actress ever. You're the best actress ever! I can only hope you read it and always take it with you. <br /> <br /> As for everyone, "Nakom" (1999) is an okay to Good movie. I would recommend it.
