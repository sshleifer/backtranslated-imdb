ONE DARK NIGHT is a highly overlooked and a little-known movie from the early 80's that deserves an audience that I fear it will never get, and it is a pity. I have seen this movie compared to others who have gained a bigger name over the years, especially PHANTASM, HELL NIGHT and MAUSOLEUM. This is a very different film than that and I don't see the comparisons except the mausoleum, which is similar to the one in PHANTASM, but not enough to make real comparisons. I'm not sure how this one slipped without a wider acceptance. Maybe that's all in the marketing, I don't know. Perhaps a remake will breathe a new life into it, unless Raymar threw it all out of life. I'm not too big on all the remakes that are currently abundant, but I think they work well with lesser-known movies (except for the horrible GHOST SHIP remake, which was different from the opening scene and Mudvayne's Falling blaring was shit). So if a repeat of ONE DARK NIGHT were to fall into the right hands, I think it would make many people look at the original. I know that's what I do if there is a movie I haven't seen before. Anything short of a remake, I fear, will not bring this movie back to life. Unless Raymar looked at his eyes. <br /> <br /> Anyways, ONE DARK NIGHT is a must see for horror fans, especially 80's horror fans (because we all know it's when the best horror movies were made). Creepy setting. Fairly good acting. Very good story. Campy. What's more about an early 80's horror movie? What is it ... nudity and gore? Well, sorry. No nudity or gore in this movie, but it's still fantastic! A solid 8 out of 10. Enjoy.
