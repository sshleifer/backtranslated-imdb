this movie is just amazing .. unfortunately in Portugal not even a shadow of him ... and I agree with a previous opinion, only FF fans will really give the movie the right credit ... but for the rest .. I dare you to see it. The story is great, and I thought the game ended the story, but the writers gave us a great story to the god of all RPGs. The harvest, as usual, came from heaven. the little details they gave us (our fans of the game) are beautiful. Like the ringtone is the winning song of the game, and even some movements are quite familiar. Look, it's a big movie, a fantastic story. ... not a 10/10
