Wildman Chief Counselor Tripper Harrison (peak-footed Bill Murray in his first lead) is chairing the various wacky hi-jinks at the North Star summer camp. Tripper befriends a sad and lonely misfit child Rudy (a good and influential performance by Chris Makepeace). Director Ivan Reitman tells the amusement of the comic vignette of the wall at a ceaselessly funny pace and keeps an engaging, benevolent show. This movie nails the breezy'n'breezy essence of summer: make friends, first love, draw pranks, compete in sports with a competitive camp, campfire singalongs, and of course the inevitable, terrifying urban legend about escaped psycho killer with the hook. The feeling of a nice fun that this picture generates is positively contagious. In addition, the humor is always goofy and sometimes rough, but never too nasty or mean. Best of all, there is a winning victory of pure heart along with the mentioned humor (the warm relationship between Tripper and Rudy in particular is really touching). The role-players have a clear ball that plays their characters: Murray's glamorous gonzo and galvanizing presence keeps things humming constantly (his crazy PA announcements are absolutely pavements), plus there are healthy contributions from Harvey Atkin as frightened camp owner Morty , Kate Lynch as Tripper's sassy old flame Roxanne, Russ Banham as the lovely Crockett, Kristine DeBell as the lovely, foxy AL, Sarah Torgov as the festive Candace, Jack Blum as the klutzy, particular nerd Spaz, Keith Knight, like Tubby Slob, Larry Finkelstein, Cindy Girling as the Wendy and Matt Craven as the Hip Hardware. Donald Wilder's cinematography gives the movie an attractive sunny look and makes good use of wipes. Elmer Bernstein's lively and melodic score also does the trick. A real riot.
