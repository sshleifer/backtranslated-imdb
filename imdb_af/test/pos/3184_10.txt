There is just as much I can take from Filipino movies, especially nowadays where the trend is sex, action and slapstick comedy (which I hate). the fact that Nasaan Ka Man made me think and made me during the movie was a big plus. It has good movies and editing was great, especially the movies. I think Claudine deserves the best actress here rather than getting one in the movie Milan. the fact that there are so few Filipino movies I really like. I think Cholo Laurel did such a good job in this movie. I really loved showing this movie, technical and character development; The plot was complex and made it fantastic.
