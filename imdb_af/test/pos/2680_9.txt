"The King of the King," is, in my opinion, a pure CBS hit! Despite having never seen every episode, I still enjoy it a lot. For that reason, it's hard for me to say what episode my favorite is. Yet I have to say that CBS really knows how to make a good sitcom. Before I upload it, I would like to say that everyone is always performing well, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well designed and the writing is always very strong. Finally, if this display stays in syndication after it's off CBS, I strongly encourage you to catch it only when it goes out of the air.
