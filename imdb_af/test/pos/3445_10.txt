This epic compilation brings a wonderful gifted movie and crew, a narrative depth to most novels, great music, philosophy and a connection with LIFE I find difficult to explain. Deploying you in Die Zweite Heimat is related to a spiritual experience, similar to the awe you get when you look at the stars in a bright night sky. The language and use of both color and monochrome segments adds to the dramatic impact. The film inspired me to go to Munich and visit some of the places, including the Edgar Reitz office. From then on I promised to improve my German skills - after Die Zweite Heimat I almost felt German, as if I were in the head of the characters. I also try to match Henry Arnold's (Hermann) piano play, but that's the one thing that will always evade me! This drama is unmatched and I was happy to see it on BBC2 in the UK and SMT in Australia. The successor, Heimat 3, is currently being filmed in Germany.
