What a crazy movie! It takes twelve (!) Hours and you don't understand who these people are and what they do! The main plot is about a bunch of indifferent actors trying to bring to the scene "Prometheus", but there are many sub-plots, such as the disappearance of Thomas and a crazy man looking for Monsieur Warok .... what is the meaning of all this?
