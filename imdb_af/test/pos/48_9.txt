I look at Lackawanna Blues every time. It brings me happy times back. I grow up in a big city in the middle-west. It reminds me when I was a kid, although my situation was a little different, it felt the same. It makes me wonder if everything we will ever know about families is lost. The big moms of the day are under the age of 55. They will see what is needed to be inspiration to others. I hope I was not the only one who loved this movie to relate it to their past. The music was wonderful in this movie. I really felt it would have gone to the theaters I would have paid to see it. While watching the movie for the second time, I figured out about the life this movie is about. He did a wonderful job in writing and made this film. I think who is better at producing a movie based on your life other than you. As soon as I can get a copy for my home use. I always enjoy black producers or directors who make such a movie feel that you are actually living in the right time. Thanks for such a great movie.
