It is worth watching, although it is sometimes cheese, it is great to see a young Sean Astin, and this is an entertaining and humorous action movie. I watched it many times when I was young and still enjoy it when I plug in the old vhs in the machine (I have a copy). So sit back with this movie, let the reality go for a while, and you'll have some good laughs and a pleasant one-half hour.
