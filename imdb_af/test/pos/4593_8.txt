First, let me say that although I greatly appreciate the work of Mike Judge, I was just clumsy in my response to Office Space, King of the Hill, and Beavis and Butthead. I usually prefer more intelligent comedy, and in it lies the irony of the idiocy. <br /> <br /> In a future world where the embodiment of Beavis and Butthead's views, beast instincts and intellectual abilities is the framework of a chaotic, messy, semi-Mad Max semi-Blade Runner society, where each fan-rubbish's fantasy becomes reality, a man with an average average intelligence is threatened and accused of talking gay and the mob mentality takes over. And this world is also incredibly funny. <br /> <br /> Yes, it is obvious that Carl's Jr., Starbucks, Costco and Fuddruckers' drivers will be deterred by the twisted values ​​of their products in the year 2505. <br /> <br /> There were some missed opportunities at the movie and the relationship between the time travelers - the other being an average intelligence woman worried about her boyfriend's attempted retribution - could have been stronger; the chemistry is there. And there don't look too many women in the future. <br /> <br /> I left with a smile on my face, but the experience is a little better than the memories. So, this is my kind of popcorn movie, and it would be nice to watch video again. Recommended! FYI continues the credits for an extra scene.
