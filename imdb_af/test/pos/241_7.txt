Rita Hayworth lifts the screen into this fun, fine and wonderful musical lead genius Kelly. Rita plays night club dancer Rusty Parker who is dreaming to be a successful Broadway star. Unfortunately her career does not take place in Danny McGuire's Night Club. When one of her fellow dancers says she is going to enter a Cover Girl game, she decides to follow her dreams and enter. She remembers the publisher of her grandmother, whom he was in love for many years. But if she finds this success, her boyfriend is not happy with it. <br /> <br /> I've never seen Rita before, and I'm so glad I did! She has such a scene presence and is a very good actress. There are some good numbers in it, not the best of any music, but they are melodic and good to listen to. One thing I didn't like was Gene Kelly's character. He had to support his girlfriend! But anyway, this is perhaps the only criticism I have about this movie. Cover Girl is a glamorous, fluffy movie - perfect escapism. Not everyone's ideal movie, but a wonderful movie, because of Rita Hayworth's strength. Big movie, really impressed.
