My wife and I watched this wonderful movie tonight because we will watch Russian Dolls tomorrow and the first is important to see before the second. <br /> <br /> We both loved the Spanish apartment and would love to follow some characters. through the early years of their lives - now in St Pertersburg, Russia. We both identified slightly with the rough framework of the story, because we were students, Florence Italy for us, so the writing was not quite strange in our early life. Our life was much different, but as with this movie, every time you throw young people together through the same lifetimes as any developed world, they will experience much the same life situations. <br /> <br /> The collection of people and the personal problems they face are universal and the beauty of this movie lies, and probably the order I will see tomorrow. As I have written, the characters as well as these situations are known to us all and so we can enjoy their lives for a while. This must be one of the great strengths of the film, so that the viewer might experience the emotional upheavals of the people and keep them informed. The viewer may think for themselves by that distance: "I would not have done anything dumb," or "I would have avoided that snare". Maybe that's why we're going to movies.
