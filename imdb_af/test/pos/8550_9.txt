It is a finely crafted movie with moving rows, humor, and best of all a love story. Anthony Quinn has been wonderfully cast and, after seeing several of his films, it has to be categorized as one of his best performances, except Zorba. The movie really makes you wonder if it's filmed in Romania, which apparently isn't. It is certain that even indigenous Fame Ense, with its authentic landscape, costume and way of life, will be deceived. According to IMDb, it's actually shot in France and Yugoslavia, hmmm. The story is compelling, so you want to watch the whole movie over to see if you missed something. It has challenged me to investigate whether it is a truth-based movie, but to my disappointment it is a novel-based film, seemingly fiction. It seems a bit far-fetched to really happen, but one never knows .... The one problem with this movie is that it doesn't want to throw any Romanian actors, and it's a movie about a movie. Romanian character. There are probably a lot of Romanian fillings in the beginning, but maybe it's not filmed elsewhere. The author of the book was Romanian, at least that's fine and foolish - overall a masterpiece in filmmaking.
