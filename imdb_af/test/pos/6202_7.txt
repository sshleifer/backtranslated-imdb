I enjoyed this series, but felt that the whole thing had dropped through the sound recording / mixing. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, they had to use a tremendous amount of ADR, where the actors replaced the original location sound with a re-recording of it in a sound box. <br /> <br /> The reasons for this are usually due to problems at the site or because someone has screwed somewhere in the audio production chain. <br /> <br /> It won't be as bad as the ADR is done, but sometimes it's just distracting. It is not just the ADR that is the problem - the sound mix does not match the quality of performances and the pictures. <br /> <br /> I would be curious to know what went wrong.
