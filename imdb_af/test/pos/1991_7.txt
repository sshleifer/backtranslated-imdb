"We both push together in this unformed world, whose rules and goals are largely unknown, seemingly unclear or even possibly non-existent, always on the verge of being murdered by powers we do not understand." So Ted Pikul says in the movie. What summarizes life for some and "eXistenZ" is probably a movie about existence. What is real and what is unreal and how you tell the difference. Or not. The last line of the movie is amazingly ambiguous. <br /> <br /> The movie looks like a rough dog story (indeed, it has a real rough dog in it), but it takes you on an interesting ride full of provocative Cronenberg that will make you look at amphibians , wildlife, fish, spines and legs in a new light. Some bits are very sorry. It takes place in a rural area where the gas station 'GASSTATION' is called and a Chinese restaurant is called 'CHINESE RESTAURANT'. The movie has an impressive texture that leaps away from your usual big budget science fiction movie. You can read lots of things in the movie and it pays more than once. <br /> <br /> The main players are Jude Law, which is OK and Jennifer Jason Leigh, which is good. Some roles do not fit with this very talented actor, but if she has such a good role, she is unmistakable. Her unconventional beauty and fascinating voice fit the part of Allegra. (It also looks good in a short black dress.) There are other well-known actors, but they aren't much to do. It looks good, sounds good and a Howard Shore score makes the movie very good. Cronenberg is possibly the Alfred Hitchcock of the sci-fi / horror genre. No matter what movie he makes, it's always worth watching.
