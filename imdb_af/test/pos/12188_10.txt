"Queen of the Damned" is one of the best vampire movies I've ever seen! The movie had tension, action and gore. The combination of the fiery queen's demanding attitude and the rock style of our star, which is very well handled by Stuart Townsend, makes a wonderful movie that can only create this combination. I am always the one who gives advice to my friends and relatives about what movies are renting and when they ask me if "Queen of the Damned" is worthy, I tell them it's worth buying. This movie is surely a must-have in all horror movie lovers' homes!
