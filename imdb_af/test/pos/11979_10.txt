This movie deserves the 10 I give. <br /> <br /> But it's not the 10 you give to movies like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas' or 'Psycho'. This is the kind of 10 you give to a movie that just makes you laugh, over and over! This is the most horribly written and directed movie, but it doesn't fail to entertain. It has the most amateur effects, but you enjoy every moment! I saw this movie on TV today, and I didn't want to move away! Read the following dialogue to know why! <br /> <br /> (Whole college is around Manisha, who has just undergone a rape attempt and asking the rapists for forgiveness) <br /> <br /> Bad Guy 1: Forgive please! <br /> <br /> Bad guy 2: Yes, we won't do it again. <br /> <br /> (No answer from Manisha) <br /> <br /> Akshay: Come, forgive them! <br /> <br /> Manisha: I don't know ... <br /> <br /> Akshay: You're a beautiful woman, and even dead men can be awakened by you! And these are living young men! Don't blame them! <br /> <br /> Pancholi: Yes Manisha .. <br /> <br /> Manisha (To Suniel): What if they try to rape your girlfriend? <br /> <br /> Suniel: I'll break their hands, legs and kill them. But anyway, just forgive them. <br /> <br /> Akshay: Yes, if you do not forgive them, then it will be as if you are too arrogant about your beauty! <br /> <br /> Now it's a true masterpiece of dialogue! This movie never fails to entertain, mainly because there are so many goofs and unrealistic situations! The bad man (Munish) can basically do anything. He can blow a sandstorm out of his mouth, or he can get a motorcycle from his back and just as easily disappear. <br /> <br /> Every actor takes turns talking. A line from Akshay, then from Suniel, then from Arshad, then Aftab, then Nigam. This is the main rule followed by the director so that equal screen time is given to each man. And then there's the whole powerful hanger, which can even cause a speed car to go right through you without harming you! All of this makes it a pleasant movie, and I can watch it over and over. I think this movie can be in the comedy house of fame if there is one. <br /> <br /> The only problem is it's not funny.
