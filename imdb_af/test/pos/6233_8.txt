After a group of young friends are having trouble traveling on the track, they accept an offer of help from lonely local mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors), owner of a nearby museum full of historical wash mannequins. Once at the sprawling street attraction, the friends are pushed through a mask-like mask that can bring the museum's dummies to life by the power of the spirit. <br /> <br /> Tourist Trap's bad guy is a demented cross between The Texas Chain Saw Massacre's Leatherface and Anthony, the scary kid from the classic Twilight Zone episode "It's a Good Life," while the plot a blend of elements of the aforementioned TCM, Hitchcock's Psycho and House of Wax. The atmosphere and performance of Tourist Trap is, however, so completely unnecessary that in this respect it is virtually impossible to make comparison with other earlier films. <br /> <br /> Director David Schmoeller's constantly inventive and unpredictable treatment of his own script gives the film a clear nightmare quality, and with a brilliant left-hand show from Connors, an impossible, spectacular score from Pino Donaggio, a collection of really disturbing mannequins with detachable jaws and the presence of super sexy Tanya Roberts, spends the film in (and briefly out) little denim pants and a boob tube figure. Tourist Trap is a totally memorable and ultimately one-of-a-kind horror experience that follows the cult.
