Seeing the movie last night without knowing it (nothing else looks interesting and I had a Buffalo connection to this movie - UB grad). It was a very enjoyable movie. Love the pass (it starts after a slow start) and story. Well written plot and good character development and relationships. Recommend it to anyone who likes to watch movies that have interesting stories. I talked about a few beers about this movie - most of the discussions take no more than a few minutes.
