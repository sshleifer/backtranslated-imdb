When I saw this movie for the first time, I thought it would be a terrible disturbance, directed by director Liev Schrieber for the first time. What I saw completely in the next 130 minutes and completely changed my mind. Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer, everything was relieved, telling the story of a young Jewish American collector (masterfully played by Elijah Wood) trying to find the woman who saved his Nazi grandfather in World War II has. He travels to Germany and draws in the help of a 20-something bunch of slave translator and his grandfather. This leads to a solid search across the country, and they are determined to find what they are looking for. In some of the most beautiful places in the world, Everything is illuminated, delivers tension between the translator and his grandfather and the help that Jonathan must find his quarry. There are also many religious issues, as the grandfather refers to Jonathan as "the Jew." All in all, it's a movie about yourself and loving family. I give this wonderful, if not enlightened, movie a 10 out of 10 Arjun
