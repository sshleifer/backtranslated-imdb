The story is about a working girl (Ann Sothern) who has a beautiful, unthinkable boyfriend (Paul Kelly). This boyfriend is so busy starting his own business, which he forgets or shows up again and again. The last straw is when Sothern's birthday and Kelly says he's too busy celebrating her to celebrate. So, if she doesn't want to stay home, she's on a blind day with what seems to be a very rich young man (Neil Hamilton). Sparks flies but it also becomes apparent after Sothern broke her relationship with Kelly that the new boyfriend Hamilton is a "love" and lets some kind of guy. How it all was finally resolved is not too difficult to predict - just enough to say it's ultimately perfect. <br /> <br /> It's a very modest little movie from Columbia Pictures - with a relatively small budget as well as second-star stars. This is clearly a "B movie" despite the fact that there are small roles played by a Mickey Rooney and Jane Darwell - both of whom were still known. Now it's NOT to say it's bad actors or production isn't good. In fact, given the production values, it's a wonderful movie, because everything looks so good, despite being a pretty ordinary and somewhat predictable plot. This is because the actors and directors did a very good job of conveying the story. Plus, the writers have done a good job of renewing and caring for the characters. The end is really really sweet and virtually my tear tubes have flowed! Because of these factors, the film deserves a 7 out of 10.
