Errol Flynn's rogry charm really shines in this entertaining and exciting but historically bankrupt biopic of the well-known (and some infamous) General Custer, who follows his career from his first day at West Point, through the Civil War and west to battle. the little big horn, all the blunt heads with competing Arthur Kennedy and romance beautiful Olivia de Havilland. <br /> <br /> Some people may say that Flynn, who is a great flamboyant show as general, is basically playing himself Custer! <br /> <br /> An exuberant production (which should have been in Technicolor), well directed by Raoul Walsh, died with their boots. There are some well-advanced battle sequences. Also, it's a good surprise to play Anthony Quinn Crazy Horse. <br /> <br /> The previous year, Flynn played Jeb Stuart against Ronald Reagan's George Custer in Santa Fe Trail (also with the Havilland), another action-packed Warner Brothers production designed to make you fail history class!
