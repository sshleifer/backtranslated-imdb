This ingenious and innovative comedy packs many moments of immeasurable and great sense of fit, though left over. Chaplin's satire with several classic scenes, he has dual role as a Jewish hairdresser and dictator Hynkel, an offensive depiction of Hitler. Then the hairdresser is wrong for the Hitlerian tyrant and happens to be mistaken. Funny and extraordinary action, such as co-star Jack Oakie as Napolini (Mussolini Equal), Henry Daniel as Gasbstich (Himmler Equal) and Billy Gilbert as Haring (Goering). Chaplin's first spoken movie is photographed brilliantly by Karl Struss. This beautiful film contains many amusing scenes, the funniest being the following: 1) One in WWI flies the barber soldier with a fellow pilot in a spinning airplane unaware 2) Dictator Adenoid Hynkel does hand over speeches including a twisted microphone 3) Violin plays with a huge balloon of the world 4) The Jewish hairdresser shaves a man who fits Hungarian Dance number 5 of Brahms 5) when Hynkel and Napolini each try to keep his body higher than the other in a hairdresser's chair; among them. <br /> <br /> Hitler banned film exhibitions to the Germans because of his satire of him and placed him in his death list after his intended conquest of America. The film is co-stars by Paulette Goddard, third of his four women, married in 1936, although no marriage announcement was made later, the Great Dictator once completed. The picture was released in 1940, when Chaplin received a moral scandal from a father's suit, but a brush with The House of Un-American activities was the signal for the US to refuse to re-enter Britain and he fled to Switzerland.
