Not only does this movie have a good title, but just the biggest drama I've ever seen. The viewer was irretrievably drawn into the film of 5 young men working together to try and overcome inhumane odds. Sean Astin, like Billy Tepper, is brilliant, along with great supporting roles of TERussell, Wil Wheaton and Shawn Phelan, the leadership and leadership of Gosset and Astins characters making the movie so much better. As time goes on, the movie keeps momentum together and it is a dissapointment that none of the young actors made a name for themselves in the film industry after this wonderful movie.
