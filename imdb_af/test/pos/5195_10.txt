One of the best war movies I've ever seen, if not the best. It is very difficult to talk about such movies, as it is very difficult to point to any movie made wrong. The "problem" is as it seems to be true and with that you drag to the ruins of Stalingrad and let you suffer for both sides. This is why this film, unlike most Hollywood movies, does not glorify the war or heroism of the main characters. Instead, the film only makes their heroes for being human and with that, anti-war is as much as reason can. Extremely convincing warships and so impressive acting seem to be most screens like insulated theater pieces. Also, German army is played by Germans who are so convincing. The film is produced and realized by Germans where you can see their love of detail to perfection. That's why Stalingrad is one of the movies I can see millions of times and never feel boring. I watched the movie with my father who fought in World War II and the first thing he said was: "It really is, so the war against Germans looks." This is the place where you can see what it looks like as a soldier in the worst nightmare of warfare in the human history and turning point of World War II: Stalingrad.
