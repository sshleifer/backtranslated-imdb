Personally, I can only agree with Stephen-12: reception. There really is no point trying to fix this movie. I like movies where nothing (explicitly) happens. Herzog's 'Aguirre, where Zorn Gottes' has the same thing, but the film is less convincing, as the climax is rather the beginning of the story. Herzog therefore had to focus on nature towards Kinski. Morte and Venezia, however, are completely different, as they have various climaxes, turns, and so on. From the point where Aschenbach's luggage is lost, the movie almost reaches its final (its final sand grains run through the hourglass after the moment of happiness where it fantasizes to warn the Polish family and decorate Tadzio's hair. <br /> <br /> You can, if you like, search some clues / symbols in this one (she tries to leave behind his luggage from the moment he arrives, shows the Tadzio at the end, the fact that in the whole movie content and form is completely in sync), but it makes no sense: it will not make the movie better or worse, as its power lies in the whole story's teaching, which is never made explicit. , the decay of Europe, the end of the 'romantic era' as we got to know it, which proved that it was just the beginning of it (individual emotions and expressions are now more important than they ever were). I start to develop one small (small) mistake of the movie myself: 'Let's talk oo r art parts. Now there's one thing to never do. I believe it can be expressed in other ways. Furthermore, I believe it becomes very clear in the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I don't like explicit movies. I can read books, so I don't want a storyline that only speaks to my rationale. I prefer movies you can't explain in words, but only in movie (Lynch's Lost Highway, Weir's Picknick at Hanging Rock and Roeg's Man who has fallen to Earth), because then, and then it has just a reason to exist as a movie and not just as a book. So how's Thomas Mann's novella? I've never read it yet, but forget about it! The movie gives a different point of view: it says things that you can never say in a book. It uses the film art to make you feel through images and music, the same thing that makes Mann feel you using text. Just as brilliant, but different worlds.
