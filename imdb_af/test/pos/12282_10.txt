loved the story of a man trying to get his girl back. There it is, so I can relate it. In any way, I love working the camera, how occasionally the camera gets 'on' they just sit there and talk about the scene or other things ... or how the camera chases him to find the cast and what not ... I watched it at IFC somewhere last year and I loved it, so I have some of my friends watched it, and some watched it, and they also loved it. Go out if you can, lovely girly, but it's still a good movie. I gave it a 10/10 because of two reasons ... one: I can be related ... but anyone who ever fell in love and made a mistake could relate ... two: this is a very creative way to make a movie, it's like you're always there, right in the middle of filming ... as i said, good movie
