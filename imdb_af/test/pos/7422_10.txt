Terry and June in my mind, is an everyday classic, next to the ranks of the house with the late sid james and the late Diana coupland, but terry scott will unfortunately be missed even though he died in 1994. I have all the dvds to print and I look forward to getting all 9, will also be nice to see "lucky after ever" released on DVD <br /> <br /> June whitfield is still going strong and terry scott will always live in my memory <br /> <br /> Terry Scott Rip there aren't many comedies today that I can think of that will stay in the legends list and yes the middle class gets a bit on some wicks, but I don't care Not, I think it would be brilliant to celebrate Terry Scott's life
