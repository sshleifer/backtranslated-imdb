Fun, entertaining movie about World War II German spy (Julie Andrews!) In love with American pilot (Rock Hudson) while trying to get secrets from him. For some reason it was attacked by critics and murdered by the public in 1970. I can't see why. It is beautifully shot, has great costumes and interiors, and exciting lures. Andrews also has a striped tease (strict PG material) and sings a beautiful song - "Whistling in the Dark". The movie has problems. Andrews and Hudson did not get through the shootings - and it shows. Their love stories have a lack of spark and they have no sexual chemistry. Still, they turn into OK appearances. The movie is a bit long (even in the 105-minute director's cut I saw) and gets too dark and serious at the end. Still, worth the effort. Try to cut the directors ... the other one goes half an hour longer!
