Preston Sturgis' The power and glory were unnoticed by the public for almost twenty or thirty years until the end of the nineties, when it appeared on television and even appeared on television. Meanwhile, it has become known because Pauline Kael's THE CITIZEN KANE BOOK has suggested that Herman Mankiewicz - Orson Welles is based on KANE's script on the Sturgis script. As mentioned at the beginning of this thread for the film on the IMDb website, Kael overestimated her case. <br /> <br /> There are about six storytellers who take turns about Charles Foster Kane's life: the news rule (representing Ralston - the Henry Luce clone), Thatcher's memoirs, Bernstein, Jed Leland, Susan Alexander Kane, and Raymond the butler. Everyone has his or her other way up Kane, which reflects their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man. And of course everyone also reveals his or her own failures when they tell their version of Kane's story. This method also results in regular overlapping repetitions of the same event. <br /> <br /> This is not the situation in power and glory. Yes, as KANE is about a legendary business leader - here is Tom Garner (Spencer Tracy), a man who has risen from the bottom to head for the most successful rail system in the country. But there are only two narrators - they are Garner's right-hand man Henry (Ralph Morgan) and his wife (Sarah Padden). It limits the almost three-dimensional view that we get from Kane at Garner at times. Henry, when he talks, talks about his boss and friend, whom he respected and loved. His wife is like the voice of the skeptical public - she only sees the flaws in Henry. Typical example: Although he has acted his way, Tom is becoming more and more anti-labor in his later years. Trade unions are wedding-makers, and he doesn't care to be delayed by their shenanigans. Henry describes Tom's confrontation with the Union in a big run, and how it involved him to the detriment of his home life. But Henry's wife reminds him how Tom used villains and violence to end the strike (apparently blowing up the Union's headquarters - killing many people). So we have two views of the man, but one is pure white and one is pure black. I don't really beat the power and the glory because I can't duplicate the success of KANE. from Orson Welles's other films), but I am aware that the story is well-presented to keep one's interest. And thanks to the performances of Tracy and Colleen Moore as his wife, Sally, the tragedy of the couple's worldly success is fully brought home. <br /> <br /> When they get married, Tom wants to do well (partially) to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had. But in America, big business success comes at a price. Tom gets deeply involved in the management of the railroad (he expands it and continually improves it). But it takes him too much away from home, and he gets in touch with Sally. And he also looks at Eva (Helen Vinson), the younger woman she becomes a mistress. When Sally learns about his unfaithful behavior, it destroys her. <br /> <br /> Likewise, Tom gets a full shock (making him a martyr in the eyes of Henry). Eva married Tom, and offered him a son - but it turns out that Eva's son Tom of Tom's son, Tom Jr. (Philip Trent), is. The discovery of this turbulent cuckolding causes Tom to shoot himself. <br /> <br /> The movie is not a complete success - the action sometimes jumps inconclusive. Yet it really does make the business (note the scene when Tom tells his board about his plans to buy a small competitive train line, and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans). Sturgis came from a rich background so that he could bring in this kind of detail. So in general, it's a first-rate movie. No chance of civilization, but important for film lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in Depression America.
