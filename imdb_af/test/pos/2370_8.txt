It's a movie that has to be taken in context. It shouldn't be seen unless you've seen the first two movies, but the kind of people watching this movie will probably own the boxing kit, or at least know someone who does. And don't expect Blade Runner; The film's budget doesn't go far, and it's a lot more ride. <br /> <br /> Essentially, the film is a science fiction that in future will be Yokohama (shot in Hong Kong as it is) about a society where it is illegal to reproduce. Sho Aikawa repeats a similar role of Dead or Alive 2 and Riki Takeuchi is a detective for birth control. Takashi Miike is not one to give all his reasons for a dish, but one can assume that the law of reproduction (applied by humans to the pill) is due to overcrowding, increased longevity and so on. more. Interestingly, the film's dialogue is mainly Cantonese, while Sho and Riki (who play their parts as always brilliant) speak Japanese and speak some English. People criticized English as wood, but I found no problems with it. Also, another person found the homosexuality themes throughout the film to be offensive; said Takashi Miike was anti-gay. He may be very good (and not all artists should be left), but I can't see this film as an insult to homosexuals. He recalled philosophies of ancient Greece when gay or bisexuality was more common. The film features similar relationships of active and pleasurable moments to DoA 2, although in this movie the action is based on more martial arts and done in a very good Hong Kong style. The cinematography in the film is very beautiful on the eyes, with symmetrical shots, a good control on colors to give the air a polluted appearance. It is nice to see rude long shots that are so rare in Hollywood. In fact, there is a lot to keep in this movie: a good sense of humor, exciting action and some very beautiful moments. This is a good finishing touch for the series. You can criticize it for a little cheese, but isn't it part of the charm?
