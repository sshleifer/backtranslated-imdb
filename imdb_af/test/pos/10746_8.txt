Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan) is back after disposing of the sea of ​​the dreaded Pirate Lo. Back on the land he was assigned to the police force, where he had to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb. Along the way, he is trapped in the plight of several Chinese patriots trying to provide sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause. The Chinese Manchu government is after this revolutionary, and anyone standing in their way is in trouble, even if they are in the police force. I had great expectations for this movie after I saw Project A. But unfortunately I was a little disappointed. There is just too little action compared to the first movie. There is only one good battlefield to the end. That battle scene is in the "gangster spot" and it's good, many people are flying everywhere and hard shots and thrusts are thrown. Jackie Chan and his stunt team do not disappoint here. The end is very entertaining, Jackie Chan shows us why he is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting things! The only bad thing about the end is that the battles are too short and forgotten. Conclusion: Very funny moments, good acting and crazy stunts. But not enough fighting for a top rating.
