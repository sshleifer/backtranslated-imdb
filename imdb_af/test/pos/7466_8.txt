I had the honor tonight of seeing a performance of the movie "These Girls" at the Philadelphia Film Festival. In the film I knew very little about it and just took a chance about it because the picture's plot was interesting. When I entered the theater just hours ago, I wondered how the final verdict would be thumb or thumb. <br /> <br /> "These Girls" is the story of three best friends from a small town. Keira (Caroline Dhavernas) is the forerunner who basically does not know what to do with her life after high school, but her father stops her going to college, something she doesn't want to do. Lisa (Holly Lewis) goes to a Christian school after the summer. And finally, Glory (Amanda Walsh) is planning to spend her summer's baby seat. But this summer is going to be a special one, as they all have a blackmail, Keith Clark (David Boreanaz), the sexy older base who is their baby. Fun times and lots of laughs? <br /> <br /> I usually don't like movies like "These Girls", but there's something about this movie I really wanted. I think the quality I liked most was that it was pretty realistic. Three girls who want to explore their sexuality choose a young man who has sex with him, later to be cut off by them. This is a very funny story about growing up, friendship and sex, but although it looks good, I can see the majority of this movie in real life. <br /> <br /> The topic here is probably a main reason why this movie did not get a mainstream release in the United States. All the girls in this movie are supposed to be under 18. If I remember correctly, two of them are 17 and one is 16. Now in the US, although minor sex occurs daily, many production or finance companies will not be a movie like this because of the sexual content. This information was actually confirmed by the director John Hazlett himself at the Q&A after the film. The thing that gets me is that the sex scenes in this movie aren't graphic and the nudity is less. Not to mention that all the actresses in this movie are far over 18 in real life. Go figure. <br /> <br /> What the movie is the best, it gives lots of laughter as well as very strong characters. I love all the characters in this movie and each character has a "Now & Dan" feature for them. The jokes were funny because they were cleverly written, not because they were dirty or topical. Everything seems to have both the comedy and the drama. The writing was very strong. <br /> <br /> For the most part, the acting was very good. I thought all three girls were wonderful. Caroline Dhavernas, who was also one of the most underrated TV series of all time "Wonderfalls", was just great; as well as Holly Lewis and Amanda Walsh, who did both good work. David Boreanaz did a good job and he seemed to have had fun shooting most of the screens. The guy played a pot head, and it was funny that he played that role. <br /> <br /> I had the pleasure of meeting John Hazlett tonight who looks like a very good guy and was greatly appreciated by the comments made about the film. I'm shocked that this movie didn't go anywhere. I think with some marketing behind it, it could have slowed down. Unfortunately, this will be one of those that goes directly to DVD movies, which will be so little to see. I think with what small budget Mr. Hazlett had to work, the movie showed well and I think he did a good job of directing this jeweler. <br /> <br /> For someone who typically hates teenage comedies, I can honestly say I really enjoyed this movie. The character development and the spectacular writing allowed me to sit there for an hour and a half and amused. It's a fine comedy because it has heart and spit on it. I know I will be sure to buy this movie on May 16, 2006. If you are a fan of age stories, teen sex comedies or romantic comedies, you should watch this movie as it is one of the funniest movies of its kind released in years. <br /> <br /> MovieManMenzel's final review for "These Girls" is an 8/10.
