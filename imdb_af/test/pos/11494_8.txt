I loved this movie! It has a good heart and big legs. I happened to get it started and I have no memory, not even an inkling, of this movie of promotions or reviews or mouth to mouth. I remember remembering many years ago to read a journalist who commented on the value of movies without polluting them through the bias of reviews or the false shill of promotions. And it seems to be the most common source of critics' negative reaction to the film: it didn't meet expectations that it was a comedy, or a cut of life or character-driven. I had no expectation about the movie, and so it was comedies - but I only laughed once or twice - without being a comedy; it was about a person, but so eccentric that it was not part of life; It was about a character, but the character was so intelligent optimistic and relied on her instinctiveness that it was not the anxiety-driven sentimental melodrama that was so typical of American 'serious' film. As I wrote, I realized that writer / director Lisa Krueger managed to make fun of this timid American sentimentality in the man! And very smart too! And Kreuger was able to keep the cloyingly sentimental end of the screen, when the vibrant, non-lost man returned with his tail that shrunk between his legs. Bravo, Mrs. Krueger, bravo! (Now I look at this movie again because it gets better and better than I reflect on it.) <br /> <br /> Graham's performance as Joline is brilliant. I have why she was subtle but totally capable of intelligently consciousness of her dedicated commitment to glorify and convey her words and deeds. She knew she was holding her word to a band or friends or a man who was trying to mock herself and / or disappointment in a world that was unable to perform as she could. But even with that power, she was fully connected to humanity and embraced them with their own irregularities and failures with a fully dedicated heart. The character of Joline was incredibly good and I surprised the movie. I had no reminder of nominations for awards for it. Well, not so surprised, as American awards tend to go to women in "serious" roles, filled with anxiety and the right amount of nudity that this film did not have. What it did have was much better, which in this woman's discovery of herself was with the help of new friends and a self-degrading shaman. <br /> <br /> I admit that I'm a bit of a gentle touch for eccentric characters who manage their own traits while remaining honest and truthful to themselves as they move through the minefield through what 'proper' societal behavior is. and 'acceptable' interpersonal discourse. So, if people have to match normality in your world, then this movie is not for you. And that was apparently one of the common threads in the criticism. <br /> <br /> And I'm always a sucker for a good game of words when it raises questions about human behavior and ethical / philosophical values. To this film I did not make and commit the emotional connection between dedication (to a reason or honesty or something) (to an insane asylum). At what point is the commitment to a personal sense of truth and action in life a one-off insane ticket? It sounds like a simple question, or one that is easily dismissed as rhetoric. But is it? And few of the critics - I think maybe two - responded directly or indirectly to this aspect of the film. <br /> <br /> A lovely movie. 8/10. <br /> <br />
