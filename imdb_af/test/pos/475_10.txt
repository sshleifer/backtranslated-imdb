I have a hard time writing words, just how wonderful it was. Once you see a movie that's just with your stick. "You're alone" is that movie (for me). The film is constantly in my head and in my heart. I play the screens spiritually every day and analyze them and go through the emotions again, as if I saw it for the first time. <br /> <br /> There's nothing I don't like about the movie. Amazing soundtrack !!! The end was perfect. Very emotional stir !!! It was compelling and sounding. <br /> <br /> I worshiped Jessica Bohl and her performance was the biggest I ever saw. I admired Britain's power (a strong woman). <br /> <br /> The tagline is "When your darkest moments come to life". We never know what we are capable of doing. Everyone says oh, I will never do it if we really have no idea what we would do in a situation. We are very capable of anything and this movies digging straight into the box. The honesty of the movie can be my absolute favorite. <br /> <br /> Thank you Gorman Becherd for a perfect piece of art !!!!
