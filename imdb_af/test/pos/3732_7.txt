WTF !! Will any of his books / movies end up with a happy ending? The notebook was good ... but she, enough with the printing end. I'm told he is writing about realistic situations that deal with people in real life. Understandable ... but sometimes it's nice to see people who have sacrificed their whole lives just to come to a mediocre unfortunate time in their lives - to finally find the true meaning of happiness for the rest of their days to live out. . Don't we already know what really happens in real life? Can't we - for a moment (one and a half and a half) live alive through a movie ending in a happy note - it gives us hope for our own future? <br /> <br /> Yes - wah. I know. But for actually, I think we should submit movies that like this one end up with a warning. "Beware: No happy ending."
