It pays to watch Reader's Digest. Of Time, if it was the original source of the article that served as a supposed inspiration for Mani Ratnam to make this masterpiece. Based on a true story of an adopted girl looking for her biological parents, Mr Ratnam is a classic that sounds as much as it reproaches, cherishes as much as it chastises and preaches as much as it practices. <br /> <br /> Where does one start? The ominous gloom that precedes fresh strife in northern Sri Lanka? The chaotic household of a family led by a fire engineer author and 3 adorably naughty children? Or that dark area where reality is turning the point to provide a comfortable existence and become a monster of incredible and sinister events and ideologies? Whatever the case, this movie is worth your while, like Mani Ratnam's compelling dramas. <br /> <br /> Mr. Ratnam is a past master in the collection of fictional stories in real-life incidents and in this film he picks up classes to fit two real stories into one. I will not go into the story as it is better seen than reading. But what I will stay with is the impact it has on me and why, for all the warfare that is happening in this world, it cannot destroy the simple, inexhaustible power of hope. <br /> <br /> Innocence, In its purity, the complex desires of adult decadence and greed cannot be satisfied. It also doesn't recognize dangers if it's accompanied by the fierce determination to seek what it wants. It is an innocence of such a nature that Amudha moves to seek her biological parents, despite warnings that they may be lost in the kettle of civil war. Having survived a terrorizing experience just talking to a physically challenged man, realizing that he's a more deadly entity in disguise, Amudha pushes her in a way that tends to resist her good wishes. And finally, when the two meet, mother and daughter, the reunion is so stiff with emotion that even the temperamental adoptive father is reduced to tears. Backed by a corrosive background score from A R Rahman, the following scene is pleasing to even melt the heart: a list of questions that Amudha has to ask her biological mother. At its height, as dramatic as the sequence of incidents, a child discovers his mother alive in the body, but lost in the spirit. With the crushing realization that she had no hope of staying with the one who bore her, Amudha did to her assuming mother who meant the title of this movie: a cock on the cheek. <br /> <br /> As far as the cast is concerned, The The Route has been blown away by the brilliant PS Keerthana. Mr. Ratnam has a gift to take out the spectacular performances of well-known artists, but it should not take anything from Keerthana for an award-winning performance. With a capable supporting film from Madhavan (Thiru), Simran (Indira) and the steaming Nandita Das (Shyama), they decorate the screens in almost every frame she's in. The music may not be as memorable as other Rahman offers, but it still has not stopped him from giving another national award for the best musical direction. "Vellai Pookal" is so much an oath for the need to cherish human life as it is for nature. The dialogue is top-class (sample the touch of Amudha and Indira, shortly after the revelation that she is not Indira's biological daughter) and cinematography, wonderful. <br /> <br /> This film is a clear statement to let arms fall as much as respect human life and expressions. Don't judge it as a lesson in making movies; You will just stand out to experience one of the very best of the Mani Ratnam A R Rahman stable.
