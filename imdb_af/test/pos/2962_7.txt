Having seen Meredith in "Beyond the Prairie", I had to buy another movie staring at her. I can't believe how she dropped herself into this teenage movie. It is better to watch this one with the sound, but concentrate only on Meredith as she moves across the screen. Save your money until the TV network goes out with a DVD on "Beyond the Prairie". It's worth it at any price, this one has to pay you to see. <br /> <br /> This beautiful lady needs someone to put her in a screenplay that can use her talent as an actress and her beauty as a woman. Maybe some of her latest passes, but I didn't see them. She has the smile of a Cathrine Bell and the eyes of Dana Delany with a much younger body. <br /> <br />
