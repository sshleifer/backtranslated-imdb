Two great stars and a legendary director have created a wonderful beating love story that is unforgettable and moving on so many levels. <br /> <br /> Henry King directs Jennifer Jones in her first hit, Song or Bernadette, and directs Jennifer Jones back. this movie and me. Jones is perfect in this role and gives an edgy, beautiful show capturing the conflict in character and Bill Holden who runs home after the house runs in the 1950s, with a series of smash hit movies starting with Sunset Blvd, Stalag 17, born yesterday, Country Girl, picnic, and of course River Kwai is wonderful in this role. To think of anyone other than Holden in this movie, I have the end and weep every time I see it. For anyone who has ever loved and lost, you will understand. For those who don't, you won't.
