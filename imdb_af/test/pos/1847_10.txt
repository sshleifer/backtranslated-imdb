This is one of those movies that contains everything in it. I don't think I'll be tired of seeing it. Hopefully more movies like this will be made in the future. The casting was perfect in all respects. In a sense, the song sung by Engelbert Humperdink, "I never went away", the song came to life. You will definitely laugh at the whole scenario and cry. I'm just surprised that I've never seen it this past weekend. I think it's worth seeing, and your heart will glow. It would be nice to cuddle with your "honey"; soup a cup of hot chocolate and enjoy being in the presence of each other. There is so much heart and emotion at times that you honestly know, not where to turn. You will know exactly how the character feels. True family expression is completely available. In fact, sometimes you will even think you are part of that family or they are part of yours. See it!
