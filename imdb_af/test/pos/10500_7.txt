Thanks The FilmZone for showing this messy soft core sex flick at 1am. I really enjoyed it. To be honest, I expected a lot more from a sexy cast with McKayla, Dru Berrymore, and of course the talented Chloe Nicholle (as Rebecca Carter). <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are really bad, mainly due to the low budget, but a little more effort, won't hurt. For example, cinematography makes it like a hard core porn movie. There is absolutely no effort in lightning. But let's ignore it, because let's face it, we've looked at "Pleasures of Sin" because of the high amount of sex. <br /> <br /> The sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy, explicit scenes. Chole Nicholle delivers the best performance of the female cast. <br /> <br /> So my advice is, look at this movie if you're in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch if you are a fan of Mrs. Nicholle is. . <br /> <br /> Recommended for the sex scene only; Don't expect anything else.
