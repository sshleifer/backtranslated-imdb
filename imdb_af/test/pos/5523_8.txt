Haha, what a great little movie! Wayne Crawford stops again, or rather it's his first big strike, a surprisingly entertaining little ball manic kitsch energy that is a psycho-killer movie. It is actually a ** brilliant ** satire on the American hippie culture in the airport, although the film is filmed independently in Miami. It makes any kind of studio-oriented convention or plot device I can think of: SOMETIMES NIGHT MARTHA DRY THINGS MUST NOT BE A VERY technically sophisticated movie, but it is a wonderful little piece of Americana made on the cheapest by people that is honest, ambitious, imaginative and made balls of steel. It took guts, nerve and lust to make this movie, which is incredibly testing the time. This movie is fresh, lively, lively, memorable and rare to recommend just about anyone with a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I dug in a period last year when I was fascinated by "star" Wayne Crawford (photographed under his pseudonym Scott Lawrence), a maestro of only local filmmaking, usually of the B degree. He is a writer, producer, director and actor, all in one, probably known for Comet's 80-year-old favorite Apocalyptic night. Here he plays Stanley, the pants carry half of some really wonderful characters, apparently homosexual trotters on the lamb, after slapping an old lady in Baltimore for her jewels. Unsung screen legend Abe Zwick is quite convincing like Paul, who is like Stanley's aunt Martha, the cross-bandage of the outfit, which Stanley condemned to think he had committed a murder to ensure his loyalty. Martha looks about as feminine as the sailors of SOUTH PACIFIC's supportive choir in their coconut bikini tops, but somehow it looks like no one has noticed - or cares? - Being a man, has no visible means of income, seems to be spreading all day where Stanley is, and scarce in her bathrobe with a butcher's knife. Just in America ... <br /> <br /> While the movie opens, the two of them just arrived in Florida and live in what looks like Ward Cleaver's old house, a garishly lit-and-design television house that is so clich√© as surrealistic. During an unforgettable scene, Martha and an unwelcome house guest sit on the couch, talk about problems and drink cans of Budweiser, which is one of the most stunning, subversive rows I've ever seen outside of a John Waters movie. Then there's Stanley, who always gets in trouble, because he's a mulberry with a STP cloth on his jacket that runs a psychedelic painted bus, which is as subtle as the Batmobile, drinking his milk straight out of the cardboard. , snort drugs with blonde bimbos, and throw donuts in an old cigar box for a quick snack. Attract contradictions, I think. <br /> <br /> But Stanley also has a point not to find it if the young ladies he gets are stoned trying to remove his pants, and it always looks like Martha is about to. get him out of the trouble that necessarily results. The bodies jump up, a nosy junkie suffocates them to use their home as a flop, Stanley's birthday cake is knocked down. Everyone meets at the local pizza shop before going to the wood shed for a hookah hash party where the girls dance in their underwear. Things get out of hand when one of the neighbors gets a little disgusting with Martha, who obviously prefers to keep people at arm's length when they invite themselves to a nice chat. And it is a woman who not only carries a butcher's knife, but a loaded .38 in her slip. Eventually, the strange duo find themselves trapped with a body, a baby, and no place to go, and finally retreat to an abandoned movie studio where the technical staff will surely borrow the equipment used to make the film. I just hope they are kindly asked for permission and only cleaned after themselves. <br /> <br /> Of course, a word has to be said about Stanley and Martha / Paul's relationship, as they dance to the fact that the two would at least be suggested to be a homosexual couple. to miss the primary core of the plot. We never see the two of them become intimate, and even though Stanley allegedly refers to "balled" in one scene, their relationship is more symbiotic than sexual. This is definitely not a "gay" movie, with an abundant female nudity and an air of 70s misogyny that cannot be denied either. Stanley and Paul never sustained their implied sexuality on the screen, though the movie would have been definitely worth doing if it was important. It's not, the story isn't about their sex, it's about the band they share, and how weird it is. Not they are gay, but they are the individual individuals they are, which are two of the strangest movie creations ever in my TV set. <br /> <br /> The movie is unique. It's made for just a few thousand bucks that look like borrowed studio sets, the event path, and a few public places they've managed to sneak into a camera team when no one looks at them. The dialogue is completely bizarre, commonplace and deliciously esoteric. It's a movie that will surprise you, not everyone will like it, but for those with a low budget. American horror / thrillers like THE NIGHT GOD SCREAMED, HELP ME! I HAVE BEEN BLOOD & LACE AND CHILDREN DO NOT PLAY WITH DEATH. You have a winner here. <br /> <br /> 8/10: Usually I want to say something: "Earn a DVD Recovery" but somehow I think it will ruin the movie's sticky atmosphere. And Wayne Crawford, you, sir, govern.
