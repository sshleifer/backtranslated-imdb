Better than the original, Gamers: Dorkness Rising manages a funny comedy with good acting, fine special effects and comedy that exceeds the "gamer" knowledge base and does it on a low budget. I saw many low-budget movies that were terrible and almost nothing that were as good as their high-budget counterparts. This movie blows away most mainstream movies! Parts are slightly weak (the bit with the pirates and ninjas while it's funny - go a little long without explanation and take you a bit out of the movie), but it's generally a very strong movie. <br /> <br /> I am delighted to say that I bought this movie as soon as I saw it and brought it home. <br /> <br /> Any chance we look forward to another Gamers movie feature of these guys? :)
