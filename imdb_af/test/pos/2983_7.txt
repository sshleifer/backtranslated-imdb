I was in my mid-teens when I saw this movie, and I was struck by the beauty of the young stars, as well as the loving film art and the simple sweetness of the story. It surprises me to know that Alvina has recently died, and that Bury did not work for nearly 30 years in the film industry, and that both would be in their 50s. <br /> <br /> The Elton John soundtrack is incredibly beautiful and supports the air of protected innocence that the characters experience in isolation. I saw the movie poster and bought it as "Deux Enfants Quis'Aiment", which believes something like "Two Children Who Love Each Other". The English distributors were wise to shorten the title! <br /> <br /> Paul, the ignored 15-year-old son of an English businessman living in Paris, meets Michelle, an orphan, at the zoo. The two take what they plan as a day-long vacation to Michelle's father's country house, but stay there for a year, apart from the outside world. They fall in love, Michelle gets pregnant and they have the baby alone at home. After the baby's birth, the police came to Paul's workplace and took him away. <br /> <br /> "Blue Lagoon" appears as another movie that protects the theme of innocence protected in a secluded paradise. So sad that "Friends" has never been released on DVD.
