All right, it was just brilliant. I wish the rest of Season 1 was so strong. It really needed more episodes like this. <br /> <br /> The team worked perfectly, though they were all in the day. Writing was fantastic and so was the editing. Great work in all accounts. <br /> <br /> The episode was exciting, exciting and just keeping you to the end. What's most MOTW episodes have tried but failed so far. <br /> <br /> The first FIVE star episode for me. Really good, almost like a movie. I didn't even remember it being so good. I think it's even better than the big horror movie called 'The Thing'.
