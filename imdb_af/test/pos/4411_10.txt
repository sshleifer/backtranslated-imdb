"Meat" is difficult to describe with a solid summary because, well, there is basically no plot. The movie just shows the day in the life of a hustler named Joe (Joe Dallesandro, who is in the underrated Louis Malle picture "Black Moon"), as he makes his laps, sleeps and modifies to pay cash. for his wife's lover's abortion. <br /> <br /> Not much, and since the movie is quite a long nine and nineteen minute, you'd think "Meat" would be a slow and boring half an hour. You think wrong. The film consists of improv, no screenplay and the corners of the film are also beautiful on the spot, but there is a kind of truth under each frame that gives the movie its demented entertaining vitality. Everything makes sense and serves purpose that happens to Joe in this one day. He meets a regular John who stays clear when he says he wants to see Joe again, a photographer who speaks so much that aggravates Joe's tears, two drag queens reading tabloid magazines, as Joe heads a mute voice addict who later mumbles on how she wants to get a breast light, an old friend of Joe reading male rape stories to him, and then a final scene with his wife and her lover who frankly hit the scene at the beginning of the movie (one some of the best openings for a movie I've seen for some time)? and tells what the film is about philosophically. <br /> <br /> It's amazing how the movie's messages and styles feel almost timeless, though in reality in the 1960s, New York City is filmed and filmed like a clear independent movie from that era. It's certainly not a movie that can be made today, which adds to its glorious mysticism. <br /> <br /> Branded by unexpected jumping cuts; and absent a score to promote his images ?? "Meat" is about as raw, eager as a film about male prostitution in the 60's.
