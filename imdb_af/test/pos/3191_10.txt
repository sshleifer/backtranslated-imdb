Can't believe it. After all these years it finally found. It was meant to be called 'The Great Pretender' in the production stage. I was on time in Oz and through a friend, I was looking for one of the home locations by filming .... It was I who showed these guys how to speak Scottish and after all this I realized just one was Russell Crowe !!! It has taken me all the years to find it, was even uncertain whether it ever went screen when I left Oz the next month to the wrap-up party. At that stage Russell Crowe was not the requested actor. He is now and I had no idea it was him until I saw the previous comment. Then I thought of the days of filming ..... incredible ... Lots of myself now! !!
