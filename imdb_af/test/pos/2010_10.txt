Jesse returns, after almost twelve months of hype about his emerging production, eventually reaching the dark world of the Internet with more than a brilliant approach to amateur filmmaking. <br /> <br /> DBP is an original, nail-biting commentary on an upset child who grows into an even more troubled adult. If I had more than two inches, I'd give more, but I think two will be enough. <br /> <br /> Great work by all cast, especially by Marissa and Elizabeth, gave Emily the character as an adult I shake so far and I'm scared of where she goes next. <br /> <br /> An excellent watch
