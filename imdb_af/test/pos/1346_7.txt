I saw this night in Fort Lauderdale. Overall it was funny and I liked the characters especially Sabrina. The play is good and the story line was OK, except for the end that ran away to many strings that strangled and we were like (what?) I wanted to know what happened to the characters and that was a strange end to it could have done much better. <br /> <br /> The film depicted, arranges life very well and we laughed throughout. It has some mistakes, but for a first time movie for Ash Christian I thought it was good. You may be waiting on this DVD for the DVD. But if you get the chance to see it, give it a chance
