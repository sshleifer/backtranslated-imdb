This film has just won the best movie award at the Cleveland International Film Festival. It is American title apparently autumn spring. The acting is wonderful. The story brings you into the life of an elderly man who takes what life handles and spits it up a bit. Through his best friend (and partner in a not-so-serious crime) he keeps people on every occasion, but he often reveals his heart of gold. His long-suffering wife came to a standstill and made a life-changing decision that was heartbreaking to watch. The resolution of the story is beautiful.
