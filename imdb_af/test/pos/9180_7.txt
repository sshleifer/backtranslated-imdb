Looking at romantic comedies, one knows what to expect; We have seen many of them over many years to know how they are going. There is a formula, one that almost always becomes movies that becomes popular with the genre's audience ... not always in proportion to their real quality. How to play with it and create something more interesting? This movie has a suggestion ... and it works relatively well. Instead of simply following a lead, we follow him to help the unfortunate men, who lack the attractive facade, to reveal the unhealthy good qualities they possess to the women they fall in love with. The plot follows Smith as he works on his self-declared most difficult case; Kevin James. In addition to his help from James, we also follow Mendes, who is full of men who are nice to get what they want (one particular scene that greatly respects Smith's character is that he meets for a while and enters him Place his place.) After seeing Smith helping James, we see him with Mendes. And in spite of his talent to help others, he makes ... bad with her. Making a wonderful point about love, and how to fall in love, affects us. For a romantic comedy, it mostly avoids the pitfalls of such (sometimes almost a ghost of the genre), although the last few scenes have the sweetness and emotions of these types of movies. Whether or not they follow the formula will not be revealed in this review. The pass is pretty good, it never really touches slow and rarely moves too fast. The acting is great, as far as pretty much everyone goes. The characters are well developed and come out as real people. The humor doesn't always work ... there are occasionally gags that are performed less than happily, and one or two jokes that seem to be forced. For the most part, however, the film was funny. I recommend it to anyone who loves romantic comedies and anyone who is in love or in love. Those who do not believe in love will have a difficult time with the last few scenes. 10/07
