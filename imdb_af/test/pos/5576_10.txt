I like this show. It is a refreshing approach to older scientific facts and styles. They are not afraid to shoot, and when they do, people tend to die. Too many shows are scared of this and just end up with the guns and then it's an expectation. Farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters. They all grow up on you to the point where it confuses you to hear that they are discussing some of the animatronic kids from their box to make the mini series. From start to finish, farscape gives you a sense of hope and rejection, as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die every time. Keep a watch even if you don't have the time.
