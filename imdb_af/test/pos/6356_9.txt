This film is an excellent example of what an independent film can be. The director does an excellent job of managing the line between emotional and physical violence. But in the end he remembers forgetting so many indie films - he tells a good story. Looking at this movie, I was reminded of how slim and everyday Hollywood movies really grew. <br /> <br /> Particularly noteworthy is a particularly strong performance by starring the movie - Jorge Cordova. As a disgraceful thief (heading to the top of the crime heap), Cordova plays a furious, brutal, conceited, devastating and messy S.O.B. <br /> <br /> I read somewhere that these guys were part of the New Wave or Latino Filmmakers in Los Angeles - La Nueva Obra, or something. Anyway, this movie makes you look forward to seeing more of their work. <br /> <br />
