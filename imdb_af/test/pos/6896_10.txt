This movie was very funny with just a little gore. It's about two tomb robbers who usually do business if they discover that there is another client who can serve them. It changes the direction of the bodies they collect. The film is told by the younger of the two, as he explains the business to a priest before being sent to be beheaded. His mate was already beheaded. The priest must confess the last confession and it takes the form of a story. There are some animations cast in which it gives a Tales From the Crypt feel. In the story we meet another group of digging robbers who fear everyone, but at one point the younger of the two is being offered a job, so it is based on the hostility between the groups. When a woman joins the two men, she bumps her boundaries and gets in trouble with the dreaded grave robbers. The story leads to the meeting of the two groups, which led to the arrest of the man who confessed and the man who had already lost his head.
