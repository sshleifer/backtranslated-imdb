John Carpenter's "The Thing" is undoubtedly one of the best horror movies ever made. Unfortunately, as with most Carpenter movies, it is also one of the most underrated films that critics put briefly, and it's almost pathetic. It seems that people were overwhelmed by the idea of ​​"good" alien then. An idea arose after the success of "I.T.". And the idea that a movie dealing with strangers deviates from this idea is considered heresy. Human ignorance is really a frightening thing, people have to judge movies for what they are not for what they want them to be. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" itself is an interesting study of human paranoia as members of an American Antarctic base discover the presence of an alien being (referring throughout the movie as a "thing") what can imitate any form of life. If we don't know who the creature is or may be, we see how each character responds to the situation. There is no mass hysteria or panic, just a slow and gradual descent into chaos, as more and more people seem to be ... not quite human. <br /> <br /> Author succeeds in elevating this movie to something higher than your average sci-fi / horror. There is no "behind you?" jump moments here. Instead, relying on an intense atmosphere of distrust and pre-apocalyptic despair, along with some nicely balanced moments of visual terror, with no small thanks to Rob Bottin's impressive creatures, gives us an experience that not matched by many other horror movies. <br /> <br /> Instead of just throwing facts and plate elements on our face, Carpenter offers us a very gradual and delicate approach. By giving a mystery, he gives the viewer enough freedom to interpret what appeared in certain scenes while giving enough plot to those who do not love interpretation in movies. <br /> <br /> Ennio Morricone's score works completely. It's minimalist and depressed sound fits perfectly with the movie's overall tone. Although I always wondered how it would sound like Carpenter (he did all his films' OSTs except that one composed)? Characters, while not deeply developed, remain unforgettable thanks to the good performances of the actors, especially Kurt Russel, who is the "down-out" patic helicopter pilot R.J. Macready. It is remarkable how his character changes through the film. From his contemptuous "don't give a ...." attitude in the beginning, to that of a united and leader of the group of men trying to fight the thing. But even with that said, there is no fake heroism here, there is no "laugh in the face of death" moments and there is definitely no kind of comic relief, the movie holds its atmosphere from the very first scene to the last. Of whom, Carpenter, holds his tradition again to make a powerful end. <br /> <br /> Quarter of a century after its release "The Thing" doesn't feel dated. And with the disturbing increasing use of computer-generated effects, it feels even stronger than before because it doesn't show life's work and dedication to people's computers. Combined with its openness to analysis, it gives the viewer many more reasons to watch it for a second or third or fourth or ... time. A masterpiece of terror that will never be forgotten.
