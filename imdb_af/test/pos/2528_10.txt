I was originally from Brazil ... the sad thing about this movie was the exploitation done to that boy. They told his life story and he never got a "centavo" (Brazilian cent) from that movie. Fernando is not the first and will not be the last to go through the lifestyle in Brazil. Sad ... but this is the world we live in. It's about making money that doesn't save lives. Question is: Where is Fernando today? Most likely ... dead. We tend to want to live in this "Disney-filled fantasy curved life". When someone comes to the board to help ... the higher power comes and says, "What do I get from this? Where's my cut?" - I wish people's conscience would emerge!
