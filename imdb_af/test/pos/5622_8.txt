Chris Smith is an excellent filmmaker with the rare talent to mock a good story and then eliminate hell. Smith's "American Movie" is the true-to-life record of filmmaker Wannabe Mark Borchardt, a looser intent to milk his elderly uncle for cash to complete his horror. But never, under no circumstances, to earn earnings, or to support the children he invented. <br /> <br /> It is producer Smith's skill that Mark looks more sympathetic than otherwise. Even if he attracts Uncle Bill with sweets and executive producer credits, it is his despair to be someone, named Scorsese and Spielberg. <br /> <br /> "American Movie" also belongs to those scarce, often attempted, but rarely subgenre, successfully reconciled with horror. The humor comes from Borchardt's Ed Wood style belief in his own genius. From his terrible efforts to act, he replaces his less-than-friendly mom for a missing cameraman and some of his working sweet but brain-damaged friend Mike when he is short of an actor or crew member. <br /> <br /> The horror comes from what Borchardt cannot see: it is this very American attitude - I want to, therefore I am entitled - it likes him not only to see how much he needs over his chosen craft do not learn. He is so confident that he cannot fail to guarantee failure.
