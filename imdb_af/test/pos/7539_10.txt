Alistair Simm's inspired depiction of me. Fritton surpassed wearing. This is one of the great comedy characters in film. Just as wonderful is Joyce Grenfell's character - Ruby Gates. <br /> <br /> It is a movie that you have to curl up on the sofa on a wet Sunday afternoon and after a while be transported when it is frightening We have received our respect - not our ire! I hear a remake with Rupert Everett as Mrs. Fritton being let down? He's going to compete hard with the master - or should it be mistress? - Alistair Simms. <br /> <br /> Go and rent it - it beats as much as what's going on for comedy today.
