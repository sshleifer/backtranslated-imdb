I drew it as a teenager in the mid 80's, based on the synopsis in the cable guide (the scavenger hunting aspect addressed me), without the knowledge or expectations of the movie. what a pleasant surprise when I looked at it! It was such a fun movie and I remember remembering to watch it repeatedly. I thought the concept was well executed, I enjoyed the harmless competition between the different groups, and I thought the scraper hunt itself was pretty clever. Sometimes people seem to have too many expectations for movies. Not all movies will have a weighty "message" or stars acting, production values ​​or special effects. Sometimes movies are just meant to be fun and fun, and this one passes on both levels. It was so nice to read the comments of the actors who played the twins. I haven't seen this movie in years, but if I thought, I'd just as warmly and enthusiastically respond to it as I did as a teenager. Even if I type it, snippets of the cheesy suitable theme song run by my head: "When midnight madness starts to get you, no matter what you say, it doesn't matter what you do ...!"
