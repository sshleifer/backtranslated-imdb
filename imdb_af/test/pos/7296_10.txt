<br /> <br /> When I undoubtedly rented a thousand hectares, I thought I was in an entertaining King Lear story and of course Michelle Pfeiffer was in it, so what can go wrong? <br /> <br /> Very quickly, however, I realized that this story is about a Thousand Other Things, except just Acres. I started crying and couldn't stop until long after the movie ended. Thanks Jane, Laura and Jocelyn for bringing us such a wonderful subtle and compassionate movie! Thank you for throwing, being involved and portraying the characters with such depth and gentleness! <br /> <br /> I recognized the Angry sister; the runaway sister and the sister in denial. I recognized the abuse and why he was there and then the Father, oh, oh the Father ... all played excellently. I also acknowledged myself and this movie was an eye-opening, a relief, a chance to confront my own truth and eventually do something about it. I really hope that a Thousand Acres had the same effect on other people there. <br /> <br /> Since I didn't understand why the cover said the movie was about sisters fighting over land, they didn't fight each one. Others, I watched it a second time. Then I could see that if one didn't have a similar story, the overwhelming undercurrent of fear and fear and the deep connection between the sisters walking through it would easily be missed. This is precisely why people generally overlook the truth about their neighbors. <br /> <br /> Yet another reason why this movie is so perfect! <br /> <br /> I don't give a rat's ass (forgive me French) how the King Lear story is followed. All I know is that I can honestly say: this movie has changed my life. <br /> <br /> Keep up the good work guys, you can and make a difference. <br /> <br />
