I watched this episode many times, because I didn't find out how Prue died. That's what happened. Prue, Piper and Phoebe try to rescue them innocently, a doctor, because Shax wants to kill him. Phoebe goes upstairs to look in The Book of Shadows while protecting Prue and Piper their innocent protection. Shax appears while Phoebe is still up, so Shax throws an energy ball at the doctor, but Prue pushes him out of the way and Prue gets in the chest and hits the wall, the same with Piper. So Phoebe came down and said the game, as it was only Phoebe who said it and the power of three Shax had just been wounded. Phoebes calls Leo to heal Piper and Prue. Leo then heals them. Phoebe went to the Underworld to find Cole, while Prue and Piper were looking for Shax in the streets. Piper and Prue see Shax and Piper using her power to blow up Shax, meanwhile, a new reporter has all got in touch. So it's all about the new three powerful Halliwell sisters, and Phoebe knows nothing because she's still in the Underworld. There are Repoters and people across the Halliwell House. Then a maniac comes in and says, "Can I be part of your covenant?" and Prue says, "No, this is our home that gets away!" and Prue uses her powers to throw her out. As the maniac cries out of the house and says, "There are witches". The maniac gets so crazy that she shoots Piper right through the stomach. Prue gets into her car and bakkies to go to the hospital, but people will not allow her, so Prue uses her powers to move people out of the way so people want to kill her more. They came to the hospital, but Piper didn't make it. Phoebe is in the underworld. Phebe thinks they're exposed, and Phoebe asks Cole to ask the source if he can stop the time. The source says he will only stop once Phoebe promises to stay in The Underworld, so Cole told Phoebe what the source told him. Phoebe says, "What will make him think I'll make such a deal?" and then Cole says: "So you can save one of your sisters' lives." Leo goes to the hospital to find out the Piper is really dead, and he tells Phoebe it's true. Then Phoebe agrees to stay alone if Cole goes back to warn Piper and Prue about the exhibitor and Piper's death. Back to hospital SWAT is about to shoot Prue, but the second before their time is returned when they were at the doctor's doctor, but Phoebe was not there to call Leo to cure Prue and Piper. The doctor also gets in the wall. The doctor died and also Prue. But that's what I didn't get, if Piper threw it on the wall, how did it just kill Prue? Why didn't they show that Leo came and healed Piper and Leo to heal Prue? If you know the answer, please email me at angelpuss924@yahoo.com PS. I miss Prue, but I also like Paige and I'm glad the performance continued
