Don't watch this movie that Jane Austen expects, a sharp dialogue or smart social commentary. This time, the starting point of Northanger Abbey has been updated in a very sensual way! <br /> <br /> In this version, Catherine's erotic daydreams are not only stupid fantasies, but a commitment to the world of sexual sexuality that she just engages with her daylight adventures. By the day she is very prim and demure, and her swain Henry treats her with the greatest courtesy. But as her own sexual nature wakes up, her daydreams move each one so subtly from soft to steamy to furious! <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the story, Katrina's faces of sex are entirely based on the Gothic novels she digests in bed. It's both heart-warming, sexy, and challenging to consider the way her dreamy picture of attractive Henry "solves" in a lurking dream of being captured and conquered by romantic villains! At the same time, it is furious and takes to cut to bed in the morning. Catherine who sleeps peacefully, looks so innocent that one will never guess what really goes in that beautiful cup! <br /> <br /> Later, after being invited to Henry's castle, Catherine dominates a family argument and misses his meaning completely. She jumped into bed, she covered her with the bedclothes and lay awake, listening awfully, her striking blue eyes being the only visible sign she was vigilant. However, the bones of blue eyes immediately fall as they drift into another heated dream of innocent desire. This time, Catherine dreams, she is in Elizabethan time and is waiting terribly outside the castle for the approach of the "banditi!" It is quite clear that she is more excited than afraid of the thought that he should be conveyed by bandits. She screams everything with excitement and anticipation! But then, after a shot of her running to escape, we're back to the daylight world where the girl scolds her for a mess of her room before falling into a healthy sleep. It is noteworthy that Catherine's heavy eye in the morning light herself is a very sensual symbol of how passionate her dreams are! <br /> <br /> Finally, of course, Catherine's strict and imaginative lover Henry distinguishes the nature of her fantasies and gives her a rigorous reading. Interestingly, Catherine's immediate collapse in tears does not symbolize a retreat, but an advance in adult relationships. In the next scene, she burned her Gothic romance glowingly and shamed herself and sneaked on the bed. This turning point is also significant that Catherine falls into a deep sleep - except that this time there is no dream to make passion believe. Katherine Schlesinger was thought to be pretty good enough to be ready for the right thing. <br /> <br /> Although Katherine Schlesinger has beautiful blue eyes and a lively expression, and all her performance is charming, it must be said that beyond the heated dream series this movie adaptation is extremely boring. I give it only 9 stars because the real romantic can enjoy it on a daydreaming level. <br /> <br /> If you want to read a book about a really strong savage heroine who overcomes the true darkness in a true Gothic environment, I recommend the PERILOUS GARD by Elizabeth Marie Pope.
