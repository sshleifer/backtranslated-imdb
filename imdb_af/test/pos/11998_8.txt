It is without a doubt one of my favorite Columbo episodes ever. The play is very well done, the music is very catchy, the writing is ingenious and the direction is fantastic. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk, who plays brilliantly in every Columbo episode, works especially well in this episode. <br /> <br /> Also the performances of Stephen Caffrey, Gary Hershberger, Alan Fudge and Robert Culp. <br /> <br /> The end is absolutely brilliant and I like the way Columbo describes it. <br /> <br /> It's a Columbo movie that won't go.
