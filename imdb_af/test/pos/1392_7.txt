Lt. Claude (Claudio Cassinelli) and several prisoners of his sunken ship were on an island owned by Edmond Rackham (Richard Johnson). Following some random prisoner deaths, Rackham takes Claude and his two remaining prisoners. Fortunately for everyone, Barbara Bach also happens on the island! Unfortunately, there are some crazy fishermen who want to kill people. <br /> <br /> This Italian-made inventor looks like it's all - a touch of CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON mixed with DR. MOREAU with a little white WHITE ZOMBIE voodoo and Atlantis stuff. In spite of some shaky fisherman costumes, the movie benefits from a beautiful location photo and a fine twist to halfway through. All the actors are good and Joseph Cotton even comes up as an old biologist. Director Sergio Martino handles himself well enough as there is ever 10 minutes of action taking place. This cannot be said for his outdated succession THE FISHMEN AND THEIR QUEEN (1995), but one of the wackiest and most basic successors since HIGHLANDER II.
