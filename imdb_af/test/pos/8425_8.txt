Despite the fact that this production has received a number of poor reviews, it's actually pretty good for its age. Also note that this is not a BBC program, it was simply licensed to them by Granada Ventures when the Jane Austen collection was released on DVD. <br /> <br /> So, how does it compare with other adaptations of the same novel? The best-known version of these days is the 1995 film featuring Amanda Root as Anne Elliott and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Frederick Wentworth. The film was of course shorter, but a good picture of the story. The previous version, with Ann Firbank and Bryan Marshall in the same roles, has four hours to tell the story and move in a more quiet pace. <br /> <br /> Firbank is a good ten years old for her role, but she's very good. Marshall is excellent as Wentworth, a man who is disappointed in love and bitter about interference. And hidden in the throw are people who also contribute - Michael Culver, who is later seen in Cadfael, like Harvill; Richard Vernon, later seen in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Milky Way, as Admiral Croft; Noel Dyson, earlier in Coronation Street, as Mrs. Musgrove. <br /> <br /> One criticism I have is that the hairstyles are a bit distracting and the costumes are awful! However, this should not detract from a very pleasant Austen adjustment.
