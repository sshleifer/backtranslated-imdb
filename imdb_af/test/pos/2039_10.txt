This is one of the best action movies I've seen. Geena's portrayal of the difficult nails, 'Charly' / a gentle mom, Sam, was fantastic and Samuel L Jackson just keeps you completely, with his classic one liners. Certainly, there were a few holes in the real story, but this quick movie keeps you on the edge of your chair to the end. <br /> <br /> I felt Geena was a perfect choice for the role of Sam / Charly and her versatility as an actress is obvious to her role as the mother in the recent movie "Stuart Little". Both Samuel and Geena were well supported by David Morse, Brian Cox, lovely little Yvonne Zima and newcomers, sexy Craig Bierko, and Melina Kanakaredes. This film highlights the growing trend of strong female character and the derivation of traditional male / female stereotypes, as we see that Sam / Charly (Davis) and Mitch (Jackson) injured from one disaster to the next. <br /> <br /> While I and many others loved this movie, it is fair to say that there will always be people who do not and that is good - each for their own. I recommend this movie to action fans, for its hilarious scenes and quick action.
