Ken Loach showed the world the swaying London with Weak Cow, about London's female Joy (Carol White), who stuck with a thief and had a boy with him, just to see the man end. the slumber. While his friend (Terence Stamp) enables her to help her, he is a little better at being a loser. It soon became clear that she had to make a serious decision about where she was going in her life. <br /> <br /> One thing I determined - I don't know if it's accurate or not. was a use of irony in the movie. Her name is Joy, but she does not experience any joy in her life. Even if it's not intended, it's still a movie I recommend to everyone. With songs by Donovan (one of which - "Colors" - appears in another Terence Stamp movie: "The Limey" (which came out in 1999 when I was as old as my parents were when "Poor Cow" came out) .)).
