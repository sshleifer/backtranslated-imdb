Like many other commentators here, I went to expect a taste of music that would satisfy my curiosity - and more than I asked. I heard and saw a powerful, beautiful, sometimes haunting, sometimes touching, lyrical, sentimental (in the right way) and absolutely beautiful mix of music and musicians. Remind me many of the forms of Indian music (East Indian), but at the same time it was very different. <br /> <br /> From the first run by Baba Zula to the Kurdish singer Aynur (who has a voice) Siyasiyabend after the jam session (or 'Jugalbandhi' as we call it in India) in the small Turkish bar. Selim Seslar (Great fan now), I enjoyed every minute and didn't want to end it. /> <br /> One of the best music commentaries I've seen and heard long ago. <br /> <br /> I'm looking for a CD of the soundtrack and hope I can find it online soon and also for old and latest albums by Baba Zula. <br /> <br /> A day later, the music is still etched in my brain and I don't want it to get away. Turkey and specifically Istanbul now look so beautiful and exciting places - and I'm going to start saving today to take it. <br /> <br /> Believe Akin - this is a gem.
