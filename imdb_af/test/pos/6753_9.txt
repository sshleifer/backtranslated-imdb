I agree with most of Mr Rivera's remarks, and I just want to add a few reservations. This film, "The Mascot" is being criminally neglected in its present form. For the case, so is "Vampyr". "The Mascot" is not a "bonus feature" - it is reported as a chapter in "Vampyr". Although it is made very clear that it is a separate movie, it must be handled by the manufacturers as such. And while I think about it, "Vampyr" also needs the same respect and cleaning. I have the feeling that the decision to put The Mascot in there has gone like this. <br /> <br /> Dude A: "We just transferred Vampyr to DVD, but it comes about 20 minutes short. We need to put something on it that doesn't cost much money. talking movies! "Dude B:" Don't worry. I have this little animation thing that has been put in my drawer. Go ahead and throw it up as an additional chapter. "Dude A:" You're fantastic, Dude B "The Mascot's animation is great, and I don't have to repeat what Mr. Rivera did so well. However, this thing needs some major cleaning and repair, especially the sound. The plot comes through in the dialogue. And in my copy there were so many lifts, pops and places where the sound just settled down (I would have had no idea what the dog was after without reading the box.) No amount of volume would make the words more understandable not, it just brought up the ignorance and made the lifts and pops. <br /> <br /> Bottom line is: Starewicz's films must be placed in a respectable collection, cleaned, spiffed up, liner notes and the entire nine meters. In other words, they must be 9 selected for 10 for the movie, not the product that would only get a 5.
