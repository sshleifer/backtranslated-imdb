Bergman's Shame is one of the most realistic depictions of the war ever set for film. It is not an action movie, although the pacing is faster and there is more action than in most other Bergman movies. It's also not a romanticization of war or patriotism, unlike most war films. In fact, the eager realism and the deliberate ambiguity of the character's loyalty have a very contemporary feel. <br /> <br /> Shame is a dark light movie, which has to be watched at night, to make it work, it's magic. Many of the effects are transmitted indirectly, but so effectively that some scenes compete in intensity for a contemporary, crazy-sized movie such as Spy Private Ryan. Of course, the scam action is on a much smaller scale, but it's impressive. No one less. <br /> <br /> Whilst the movie style feels unique, the setting of the movie feels timeless and fluffy. The war-torn countryside, and even the still unknown provincial hamlet, can be anywhere, anywhere. And this film is not so much about specific historical events, with specific names and dates, but about universal human reactions to adversity and chaos. <br /> <br /> The play in Shame, which is typically impressive by Ullman and Sydow, is not of primary importance in this movie, as opposed to most other Bergman movies. By much of the movie, they are spectators, as much as we are. Bergman imposed the war on them, and by their hearing, and their reaction is perhaps what any of our reactions would be possible. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 10/10
