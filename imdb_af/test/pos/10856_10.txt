Of the top 24 lesbian movies in my library, I have to rate this one as the number one movie of all time. This film goes down in history as the best in its genre. It is a story about a girl (Rachael Stirling) who goes from wealth to patches and from rags to wealth, with her first love (Keeley Hawes) jumping in and out of her life. It is set against a Victorian backdrop in the 1890s, making it the ideal venue for the best entertainment in the industry. This movie did not save any cost to music and costumes, and the makeup Rachael and Keeley wore while adding to the film's diversity on stage in the halls. <br /> <br /> No matter what kind of movies you have favored, I can assure you that this movie doesn't just surprise you but keeps your attention through all three episodes. This movie is played and enjoyed for decades to come. The unrated DVD collector's version is a must have for anyone's library. Rachael Stirling and Keeley Hawes were the best choice for the decisive role in these two roles, and they played very well.
