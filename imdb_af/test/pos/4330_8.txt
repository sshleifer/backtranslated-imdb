This is probably the second best of the Death Wish movies. Death Wish 5 is the best. <br /> <br /> Death Wish 3 reminds me of "West Side Story" with a new twist. Not even the recent movie "Gangs of New York" can measure with a New York neighborhood in Death Wish 3 that is not harassed by two competing gangs - but one big gang. A gang who is willing to do things like killing a person with an ax when he breaks his set. <br /> <br /> Deborah Raffin, who plays a public defender, plays softly in this action-packed movie filled with a lot of shooting-em-up violence. So, like Geri Nichols in Death Wish II, Death Wish III scores with his soft, romantic moments as well as his violent moments. Only the James Bond love interests will do much better. <br /> <br /> In addition to his .38 Kersee with this new rifle plays the Wildey .475 Magnum. It reminded me of the Dirty Harry movies when Callahan used his .44 Magnum in Magnum Force, Sudden Impact and Dirty Harry. The Wildey rifle packs a big punch and when Kersey kills it, he doesn't care if the rifle has a big kick in it. <br /> <br /> And that antitank missile that killed the chief gang leader? Well, that's something. Kersey would not use an antitank missile if she used regular vigilante weapon .... it was too military for him.
