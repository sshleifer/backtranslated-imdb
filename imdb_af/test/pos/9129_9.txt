Just as in Rififi, the most compelling scene in the movie is the perfect silence of the jewel lift. The scene is masterful in its performance, each of the robbers having their own specialized work to perform. Each one combines their own unique talent to the goal, and each one up to a month earlier, completes strangers. <br /> <br /> Many of the scenes are playing very slowly. In fact, the opening scene is a long-term introduction to Corey and Vogel, as we see Corey being released from prison and Vogel escaping on his way to prison. The two characters are then methodically brought together at a paddock, such as Bird hiding in the drum of Corey's car. From this unlikely burglary, the two strangers come together to become partners to commit a perfect and precise jewel cage. <br /> <br /> However, to pull this lift, they must include the help of a third man called Jansen. Jansen is hired as the gunman. His inclusion in the mix was an interesting and desperate choice. At the time of his rental, Jansen is in full battle with DT's and spends most of his day on his cot which hallucines lizards, snakes and spiders. His transition from the staggering and hallucinating world of a William S. Burroughs dream into the steady hand and soberly sharp shooter is a very fast and perhaps the only true fake moment of the movie, but it's just me that is very picky. <Br /> <br /> Another light false note was that of police inspector Mattei. Sometimes he seems to be brilliant in the way he protects or collects the right people and waits for his escaped prisoner to make his move. Other times, he appears 10 years before retirement, especially at the beginning of Vogel's escape through the forest. <br /> <br /> I wonder if I got too much hidden meaning from the beginning of the movie. At the start of the movie, as the police car is driving through the city, the first image we see is a red light. My first thought was that it could be the "red circle" and that if I wanted to find a deeper meaning in the movie, it might be that this car, or rather the people through it, is going through the red light, those who are the jewel heist will stop. Hmmmm? <br /> <br /> Maybe the red circle refers to the triumvirate thief? Maybe it was the burning sledge? It does not matter. <br /> <br /> It's a long movie, but it doesn't. The end is a bit of a disappointment. It was too soon for a movie that felt such a nice slow burn. 9/10 <br /> <br /> Clark Richards
