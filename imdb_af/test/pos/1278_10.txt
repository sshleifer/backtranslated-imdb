Given Christopher Nolan's rope of successful films, it's not a brain for me to watch his filmography. Watch his debut feature, shot in black and white in England, lasting less than 70 minutes, with little budget done, but all the features that made him a master movie story and storyteller. <br /> <br /> Shortly, the film is no less poignant with its winding plot that will make you guess, because the premise doesn't even hit the surface of this story, which is pretty amazing in view of the depth in the narrative's structure and characterization. As we have said, we follow a writer Wannabe called Bill (Jeremy Theobald) who begins a regular obsession with following random people he voyeuristically suggests on the streets, which can initially be considered as research before his own start making arrangements and breaking them. <br /> <br /> He meets charismatic Cobb (Alex Haw) who seems to be a robber with peculiar sensitivity and modus operandi, and soon finds himself hanging with him as they go about breaking and entering and speculate on their victim's livelihood, as well as the pursuit of a femme fatal blonde (Lucy Russell), a murderer who rejects his advance. <br /> <br /> Nonlinear that comes with scenes that don't really come together, sets the movie up for several views as you just watch Nolan keep that tension and intrigue at you when the audience expects and more want, which is properly delivered. There are plenty of twists that turn the movie into a dizzying crescendo, where loose points begin to come together and the glamor of the star story begins to shine. <br /> <br /> It is also wonderful how, as a first function shot at the cheap, something smart and sophisticated can be built from its own experience, with Nolan involved at every stage of production, from writing to shooting, manufacturing and directing, after working on the project a year ago shoots can only happen over weekends. I think this is an example of a successful filmmaker's humble roots, serving as inspiration and encouraging new filmmakers out there. Now I will be patiently waiting for Christopher Nolan's inception because of later this year, whose trailer is such a plague.
