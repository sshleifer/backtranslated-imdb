The plot is predictable. This has often been done in other movies. You have competitive summer camps in this one: the rich children against the undercurrents who compete in the typical camp games for the bragging rights, while the kids and consoles strive for pranks, gender and good time! Are you ready for the summer? Meatballs are the first (and best) summer camp movie for a good comedy. Like others, it's not Citizen Kane, but this type of movie isn't meant to be. The film works because of the wonderful comic timing and classic one-liners of Bill Murray. His scenes with a camper where he tries to raise the child's self-esteem are very good. Bill's one-liners throughout the film are very funny. <br /> <br /> I also like this movie not being dirty or explicit like many other "teenagers at camp" movies today. There are some soft sexual innuendo and maybe one or two cuss words in the whole movie. But Meatballs are the type of teenage movie that is actually suitable for the younger crowd. It's rated PG. <br /> <br /> It's a movie you have to see a few times to get all the jokes! When Bill Murray is on the screen or makes one of his classic "PA Announcements", you are drawn to the movie. Bill seems to carry the movie himself alone. But he does so well that when you see Meatballs, you'll realize it's the movie that made him star! A snapshot of this review is to avoid ALL of the Meatball movie sequels. They're terribly bad.
