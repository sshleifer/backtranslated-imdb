Although Cover Girl's plot is very weak and tired, it serves well enough as an anchor for the Core and Gershwin musical numbers. Following her signature role in Gilda, Hayworth chose to die in this musical, which made her look tailor-made. As well as looking as beautiful as ever, she also impresses with her dance. Gene Kelly, who was loaned from Columbia to Columbia, adapted her to dance and the order in which he was cut with his own shadow was well done. The supporting characters were also skilled. Personally, I don't enjoy Cover Girl as much as the musical instruments Hayworth made with Fred Astaire. However, Cover Girl is still very entertaining and easy to recommend. My Score: 7/10.
