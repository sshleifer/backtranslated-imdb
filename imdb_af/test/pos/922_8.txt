In my analysis of "Trois couleurs: Blanc" I wrote that his tone is much lighter than the tone of Trois couleurs: Bleu. I think it's the same with this movie. This time it is not because of a tragic comedy element, but much more because of the main character Valentine. Although her boyfriend lives abroad and is ridiculously jealous, she manages her life with light and optimism. It seems to me that she can be Kieslowski's image for a carefree youth. The opposite seems to be the judge, who is very pessimistic, an old old man who is experiencing great loneliness. In my opinion, Valentine and the judge are very similar to each other, the judge is only much older and has experienced far more disappointment. They share a different kind of naivety and they both discover that they can learn a lot from others. Finally, I would like to emphasize Ir√®ne Jacob's performance. She made a round of wonderful female contributions to the "Three Colors" trilogy.
