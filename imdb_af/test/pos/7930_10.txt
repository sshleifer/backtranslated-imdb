Not only was Eisenstein one of the largest Soviet Russian film editors, but one of the great masters of the theater, among Griffith, Murnau, Ford, Hitchcock, Welles, and others. One of the biggest things in all his films was the edition, very personal, and in this movie is exceptional. This was his first sound movie and the use of the musical score by the great Russian composer Serge Prokofiev in the order of the battle is a perfect contrast between music and image. Watching this movie is like taking a class or lesson in Cinema, which can't afford many movie directors. I never get tired of watching REAL CLASSICS like this movie. I hope more people will recognize a good work of art in the near future.
