A spectacular piece of art. You can see every picture of the movie and see the beauty in it. First of all, I would like to say that "when I saw the German soldiers' helmet, I understood that from here it was" Star Wars "inspired. The scene they were killing the baby was frightening and when I saw it, I did not like it, but when the film was finished, I thought of the scene and I changed my mind and thought in World War 2 That was exactly what the Germans did. <br /> <br /> The ice-battle scene is one of the best war styles I've seen (if not the BEST), their way of combining this movie music and so wonderful visuals is really great, then the Prokofiev score is one of the best known soundtracks in history and I thought it was the best. <br /> <br /> What more could you say about a work of art.Eisenstein created a beautiful masterpiece, a propaganda movie and a beautiful artwork. I'm very happy because I just got the criterion set Eisenstein set.
