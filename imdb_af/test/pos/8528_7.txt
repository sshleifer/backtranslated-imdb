In 1965, producer Kevin McLory owned part of the Bond movie rights association with EON Productions (Harry Saltzman and Albert Broccoli) for making Thunderball, the fourth film of the 007 franchise. The star is of course Sean Connery. <br /> <br /> In 1982, McLory won a legal battle and could produce an "independent" Bond movie. "Never Say Never Again" (NSNA) is one of the two "unofficial" 007 films made outside EON (the other is the 1967 comedy spoof "Casino Royale"). NSNA is a remake of Thunderball and stars the original Bond, Sean Connery. After many years of absence, the role comes back. <br /> <br /> The movie is released a few months after Octopussy with Roger Moore, the 13th episode of the EON series. At the moment the press calls 'War of the Bonds' ... Both films were a great success in 1983, although "Octopussy" earns more money at the box office. <br /> <br /> NSNA is a luxury film made by excellent technician director Irvin Kershner who led "The Empire Back", Douglas Slocombe Cinematographer of "Raiders of the Lost Ark" - and author Lorenzo Semple Jr - who wrote the "three days of the Condor" ... <br /> <br /> The movie is great with Connery, a relatively unknown Kim Basinger, Barbara Carrera, Klaus Maria Brandauer, Max Von Sydow, Edward Fox ... <br /> <br /> Although Al the movie remains inferior to the original "Thunderball". It has many fundamental elements for being a true Bond movie: there is no traditional column of arms, there is no James Bond theme. M and Q are not played by traditional actors. It's a copyright law. Only EON are allowed to use these elements. In short, NSNA lacks the classic cinematic 007 atmosphere. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the movie is exciting and enjoyable. Brandauer is a very good villain and the women (Basinger and Carrera) are sensual and beautiful. But the main highlight is Sean Connery! He is wonderful in the role, he is older, but looks finer and nicer than in "Diamonds is forever", his last performance in the role of the British superspace for NSNA.
