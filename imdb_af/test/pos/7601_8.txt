Drew Barrymore gets second chance at high school, on undercover command as newspaper reporter. In flashbacks, we see that the first time was to bring a big disaster. David Arquette is amusingly modest as Drew's brother, who also enrolls to help sis. Many subplots are in danger, but never overwhelmingly simple charm of the movie. Drew holds her niche as a big innocent sexy light comic actress.
