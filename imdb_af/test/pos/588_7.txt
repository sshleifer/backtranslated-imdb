The first feature film adventure of Jim Henson's beloved muppet characters is a very capable musical comedy vehicle like Kermit. The Frog leaves its carefree, marshy environment for the bright lights (through the stranded Hollywood agent Dom DeLuise who heard him). Along the way he meets Fozzie Bear (a deceptive comedian at the El Sleazo cafe of James Coburn, who has Telly Savalas for a rider and Madeline Kahn is a patron!), The piano Rowlf, bestial drummer Animal and his laid-back , funky band, egomanian beauty queen, Miss Piggy (in a ceremony presented by Elliott Gould and Edgar Bergen), etc. All the while, Kermit et al is being pursued by frogleg civiliate Charles Durning and reluctant Acolyte Austin Pendleton, selling cars, ice cream and balloons by, respectively, Milton Berle, Bob Hope and Richard Pryor, donated food by the bad waiter, Steve Martin. almost drained by the mad German scientist Mel Brooks and finally an audition in the offices of filmmaker Orson Welles who has Cloris Leachman for a secretary)! The pleasant song score comes with Paul Williams, who also makes an appearance as the resident pianist at El Sleazo's. For the record, I recently won four of the following Muppet movies and have to watch them in the coming weeks when their turn falls.
