I just rented this movie from the video store. It was new and not released long ago, but the rent was just overnight. I, my little sister, and my older brother who usually hates to watch this kind of movie, sit and watch. Once the movie started and after we put it, we've been laughing for a while. Even my brother. This movie is hilarious, I actually laughed. No matter how funny some movies are. Even though I think it's funny, sometimes I can't laugh. But this movie ... I laughed. My brother finally thought it was the best "kind of movie" he saw. I finally watched the movie about 2 or 3 hours later.
