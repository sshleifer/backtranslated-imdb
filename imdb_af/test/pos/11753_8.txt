Holden and Jones SIZZLE in this movie, but not in the way we think today sizzling - it is very subtle and under the surface - yet tangible. In particular, Jennifer Jones is so sexually hot in this movie (much more than a caricature like Monroe was ever) because she creates a real woman - with all the facets of the woman: she is intelligent, intuitive, graceful. She desires and desires. <br /> <br /> There is a scene on the famous hill, where she is lying in the grass, watching Holden and the expression in her eyes is X-rated, but in the context of the scene and character, in make complete sense. You don't have to have everything in the dialogue - spelled out as the rough look in most modern movies. It's all there in her eyes - sexy but elegant. What a beautiful, underrated actress she was. (I saw her MADAME BOVARY for the first time recently and was blown away.) I will fetch Bergman, Davis or the two Hepburns any day.
