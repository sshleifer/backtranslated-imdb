Well, I would say it is a very pleasant and somewhat touch of the movie despite its flaws. I didn't believe for a moment that Matthau was the first thing to be a dentist. Also, Hawn's character recovered at the start of the movie of suicide depression. Not to mention the whole thing was quite ridiculous. However, the movie sounds like a good fit, humor and its stars. Matthau may not be a dentist, but he was as amusing as he usually was. Bergman brought a lot of sensitivity to the film (especially during the scene where she and Matthau went to work for a drink) and also a lot of humor. I believe it was her show that made my brother know about this movie after hearing some scenes. Hawn's performance is remarkable, although an Oscar may have passed, it did a bit. Basically, don't take this movie too seriously and you'll enjoy yourself.
