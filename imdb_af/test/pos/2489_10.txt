Penalty Park is a brilliant piece of cinema. Shot in the Southern <br /> <br /> California desert with its patent-faux documentary style, Watkins <br /> <br /> creates a movie like no other. He follows two groups of prisoners (one <br /> <br /> condemns the other post-convicted) throughout the photo. After <br /> <br /> they are tried by a military tribunal. They have the option of <br/> <br /> serving a jail sentence or they can take part in punishment <br /> <br /> Park (a three-day summons through the desert with nothing but clothes on their backs while being driven by local legislation <br /> <br /> enforcement officers using the park as a living action training <br /> <br /> land). I can't say enough about this movie. Sometimes it feels like you're <br /> <br /> a real documentary. It's one of Peter Watkins's most <br /> <br /> accessible movies. I advise you to look out. You won't regret it! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended <br /> <br /> A + <br /> <br />
