It was a fantastic movie about two people, one a young teenage girl, and the other, a middle-aged man who was looking for someone to help them fulfill a certain void that had previously been loved. <br /> <br /> Both actors provide brilliant performances that various audiences can meet. The writing, though written by Gorman Bechard, seems to have been written from a woman's point of view. And at the same time, men can relate to the male characters because of how well they developed and described in the movie. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie has an unusual but powerful and unexpected turn that leaves you speechless. I would recommend this movie to anyone who once or fell in love with a loved one. It is clear in this movie that you are not alone.
