Although a cable for HBO is made, it is a pleasant movie and a fascinating look at the back and double world of television. Allowing the viewer to watch behind the scenes of the so-called late-night talk shows in the early 90s, as Jay Leno and David Letterman took part in the prestigious position of the Tonight Show. Kathy Bates performs well as Leno's mercurial manager, Helen Kushnick, and one can experience empathy for what Leno / Letterman has in the hands of TV drivers. It's just as timely now, considering the recent events that ABC's failed attempt to replace Nightline with Letterman. No matter how many times I've seen this movie, I still find it so much fun to watch as I did when it was first broadcast. If ever released on DVD, I would definitely add it to my collection.
