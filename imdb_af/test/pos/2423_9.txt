*** SPOILERS *** Feeling alone and companionship, as well as the love of Frances Austen, Sandy Dennis, keeps all these emotions in because she is going through life as a popular young single lady who has many high-class friends. But for the sake of her own deep insecurity, they hold their arms. As for Frances, male friends are not near her age so they will have no reason to have any romantic involvement with them. <br /> <br /> One early evening, when Frances entertained some of her friends, she saw outside her apartment window a young man, Michael Burns, alone in the cold showers. Feeling homeless and alone after her friends leave Frances going to the park and offering the young man shelter in her place until the rain falls and even remains for a night in a guest room she has. You can immediately see that Frances is more interested in having only the young men safe from the cold and then she wants to play him as a girlfriend or even toy for herself and if the movie progresses, you see that you were right <br / > <br /> A great show by Sandy Dennis, somehow much like that of Kathy Bates's Oscar performance in Misery, made twenty-one years in 1990. Frances thinks the young man was alone and homeless and later, when she meets him, sees the perfect person for her to be a true friend. He is by no means equal to her or better than her as the friends she has, doctors attorneys Indian leaders, and is therefore totally dependent on her. It later turns out that the young man is not the lonely and homeless person Frances thought he was. That's when she finds out that he really doesn't need her and that he has to manipulate him. The other way to enforce it in Frank's mind is a coercion of murderous relationships. <br /> <br /> A very strange movie by director Robert Altman that goes deep into the depths of loneliness and depression of human mind. The actress Sandy Dennis is perfect like Dr Jekyll and Miss. Hyde personality acts in her as the lonely but at the same time dangerous Frances Austen and it is a pity she did not get an Oscar for her role in the film. but was not even named for it. <br /> <br /> Like most Robert Altman movies, it seems a lot of improvisation among the actors in the film and ad lib dialogue, especially between the youngster's sister Nina, Susanne Benton and her friend Nick, David Garfield. The only thing in the movie I find confusing is when we see Frances go to a city clinic to have a complete gynecological exam and tell the doctor she is going to get married very soon. Was her husband the young man staying at her apartment? But besides, the film is very good and the end is a real shock to the audience as well as the young man. When he finally realized that Frances was not just a little out-of-the-wall but also murderous insane.
