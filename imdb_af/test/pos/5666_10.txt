<br /> <br /> Giorgino is a strange, dark, obsessive object; The casting is impressive, the plot is powerful, reminds me of Edgar Poe's stories. Probably not a masterpiece, but it reminds us of strong images, fine music, fear, sadness, confusion, and a sense that says everything: the wolves come. GORORINO is now very forgotten, and when it was released, no one appreciated it. It's a shame. If you ever have a chance to see it, well ... try it.
