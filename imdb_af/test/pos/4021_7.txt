Of the two hit films, it's better and although it's hardly a Schindlers list in complexity, it's bloody funny. All the men are the goodies or the bad things and the women are all just HOS and emotionally needy, eg. Slaughters Meisie. It's also bloody funny and The Pro must be the funniest movie pimp of all time. You can't get enough of those hats, press kits, gold chains and jive patois forever. The best part is where he goes around the Harem, "INSIDE YOU". Everything about him is bigger than life and it is reminiscent of Morris Day in Purple Rain. Jim Brown also proves he's a private dick for all the chicks and again he kicks white-headed ass in all directions. The car scene is very unrealistic that they survive undamaged, but hey, it's the movies. Definitely the best blax flick and it surpasses Shaft (1971). Even the first movie is pretty good.
