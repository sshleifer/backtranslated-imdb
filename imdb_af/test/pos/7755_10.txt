I first heard of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya from a reviewer on Youtube. He literally slapped the show with a big bad ridge and condemned it dirty and confusing. Curious, I decided to watch the show (as soon as I got the order of the episodes right, thanks to those who made the lists), and I watched it absolutely brilliant and enjoyable to watch. Great memorable characters who are full of life and are absolutely sweet and hilarious; a unique and unleavened plot that makes sense when I watched the show; and two of the best anime moments in history, in my opinion. Plus, the opening and finishing themes are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Based on a collection of successful manga novels, the anime follows a simple plot once you understand it. While the show focuses on the main character, Haruhi Suzumiya, her friend's position is Kyon. Kyon is a regular high school student who doesn't really believe in supernatural things (eg Santa Clause, strangers, time travelers, ghosts, teams) but he soon ends up with Haruhi, who is the strangest girl in the school and prefers to be a stranger all men are worthless. She even joined every club at the school to find something interesting, but stopped as soon as she joined the school. After "advice" from Kyon, Haruhi decides to form her own club with Kyon's club. Haruhi forms the SOS Brigade in the literary club room - his mission to investigate supernatural cases (think Scooby-Doo minus the dog, the masked man and the Mystery Machine). <br /> <br /> Haruhi "recruits" three extra members. The first is Yuki Nagato, a bookmaker of many who speaks very little and spends most of her time reading and sitting. The second is Mikuru Asahina, a shy girl forced by Haruhi in the club, who thinks they need a cute mascot to do things. She is often forced into costumes by Haruhi to promote her sweetness. The third is Itsuki Koizumi, a friendly and welcoming transfer student who always smiles. While Haruhi thinks her group is full of normal people, she can't be wrong anymore. While Kyon is as normal as you can get, the other three are unique. Yuki is a stranger, Mikuru is a future traveler, and Itsuki is an esper (an ESP). All three have come to look at Haruhi who has only powers of a god, and if she gets bored, she can discover her powers and create a whole new world, and Kyon is somehow involved. <br /> <br /> The show is worth watching with great characters, music and some hilarious and wonderful moments. However, for parents, there are some sexual references, including Mikuru's fissures that are exposed or touched several times, and various swearing words are also used. In addition, the display is one of the sizes.
