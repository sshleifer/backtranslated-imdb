It's an excellent movie and I wish they'd put it on DVD for people to buy. It's hard to try to catch it on TV anytime. As you don't know when one of the stations will decide to air it. Can anyone tell me which file company does this, can I write to them and see if they will make it public? I only caught the last hour and a half yesterday and I only saw it once last year. My sisters and I are all looking for it in every store that sells any videos. John Denver is an excellent singer and actor and the plot line is great. They poured out some older movies and I think it's good, but there are quite a few that haven't exhausted them and I think if we can contact the producers and can address our requests, we can put some of them on DVD get.
