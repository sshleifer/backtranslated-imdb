I love the other reviews of this movie. They mirror my attitude. I am a 70-year-old man, less disco and 'Star Wars' childhood. There was nothing nice about this movie, except for a chase. That's why it was good because it was tough, basic and economical. Roy Scheider carried the film, based on the crew, the 7 Ups, which supported Gene Hackman in the "French Connection". The people in it were credible and average, who burned themselves, stole coffee, showed fear in pursuit, and almost lost it after a close call. <br /> <br /> Perhaps it will be easier to tell you what's missing. There were no fancy weapons, just basic revolvers and rugged saws. There wasn't a tough man who was philosophical, ala Tarantino. There was no kung fu or samurai nonsense and no fancy trick. There was no clever guy doing a complicated scheme based on hundreds of things just as he had planned to plan everyone's responses. The criminals were bad guys, but they didn't shoot people for hell. In fact, there was a body number of only three. something that will average the average movie these days in the opening credits. It can be a G-movie today! No orphans have been kidnapped and no terrorist threatens to kill half of the city. There was no high-tech hijacking, and the crimes themselves were not very mobile, and the highest technology I saw was an ATT wallet. It had no subplots or amusing character developments. Also, no gender or women, except for one gangster's wife shouting like the Buddy our hero threatened her. <br /> <br /> It was a little entrepreneur who exploited his ties with the local gang and police. uproot local gang members for a few easy payoffs. The entrepreneurs. Vito was played by Tony Lo Bianco who did a good job, as well as Roy Schneider, Buddy, the head of the 7-year-old policeman, who he informed and exploited. What ever happened to Tony Lo Bianco, was he like a Pacino shoe, beautiful and talented? What it did have was a great NYC background for a simple crime story. Places that were pale and inhumane without being a sociological study. It had a simple plot involved in this kidnapping scheme where one of Buddy's police was accidentally involved, literally accidentally caught up and then accidentally shot dead. As Buddy and his 7-ups are a hot dog unit, both NYPD buyers and shooters thought he was involved, as kidnappers moderated as ordinary clothing police officers had to lure the mobsters. Obviously the shooters thought they had lawyers and rights to protect them from the normal police. Even the gangsters were simple, old and ugly, no Godfather royal or Soprano hip. <br /> <br /> It's a good basic movie with a striking backdrop between two 70's Pontiacs. Even the cars were simple and economical, not even a GTO or a Trans Am, such as the acting and the story. In the days of Batman uber-hype or "24" levels of intensity doomsday scenarios, this movie reminds us that is less better. It should be shown to film writers and directors as a caveat to not be blinded, wasted, and eventually insult us with stunts, gadgets and clown psychotic behavior in general.
