I personally found the movie to be good. I watched it for pre-order for a month and watched it twice the day I got it in the mail, and a few times ago. Yes, the lapse of time may be a bit much, but the rest of the movie clearly compensates. . Throw all the amature, but the acting was right for every part. The plot itself is just ... haggard! There is no other way to describe it. Who makes a movie about someone who gets saved? ?? BAM, that's who. Genie. Simple genius. Two thumbs up. I will be honored to work with him any day, anytime.
