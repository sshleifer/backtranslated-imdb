"The Devil in the Dark" is William Shatner's favorite episode. This is also one of my favorite episodes. The program is pure Star Trek because it deals with one of the series' main themes: respect for other life forms. I don't think a clear example of one of the show's most interesting ideas can be found. In this episode, Kirk and his crew have to confront a monster that kills miners on a distant planet. The story is an excuse to investigate the law that people must destroy creatures that are an important part of the environment. Today's environmental concerns make the show more relevant than ever before. It is extremely well written and performed with gusto by our beloved cast. One unforgettable series involves Spock joining the mind of the monster. A lot of tension between Spock and Kirk (they want to solve the problem using different methods) adds to the fun. Shatner and Leonard Nimoy are doing their best here.
