Now I realize that most people here disassemble YOUNG VICTIMS or make it "so bad it funny", write entertainment, but let me make something clear: this is actually a quality piece of low rent action, if you are willing see such things cinema without a critical eye. In fact, it's much more entertaining and thoughtful than most of the action films of the 80's. <br /> <br /> The key is in the movie's subject. I am always a sucker for movies that is the subject of vigilance, especially when they are ambitious in the psyche of the characters involved. YOUNG TRANSITORS may not have the intelligence or sensitivity of the first DEAD WISH movie (and yes, I think the first one has both of those elements), but it tries to be different from the Cannon movies of The Period in which it is actually unique. is. <br /> <br /> The plot is simple (don't worry, there won't be fairy tales): A group of college student pranksters change their ways when one of their family members is. assaulted by a difficult street gang. The students go to the streets in an attempt to combat general street crime because they do not know who the gang is responsible for. They eventually get some heavy artillery (machine guns and grenades) and taste the night fully armed. However, these are not Schwarzenegger types; They are vulnerable, inexperienced beginners who make substantial blunders almost every time. They clean the city (usually with their frat mascot dog in tow). They eventually found out who the gang is and are behind them, but by that time you won't expect a standard climax in which the good guys go unharmed. <br /> <br /> One thing about the movie that struck me so strange but effective is that most of the first action doesn't indicate that we will later see any action or violence, as it is treated as A goofy frat comedy that you will see on the US Up All Night (where I believe it was actually shown at one point). The comedy setup actually forgot to forget that the VHS cover had a man with a machine gun running on his back. Then, when the violence finally arrives, it's not funny or cute at all. It's shockingly disturbing. From then on, the film becomes a full-blooded, uncompromising action yarn containing some surprising rifles and gore. <br /> <br /> The play, while nothing special, is much more passionate than I expected. James Van Patten, who plays the lead, gives her everything and his performance is surprisingly good for this type of film. The rest of the cast is equally invested, including the always trusted Ernest Borgnine as the hero's cop-father. The cinematography is also above and the action scenes are dealt with with some seriousness that I personally did not expect. <br /> <br /> I can understand why some people thought this movie was worthless because it was very dated, but those facets struck me as nothing but cool in and of themselves. Van Patten's character studies animation and his striking early 80's style work, featured in several scenes, is a retro movie lover's psychedelic wet dream. I'm sure most contemporary viewers would call those moments as low points in the movie, but I disagree. Also, Joe Walsh's soundtrack - which seemed to have just been recorded in 83 - was particularly fitting and enjoyable, no matter how old it seems today. <br /> <br /> YOUNG WARRIORS is one of my favorite action films of the 80's and I especially urge anyone interested in the genre to take a look. Unfortunately, it is only released on VHS because of this writing, and it is not currently shown on television. A good DVD presentation will run my moon in my living room with so much intensity that I'm sure my ankles will swell. Meanwhile, I ask you all to go on Ebay or Amazon and cough the ten dollars or so for the old big box. It's really a remarkable staple of ambitious garbage films.
