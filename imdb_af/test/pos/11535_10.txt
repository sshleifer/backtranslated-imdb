I can't understand why my appreciation for this movie is so low for my life. It was one of the most beautiful movies I've seen this year. It really hit me a chord. I've been reacting to this movie for a few months and I thought to myself. There is no way it could possibly meet the expectations I had for it. How does it look like I built it up in my head? Well, needless to say, it didn't just meet my expectations, but it surpassed them by far. Jordana Brewster and Cameron Diaz were excellent in every way. Their performance is excellent. They were both in their element and quite natural to the roles. The locals were absolutely beautiful. Every shot shot is perfectly captured and fits in the atmosphere and beautifully. I touched this movie very much and took it very close to my heart. I would even consider saying this could be one of my all-time favorites. At least, I could see it again and again. <br /> <br /> I swear I couldn't find one mistake in this movie. It's hard to tell about any movie. I would highly recommend this one. It affects, it's significant, and it says a lot about human nature and family. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10. Well done by everyone.
