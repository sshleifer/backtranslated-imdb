I remember it in the early 90's on the British TV and was addicted. The international scale of the production is breathtaking and watching the characters evolve through the five hours it runs is wonderful. The scenes in Pakistan and Afghanistan are of particular importance, and as a viewer, you get a true sense of the boundaries of the culture and vibe of these countries during the closing times of the Cold War. The characters of Fazal and Helen really develop well throughout the range and competitive modern performances such as The Sopranos and Six Feet Under in this area. In the UK, the VHS goes for about £ 6 and the DVD is about £ 10 - a good bargain. I thought Soderbergh's version was fantastic too - but this masterpiece is clearly a big blame.
