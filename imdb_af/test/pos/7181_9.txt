The second (non-animated) movie about the only people who still refuse to surrender to the Roman Empire is even more hilarious than the first film "Asterix & Obelix contre Ceasar". <br /> <br /> Where the first movie all laughed because all cartoon characters were so perfectly brought to life without losing their cartoonish identity. This successor (who is a separate story like all comic books) is even better. Certainly, all the ingredients you find in the first movie and in the comics are again present. Obelix still dies to taste the "magical drink", giving his other tribesmen such enormous powers, Caesar and the rest of the Roman Empire are still enemy number 1, but new, refreshing elements have also been brought on stage. <br /> <br /> Not only is the setting of very idyllic (biggest role players of course in Egypt), rather than repeating movie number one, some extras have been added by making all sorts of references to other movies (Bruce Lee, etc.). It's all not very new, but the unexpected combination of the well-known story from the comic book (with almost the same title as the movie) and references to things that have absolutely nothing to do with Asterix and Obelix, really works. <Br /> <br /> In this way, the movie builds on a tradition by comic writers Goscinny and Uderzo who did not hesitate to raise Laurel and Hardy and even give a whole story to Kirk Douglas . <br /> <br /> If you're not convinced to watch this movie, I'm sure Monica Bellucci will play Cleopatra.
