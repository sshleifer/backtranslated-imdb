The many comments made by others were very informative and I share in their calls for the release of Porgy and Bess, the 1959 film. <br /> <br /> In my early teens, I joined a record club and this album was one of the free ones I chose to attend. I knew some of the voices were baptized, but only Robert McFerrin was recognized on the album. Recently, my daughter bought a CD from Austria, I think. The quality is excellent, so I'm confused about why it's available in Europe by CBS Records, Inc., when I wasn't lucky in local stores. <br /> <br /> Actually, I've never seen the movie, but for years have pleaded with local video stores to get it. Now I know why it has never been available. <br /> <br /> I add my voice to others who plead with the heirs of the property and rights and accept it to release it, but imperfectly they see it - The beauty of music and story has reached so many of us that would never have had the experience different. <br /> <br /> Trudy
