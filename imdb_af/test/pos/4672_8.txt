The movie is really good, it doesn't use violence or sex etc. to sell itself like other movies, but rather uses a very decent plot (based on the original by Michael Caine) and some good actors for a fun, make active film. which I thoroughly enjoyed. One more thing that made me more of this film was that it had a few actors that I really like Edward Norton (who I last saw in the 26th hour, which I also enjoyed), Jason Statham (carrier, enjoy it too) and Seth Groen I think is great, his role as Shawn Fanning's roommate, "The Napster" is hilarious and his hacking skills play a big role in the main loft that is situated around a major traffic jam in LA . The car hunt is very decent and the high-tech equipment used by the thieves is interesting and very impressive. I didn't see the original, so I can't really compare it, but I really enjoyed it and would recommend this movie to everyone. It's not a movie where you have to keep that particular genre, it will suit everyone. , I felt good about this movie, it had a very good end and was really fun to watch. I give it 8/10. Go see it!
