In the middle of The Hole I e-mailed a friend to summarize it. Not sure if the film would break down into a series of submissive gestures, I recommended a little uncomfortable, but then I saw the end. It's perfect. I've been living in Korea for 6 months, and this movie can just as easily summarize the odd enigma and frustration of an Asian metropolis as it does in Taiwin. It uses the myth of Hong Kong to use musicals like Godard or Hartley Western musicals, but take it to the limit, it's a cruel world and occasionally Kafka-esquire logic makes it all better. I really think The Hole's closest comparison is Hal Hartley's surviving desire, but has a kind of pale edge for what is ultimately hopeful and strange metaphorical films. Anyway, that's what I wrote to Esther. Hope you like The Hole too. <br /> <br /> Hey, <br /> <br /> Look at a move called the hole. Taiwanese I think it looks a little strange to China, unless it is Hong Kong. it is worth seeing so far. It's about a man and a girl in an apartment complex. the man's ceiling was grieving and the girl was getting annoyed and it was a strange metaphor for the simultaneous pleasure, breakdown and pain of a rather intense loved one. There is also a kind of zombie virus sub-plot and a lot of strange little scenes where the girl works out her desires through rather innocent and lovely fun 50's doo-wop rows. worth a look.
