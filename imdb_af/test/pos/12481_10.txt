One of the best movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic. He really fills in his part, and it's great. He is such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to participate. <br /> <br /> And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good French people trying to defend themselves in the murder-born battle. <br /> <br /> The story is awesome and good. building. You can feel the atmosphere of Paris for that period (which around 1930-40) between two wars ... The clubs, the old little buildings, the neighbors. <br /> <br /> All things contribute to making a good movie.
