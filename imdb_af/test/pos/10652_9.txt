The photography and editing of the movie is exceptional for the period. Eisenstein builds on every scene of the movie that leads to the sailor's uprising and the massacre in town. As much as the movie is a high point in the theater, it is also an example of Socialist Realism. By 1925, the Soviet government was actively using the arts, including film, to spread the message of the revolution. Eisenstein's portrayal of the Battleship Potempkin rebellion gives the viewer insight into the message of the Soviet elite. Marxist theory and perspectives of class struggle are demonstrated as the sailors representing the oppressed workers and the officers representing the elite of society. Much of the film shows the communist party message and how film is used as an instrument of propaganda.
