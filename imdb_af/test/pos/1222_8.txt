Watching the preview of Armourer I thought the movie would be either a very bad or a very good movie. Fortunately, the movie was entertaining, exciting and realistic. There is never the perfect crime, and Armor showed why. The movie shows perfectly when people are in stressful situations, they act like animals. The last hour of the movie is very entertaining. Matt Dillon is still a very good actor. Hard to believe Dillon is 50 years old. I'll buy this movie. I give Armor eight out of ten. Not a Christmas movie. Did I write another ten lines? Nope! Anyway, there aren't many action movies. Armor has a lot of excitement in it, which makes the filmmaker a choice about another comedy.
