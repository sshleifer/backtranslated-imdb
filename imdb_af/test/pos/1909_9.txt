Dolemite is wonderful. Rudy Ray Moore's rhymin kung fu pimp with horrible choreographed action sequences is about as close as you can get to being a spoof of a genre without really being spoofed. Burger Kane it may not be Les Infant Au Revoir, but it is undoubtedly genius in its own right. The production values ​​in this movie are so bad that they can qualify as existential special effects. The plot pulls a little in the middle, but the power of such a cheap starting point as kungfu hookers is enough to spend everyone but the snootiest movie lovers. The infamous, ever-present drunk raises shades of glorious Ed Wood and never grows unsuitable. Sometimes I wonder if the tree is deliberately left as comment on the ridiculous aspects of movies in general, but I am usually distracted by erotic scenes that have erotic erosion to the point of high artisticity. All this film is alive and breathable, dropping with desperate longing to love and be banned simultaneously. It works. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
