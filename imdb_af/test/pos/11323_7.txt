The BBC and HBO have joined forces to create a "Dirty War", a 90-minute TV movie about a terrorist-dirty bomb attack in London. The film goes fast to the business as it leaves both the terrorists and the government's anti-terrorist efforts in the film, and there is little room for human interest subplots. On the terrorist side, we follow the bomb from the smuggling of radioactive materials to gathering to blast to explosion. On the government side we see PR and training exercises, intelligence gathering and analysis, interdiction, post-detonation response and follow-up. The film also gives a sense of how al-Qa'ida-type terrorist cells are organized, the radical Islamic terrorist mentality, and terrorist strategies. A kind of anatomy of a "dirty bomb" incident, "Dirty War" will answer many questions that become in the minds of an audience and become increasingly aware of this treacherous threat. (B)
