This is one of the best lesbian movies I've ever seen! This series brought joy and sadness to true love. To be in the 1800s was a wonderful look at lesbian lives and desires of lesbian women. The cast was beyond expectation! Rachael Stirling is a wonderful actress, I have never seen her other works, but her depiction of Nan connected with her to feel her sadness and pain and love. The one thing I feel most important is to connect with the characters in everything I see. If anyone doubts about seeing this movie ... Think twice! This is a series that needs to be seen. Well done to the BBC again! We need more lesbian movies that portray true love and pain, like this one. To live in Canada I imported this DVD and I'm so excited to buy it.
