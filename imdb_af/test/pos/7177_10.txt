In 1968, "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" was released, it didn't come off anywhere, and it seemed like a psychedelic thunder bolt. African American actor and film maker, William Greaves, aims to change the 'new-reel' style of documentary films, and to date there has never been such a thing as that. The film is a film about 'making a movie', intentionally written and directed to create as much controversy and contradiction as possible. In the New York Central Park, the action and scarce dialogue is addressed on a couple fighting homosexuality and abortion. The woman wants out of the relationship and the man wants an explanation. Towards the end of this interaction, a drunk homeless man interrupts the proceedings and presents his comments and personal storytelling. Then, after the principle material was shot, the film person added their own views of the filmmaker and what they felt was his improper handling of the movie. And throughout the film several cameras are used to record the action within the scene, and excessive commentary by throw, crew and spectators. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone interested in Avant Garde filmmakers such as Andy Warhol, John Cassavetes, or Jim Jarmusch. William Greaves tries to show that a thing cannot really be perceived and understood because the view itself would change reality. "SYMBIOPSYCHOTAXIPLASM: Take One" can be seen as a cinematic representation or application of the uncertainty principle. This is just one possible explanation, and Greave's true intention is definitely open to speculation. Above all, this film is trying to confront, confront. and, successfully, stimulate successfully.
