Nana Patekar once again proves that he is without doubt the best actor in Bombay. His recent movies shouted his lines that did not fit well with the theater-trained Thespian. One wonders why he always gave his awards during the awards season. <br /> <br /> "Shakti-The Power" was one of his flashes with Kohram a total disappointment (a missed opportunity to create screen magic with Amitabh Bachchan). <br /> <br /> But Patekar gives a cool serenity to this film that a policeman plays on a sort of social justice journey. To destroy the streets of the Mumbai of the underworld in the false encounters, Patekar's character takes control of the screen (and viewers' attention) and never lets go. The editing is tight and there are no annoying songs to derive from the story. <br /> <br /> Under the same lines as today's cult-classic "Company", the movie is well-acted, directed and needs a long shelf life on DVD. <br /> <br /> The last ten minutes Nana and the main cork speak at his foreign port will be part of Hindi theater classics. Will not be disappointed with these policemen and robbers flashing.
