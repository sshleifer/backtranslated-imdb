OhMyGAWD !!! THAT MAGIC GARDEN may be one of my most beautiful 70-year-old memories. Two hippie chicks with ponytails, Carole and Paula, will swing on, tell jokes, take the bell out, pull them out with costumes they have in a huge chest called The Storybox, and argue with a vague pink squirrel named Sherlock who stayed in one. from their trees. They can also grind an average acoustic guitar and sing a nice melody. It was a wonderful children's show. Many 70's feel. But this is the problem: They no longer do so. Too bad. You could say these two girls had hearts of gold and beloved children, they were really sweet. MAGIC GARDEN is one of the shows that if they came out with a box, people would buy it because it is such a MELLOW runs down to Memory Lane.
