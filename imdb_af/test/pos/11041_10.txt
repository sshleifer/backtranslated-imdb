See this GREAT classic movie by Greta Garbo and think her performance was excellent. The German movie version, which had English subtitles, was, however, her biggest show. Greta Garbo even told the press that the German movie was her favorite where she had to make the change of Silent films sound. Greta had a high voice and had to take lessons to lower her voice for her future roles in movies. This story was very sad because Greta Garbo (Anna Christie), "Ninotchka", 39, was murdered on a farm by young boys. Her father left her sailor years ago and then as a coal captain. There were many scenes from Old NYC, Brooklyn Bridge, Coney Island and Manhattan Airline. Charles Bickford (Matt Burke), "Days of Wine & Roses", '62 A classic veteran actor has given a huge support role.
