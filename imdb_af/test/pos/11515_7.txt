This is an important historical film as it was the first all-talking movie. <br /> <br /> The movie was made for just $ 23,000. <br /> <br /> It attributed more than a million dollars to its release. <br /> <br /> This movie helped to define the gangster melodramas that had to become the Warner studio's bread and butter in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> The popularity of this movie ended the quiet era more than its famous partition predecessor, the Jazz Singer. The film deserves its place in history and not as a mere footnote. <br /> <br /> The only actor to remember today is in Eugene Palette.
