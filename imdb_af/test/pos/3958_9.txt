Films that are part of the "film noir" genre usually contain similar elements: a "Deus ex machina" plot twist that is the main character in bedlam, a beautiful but psychotic girl, a beautiful but psychotic crook, a lot of money, drive a lot of brutality, and usually a desertion in the desert. Think "High Sierra" or "White Heat." <br /> <br /> There are many hard-boiled bad film noir out there. But if film noir is good, you can't take your eyes off the train wreck of human lives. <br /> <br /> This is the last tradition Blind Spot belongs to. The movie follows Danny Alton, a troubled teenager (played excellently with depth, grace, emotional integrity, and righteous uniqueness by James Franco, who totally throws him into this role) who fell in love with the rough edge, Darcy. /> <br /> From the start you know it's going to be bad. <br /> <br /> Darcy invites Danny to his home. But the house is empty and for sale, and a bloody check for thousands of dollars is on the floor. Danny was robbed of his clothes and possessions, but used the check to find the suicidal April-Darcy's other lover. When they reach Darcy's real home, they find Wayne - a thief Darcy is looking for the money he is stolen. Together, the three Darcy get into a dusty, downhill motel in the desert. But this is just the beginning of the story, as plastic explosives, drugs, firearms, a creepy funeral home, bisexual assassins and a lonely desert half-house in the desert trigger an explosive head in a alley outside a Los Angeles tattoo room . <br /> <br /> This movie features the best noir cinematography I have seen in years. In one scene, Danny raced on foot through the desert to the semi-completed home in the desert, where he believed Darcy could be taken by murderers that night. A very long shot with sharp lighting effects shows Danny - arms and legs flashing, tangible fear afflicted on his face (visible even at this distance), dust clouds lying behind him as the wind whips in his direction - riding over the desert plains to the house. The loneliness, the despair, the despair that Danny feels, are shockingly portrayed. There are many such scenes in this film, wonderfully crafted by the experienced Maximo Munzi. This is Oscar-winning material. <br /> <br /> Editing is also amazing. The film contains few moments where the characters gain insight into themselves or their situation. Bits of time, where memory and feeling are flooded again. At these times, fast-paced images of images flash over the screen. This is great editing by director-writer-editor Stephan Woloszczuk. In an early fitting, Danny describes the wonderful feelings he now has that Darcy has entered his life. Fast images of Danny's diary flash over the screen: the words "4 live," "happy" and "safe" stop for a moment as the page on the page of words, the content of a human heart, moves across the screen - Outside focus too fast to read. It's like the flood of emotion that Danny feels. <br /> <br /> The flood images reveal something else about this movie: Just how beautiful Nathaniel Waters's production design is. Darcy's home with a cabin is the perfect match of hi-tech and slob (a tribute to the attention of the decorated Kimberly Foster). The beautiful desert home scene is just totally creepy. The ruined motel where Darcy hides can be found in any deserted small town in America. The creepy (and stunningly lit) burial house where the plot takes a horrible turn, blends strength with the death penalty hanging over the entire film. (It's too bad the movie's lighting director isn't credited.) This movie has an excellent production design, one that enhances every frame and every actor's performance. <br /> <br /> This is the fourth element of this movie that makes it grab you and hold onto you: the play. James Franco is an excellent actor. Even in "Spider-Man" - where he was given almost nothing to do - Franco showed that he understood human emotion, like no other actor of his generation. He's not a pretty boy who looks good on Brad Pitt. Franco depicts deep emotion with full power. His performances contain pure human heart. Consider the scene in the telephone box outside the funeral home, where Danny invades after he told April and Wayne that Darcy is dead. Smaller actors could not break down the complete emotional collapse of a person. Do Franco. <br /> <br /> In her first movie, Shawn Montgomery just blows you with her performance as the April suicide. Dies in love with Darcy, who is suffering from massive depression after she alone buried her unborn child (after spontaneously aborting the fetus) in a perfume box in the bush, her life of luxury and perfection is now a bump: April is one of those best-signed characters on film I've ever seen. While Danny's relationship with Darcy slowly wiped out during the film, April's nervous breakdown is only revealed to the audience. Not Danny or Wayne looks particularly interested in her as a human. April's despair when she realizes Danny is also Darcy's lover is attractive and strong, even though it is cut down by the character's complete inability to feel a lot of emotion for a long time. Montgomery will bring a pathos until April to put your heart through the wringer. <br /> <br /> Mark Patrick Gleason gets the hardest job in the movie: To make something male and real out of the thief, Wayne. In the first place, Wayne is just one of a number of violent, uncomfortable, obsessive drug pushers / gun runners found in any number of films (from "Kindergarten Cop" to "Beverly Hills Cop 2"). Gleason is doing very well with what he has given, but he doesn't quite come to feel where Wayne feels much. It's hard to tell if it's Gleason's problem or material. There is one moment - where Wayne (who is Darcy's brother, although Danny or April knows it) reads Danny's diary and realizes the sexual and emotional link between the two men - just knowing that Wayne is going to go homophobic Danny's ass. But the explosion never comes. (Thanks! Trite suddenly is the death of the film noir.) Once the revelation about the brothers and sisters comes to the end of the film, the audience is pretty surprised to realize the depth of love and compassion. Wayne really felt for Darcy - so deep that Wayne accepted. Danny's homosexual love for his bisexual brother. But it all happens on the screen. Gleason never gets the chance to find Wayne's feelings. It should have been very frustrating for the artist. <br /> <br /> The story is quite inventive, although the smuggling piece seen at the end of the movie is likely to remind viewers of "Diamonds Are Forever" (yes, James Bond). A traditional narrative voice over (proving that Franco is just as much a voice as he is a physical actor) offers a tremendous atmosphere, though it usually flows several times in the skemaltz to the end of the film. (which gives unintentional laughter). Site sites play key visual roles in the movie. Kudos scout the place for finding such amazing buildings! The end of the movie made me slightly upset; Not complaining, but a little firm for my film noir taste. <br /> <br /> Now I've seen audiences, hate or love Blind Spot. Modern film audiences, exposed to extreme cruelty and violence, often have little appreciation for the subtleties of film noir. My suggestion is to take a small group of friends who do not see despair, emotional collapse, despair or depression. Bring them to a small theater, where they can glory in the spectacle of the film's vision, but where their performance will not be destroyed by a crowd of people who will not recognize good film noir. Get them some popcorn (trust me, they'll be so worried that they won't finish), get a cool drink, and let them be overwhelmed. Go a little clear and cheerful to the place to wash the dirt and discomfort out of your soul. Because this movie is so good to make you feel, you will need the restorative.
