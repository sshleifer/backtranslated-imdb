Greetings again from the darkness. Director Alejandro Amenabar creates life against all chances in this on the basis of a true story version of one man's struggle to control his fate. The great Javier Bardem is fascinating to watch in his role as Ramon. His eyes and head movements leave little doubt about what goes on in his mind. The dream and fantasy sequences are not overused, so prove very effective in explaining why he wants what he wants. Rather than forcing us to answer the euthanasia question, the real question was asked: What is love? At every turn we see people in love, looking for love or dying to be loved. The writing is stiff and keeps the movie moving, though it is mostly filmed in one room. The supportive role is wonderful and we really feel pain and how every family member deals with Ramon's decision. It's a gem and deserves to be seen.
