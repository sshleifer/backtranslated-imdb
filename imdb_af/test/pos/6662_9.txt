Anthony Minghela (writer / director) Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive and intelligent drama placed in the social context of the confederation during the civil war. It deals with the politics of war in a very subtle and realistic way. While accurately portraying the brutality and inhumanity of the war, it does not make many films related to this period so effective. Cold Mountain studies the southern context of the interior and shows changes among the non-slave-owned community who worked through the war. And almost unique, Cold Mountain does not proclaim southern, northern or anyone else. <br /> <br /> The movie surfer by genres as needed - never offers a dull moment. It is a romance, a war story, an action adventure and historical fiction. Everything is beautiful in one weight. <br /> <br /> The story focuses on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) for very simple reasons, beaten to each other. As these young romance began to nod, Inman argued in the confederal army, taking a book Ada had given him, and a picture of her. Ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third-person perspective, but the story is clear from the beginning to the end. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. She started the film as a daddy's girl who was skilled in many of the arts that were expected to learn most of the southern women who surrounded most of their lives. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a master of everything that is useless. <br /> <br /> Ada's dad is over, and she is left to manage his modest estate herself. With so much experience, she struggles and survives by keeping Inman's memory near her heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities that Ada lacks, and if they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love each other as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he saw many friends murdered for the causes they didn't really believe in and decided to leave. No one he meets comes to his rescue, as he starts a thousand miles back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie takes place during Inman's long walk. both of the lead actors as they live, learn, grow and change. An ongoing act of despair will preserve their intense passionate love. For Inman, this is his only source of hope in a world of pure despair. For Ada it is very similar, but also a symbol and remnant of the old south - a world that is rapidly passing. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes that give the film a strong sense of history. The writing and editing are also extremely strong - reflecting the broad class and educational differences in the ancient bell southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the film of this film nothing of perfection should be expected. And the wheelchair, mostly, rises to the occasion. My one criticism, however, relates to the accents adopted by Kidman and the characters of the law. An Australian and a Briton are unlikely to be expected to reproduce the South American speech accurately, but there are a few times where these two particularly talented actors produce distracting vocal slips. I admit my misfortune and can certainly say that it will not bother most people. Zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character I will remember in my senesence. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
