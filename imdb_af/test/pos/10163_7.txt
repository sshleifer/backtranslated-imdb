Hitchcock's repetition of his 1934 film relates to the well-known story of McKenna's marriage (James Stewart, Doris Day, first edition Leslie Banks, Edna Best) with their 11-year-old son traveling during holidays through Morocco. In a bus they know a sympathetic French person (Daniel Gelin, in the old version of Pierre Fresnay). While in Marrakech, they also know a few (Bernard Miles and Brenda De Banzie) and suddenly happen at the scene of a murder, the dying whisper a political message. Then the kid is kidnapped to ensure their silence and McKenna gets help to Morocco's help. Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman). <br /> <br /> It's a great movie about a family stomping on a dark international conspiracy and then being forced into action, played excellently by James Stewart and Doris Day. This thrilling movie shows excitement, plot, excitement and interesting drama, well written by John Michael Hayes and Charles Bennett. Grab a regular theme of the suspension wizard: innocent people are trapped in a cobweb intrigue and rude, intelligent villains. Colorful and glittering cinematography shot in Morocco and London studios by cameraman Robert Burks, though with excessive transparency for Marrakech scenes. Lavisse sets by Henry Bunstead, Hitchcock's regular, and works until his recent death. Of course, the highlights are the events of the famous Royal Albert Hall or London assassination attempted by a trigger killer, Reggie Nalder, while composer Bernard Herrmann performs orchestra. In addition to the climax Doris Day singing "Sera Sera, Que sera," her son had been in danger, the song Oscar for Ray Evans, Jay Livingstone. The story has been cruelly reviewed for its dual characters, but today it is considered a classic movie and quite entertaining. Rating: Better than average, Hitchcock's enthusiastic will undoubtedly enjoy it.
