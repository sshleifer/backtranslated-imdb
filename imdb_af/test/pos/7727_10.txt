I enjoyed Carmen much better than the original sin (Angelina Jolie & Antonio Bandaras), who share some thematic similarities, and which I also really enjoyed. I felt the play was stronger here (Paz Vega showed a wider range, more fire, and Sbaraglia was great too). Overall, their acting was more eager, more credible (less dreamy than Original Sin, and both actors here had less "celebrity status" and "pretty face" to rely on making the movie work. Vega sizzles definitely, as expected . <br /> <br /> Director Vincente Aranda has also built up a detailed world (again better than Original Sin) with which you can feel the filth and daily rise of archaic Spain - for example, people who download goods from a car On street, workers who change the street lamp candles, all in the background of the action. <br /> <br /> While I am very pleased with the recent idea of ​​our femme-lethal losses (such as Brian de Palma's Femme Fatale) , is a pleasant, modern show in the tradition of the noir classic double insurance, and is a pleasing pleasure to watch, another good example of the triumph of bold European films about glamor and auction get Hollywood prize.
