I drive slowly through as many Hong Kong action movies as I can get my hands on and come across this gem - mainly because of Ching Wan Lau who is one of my favorite actors. <br /> <br /> It's a great action movie, but not as OTT as the title might suggest. It moves very fast and is really enjoyable. <br /> <br /> The biggest surprise of this movie was the soundtrack. It seems as if Rob Dougan - the man who did the 'Clubbed To Death' song, which was popular in 'The Matrix', lifted the Big Bullet's soundtrack and put it in one of the songs on his 'Furious Angels' album compiled; The particular melody is called 'I no longer drive' and is also the opening stamp for the TV series 'Law and Order' AND the opening strip on the 'Matrix Reloaded' DVD menu teaser! It really surprised me because of the sheer coincidence!
