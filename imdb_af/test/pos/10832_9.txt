This movie continues on 8 shots, 2 kisses and 100 clich√©s as possible. Yet it still works. Brilliant. <br /> <br /> When I was at home from the theater, I tried to find out how it came to film stalls, such as the pages of a new manuscript waving across the beach or the impossible series of casual coincidences without the whole hearing stood up and shouted: "I've seen it a million times before! And you've pushed beyond the verge of credibility! " But the actors were so captivating and the screen was so full of credible extras I forgot to care for. A friend who saw it with me transferred him so perfectly to Paris to be disappointed when we left the theater and realized that we were still in Indiana. <br /> <br /> Overall, a romantic comedy thriller with subtlety, white and elan.
