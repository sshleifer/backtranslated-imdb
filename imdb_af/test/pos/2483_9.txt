This extraordinary pseudo-documentary, made in 1971, perfectly captures the United States' geyser today. This makes it increasingly scary and relevant. "Subversives" (college students, hippies, black activists, academics) are set up by government and given long prison terms for the amount of crimes and social protests. As an alternative to life in prison, these convicted "criminals" are offered three days in "Penalty Park". Their goal in the park is to make their way to the American flag where freedom awaits them. Not surprisingly, the option Punishment Park is a dirty lie. This brilliant movie by Peter Watkins, even pre-dates "Battle Royale" and "Series 7", although his angle of attack is more blatantly political. Shot in '71, it looks and feels as fresh as anything made today. The performances are exemplary and the direction is zipper sharp. The story cuts back and forth between different groups to survive the harsh conditions of the park and the McCarthy-like trials they found guilty. Today, this film still retains its power. In '71 nothing but nothing. This is a masterpiece that succeeds at a dozen levels. It has the balls that most people lost today.
