After reading some of these reviews, it is clear that some have missed the point. What's good about this movie (here's the point), which is incredible about this movie, which is amazing about this movie is that there is no proselytizing. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. There is no preaching. Life goes on. It's a masterpiece to make an audience think of its collective self. Only children do children - without consciousness. We all went to school with children like this. Feck's (Dennis Hopper's big) girl alone and his relationship with her is worth the price to rent it out. <br /> <br /> movies. <br /> <br /> There were some movies before or after that measured the intelligence of this movie. AMEN. <br /> <br />
