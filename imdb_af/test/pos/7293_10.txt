All I have to say is that this movie is the bomb. You will cry when you see it. I mean, it's a reminder of everyone how difficult and easy it is to fall in love. It reminds you of the days during your youth when you were restless and all that was bad for you was washed away with a single kiss. Even though I'm still a teenager, it's how I live my life. When I'm with that certain person, everything that's negative in my mind is erased. So, I give this movie a 10 for his sincere message and plot touch. Actors Josh Hartnett and Chris Klein I also give a 10 for a cute face.
