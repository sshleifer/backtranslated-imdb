The music is by Stravinsky (and not by silly incompetent Philip Glass) and was written ten years before the unlucky birth of glass. The performance is simply extraordinary. The story in Japanese adds a threat quality and intensity to the Latin version. compare Terzieff's version. The giant heads and hands are completely justified by the mythical aspect of the story. The props and make-up used for the pest are simply on the point. This is Taymor's best work. The singers are very good, especially Terfel. Langridge is very moving and clean, and Norman finds the right expression, and her beauty is great here and finds its right place: bigger than life. Simply a must.
