Absolutely incredible! Humor, beat music and an anti-war message probably make it the best movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> First of all, I like how clever this movie is, especially in the Vietnam part of the plot. It's interesting how they look ridiculous to the army officials who enforce the concept. Follow this with the serious situation of the real war, and then the conclusion (which makes me angry with anger at war); and yet there is absolutely no violence on the screen. Wow. <br /> <br /> The music is really cool too. But what is very unique in this musical (as opposed to Evita, or Wizard of Oz, for example) is that the lyrics do not tell the story. The mood (along with the footage and inter-song dialogue): "Donna" is an exciting song that highlights the happy mood, while "Flesh Failures" has a rich, intense beat in a small key. <br /> <br /> Also, note that the LSD scene is not very flattering. Now I'm definitely not going to do drugs (not what I ever meant). <br /> <br /> Taking all that into account, it's a great movie. The only negative comment I can make is that it is sometimes difficult to hear the dialogue. But who cares? 10/10 stars!
