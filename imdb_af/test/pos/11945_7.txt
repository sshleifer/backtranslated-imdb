This movie is similar to "Better Off Dead" as it is of the same star. However, this one is not so good. Granted it's pretty funny and nice, there's something about "Better ... what I want, better." This one went to Nantucket to spend those summer holidays there. As they meet the girl trying to save her. From this man who wants to turn it into a lobster restaurant. This man doesn't really look like lobster, because in one scene he puts it in boiling water and places a stethoscope so he can hear it shouting. The main character is torn between this girl and the boy's son of the man who wants to make the restaurant. Somehow, this results in a great performance of the boat race, as in the "Summer Rental", though it does work a little better here and fit it into the plot is a bit better. Although what is the handling of the boat racing at this time? Was there some strange fascination with them? For the most part, this movie is a good clip, but 'Better Off Dead' was even better because it was the first and the jokes worked better.
