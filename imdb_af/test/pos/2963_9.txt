A talented high school senior with a bad attitude is forced to play in the state all-star high school football game. When he meets and falls for a handsome local girl, she helps him realize he has a shot at a full rally when he's playing well. <br /> <br /> Too often this drama falls into formal fall and tells the same old story of a troubled and confused teenager. FULL RIDE's Matt Sabo adapts to this profile, but below the surface is a much more unique individual than we usually see in this genre. Matt is at the center of the action and he is a realistic teen, both confident and vulnerable, optimistic and cynical by turns. Matt is influenced by Amy in a character and heart man. He, in turn, forms friendships with his teammates, influencing his growth as an athlete and team player. <br /> <br /> FULL RIDE has all the elements we love to watch in a movie - admirable characters, exciting sports scenes, sad drama and a love story. Yet, while watching these elements in other films, FULL RIDE is assisted by actions that are sincere and sometimes even moving. Perhaps it is the most impressive of FULL RIDE that is the reality. Although the author of the previous comment disagrees (clearly a dissatisfied student who has received a poor degree in his film class for reasonably obvious reasons), Mark Hoeger directs the film into a credible situation and place and makes a good job of the abyss of life in a small village. These characters are true people rooted in realistic situations, which often create the most compelling entertainment. On one level it is a love story, on another it is a character study, and another is a simple football movie. All these ideas come together to form a coherent vehicle.
