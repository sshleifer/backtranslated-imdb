Reasonably effective horror / science fiction a la "Alien" is fairly well done given its limited ambitions. Some good special effects and well-advanced action sequences correctly pick the cracks in the rather tiring dialogue. When a spacecraft crashes into a remote planet, the survivors soon become aware that in the dark of the coming total eclipse, they are waiting for a terrible terror.
