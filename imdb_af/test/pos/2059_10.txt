This film is a great drama of action and comedy, it comes right in the beginning, there is no boring build up. The mainstream chemistry contributes to the excitement and anticipation of the end, although my suspicions were not satisfied. The special effects worked brilliantly and were credible! Would have liked a different end, but it still made me feel emotional. The story line unfolds well, but it is a movie that you have to look from start to finish to be careful about all the details, to fully understand and enjoy maximum enjoyment. <br /> <br />
