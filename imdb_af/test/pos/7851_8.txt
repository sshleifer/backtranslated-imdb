I was amazed at this early performance by Clint Eastwood. I didn't read a summary of the movie when I decided to watch it on TV. Due to Mr. Eastwood I didn't expect some good shooting ranges and no deep story. I was completely wrong. I have addressed some topics very explicitly, and to the end I couldn't think of who's good and who's bad. This movie is definitely not typically Eastwood, but definitely worth watching.
