This year's Royal Rumble wasn't really bad, but last year was definitely better. <br /> <br /> FIRST MATCH-SHAWN MICHAELS USA. SIDE Although this game took a little too long, it was quite right. Edge wins after using the ropes to pen Shawn Michaels. 4/10 <br /> SEC / MATCH SUBSCRIBER VS. HEIDENREICH IN A PURCHASE MATCH Now I don't look much like Casket games, but this game was boring and messy, but eventually it picked up the pace when Undertaker met the Tombstone. Then Heidenreich rolled into the coffin for victory. 4/10 <br /> <br /> THIRD MATCH-JBL VS. CALL ANGLE VSA. GREAT SHOP IN A TURNING WRAP FOR THE WWE WOMAN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad triple threat stamp. Sorry, JBL wins again to keep his title after beating a hell of a line of hell on the corner for victory. 5/10 <br /> <br /> FOURTH MATCH-RANDY ORTON USA. TRIPLE H FOR THE WORLD HIGH ROAD CHAMPIONSHIP Great game by these two men, the game was a bit messy, but it was still good and it picked up quite properly. Although Orton lost the game, it was fast and good at the end. HHH nails the family tree at Orton for the victory to retain its World Title. 5/10 <br /> FIFTH MATCH-ROYAL RUMBLE It was a cool Royal Rumble {Every Royal Rumble is good}. After all 30 men entered, the last four remaining superstars were in the Rumble Cena, Edge, Mysterio & Batista. Edge was able to spear out Mysterio, later Batista & Cena joined. It was now Cena & Batista. Only after he turned an F-U, Batista went to the Batista bomb, but suddenly both men came out on the outside at the same time. After a controversial decision and mr. McMahon, making his way to the ring to fix the case. The match was restarted after Batista and Cena challenged it, but Batista got the best out of Cena, clipped a backbone and cast Cena to win the 2005 Royal Rumble and go to Wrestlemania 21 to meet the Champion in the lead . . 10/10 It was a very good Royal Rumble, but last year every Royal Rumble will always be top of the list. <br /> <br /> Overall: I give it 8/10 & B +
