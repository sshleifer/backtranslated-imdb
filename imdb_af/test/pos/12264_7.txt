James L. Brook is one of those directors who always looks a strange look at life. Not only is he the producer of "The Simpsons", but he has some classic comedies under his belt. "Broadcast News" is one of them. <br /> <br /> Although it doesn't fit his later effort, as good as it gets, "Broadcast News" is still a very clever, funny and witty movie about a television broadcast station and all the issues There is a great comic sequence of physical humor where Joan Cusack is running around the building and trying to get a news band after a few minutes to reach the modification room before being broadcast live on TV. <br /> < Not only is it a lot of truth in terms of how busy broadcast stations operate, but also an experienced and honest portrayal of people. <br /> <br /> A low key, subtle movie with good acting (especially from Hurt, which I do not always want so much) and appetite direction.
