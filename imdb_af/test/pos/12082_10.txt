Whoever loves my children has changed my heart, it made me cry all the time, most of which I cried was when the family had to say goodbye to the baby. I cried most about it and every time a child was adopted I cried when they had to say goodbye to their mother. It was sad that they had lost their mother. I was sorry for the child with epilepsy. I was glad he was adopted by the same family as one of his brothers. To me that boy I thought was the special one because he was in a house. I feel special because I'm in a world with Aspergers syndrome, and sometimes when I feel, I sometimes want to cry. I really enjoyed this movie, 10 out of 10. A real story, very good. Another movie that will bring tears into your eyes, I think will be Tuesday's Met Morrie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0207805)
