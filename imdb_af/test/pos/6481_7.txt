I watched the movie about 13 years ago while living in Airlie Beach Qld Australia. I found it in the shelves of a small back store that didn't bother most. <br /> <br /> To my delight, I found and watched it, with the intention of one day possessing it and being in my collection. I haven't got it yet, but will one day. <br /> <br /> I love the concept of poetry and fantasy. The semi-abandoned street tunnels with a busy team town in the distant background contributed to the visual effect. <br /> <br /> I've mentioned this movie several times to people who enjoy this genre, with nothing but praise. It stuck in my mind and will come for a long time. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie, but only to those in this type. <br /> <br /> This comment and The One of LA, CA can help you when you want to watch this movie. The comment may be negative, but I found them positive if you look beyond the vanishing connotation.
