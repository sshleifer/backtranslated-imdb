It was one of those movies I would always overcome (whether on television or cheap DVD), but never beat me to give it a shot, because I thought I didn't lose much. It was one night and I thought oh well? why not. A good decision too, because I would kick myself for so long to get there. For me it impressed me because it is there with Burt Reynold's best features ('Deliverance', 'White Lightning' and 'Boogie Nights') and returning to the 70s / 80s gritty, hardboiled urban crime addicts who were not scared . To prevent them being unconditionally darkened and going out of their way to compose characters, packing it with realistic brutal power and effectively capturing local places (Atlanta here) after the fold with well-founded photography. In some shades it reminded me of 'Dirty Harry', but it's loosely. However, it is a bad dog blues score with its quirky kicks, funky shifts and unprecedented sounds. I thought a lot about Lalo Schifrin's pulsating score he orchestrated for Dirty Harry. The music soundtrack on the other hand is hit or miss. <br /> <br /> Sgt. Tom Sharky was an Atlantic narcotic agent before an outbreak during a bust saw him as a teaching work. Together with his new team, they come across a prostitution ring that catches their interest, because it is owned by one difficult track and convincingly criminal. What they are digging up involves a prominent government figure and a call that they can give important names, but they must come to her before she has made a target. <br /> <br /> Burt Reynold's deeds, but also in an unconscious and muscular manner that would suit his laconically stubborn performance and Gerald Di Pego's thematic, hard-bitten and sturdy script (adapted from William Diehl's novel ). Well, he does show some kind of heart / insightful minds under the arms of the behind British actress Rachel Ward, whether it's the extinct screens if he views her from another building (and is slowly confused by her) when they finally come together, but these latter interactions in the middle of the hand slowly make the momentum, but give it noir as strokes. The performances are fairly right on Reynold's formulation of a good report with exceptional actors Charles Durning, Earl Holliman, Brian Keith, Richard Libertini and Bernie Casey. The turbulent profanity and witty dialogue between these guys was an explosion. Regarding the corrupt villains, Vittorio Gassman is building impressive power and strength, but it is Henry Silva (who apparently was born for these roles) a little wobbly and unstoppable twist that makes the show. Where his appearance seems to describe things to come and help them get in place. Plus its adrenaline-filled and violent cat and mouse climb with Sharky and his team was done brilliantly. <br /> <br /> The thrilling action runs can be fast and dry, but remain pleasantly violent like an incredible tooth-milling interrogation sequence. Some handy, old-fashioned filming techniques add to the tension. The intriguing material holds it fairly tactically in nature, but if we think of the smooth sail, it offers a blunt surprise or two with some intense-brown confrontations.
