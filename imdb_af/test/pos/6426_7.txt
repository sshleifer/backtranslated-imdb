Alice (Florinda Bolkan), a translator living in Italy, discovers that she has a memory loss and cannot remember for the last few days. She began with a trace of memory fragments, which led her to the small town of Garma. People in the village seem to recognize her and she begins to suspect that the reviving nightmares of astronauts doing horrible experiments have something to do with her own amnesia. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting and the plot is good. but it is a little slow and mobile for my taste. The plot takes some nice twists and it is really hard to find out where it is going. Florinda Bolkan is good in her role (but even better in "Flavia the Heretic") and it is always nice to see star actor Nocoletta Elmi. Klaus Kinski's role, however, is too small. It is not a movie for the mortal or addict, but still a very enjoyable hour and a half secret.
