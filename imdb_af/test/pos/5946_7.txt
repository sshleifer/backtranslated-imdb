Pretty amusing spoof with great attention to detail re: the appearance of the 1960s espionage movies and the way the action was at the moment. The battle room in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with a Peter Lorre lookalike added to the mix of villains. A big plus: Jean Dujardin is hot and the scene in which he was tied without a shirt was a highlight. Plus his eyebrows deserve some kind of recognition to do a good job. <br /> <br /> Quite apart: the people behind me in the theater continued after every plot switch as if they were watching a "real" spy thriller. <br /> <br /> Before the movie started, a "Get Smart" trailer was selected. The preview made the movie look terrific with attempts to record the jokes and gags of the TV series. Looks like a bomb and quite a contrast to the relatively sublime jokes and gags of OSS 117, but of course OSS had its share of misfires. However, the overall tone of OSS was not an insult to the audience's intelligence, and the material did not feel as if it had been plunged. I got the clear impression that if I understood the language, I would have caught more of the jokes, and especially (the pistol gag) was in the interpretation for the caption abuse.
