This is the only thing I can look back on from 2006 and now it is shaken. It was blowing hard, and still it was nice. Mr. MEATLOAF added a nice bit to this dish of a movie before the opening credits even rolled. Now it tells you something, filmed it even before it started! Now I don't want to give away too much or be a "spoiler", but this movie is ROCKED! If you heard the new album and thought to yourself, "It looks a bit substandard. Fabulous stuff, it's like I'm just playing badminton with Satan, who gives?" Then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece. For those who want it better, don't know what they want because better will no longer be the D. This movie is the D period. If you dare to rock your socks, dare to venture into the local theater.
