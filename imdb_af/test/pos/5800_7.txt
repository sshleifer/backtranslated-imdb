The Captain and Tennille released a very good 3 DVD package with minimal editing. Unlike most variety of display releases, these shows are not hacked. The music and dance numbers are included in the sketch, just as they were during the first broadcast. I suspect some music numbers on the DVD might have been modified in performances in which they did not originally appear, but could not check the suspicion. I noticed some discrepancies between what was on the DVD and program information I found on the internet. I couldn't verify if the net information was inaccurate or if the music shows were edited in the shows on the DVD. Whatever the truth, I am very grateful for the efforts made by the manufacturing company. I wish that every variety show released would show the same respect for the format. I would guess that about half of the exhibits will be aired. I believe they ran legal problems on the shows that were not included. Hopefully these problems can be solved and a Volume 2 can be released somewhere in the future. There are some individual music videos along with a dance rehearsal among the extras. I recommend this DVD to any C&T fan.
