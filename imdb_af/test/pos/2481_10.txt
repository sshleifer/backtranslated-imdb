The trial group includes a feminist, a black panther and a folk song. <br /> <br /> Those convicted by a Conservative Tribunal have the choice of a long prison sentence or three days in Penalty Park, in which they can achieve their freedom by reaching an American flag in the desert. They should reach it without food or water. They are also pursued by armed national guards and police who can return them to the camp if they are caught to face the sentence sentenced to each convicted person. The reality is different; Those who choose Penalty Park are hunted and killed or cruel, without hope to gain their freedom after a policeman died in the park. The park is a training ground for the police and guards who have to master these acts of oppression so that they can be used in the open American society. <br /> <br /> Shot at 16mm and in the documentary style developed by Watkins, in his celebrated Culloden and controversial The War Game for the BBC; He interacts with the prisoners and guards and sees the unconstitutional trial, intersecting them to create a completely convincing political film that remains vital and relevant. With his knowledge of the medium, Watkins made a rich, inexorable and ultimately frightening film depiction of a completely fictitious US political detention camp that would not convince whether it was not his flawless construction. Many of the actors are amateurs who improvise with broad characters. The sparks fly into the trial scenes in which every case is heard, including that Watkins has tried them from the jury to film those scenes. Watkins also claims that the actors often express their own opinions, explaining the anger as well as the credibility of their actions. <br /> <br /> The film is strongly criticized for polarizing the views of those who see it. The film is said to represent reactionary and unmistakable that conservatism and war are the root of America's social problems. While this criticism is valid, it is important to consider that the film works on a fictional, metaphorical level and that is perhaps the realism that the film so cleverly conveys that encourages such a warm opinion to its content. In fact, the film's main theme is the problem of polarization itself. The 'conservative' judges and brutal judicial officers are on the one hand and the 'liberal' convictions are clear, on the other hand, without any concessions on either side. It seems to be what the movie is about. The new law and the park itself is the outgrowth of a situation where mediation between the two political positions has been lost. <br /> <br /> During and in protest against the Vietnam war and the treatment of those who oppose the war In America, the film's main themes of government persecution of its own citizens and conservatism in terms of civil liberties continue to be the same in the era of the Patriot act and the identity card. It also strikes a disturbing chord with news footage from Guantanamo Bay and the treatment of Iraqi prisoners in the hands of Allied forces. <br /> <br /> The threat of internal terrorism is such a brief problem that the movie cannot fail. to link to current attitudes towards the subject. Not surprisingly, the film had a vast distribution history, which was marginalized by its content, but the disturbing fact that this movie is still so relevant today suggests that the waiting time was nothing. Penalty Park is a movie that had to fight to see everywhere and it requires your attention.
