SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love the Simpsons, and I've seen every single episode ever come out. I have to admit that the season is by far the most underrated season, and this is the most underrated season episode. The episode begins with the family playing a game of Scrabble to prepare Bart for an intelligence test he has to take at school. He says the game is stupid and he doesn't want to play it, but he must do it. He speaks a word that Homer fears and he beats Bart around the house. The next day Mrs. Scratch the class that the test is not part of their degree, just a test that will tell them how their future will be. Bart can't answer one question. He thinks quickly. He quickly tests test with Martin Prince, the smartest in class. Later that day Marge and Homer are called to go to the Rector's office to discuss Bart's behavior. Suddenly the school psychologist suddenly comes out and tells Skinner and Homer and Marge that Bart is a genius and goes to a special school for the gifted. Bart agrees to go as he does not have to do homework. The next day, Homer Bart drives to the new school. He was introduced to everyone and everything. Unfortunately, his day is not very good. The clever students take his lunch smartly, he can't read any comics, but he does anyway, and he is criticized by his fellow students. Fortunately for Bart, he and Homer start with each other, but Marge buys tickets for an opera. They go to the opera and enjoy it. The next day he goes to his old school, but is made happy by his friends. They call him a point keeper. While at his new school, Bart is advised to do a Chemistry experiment. He does it wrong and blows up the school and leaves himself green. Bart is told by the psychologist to tell him why he did this. Instead, Bart tells him he wants to go and go back to his old school to observe other children. The psychologist is intrigued and he asks Bart to explain it on a piece of paper. He finds it too hard and writes instead a confession that he really is not a genius. He gives it to the psychologist. All he cares about is that he spelled the word confession wrong. That night, Homer Baths told Bart and Bart that he really wasn't a genius and that he was deceiving on the test. Homer gets angry and chases Bart around the house as Lisa and Marge watch them. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a very underrated season one episode. <br /> <br /> 8/10
