This film sets the standard for African American film excellence when made. I have heard several films on the film several times, that there was an indication of the nomination of an Oscar Oscar when it was released. This movie plays on different emotions, and you definitely feel for all the characters. Certainly, some of the plays are a little wood, but fortunately those parts are not decisive. The music is sensational, and if you don't think the end is a tear-jerk, you have no heart in your chest. Looking at "Cooley High", you'll see many, many movies have copied different elements of it to enhance their own movies. The biggest example of this is "Boyz N The Hood".
