It was such a beautiful movie. Such an incredible performance by Joseph and Brad. Written and executed very innocently. A must see !! I almost took out my eyes all over the movie. It is a movie that every family should sit with their children to watch, it teaches us all a very important lesson in life and how to approach the hard topic of AIDS, how to teach our children how to handle it and people around them. Not just with Aids, but with any terminal disease. I didn't even hear about this movie until I got through t.v. someday and happen to run over it. I recommend everyone to see it, don't forget to forget your box tissue. More movies should be made like this. Extremely heartwarming.
