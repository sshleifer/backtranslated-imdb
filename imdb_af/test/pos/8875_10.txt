This movie is extremely funny - the character of mom keeps me back to the movie again and again! I can't get enough of her dry lines ... like when she tells her Owen's son to bury his friend in the backyard before smelling the place ... and her suspicion that Owen is trying to kill her by giving her unsalted nuts! It's hilarious! <br /> <br /> If you like movies like National Lampoon's Vacation, Uncle Buck, or planes, trains and cars, it has similar humor. It's a good, healthy laugh ... a must see!
