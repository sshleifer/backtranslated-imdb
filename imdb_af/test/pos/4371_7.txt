George Carlin is probably my favorite comedian. I saw so many of his presentations and even had the opportunity to see him play. He had a certain cynicism that always addressed me. His last 2 specials (life is especially worth losing and grievances and grievances) lacked a certain spirit and content. George appears overweight, old and tired (not to mention rehab). "I did not say that!"! Anyway. Life is worth losing. It was especially tragic because he was overweight, dissatisfied, descended from rehab (there we go again ...) and extremely unfriendly. If there was a way to feel sorry for a comedian without taking him off the stage, George did it with the Life that is worth losing. It is as if the New Millennium and Post 9/11 America trampled George's spirit. The bs got too big to manage. <br /> <br /> The return is partially successful with It's Bad for Ya! This special is the transmutation completed. George is no longer trying to revive his glory days. He is in full acceptance of his age, is old and deals with the impending prospects of death. He accepted that he was a crunchy old SOB and rejoiced. It's better than its previous offers, but far from Jammin 'in New York. It's a little tragic. His observations are no longer cutting edge and look more like Andy Rooney and Lenny Bruce. George is no longer George. He does not criticize us anymore, but is the man in the high castle pointing out how things were and how different modern life is. <br /> <br /> This is an improvement over the previous two special offers, but George has not yet restored his old glory (as ever). He has been reduced from critical social and political offensive comments to mostly personal peeves. When he goes politics, he still has something to say. It is heavily distracted (especially if you have seen any of its previous work), but it still works somehow, as opposed to its random rations that have some relevance outside the baby. The last 25 minutes are the best that this special offer offers. <br /> <br /> For now, I will worship the sun and worship Joe Pesci that George can recreate himself as a forefront of the Septuagain. This is a 50/50 chance. Life looks more boring to George and his "art" is now his life. This is a step in the right direction of his previous 2 specials, but is far from his old self. Where does he go from here? He can never regain, but maybe he can further metamorphose / refine this new old-fashioned man routinely. Heres to hope for another 7 words you can't say on television or at least a windmill he can handle.
