The movie of the 60's was as much like the time of revolution as politics and music. Filmmakers dared to make avant-garde films that discussed taboo subjects that were first allowed into exploitation movies. Starting with both "Breathless" and underground American cinema (like Kenneth Anger), films have become increasingly experimental. All this accumulated when Hollywood realized they had a great commercial appeal with "Easy Rider". One of the best (and most surprising) outputs of this era was also one of the least successful initially. "Head" was made when The Monkees' career declined, which is one of the best psychedelic films ever made. <br /> <br /> The plot? Well, there really isn't one, as many have said. This entails that the Monkees go from one surreal scenario to the next. However, these sequences are, of course, LSD-toned and basically mocking how The Monkees were ill to be limited to their light pre-fab reputation. It's a pity that the movie didn't find an audience. The teenagers they loved put on a new red as they always do. The movie's psychedelic / Haight-Ashbury crowd will never be killed at a Monkees movie. It's all their loss. This movie may be less, but it is certainly not meaningless and is very intelligently compiled. The crew later made both "Easy Rider" and "Five Easy Pieces". The film was later revived in a 1973 Raybert retrospect, and it received a very positive response, giving it the cult it has long earned. Ironically, the Monkeys would be the victim of the same commercialism they protest in this film with their later 80's reunion. (10/10)
