When I was very young, my mom had a series of four Looney Tunes / Mare Melodies shorts on tape and I watched them several times. A Coy Decoy was one of those shorts, and I was really shocked to read in another comment that it was banned. When I was young, I probably didn't even understand the Black Beauty gag. Yet, it's probably why it's banned, but until I watched it on a video site, I didn't even remember the gag. After watching the video, I remembered some shots - especially the shrinkage of Daffy's hat and Daffy's eyes turned clockwise when the lid surrounded him in The Lake. I was not bothered by the gag that was probably the reason why the gag was banned. Instead, I was flooded with childhood memories to look at this brief. Because of how much I kept as short as a child, I give it 7 out of 10.
