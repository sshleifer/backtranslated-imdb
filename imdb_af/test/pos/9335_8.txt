It may be a bit cranky and it can never have the impact it once had, but it is still an exciting reminder of what Michael Jackson could ever do. Looking back for the first time since his first prominence, I was not hit by the horror spots - beautiful, but nice, and Vincent Price never sounded so completely, non-campus (sic?) Threatening - as the recording the horror movie, so that Jackson, behind genre and make-up, gives us a brave revealing portrait of male sexuality. Because THRILLER isn't really about horror, in the way horror isn't really about horror: it's about the old-fashioned theme, the sexual awakening of a young woman. The film opens in a theater, with Jackson's girlfriend uncomfortable with the images and the aggressive gender reaction. Of course she is on a date, and she is less afraid of the movie than she knows, will be expected by her boyfriend. <br /> <br /> The mainstream image of the movie they see, the group temperature all propose socially-conditioned expectations. It not only leads her to think in the disgust of the body - hence all the dilapidated ghouls; The loss of her virginity is seen as a kind of death - but the sexual ritual is not just about her boyfriend, but also of her friends, her society, hence his visualization as a gangster. <br /> <br /> These are brilliant, disturbing things, the best thing ever done by Landis director. Jackson, the most popular artist on the planet, was still willing to show that the solid image of a star contains crowds, not all reassuring. The song itself performed remarkably, the creepy, persistent bass rhythm, the extraordinarily sluggish lyrics, the beautiful 70s disco ecstasy that suffocates the chorus, breaks timelessness and reveals the milky desire behind the fear.
