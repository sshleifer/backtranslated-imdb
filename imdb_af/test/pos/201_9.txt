A true masterpiece of Soviet cinematography. It is a pity for the Soviet Union that Samojlova never had the opportunity to play in Western movies - but then she will probably never find her again. In "Letyat Zhuravli" she is unforgettable. It was one of the few movies I was crying ... <br /> <br /> In addition to Samojlova, Batalov and Merkurev, who were the best rate, it was a brilliant job of the director and operator who made it . film all the time classic worldwide. Just remember the scenes of piano music and suggestions under the heavy German bombing, or Boris's death with a cloudy sky above his head and his last visions appearing in the sky. The very simple means - but the great technique added to the emotional weight. Mind you, 20 years before "The Star Wars", 41 years before "Titanic", and with a Soviet budget.
