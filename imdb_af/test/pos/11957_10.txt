John Cusack dies as Hoops in this silly little movie that should be one of the best of the eighties teenage comedies. Keep it or not Demi Moore is his co-star ... If you like the eighties, you grew up around that time, or a fear-driven teenager is getting ready to laugh. Wait until you see the cartoons. What a riot.
