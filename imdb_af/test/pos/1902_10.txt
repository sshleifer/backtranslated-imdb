Dolemite may not be the first black exploit slip, but it's definitely one of the best. It is a central movie in the Black Exploitation genre as it caused a dramatic shift between the films that occurred, as opposed to the movie that followed it. It was not necessarily a gripping or moving movie about black culture, and it is a struggle to overcome issues such as racism or something so important, but it was the story of a badly-judged dude who " white "with his army of hot kungfu moms. It was a guilty pleasure, very nice and best to see it with friends. (10 out of 10)
