I had a chance to talk to co-creator Rebecca Cammisa at the 2002 High Film Film Festival in Rochester, NY. She said her style was completely open and unobstructed in film-making, but it was very fortunate to be so strict in the home of the group house. The narrow hallways and smaller rooms were expertly shot with a realism that was lost with more controlled and deliberate camera work. <br /> <br /> Sister Helen herself is a remarkable character that comes from the tragedy in her own life to an unusual combination of caring, difficult and street speed. The way the film puts us in the past is excellent, and it spends only a few carefully selected minutes around the world. <br /> <br /> All in all, I can't really roll this movie. It's really a treasure of cinema and the subject is a treasure of humanity.
