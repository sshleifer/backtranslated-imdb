I'm going to make this short and sweet. It is not surprising that you did not use this movie. It is a story about the power, beauty and possibilities inherent in meaningful education. Based on your pathetically compound remarks, I can see that your own education has been disgustingly neglected ... or worse ... totally wasted. Your comment is that of a truly ignorant person. I'll recommend doing something about this condition ... but in your case I feel it's probably too late. My hope is that you do not intend to go to the teaching profession (especially in Film Studies) because you can only do harm. Oh ... one last bit of advice. In the future, if you intend to write more opinions, you really need to proofread. This will make people take you more seriously.
