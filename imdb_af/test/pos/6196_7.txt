Cleverly written, well maintained, intense and exciting. This show lives in the real world, not as fantastic as "24" (and I'm also a big fan of 24, casually). It has credible characters and in many ways is much smarter than most in this genre. It tries to offer both sides of Islam. So far, I've watched the first 4 episodes and balanced the story more evenly. The terrorists are more complex and not one dimensional. And because of the balance, the terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains portrayed in film and television. Last but not least, the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon. I recommend this show to anyone who is a fan of 24 and so on.
