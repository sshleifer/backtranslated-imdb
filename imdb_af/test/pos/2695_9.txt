The king of Queens could be divided into two periods. <br /> <br /> The first era, composed of the first few seasons, depicted the issues of everyday life of a man and his wife made it through life in the city. paycheck by paycheck. <br /> <br /> The second era increased the scope of the show, addressed the current popular culture and marriage issues with a humorous twist. <br /> <br /> But above all ... <br /> <br /> Kevin James, if he doesn't do crap comedy movies with Adam Sandler, is a genius of laughter and his chemistry with Leah Remini was unmatched. on TV. <br /> <br /> Jerry Stiller as the psychotic living father-in-law added his own unique style of strange humor, and Patton Oswalt as the "man-child" Spence Ulchin was wonderful. He's a great comedian too) "The King of Queens" was the final sitcom of the 1990s to go off the air, and it's a damn disgrace. Now, all we have to look at is the idiotic sitcoms full of unhealthy actors and actresses whose only appeal is their physical appearance. I love many fans of actually funny TV shows are now in a raw state
