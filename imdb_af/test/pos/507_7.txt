Overall, I give this movie a decent 7.6. To begin I will say I love how the character is portrayed and adapted on the screen. If you occasionally read delicacies or just watch DVD extras, you'll see that the Blade character is drastically different from the one we see in the movie. Among the changes, Blade is now the most important half-vampire, thus gaining "all their strengths, but not their weaknesses." Of course, this credit goes to David Goyer, a co-founder of the dark comic book genre. Thanks to him, Blade became a much more interesting character and I find him one of my favorite anti-heroes really. Wesley Snipes was born to play this role, but some would probably have had Dezenel Washington or Will Smith (lol). His performance here doesn't have to win exactly Oscar, as the character is chosen, but I'm glad he decided to play the DayWalker in the two pursuers. Also starring is Stephen Dorff as our biggest villain and Kris Kristofferson as Blade's Alfred to speak like that. The acting is actually good and the action sure holds the plot. The opening scene in the club is one of my favorite parts to say. As much as this movie is, there are very few things that bother me about this scroll list with something like "Spider-Man" or "X-Men". Stephen Norrington portrayed the villains in a way I didn't like. Their lines were so full of dirty mouth comedy, it didn't really feel like a cartoon movie. Plus, "La Magra", a bit disappointing than the final villain but the intense sword battle makes it up to me. Not to mention a feeling of extra non-realism: a black man in a leather jacket with a sword sticking out on the day of a policeman in the day, leaves a little how unnoticed by the crowd walking , as it seems. ..dumb. The way of some of his flaws was the music of Mark Isham great and fitted the movie nicely. Fortunately, all these issues have been solved and improved in the beautiful sequel, "Blade 2".
