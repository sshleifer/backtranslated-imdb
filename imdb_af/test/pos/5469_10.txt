Almost no information is available on this movie, or air dates. After a continuous and thorough search I found the DVD to be available for 3.99! -Release date February 28, 2006. Try yahoo / dvd and video. To get this information, I will continue to declare that it is a well-made movie with a true and fascinating story about a mysterious carpenter who builds a very unusual staircase in a church. This is a chance to sell William L. Peterson before C.S.I. to see. changed him in a star. Equally in the story, venerable Barbara Hershey - does anyone remember when she was Barbara Hershey Seagull? I have to write to get it informed. Thanks to the previous commentators for taking the time to recommend this somewhat dark TV movie, which is of course a lasting impression on late.
