In my opinion, directing, editing, lighting and acting (minus Franco) were very good. I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with this movie. I didn't expect much, towards camera angles, sound, etc., but in those areas the movie wasn't bad at all. <br /> <br /> After I watched the movie, I personally got frustrated with both characters because I wanted such two characters to reach out to each other. And I felt that the character of Travis (Franco) wasn't really affected or changed after Terri committed suicide. However, it is probably due to the lack or inability of James Franco to express emotion (of any kind) very well in this movie. I saw a couple of Franco's other films, and for me he just can't subtract it as a scene call for true emotion or facial expressions. The only positive thing he brought to the movie is the possibility that more people will see this movie. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, Rachel Miner's depiction of Terri was well done, and she looks a bright future. I could really see and feel the sadness and emptiness of her character, which made me feel like she was. I just wish I could have seen more in Terri's life before the movie ended. <br /> <br /> For a short movie, this movie was good, but it eventually makes you want more. I wish it could be a little longer to see the characters develop a little more. Despite this, I hope to see more films from the director and crew in the future. :)
