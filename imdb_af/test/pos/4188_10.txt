To experience Head, you really need to understand where the Monkeys were when they filmed it. <br /> <br /> That was when their series came to an end and the group almost broke up. Their inventive and comic series (kind of an American Idol of their day) took four unfamiliar actors and formed a crafted supergroup around them. <br /> <br /> They're taking their "crafted image" and status as the 2nd tiger Beatles. They always felt they were in a box, trapped and unable to find credibility, despite their talents. <br /> <br /> It's also a hell of a musical trippy, inventive (I have the soundtrack) and full of surprises. <br /> <br /> See it with an open mind.
