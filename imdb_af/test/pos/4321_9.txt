The writers of lost have disregarded themselves. Season two's final is even more heartbreaking and intense than the final for season one. Locke's lack of faith not only led to spiritual consequences for himself, but also to tragic physical consequences for the lives of other castaways. Michael's betrayal made him a success, but could he possibly escape the island? He will have to stay if he wants to. I have no doubt that one or more of his former friends would be willing to kill him in revenge. This final left more questions than the previous finals; and I can't wait for fall. <br /> <br /> A lace note: What is the point to post a review just to write out all the spoilers? Where is the pleasure to destroy the surprise for everyone else? The current review on this page is nothing more than a big fat spoiler, poorly built in scarcely readable English with the explicit purpose of making someone angry. Good work.
