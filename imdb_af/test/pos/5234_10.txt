I never expected such an old movie to be as impressive as it was western in 1930. The screens of the pioneers living west in their carriages, which experience storms, mud, river crossings, Indian attacks and all forms of trial and danger, are surprising in their robust credibility. Much of the movie is shot outside, and the movie has a real epic feel about it. The actors had to face many of the same conditions as the original pioneers, and the results are amazing. The wagons, the clothes, every detail look and feel right. The characters are simple but credible, with a straight story, moving like a wagon train to its destination. <br /> <br /> John Wayne is slender and youthful in one of his first roles, as the scouting leads the car, and he does a good job as the idealistic young frontman. He is against a wonderful scurvy trio of villains, including Ian Keith as a slick player, Charles Stevens as a Mexican sidekick and Tyrone Power, Senior, as the coarse, weary hiker. Power's bearded, faster, greater than life-imagery is both comical and threatening. I hold him with a bandana, golden hoop and black eye patch, with a parrot on his shoulder, grabbing various threats and insults. His character can easily be transferred to a pirate ship. He almost steals the whole picture. <br /> <br /> Tully Marshall is beautiful as a cheerful old man who is Wayne's best friend. The beautiful Marguerite Churchill makes an enthusiastic heroine, whose initial encounter with Wayne is a hilarious blend, leading to a long career of insults and causing indifference to her. The results are very humorous and one is happy to see them finally get together. <br /> <br /> The scenery is wonderful, with the wagons crossing the right prairies and being lowered by ropes. Indians who are clearly the true article and not white actors in makeup appear as friends and enemies and are treated with dignity. Wayne's character tells an admiring group of young boys that the Indians are his friends, who have taught him everything he knows about survival in the wilderness. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is an uncomplicated story told by a talented film. crew. It will probably be naive for many modern viewers, but there is a silent dignity about it that can never make it. There is a lot of intentional humor, including a rough pioneer rascal, which makes loud noises hide every time the slick player Ian Keith tries to marry the beautiful heroine to marry him. His flower speeches about the plantation he allegedly possesses are interrupted by very realistic counterfeit cats and quagmire ducks, causing it to be tempted to look around in irritation for the unseen creatures. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, both for Western fans and lovers of old movies in general. It is truly a classic movie for centuries.
