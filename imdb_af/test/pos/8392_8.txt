Not your daily Tom and Jerry for many reasons. One, there's a voice story by Jerry, which is strange, because Tom and Jerry seldom speak. Two, the two are friends, who were also scarce and rarely work, as well as the more adversary shorts. Thirdly, and above all, the cartoon is rarely humorous (by design) and the jokes here are dry chuckles with a little cough and a blood tube at the end. Think of a Tom and Jerry cartoon directed by Tim Burton. Not quite successful, but it works largely. The creepiest ends for an MGM card I can remember. Not for everyone and proving that these shorts were never meant for children only as the target audience. Worth watching. Recommended with the reservation above.
