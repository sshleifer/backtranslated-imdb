One of the myths of the early sound era is that they could not make Westerners because they had problems recording sound in place. In fact, these were the financial constraints of the depression that temporarily killed the genre, at least in the "A" budget. However, in the period 1929-1931, before the economic downturn really entered, the A-Western flourished, notable examples such as The Virginian, Billy the Kid and Cimarron. The Big Trail might have been the biggest of them all? a gigantic pioneer Western shot in an early widescreen process, appropriately titled grandeur. Thanks to a recent DVD edition, we now get the widescreen version alongside the fullscreen shot simultaneously. <br /> <br /> The director was Raoul Walsh, a man for whom the spirit of adventure lies in great outlook, and thus in many ways a perfect choice. He makes great use of the broader frame to show the Western landscape in its most breathtaking way. Very typical of Walsh is a number of shots at the beginning, like the one where a woman is cutting firewood. Most of the screen is tightly filled by the wagons and other junk, but in one corner we see the desert invitingly stretching. When the wagon train goes, the open plain is gradually revealed to us, with wagons being pulled away like curtains. These shots are not as effective in the fullscreen version, but on the broader canvas Walsh's expression of the outdoors was never better. <br /> <br /> But there's an unfortunate flipside about this. In terms of dialogue scenes, Walsh's tendency is to put the actors in the center of the shot, as if they were in an imaginary fullscreen. The extra width just becomes that ?? extra. Initially, it may seem logical because it means we see the highlights as many of the actors as in a full-screen photo. However, this makes the players look small and insignificant within the frame, while all background businesses dominate the shot? and there are many background businesses in the Big Trail. When widescreen formats appeared again in the 1950s, many directors would make the same mistake before finally realizing that in talkie screens it is better to spot actors from the chest, to lose their height, but to fill the screen. <br /> <br /> It's a pity, because The Big Trail is a well-balanced and well-written effort. The novels and revenge subplots are simple but well defined, and do not threaten to conquer one another or the pioneer story. It could have been a very intimate epic, but it lost dramatic weight, because every time characters start talking to each other, we are distracted by cattle, wagons or whatever the extra frames of the frame. Yet, Walsh's sensitivity to deep emotional romantic moments is still exhibited, and he manages to make the final scene effective and memorable. There are also some good comedic touches, mainly with the "comic Sweden" El Brendel. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is also remarkable that John Wayne's first lead is. While Wayne is still a victim of distant dialogue dialogue, we at least see his strong physical presence and hear his warm but self-conscious vocal delivery. He betrays his lack of experience, but the potential is clear there. Unfortunately, that potential wasn't widely realized and he spent the rest of the decade slumbering it in B-pictures before finally hitting the stars. Also in this photo Wayne's friend (and later cheerful character actor) Ward Bond appears. He is not credited, but you can see him in a number of scenes, most prominently around the 80-minute point where he stands on Tyrone Power's left hand. <br /> <br /> The Big Trail is a glorious epic that manages to defeat itself as a drama. And it was this wonderful scale that would put the Western (and wide screen) in bed for quite some time. And while the 40's and 50's are now considered the golden age of the West, it was a changing genre at that time, with stories of individual adventure and heroism in an established West? not better or worse, but of a different shape. The early talkie era was the end of an era in which Westerners could really be huge.
