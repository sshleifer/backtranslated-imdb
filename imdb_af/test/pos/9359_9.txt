A March 1947 New York Times article described Crossfire as one of the first Hollywood films of the 1940s to "put questions about racial and religious bias with more righteous courage than audiences were expected to expect." While manufacturing RKO Crossfire, Twentieth Century Fox was making Gentleman's Agreement, another story about anti-Semitism. RKO rushed to beat the very "ballyhooed" Fox movie to the theaters, and released Crossfire several months before the Lord's agreement. In July 1947, RKO selected Crossfire for representatives of various religious groups in Los Angeles. In addition, several recordings designed to measure audience prejudices were performed before and after the movie's performance. Crossfire received both praise and criticism for the depiction of anti-Semitism in America and was the subject of many editorial articles. Crossfire received a Best Award nomination for the Oscar, but lost to the Lord's agreement. It has also been nominated for best supporting actor (Robert Ryan), best supporting actress (gloria grahame), best director and best script (adaptation). In September 1947, Crossfire was named the best social film in Cannes. In December 1947, the Ebony magazine, an African American publication, gave the film its annual award for improving interracial understanding. Love this movie. If you get the chance to see it, see it.
