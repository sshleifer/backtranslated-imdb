Beautifully filmed, a little uneven, "Nobody" is a good evening's entertainment. The plot is simple enough - three yuppies scrap with a group of strangers in a bar, and it seems to be much more than they have bargained for. The acting is decent, and there are some unexpected twists. Look for the totally amazing (like the 10-shoot revolver, and 25-shot semi-automatic handgun).
