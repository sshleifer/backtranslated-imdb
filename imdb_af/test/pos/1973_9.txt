I loved this movie, but then I'm a big Cronenberg fan again. If you haven't seen a David Cronenberg movie, it's not a good place to start. Scanners, The Fly, Rabid would be a place to start and then work on Video Dreams before checking this one. This is definitely one of its best and takes the interactive gaming phenomenon one step further. <br /> <br /> In this game, players stick a bio-developed game block through a jack into their spinal cord and come into play directly through their nervous system. It is very difficult to tell you more without giving away the story and the plot, but it is enough to say that this is a game you will not forget. It is full of Cronenberg's clever bodywork, a dark, predictive landscape populated by a huge role, including Jennifer Jason Leigh, Jude Law and Willem Dafoe. They take the situation they find very serious. These people will do what they can to find the game and then win. Like other films of his, there is no shortage of imagination or parts where you sink to the seat, but like a car accident you don't look away. If you liked any of the above movies, go out and get one.
