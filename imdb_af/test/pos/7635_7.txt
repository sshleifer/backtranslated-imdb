L'OSSESSA, also known as THE TORMENTED or THE SEXORCIST, or the ridiculous title of the EERIE MIDNIGHT HORROR SHOW, is a forgotten EXORCIST rip-off that features one of the best horror moments I've ever seen. The scene is when the crucifix comes alive. This great ghostly scene is unforgettable and totally effective (big FX's). It is a pity that the rest of the movie does not maintain the level of creepiness displayed during the scene. <br /> <br /> It's one of the most frustrating movies ever. Imagine that the producers decide to make an EXORCIST copy, but while they are doing it, they actually succeed in creating something truly original (a possession of crucified man who is shocking when you think about it) but then completely original idea forgets to make a boring and uninspiring exorcist rip-off. If the movie continued to possess the sculpture concept (with the characters trying to destroy it, etc.), this movie would have been. But as soon as the girl is possessed by the spirit of the sculpture, she never tells anyone where the devil came from. She and the manuscript forget about the ghost cross that is completely over! <br /> <br /> If you like so-called "Euro-cult" movies, deliver the first 45 minutes unlike any other Euro cult. movies. But after the scene when the girl has a vision to be crucified and she gets stigmatas, the remaining 45 minutes struggle. Boring. It is not going anywhere fast because it is trying to make the psychologist too bad. So, look at the first 45 minutes of L'OSSESSA and enjoy the 1970s fashions, the sleaze and the wonderful scene-coming-to-ravish-the-girl scene, but after the first 45 minutes, stop and eject, and maybe even tighten your toenails.
