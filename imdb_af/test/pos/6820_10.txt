The Youth In We are a peak-perfect jewel. I saw this beautiful short at this year's Sundance Festival. The story took me on a profound transformation. Directing Joshua Leonard, the play of Kelli Garner and Lukas Haas, the artistic, cinematography, the score - every element was true. One can only hope that this beautiful and impeccable film is predicted on more good work by this talented director. <br /> <br /> Just as a short movie before a feature at Sundance is shown, commercial movie theaters have used a similar format. times gone by. It would be great if miniature masterpieces such as The Youth In Us could reach a bigger audience.
