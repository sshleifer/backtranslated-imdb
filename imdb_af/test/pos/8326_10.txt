When Jurassic Park came out for the first time, it was revolutionary in movie viewing and special effects. For the first time people go cold to a dinosaur movie and are convinced they are watching real dinosaurs. But while some dinosaurs were almost perfect examples of what the true creatures would have been (T.Rex, Brachiosaurus, Triceratops, etc.), the film (Velociraptor, Dilophosaurus) was changed and the movie happened on the tropical island where they were not in their natural habitat. Walking with Dinosaurs shows us the real animals in their proper habitats millions of years ago. The amount of detail and scientific information used here is wonderful. Now we can see attractions such as a grim Triassic desert, a whole herd of Diplodocus, an Icthyosaur birth, a MASSIVE sea monster, a pterosaurus eye survey, dinosaurs thriving in the South Pole, two Torosaurus lock horns, T.Rex - roaring at the camera and the impact of the comet that spelled their punishment. These dinosaurs walk, run, feed, fight, hatch, hunt and swim. But the series also reveals the other creatures with which they shared the world. Two episodes focus mainly on two different kinds of animals, the flying Pterosaurs and the marine reptiles that lived under the waves. The scenery and scenery are spectacular and look all the more unique when a CG Dino walks on the screen. And as for CGI and animatronics, the movements of the CGI dinosaurs seem quite natural. The color is bright and lively and the crew members have taken careful steps to ensure that the CG animals interact with their surroundings in any way that would be a real creature. by making splashes in the water, brushing with bushes, kicking dust and throwing shadows on the ground. The CG is not perfect, with a few short cases where the animals look computer-like, but the rest of the time looks amazing. The puppetry is in some cases poor, but it has its moments especially with the Cynodonts in the first episode. The story by Kenneth Branagh is pretty good and also gives us important information and drama at the same time. But of course, the real pleasure is to see a living dinosaur they've been doing for years and also some nice moments with Cynodont (mammals / reptile hybrid), Sauropodlets (baby Diplodocus) and T.Rex chicks (Yes even T. Rex can be cute) and remind us that nature can be brutal and so much more. All of this adds to a prehistoric masterpiece that lets you see a true dinosaur and take your breath away, all from the safety of your living room. If you like nature, dinosaurs, informative learning, wonderful artworks or just a good view and entertainment, then Walking With Dinosaurs is for you. Easily recommended.
