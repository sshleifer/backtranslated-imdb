One of the most underrated comedies. Dan Akroyd is hilarious in this lead role; Charles Grodin gives a performance almost as well as in "Midnight Run;" and Walter Matthau gives a wonderful comic performance in this sometimes muted, sometimes mischievous movie. Akroyd and Matthau have good chemistry together.
