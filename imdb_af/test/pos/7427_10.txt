This movie is a hidden gem. I can't understand why this movie doesn't get airtime anymore. Errol and Eleanor Parker make for a real attractive and bustling couple. And their chemistry is impeccable. I really like the touch of his daughters who refer to him as her Robin Hood. I recommend it to everyone who enjoys Errol Flynn. It is nice to see Errol a father too. Through all accounts of his own children he was a very attentive and loving father in real life. Also, the supporting cast is also wonderful. You can't go wrong with supporting players like Hattie McDaniel and Lucile Watson. Hattie McDaniel makes a movie so much better from the get-go. This movie is now a holiday tradition in my home. Enjoy !!!
