Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Carla Gugino and Gil Bellows is a DELIGHT in this sexy caper. This movie is clever, edge of your adult entertainment seat, and what a relief that in these days of great concept predictable cartoons. Great music and camera work adds to the fun that this New Orleans set puzzle. Highly recommended. Ten stars!
