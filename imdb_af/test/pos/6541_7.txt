I suspect we all, no matter if our fans of cars, luv the sound of a Dodge Challenger as it grows along the road, the sound a Chevy cook makes when it screams with ecstasy when it comes to " A twist and, most of all, the explosion of sound as a classic vehicle burst into flames as it explodes. I'm not the biggest car enthusiast with any imagination, but any of the above really works my car! There is no denying the importance of transport on the theater. It was even said that the invention of the train was one of the greatest influences on the early theater (looking out for a window almost like a moving picture and the idea of ​​being transported to another time / space). But the car remains the most popular and beloved, and it even has its own genre: the car exploitation genre. A genre that focuses purely on the beauty of cars. In effect, it's just porn! Car porn! And I'm not talking about that rather nasty documentary on Channel 4 in which men actually had sexual intercourse with cars. Whatever drives your car, I think. For example, moving on ... while RUNNING ON EMPTY isn't quite as pornographic as VANISHING POINT (Richard C. Sarafian, 1971), for example, with her close to the car in motion, even if it's bumps and curves (!), That means This doesn't mean the car isn't the main focus of this movie. In fact, the cars become characters themselves (more later). They are objected and fetishised as much as the women, in fact, perhaps even more. And holy holy, these cars are something! Every car in this movie (except one in the background) is simply beautiful ?? artworks, there is no question. <br /> <br /> As I said, these incredible cars are somehow characters themselves. You actually start sympathizing with the car! SPOILER ?? Usually during the scene where the car is destroyed and burned. It has almost become a convention of the caravan genres; The evil 1978 Plymouth rage from CHRISTINE (John Carpenter, 1983), Satan's personal Lincoln Mark III in the car (Elliot Silverstein, 1977), the small Mini Coopers of the Italian JOB (Peter Collinson, 1969) to the friendly Volkswagen Beetle in LOVE BUG (Robert Stevenson, 1968) and of course every car of DEOD RACE 2000 (Paul Bartel, 1975) and even WACKY RACES (1968-1970) all had their own character. Ironically, however, this emphasis on the car often (!) The human characters! And this is certainly the case with RUNNING ON EMPTY, in which only one human character (the blind character who drives his car with his audience rather than face) has any dimension, the rest are many stock characters. These are all your stereotypical Australian 1980s teens; great hair, annoying accents and none of them will look near NEIGHBORS, especially the Kylie Minouge look-a-like. But who gives a damn? It's all about the cars that are racing and crashing! That's it! If you don't like it, you really look at the wrong genre. <br /> <br /> The movie scene is definitely the point of sale of this movie, and the best thing about it. They are fast; very fast! And we're not talking about the rather annoying technique that some movies seem to 'speed up' the car at about 40mph and then speed it up. Oooh no! Not with this movie you do. These cars are in real time with the highest speed in? no fancy editing tricks here. So, we have speed. Cheque. What about accidents? Go look, make sure! While there are no cars crashing, there is an amazing BLUES BROTHERS (John Landis, 1980), when cars in this movie crash, they definitely crash! They seem to use gunpowder or something similar to building the cars as one small hit and KABOOM they are in flames. It reminds me of THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE (Bo Arne Vibenius, 1974) in that sense. <br /> <br /> Between these simply amazing scenes (especially the beginning and the end) there are quite a few scenes that make everything happen and in my opinion don't add much to the movie. Note: more explosive cars needed! However, there are some exceptions here, which are fantastic scenes ?? SPOILER especially the attempted rape scene. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a man's movie! A boy's movie! Full of cars pious pious panting around the outback and a few tits thrown in for good measure too. I would recommend this little movie to everyone, even if they are nice cyclists (!) ?? It's a good movie you can just turn off your brain, sit back in your chair and turn on full volume! I'll give it 3.5 luvs out of 5 luvs? Bruuuuum! P.S ?? Amazon sells it for just over £ 2 ?? It's a real bargain, though the DVD has no special features whatsoever.
