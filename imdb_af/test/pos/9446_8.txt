Okay, so I don't understand why people are getting worse about this movie. So I thought it would be the usual Amanda Bynes movie, but it wasn't. It was BIG. <br /> <br /> Well, okay, so the acting wasn't the best, but I thought the performances were still generally good. You can also tell that the actors had fun while doing this movie. In other movies, which won surprising prizes, where the actors did not like to work on the film, you could tell. All the actors had chemistry, and it also showed. <br /> <br /> A lot of people move on the soccer skills that the actors have. Yah, so they're not perfect ... get it over! They are actors, not soccer players. I played soccer for my whole life, and trust me, it's hard to learn, so stop at the level of skills they have. <br /> <br /> I thought this movie would be stupid, but it was really funny. The way Amanda Bynes and Channing Tatum can make a situation funny without saying anything is funny. I laughed a lot in this movie. <br /> <br /> Overall..I LOVE IT!
