I like this movie above all others. This is multi-layered; there is so much to see and appreciate. Each display brings a new appreciation for the story line, the plot and the characters. Flawlessly done and very enjoyable if you take the time to see and appreciate it. I love the interaction between the players; the subtle relationships; the period atmosphere. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly thrown as the splendid lover and Geoffrey the wrong man is beautifully underlined by Colin Firth. The scene in the sandstorm where Catherine & El-masy discuss the different types of sandstorms is one of the highlights of the film and where the case really starts. The other relationship between Hanna & El-masy is another "layer" of the film that is totally enchanting (and heartbreaking). A valuable winner of so many awards.
