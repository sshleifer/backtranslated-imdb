Bridget Fonda has disappointed me over the years, but she has had my attention in BREAK UP. It is true that the story lacks critical details in many places, but I only checked Fonda for clues about what was meaningful in the story and she didn't let me down. The gaze in her eyes in the last scene, like his courage to literally put one foot in front of the other toward her uncertain future, is one of the most dramatic and significant examples of face ever trading. I completely believed her, possibly because I knew and admired several "difficult brothers" who survived similar offensive situations. And they did it without being people, but it's my own hopeful projection of Fonda's character at the BREAK UP.
