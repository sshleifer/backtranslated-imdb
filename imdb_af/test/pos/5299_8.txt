I recently watched this movie, and decided to comment on it. <br /> <br /> The best way to watch this movie is not to expect what you've seen through Miyazaki in the past. Miyazaki is known for his work on Spirited away and Howl's moving castle. Well for western viewers anyway. Both films were similar, but at the same time completely different. However, Ponyo is a completely different kind of story and animation all together. <br /> <br /> The story follows 'Ponyo' a fish that has the face of a girl. After Ponyo drove away from her home at the bottom of the sea, she found a whole new world she had never known, and also new problems, when she was almost caught by a fishing boat, she was saved by a five-year-old man. son known as Sousuke. <br /> <br /> The story then follows the two of them and the pure friendship between a boy and a fish. can Ponyo always live with Sousuke forever? <br /> <br /> I feel the movie is inspired by "The Little Mermaid" and at the same time similar to "Tonari no Totoro" <br /> <br /> The movie is very short and you have very little time to Learn about the characters in this movie. But the characters a fish and a little boy so much do you expect to learn from them? The movie is about what it looks like 3 days, I think that's why the movie is so short. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie and I hope you all enjoy this movie too
