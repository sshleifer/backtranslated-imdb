I just wanted to inform someone who was interested that the movie "New Jersey Drive" was my personal favorite of all. I admire the work Nick Gomez and Spike Lee in this masterpiece of a movie. This movie made me feel because of its reality and its appreciation for detail of life in urban New Jersey. It hit me a chord, personally, because I grew up with friends like those portrayed in the movie. This made me even more impressed, as I spent some time in Teaneck some years ago, so some of the characters were "really" kept. Sometimes this movie was like a documentary because you didn't know if it was real happening. Although films such as "Boys in the Hood" and "Menace II Society" receive more attention, I personally feel that these movies are somewhat improved to present a larger audience. "New Jersey Drive" was an uncompromising piece of "in your face" reality. Lee and Gomez covered every detail in this urban drama from the music, clothing, snake and location. Unlike some of the movies I mentioned earlier, the actors acted as if they were not "actors". Nothing was compromised to make good theater. The only accident coming out of this movie was the fact that many people were sleeping there. I am looking forward to more works by Nick and Spike in the hopefully near future.
