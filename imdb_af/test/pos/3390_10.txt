Shelley. <br /> <br /> Based on John Jake's successful paperback novels "North and South", "Love and War" and "Heaven and Hell", it was a mini-series on television from 1985 to 1987. Its success was more due to the success of 'Roots' similar civil war era / slavery soap opera television over a decade earlier in the 70s. Patrick Swayze, at the beginning of his career and at the time he was busy with many films such as Dirty Dancing, which would make him famous, stars like Orry Main, a plantation-born young man from South Carolina who leaves for West Point. Here he meets George Hazard (James Read), who is supposed to be the hated enemy, the Yankee North, but with whom he is now connected. Soon, the Mains from the South and the Dangers of the North become friends despite the turbulent era that leads to civil war. The theme of family, friendship and the right thing, even when the nation falls apart, is at the heart of this other soap action full of action and romance. Clariss and Ashton (Jean Simmons and Teri Garber) portray sisters who become enemies when one of them marries Yankee Billy Hazard (John Stockwell). Garber's bitchy, seductive, manipulative, ambitious and evil Ashton is fun to watch on the screen. Although the series does not cover everything in Jakes novels, which we see is a shortened version of it and they have changed a few things to make it a kind of historical romance with history lessons. The characters find themselves in all the great Civil War scenes - Harper's Ferry where apostate and feminist Virgilia Hazard (Kirstie Alley) loses the love of her life, former slave Grady, Fort Sumter, Vicksburg, Antietam, Gettysburg, Appomatox and us is in the White House where we see Abraham Lincoln (Hal Halbrook). fight the war in his conscience, we meet all the prominent players like Lee, Grant, Sherman, Jackson and Davis. Several veterans Hollywood actors of the Golden Age - Robert Mitchum, Elizabeth Taylor and Olivia De Ha villand have cameos and it's interesting to see them. It's not historic, it's historical fiction and pure dramatized entertainment. But it has cliffhanger ends and beautiful cinematography, costumes and places. It's like watching an epic movie running longer than Gone With The Wind, with war scenes in it! The script can sometimes be bad and the acting may not be the best, despite the good decisions. Swayze likes it like Terri Garber, but some performances like Kirstie Alley, James Read (like George Hazard) and Leslie Anne Downes as the beautiful and strong Madeline are very good performances. They shot in sets and in southern places. The music is captivating and it's a good movie in which we root the good guys and watch the villains and finally get their arrival. All fans of Civil War films and the Jakes novels should watch it. It is available on DVD and VHS.
