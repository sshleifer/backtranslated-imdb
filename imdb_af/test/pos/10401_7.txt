Another handy horror means another divisive movie that fans still have to look out for and consider their own thoughts. <br /> <br /> Imagine a cross between The Blair Witch Project and The Wrudge and you are close to the overall content of this movie. This is another video horror, but this time most of them are edited together for a video document never completed by a supernatural investigator. <br /> <br /> I definitely had a sense of fear while watching this movie does anyone much better than our Asian friends?) But the eager moments, the truly creepy moments, were unfortunately a little less and further between what I was hoping for. I also felt that I was two or three steps ahead of the investigator when clearly "revelations" appeared everywhere, so I definitely can't recommend it as high as [* Rec]. <br /> <br /> That said I wouldn't recommend recommending any movie that has long been about ectoplasmic worms, contains at least two subtle ghostly ghost moments and made sure I was the light had to offend for a while when the sun went down. br /> <br /> See if you have enjoyed some of the other handheld reports. And the final is a hair warming. <br /> <br /> See it if you want: The Last Broadcast, Pulse, Angel Heart.
