I think Melville suggested that this movie should be the definition of the cool; It has the cool approach of the late 60's / early 70's thrillers ?? The same same peculiarity. LE CERCLE ROUGE, a bitter and fatalistic story, is also the playground of Delon, Bourvil, Volonté and Montand in the definition of roles. <br /> <br /> Bourvil is a cop who has three cats and a daily routine in his apartment. Delon is a hoodle. Montand is a sick, failed policeman. Volonté plays an escaped suspect. LE CERCLE ROUGE is of course far above a hoist film; Melville uses his techniques ?? long wordless detailed images of every step of the hoist, etc. Yet is this particular drama drama much better than his other films? And it's very unlikely they are so much better. The appearance of LE CERCLE ROUGE is very peculiar to Melville, many Melvillian. <br /> <br /> Delon was sharp and cool; Bourvil brings his craft, and Montand may play the best role in this movie; his performance has an unexpected warmth. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, the characters are barely sketched, no more than strictly needed, and are personae. Or masks; Yet, the depiction is inspired, economically but suggestive. <br /> <br /> Another movie that Delon proves to be a good, very good actor; and the fact that he is not a genius does not imply that he should be despised as a fourth actor. He is good, he can wear the proximity of a Bourvil and Montand. <br /> <br /> Only ten years. before LE CERCLE ROUGE did Melville do a boring, elongated noir pastiche by the end of the fifties (starring himself)? And after just a decade, he is in full shape with this amazing action drama. Stylistically, it is a success. <br /> <br /> Before you saw LE CERCLE ROUGE, I wasn't a Melvillian fan; now I think I'm rather one. <br /> <br /> LE CERCLE ROUGE is a drama, an action drama, one of the most striking genres. Melville scores.
