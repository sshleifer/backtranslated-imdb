When, oh, when will someone like Anchor Bay or Blue Underground release it on widescreen DVD? Le Orme, which I know only because of my rare / old video collection habit, is a movie in my collection that I will not only pass through, but actually enjoy watching. The fact that Klaus Kinski is the best, but only in small parts of the film, means little to me. (Although several commentaries expressed disappointment in his limited screen time.) I can't say it's a good horror movie, a good riddle, a sci-fi epic or anything of the kind. It is simply unclassifiable in the "genre" of things. It is more like a confusing, frightening (though not particularly violent or bloody) dream filled with great visual and mystery. It relies on visual and emotion, such as Bava's "Lisa and the Devil". Both films are in virtually every sense, but almost impossible to describe in a logical way; they both appear in such a dreamy atmosphere. Don't be deterred by Force Video's back cover summary. It is infinitely more complex and intriguing than that. Although Force Video's release of 1986 (the only one in the US I know of) is cut to the full screen on the tape, even in that format it's still big. To make it remastered and / or letterboxed makes it great (hint, hint ... DVD companies).
