This weekend I caught this movie at Glenwood Cinemas as part of the Kansas International Film Festival, which, as usual, provided a thoughtful and eclectic sample of world cinema. <br /> <br /> I've been waiting for the Australian Film for a number of years and it was so nice to learn that this movie was included and I was definitely not disappointed. <br /> <br /> Excellent shot, firmly directed, it's a terrible story of one man and his journey to the heart of darkness, as it was. It reminded me of Lynch's Wild at Heart, it has that strange madness in it, but for other reasons I'm hooked on the movie, that it contains a portrait of Australia that is ... very credible. <Br /> <br /> I had a vacation to the Land Down. Amongst a few times, once in the 1980s and again about 7 years ago with my wife. <br /> <br /> I don't wanna go out and explain my holidays, but director Frayne seems to understand that I find so strange and eccentric about Australia, a country responsible for the other says Nick Cave and Steve Irwin (the Crocodile Hunter). A little lucrative wide - - I would have more of the 'unknown' Australia. Much more in fact. But I also realize that there is only 1 and a half hours to do all this ... "Suck." <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is very, very accomplished.
