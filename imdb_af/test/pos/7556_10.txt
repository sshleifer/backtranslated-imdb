Movie follows four friends of the 1950s (when they are in high school) until 1981. They are Danilo (Craig Wasson) a Yugoslavian immigrant; Georgia (Jodi Thelan) a "free spirit"; David (Michael Huddleston) who has no personality and Tom (Jim Metzler) a great, strong, attractive, solid man. All three are in love with Georgia, but she just loves Danilo. The film mostly focuses on the two - it chronicles their lives, love and appeal to each other over the years. It also gets in Danilo to win the love of his difficult immigrant father. <br /> <br /> I love this movie, but it's not without its bad points. Thelan's loud, squeaky voice is annoying (but you get used to it); the story is quickly jumping around; Tom and David's lives are never explained (Tom appears with a Vietnamese woman and children and David has a woman we never meet to the end); Some important plays are badly written and there are some obvious cuts (probably to keep the film after 2 hours). <br /> <br /> But all the others are so good that you can easily forget about the problems. The story is compelling - you learn the characters very well and understand and are always caught in life. With a few exceptions, the writing (by Steve Tesich) is good - Tesich himself was a Yugoslavian immigrant himself and based much of the writing on his own experiences. All the plays are wonderful - especially Thelan and Wasson - also Reed Birney throws in a strong, enjoyable show like Louie, Danilo's college roommate. And Lois Smith is very interesting in her role. And look quickly at Mercedes Ruehl and Glenne Headly! <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a wonderful story about immigrants, age, love of America, and covers the 50-80's perfectly. <br /> <br /> This film was (unfairly) malicious on its release. The studio didn't know how to advertise it (it's a hard film to market) and the critics bumped into it (Pauline Kaels's New Yorker review was particularly strict). It hardly played in theaters (I was lucky to catch it in his short theater career in 1981) and just disappeared. It's a shame. It's a movie that's just ripe for reissue. I don't bet on it - but you never know! A decided 10 all the way!
