I did not read the novel from which the film is based. So I can't comment on what is missing or changes have been made. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, I had a wonderful experience watching THE KITE RUNNER. I find it when I see films about other cultures that we have here in the US, I learn how others live and exist. <br /> <br /> The actors in this movie come from Afghanistan and other countries in that area. There are 3 young children in this near epic movie. There were first roles. They were wonderful. <br /> <br /> The scenes shot in Kabul are shot in different parts of China. I assume the area is similar to the real places in the book. <br /> <br /> Mark Foster aimed and found NEVRRLAND. He created the same magic here. <br /> <br /> All aspects of production are first time. <br /> <br /> I found it a better movie than those nominated and won Oscars. <br /> <br /> The movie is subtitled, it is very clear to read. It has a proper PG-13 rating. SPOILER ALERT --- The child rape scene was handled very well. <br /> <br /> However, I can't give it a 4-star rating, because the common plot and story line we've seen many, many times, Non-the-less is a very good movie to to watch. <br /> <br /> Ratings: *** 1/2 (out of 4) 95 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
