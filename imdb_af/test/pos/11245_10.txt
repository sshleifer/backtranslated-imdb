The show itself basically reflects the typical nature of the average youth; parties and picking chicks is the general weekend goal at the clubs. People frown on the show because of its "twisted" idea to pick up girls using technique and strategic characterization, but the truth is being told, almost every young man is doing it at the club. Overall, the show really appeals to the younger population as we see the outcome of a "player's" performance at the club, as the show offers a comic approach made by the panel. <br /> <br /> 10/10; a cool, fun and exciting series that allows the audience to communicate with each other. Good workman.
