What do you do if you are Aishwarya Rai, coming from a sturdy movie like 'Devdas', with some skeptical critics who are still relentlessly dissatisfied with your amazing performance or convinced by your strong screen presence and star-active skills, what do you do? Go home, sit and pussy? No. If you are Aishwarya Rai, sign up for the next strong period that comes together and remains worthy of all praise, kudos, great scripts, and equal roles. And that's just what she did and in 'Chokher Bali - a passion game' where she dies and shines as Binodini, a young widow who causes controversy before her time.
