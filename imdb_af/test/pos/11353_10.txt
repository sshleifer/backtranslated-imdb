I recommended this movie as one of the best love stories ever told. And if I'm a big fan of love, I bought the tickets and put myself in the theater. After 90 minutes I left the theater with nothing but disappointment and the theme song as the only positive thing about the movie. I was upset about the story itself, that two people could love one another, but be so scared that they would never act. I just couldn't pass the language barrier and the cultural barrier. The second time I rushed into it ... I was in another mood, no longer expected ... and had more patience, more relaxed thoughts to "see" the movie ... and as soon as I saw my eyes opened, I discovered love ... the beauty of the movie. I went further than seeing the language and the love story and the acting (not even for a moment did I ever feel they were acting!) And the movies. The first time I heard a movie definition, I said it should be a chain of perfectly balanced photos (shots) and that is the movie that matches the description. Almost every shot has an idea behind it, and combined with the music ... and light effects ... the result is just a masterpiece! And a masterpiece is just something you should have in your collection of movies.
