To say I didn't expect to sit down much to watch "The Couch Trip", it's an understatement. I had no idea what it was about. I thought it would be a journey to the sexuality field when I heard Chevy Chase playing a condom man and the movie's title "couch trip". Then I figured it had something to do with a mental institute and escaped a patient. My expectations fell even lower. <br /> <br /> I was literally expecting a grin - the kind you once grabbed and walked out to cheat a little. And in a way, it's cheap comedy - it doesn't have the biggest gags, the plot is ridiculous, but you know what? I had a big dumb smile on my face all the time I saw it. <br /> <br /> Then Aykroyd plays John Burns, a patient at a mental hospital who may not actually be mental. He gives the psychologist Lawrence Baird (David Clennon) a lot of sadness and misery, which leads us to be a healthy person. <br /> <br /> After a bit of a riot in the mental institute's cafeteria, Burns is waiting for Baird's tongue in his office when the phone rings. Burns picks it up, pretends that Baird is, and finds the caller on the other, Harvey Michaels (Richard Romanus), the real dr. Baird enters a radio shrink called George Maitlin (Charles Grodin), who takes a vacation with his wife, Vera (Mary Gross). Michaels wants Baird so bad that he even booked a ticket on a plane. <br /> <br /> Burns escapes the institute with the help of a receptionist and drives to O'Hare. He gets dr. Baird's ticket gets on the plane and eventually ends up on the air like dr. Baird. His performance is a phenomenal success. "People love him!" one man says, and the other man answers, "it's because he actually cares for them." <br /> <br /> Donald Becker (late, great Walter Matthau) is an ex-patient who recognizes Burns's clothing as being sold-out pants and shirts. To keep him quiet, Burns Becker promises a percentage of his income. The secret is closed. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Maitlin and his wife get an argument. He flies home to shorten his holiday and realizes that the man on his talk show is not actually Dr Baird, but nobody believes him. He gets the right dr. Baird, but unfortunately he lost his ID, so the police took them as handkerchiefs and didn't listen to their story. <br /> <br /> Let me just mention a few of the plot holes as he watched this movie: Burns set as dr. Baird before, but is never asked for his ID, even if he claims his plane ticket (he was robbed, he says, but they will make sure he is Baird). If Burns gets so famous, how come the real dr. Baird in Chicago never heard people talk about him? Word Travel. And lastly, why would police ever arrest Maitlin and Baird (the real Baird) without following their stories? <br /> <br /> To be honest, I can't care less. I went into this movie with a closed mind and it surprised me - I really liked it. It entertained me. His ideas are essentially ridiculous and not realistic, but Dan Aykroyd gives a real enthusiastic performance as a half-wage that makes a trip worthwhile. <br /> <br /> 3.5 / 5 Stars - <br /> <br /> John Ulmer
