Movie author Stephan Woloszczuk explores the depth of love, passion and brotherhood and the devastating effects of the loss in his latest movie BLINDSPOT. <br /> <br /> BLINDSPOT's lethal world explodes with excitement and takes the audience on a winding journey to the heart of the human soul. As director, he manages to draw the human spirit from the actions of his actors. With excellent editing, especially in flashback screens and beautiful cinematography, BLINDSPOT is a mind-blowing tension from start to finish. A play that leaves much to the mind's eye. <br /> <br /> What an amazing thing for Stephan Woloszczuk. <br /> <br /> Cheers Stephan! Angela Sander
