Married to The Mob was one of the first VHS tapes I had with Coming To America and Grease. I've always had good memories of this movie. Hell, I still have the VHS of this movie in good condition. <br /> <br /> The story: Mike Downey (Matthew Modine), the cover artist, is sent to spy Angela De Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer), the wife of the murdered Mafia member Frank "Cucumber" De Marco (Alec Baldwin). He later fell in love with her after realizing she was innocent in all this. Angela should not only deal with the unwanted progress of bullying Tony "The Tiger" Russo (Dean Stockwell). She also has to go with his jealous wife Connie Russo (Mercedes Ruehl). <br /> <br /> Married to The Mob is funny and still holds your interest if it's not funny. I love the little jabs it requires in mafia life (the jealous mafia woman, the crowd who doesn't realize he's not a chick magnet, etc.) And you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last of the funny phase of Johnathan Demme before becoming serious and giving jewels such as Philadelphia and Silence of the Lambs. If you're in the mood for the comedy, Married To The Mob is a custodian. It's better than the rubbish nowadays for comedy (Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie etc.).
