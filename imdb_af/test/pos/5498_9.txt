Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully-educated movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo <br /> <br /> keep her own as partner (and love) Lilly Raines. But the film's <br /> <br /> rests on John Malkovich's shoulders as "Booth". He captures <br /> <br /> this character's anger and hatred as well as his humanity strangely enough. <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it was his best performance and had to receive an <br /> <br /> Oscar. (But I also loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive of that year). Overall, it's a good movie to see if you're looking into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat all the way through. Enjoy !!
