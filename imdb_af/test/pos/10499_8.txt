There's not much anyone can say about this movie. The plot is pretty simple: Two police officers (who are also lovers) use a brothel as an interest in catching a criminal, with the help of the "lady of the house", played by hardcore pornstar Chloe. As anyone can guess, there are a few plot twists and some faded alliances, but the writing was just terrible, even for a soft movie. <br /> <br /> I've read a few previous posts about Nicole Hilbig's accent the female policeman). Yes, it is difficult to understand what she sometimes says, but I think I posted it. I sniffed a little. I think she is from Germany, hence her strange sounding accent. She makes an impression even without speaking, but she has a nice look. <br /> <br /> There were some "behind" sex scenes in this movie that was pretty graphic for a soft movie. ... excellent work there. The three-way scene to the end wasn't bad either. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> I knew that the female police are turning into a part-time call girl at the end. She enjoyed her three-way too much. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> I'm not going to go over the story because it's a low budget, direct-to-video softcore movie. However, I seem to have seen too many movies in this genre with a similar kind of storyline. <br /> <br /> Women: B (Chloe and Hilbig were ok as the sweets) Sex: B + (screens were short but good) Story: C (a recycled plot but what works, eh?) Overall : B-
