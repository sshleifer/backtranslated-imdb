In 2023, Kam (Bobbie Phillips) was ruled in a world by the economic interests of large corporations (and not by humans or politicians) a human hybrid and IBI (International Bureau of Investigation). She is a 'sub' (of sub-human), and her genetic composition is 80% human and 20% animal. She has a combination of genes peacock, giving her strength and flexibility; falcon, giving her a greater capacity to see and hear; and chameleon, giving her the power of camouflage. In the first film she was a very seductive and amoral woman with sex to obtain information. I haven't seen the second yet, but in this third one is the story full of action. A group of scientists has been developing a new and dangerous form of power generation for fifteen years. The research has not yet been completed, when one of them betrays the other and steals the research. The problem is that, due to its molecular instability, a black hole is created and the entire planet will suck. Kam saves dr. Tess Adkins (Teal Redmann), the survival of the science team, trying to pick up the dangerous finding out of the "bad guys". There is a very strong "sub" in this gang that causes many problems for Kam. This action and sci-fi television is better than the first one, which reminds the terminator in some parts of the plot. Bobbie Phillips is a very nice actress, and her outfit is very cool. I become a fan of this good entertainment. Fans of sci-fi movies will not be disappointed. Now I'm trying to buy `Chameleon 2 '. My voice is seven.
