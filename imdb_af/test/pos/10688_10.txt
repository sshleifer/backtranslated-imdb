I have never seen this movie before being broadcast on a local cable sci-fi network. It reminded me of the Irwin Allen TV series of the late 60's (Time Tunnel, etc.). Excellent effects (they beat Star Trek 5 20 years later, but then it wasn't very hard to reach). <br /> <br /> I found the writing very intriguing and mature for this type of production. They would need some renovations to link a few loose ends to the character level, but for a children's movie it was surprisingly interesting (especially the look at futuristic euro politics, surprisingly similar to the current European Union!) <br /> <br /> The plot does indeed remind Twilight Zone in general (as other users have indicated), but in this case it is a compliment. <br /> <br /> Great sets, incidentally! <br /> 7/10
