My first Mamin movie, has seen it for a long time and love it. It was absolutely artistic, original, fun and hilarious. Not a moment in the movie made me bored or bored, and I laughed or laughed a lot at my face. I mean this movie is really funny. But here's the catch: it's also very artistic and creative. If you don't know Yuri Mamin (probably unfortunately, because so many of his BIG movies aren't available here) he has a very original style like no other, and for me it's not even my favorite movie of his ( now it's the madman.) I also have to say, as Russian, this movie is good because you really see what Russians are. And this is possible because it is a true Russian movie, NOT a strange movie that is trying to be American or to appeal. Mamin did not sell (not even since, Gorko (1998) was as good or better) is true Russian style film that came from communist social realism. <br /> <br /> If you like this movie, I think you have a very high chance of loving Mamin's other films, actually I love many of them more than this one, I think this one is his most accessible movie, a similar film is Fontein, which is six years ago. occurs during perestroika, it has the same actor in the lead and more of Mamin's tribalists you will recognize from Window to Paris, this one has one supernatural twist in the end but is mostly a realistic comedy, a great one Viva Mamin, hopefully Criterion will hook up all his films one day, he still works, and his catalog is so good! See any of his films if you can.
