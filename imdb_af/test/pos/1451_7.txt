Instead of taking the place and making a realistic movie about drug addiction in the Windy City, director Otto Preminger, the director, decided to do the opposite way and make his film look as artificial as possible. flying in the face of the fashion set by men like Kazan, Huston and Zinnemann, who made their photos around the world. Nelson Algren, on whose novel the film is based, went on record to despise it. What does one wonder, was Preminger and why did he do the movie this way? <br /> <br /> The sets in the movie are as little as a Mr. Suggest Magoo cartoon. Louie, the drug addict, was adapted to resemble the kind of gangster who used the artists at Mad magazine to sign. Arnold Stang, a wonderful comedian he was, looks in a serious picture like this, and his appearance, which is conveyed by an exaggerated and excessive baseball cap, is lauded. Robert Strauss, another actor best known for humorous roles, is also out of place, as his big, heavy-jumping face and Runyonesque line-up are more suited to a Jerry Lewis movie. For all this, stars Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak and Eleanor Parker have to work overtime to just let the viewer sob. Sinatra is jittery and manic throughout, suggesting that a man is ill at ease with himself, thus perfectly suited to the role of a drug addict. Miss. Novak, plant-like and sublime dodpan, is sympathetic and seems to be a product of the shabby slum shops she plays in the movie. Parker is pure Hollywood and very hardworking than the crippled and smart Zosch. She's never convincing, but it's not the movie either. <br /> <br /> I would not recommend this movie to anyone interested in realistic depicting the lives of drug addicts in America. The Caligari sets alone make it incredible. Preminger might have had a dream effect, as the background of the cardboard gave the proceedings the surrealistic feel of a nightmare operetta, which may return to Preminger's early days in Vienna.
