The slightly overdue drafting episode of the previous week paid in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights. There was a certain deus ex machina scent for the decision of the stone hanger, but it was a good start for everything. As was common with this doctor, the moral, ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were the middle stage. They were always there in the classic series, but they were a side issue that had to be overlooked when the doctor was in the heat of the fight. This rebirth even says sorry for a cuberman during the battle! This episode finally shows Mickey the heroic side hung in previous episodes. His journey from zero to hero was completed, and it was a very convincing one. With scares, humor and scenes that brought a lump to your throat, this episode had it all. After much consideration, I can finally say that the new series enters the classic series in every way. Coming from a dying Whovian, you can't get a better recommendation than that.
