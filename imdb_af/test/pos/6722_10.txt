Daisy Movie Review By James Mudge From beyondhollywood.com On paper, "Daisy" sounds like an Asian movie fan's dream true, directed by "Infernal Affairs" fellow helmet Andrew Lau and starring everyone's favorite sassy girl, popular Korean actress Jeon Ji Hyun. Unfortunately, despite the talent, and the fact that the crew flew halfway across the world to shoot in Amsterdam, the film seems to be a bit of a disappointment. It is a critical romantic drama that flushes in misery and self-interest. <br /> <br /> The plot follows Hye Young (Jeon Ji Hyun), a fairly Korean girl living in Amsterdam, spending her life in her grandfather's antique shop and portraits for tourists. One day she started to receive flowers from a secret admirer exactly the same time, which she believes is a mystery man from her past who once built her a beautiful brown. One day she meets Jeong Woo (Lee Seong Jae, also in "Holiday" and "Public Enemy"), which is unknown to her, is actually an Interpol agent who watches Asian criminals in the Netherlands. <br /> <br /> With Hye Young Assuming Jeong Woo is responsible for the flowers, the two fall very slowly into a cool romantic relationship. However, it appears that the man sending the flowers is actually Park Yi (Jung Woo Sung, of "Sad Movie" and "Musa"), an assassin working for a Chinese crime syndicate. Inevitably, the love triangle becomes tragic and the two men end up in the face while poor Hye Young tries to figure out which of the two is the love of her life. <br /> <br /> Although "Daisy" seems to be a love story, it has the feel of a funeral, with a slow, bleak pace and a plot that comes up on the misery. Half of the movie's running time is recorded with screens of characters staring out of windows in the rain, with the silence only broken by clashes of self-pitying narration. Director Lau seems to be under the impression that the film is a weighty Shakespeare tragedy, rather than another bleak love story. As such, the proceedings have a prosperous air, despite the fact that the plot is inherently predictable and is based mainly on the rogue clichés borrowed liberal from the so-called "Fulltime Killer" and John Woo's classic "The Killer". <br /> <br /> Almost every aspect of the movie is anxious, with the three main characters suffering as if the weight of the world were on their shoulders and refusing to do anything to follow their romantic tendencies. In particular, the Park Yi, as the kind of exaggerated emotional, socially delayed killer loved by modern cinema, is poorly ridiculous, from its blatant incompetence at work to its hilarious efforts to impress Impressionist painting with Hye Young or his love for flowering. to discuss. This cunning passivity makes the film's central novels somewhat difficult to swallow, and Lau's efforts to make it feel like the fate of the characters is more than a mere coincidence. <br /> <br /> Fans of Jeon Ji Hyun should note that her character is very close to her role in the glum supernatural drama "The Uninvited" as "My Sassy Girl" or "Windstruck", and while she is best tried to pull a few wicked faces here and there, is her performance The film benefits from shiny production values ​​and Lau makes good use of the Amsterdam landscape, and plays on the contrast between the gray, almost gothic beauty of the city and the innocent blue sky and flower fields of the countryside. Unfortunately, he tends to use slow motion for some of the emotional scenes, which, in combination with some of the postcard slideshows, gives the film the feeling at times of a perfume advertisement. There are a few scenes of surprisingly violent action, although it is far and wide, and while well-behaved, it seems to be a memory cast and does little more than briefly increase the pulse. <br /> <br /> Despite his flaws, Daisy makes a special show, and the story almost grasps in spite of itself, mainly from a morbid fascination not to see which of the men Hye Young will end but to see who is dying in her arms. The self-indulgent melodrama work well enough to mark all the right boxes for the genre, and the film functions perfectly as a gorgeous glamorous romance. <br /> <br /> It is noteworthy that the DVD contains the directors cut. of the film, which once indicates that it is essentially different from the theater version, which not only adds 25 minutes, but re-orders some of the screens, which makes the story less linear. Although this new version may be too long, it's certainly better. Because of these changes, the film would surely have been even more conventional and would even be characterized by an even darker character development. <br /> <br /> Wai Keung Lau director) / Jae-jong Kwak (script) CAST: Woo-sung Jung ??.
