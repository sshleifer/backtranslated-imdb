The movie 'Nightbreed' is one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Overall, I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but there's something about this movie that is more atmospheric and unlike any other horror movie I've ever seen. Many horror movies I've seen, I enjoyed watching, but because they are terrified, I know the stories are unreal since it's fiction. That's why I can't take them seriously. Nightbeed, on the other hand, is a unique horror genre, as it has a sense of realism that I have seen in very few horror movies. <br /> <br /> This film story about how a man is killed and ends The life of the dead in an underground cemetery hiding with walking monsters is the kind of story that one will get from a dream Nightmare, since this is a very unique and original story. Most horror movies I've seen are all very fake, but because Nightbreed was so sophisticated and enjoyable with great acting, especially by Craig Sheffer (Aaron Boone), wonderful special effects, great lighting and fantastic dialogue, I did this movie found. a sense of depth and maturity with no fool false horror parody, whatsoever, that has many other horror movies. Nightbreed, as well as abomination, has elements of excitement, romance, and action all in one. If you haven't seen this movie, I recommend you watch it as I rate it a 10/10.
