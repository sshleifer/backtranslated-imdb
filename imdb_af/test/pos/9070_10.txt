I'm usually wary of movies moving over the 6/10 point on IMDb. I like to think people know what they are talking about and know what they want. I think the trick with the review is to take an approach from "Hey, if I like movies, I would give it a higher score than I want to give it now, because I don't like these movies "Then people judge differently, appreciate more value on acting, or maybe story or direction. Anyway, the plane here landed - I hired this movie before and didn't have the time to see it, this morning I did it. <br /> <br /> Wow! See this movie. I am personally interested in the paranormal / have read a bit about the near death experiences, so I was automatically addicted. I am unsure of some of the comments here and say that a goodbye is wasted here - I disagree - the acting here was wonderful of everything. I think it's the only time I don't mind, Julia Roberts, it was good to see 24's Kiefer Sutherland (At the time of this review, serving a DUI jail), and Kevin Bacon sports an interesting hairstyle. <br /> <br /> Overall - I like the direction, the atmosphere, the acting, and The story is mostly - especially the idea of ​​karma, and to quote Nelson Wright, "Everything we do matters ". Really. <br /> <br /> 10/10!
