If you listen to Ween (The Pod, God / Satan), then you know what's going on with "Split". I found that the movie was under the influence of LSD to work with Audio / Video tracers with fantastic editing. The plot was important only from second to second. The acid helped to communicate with the sounds, subliminal and general pace of this masterpiece. Do not write about anything beyond the reach of your understanding. There is not enough of these great independent efforts to express the most miserable, amateur level. I dare dare to make a movie that can beat equally well with my head and the way I look at visual arts and change the world's reality. Not to mention the many realities that have not yet been investigated by these people's minds. I love Chris Shaw's vision. I also appreciate the texturistic terror film "The Begotten" by E. Elias Merhige.
