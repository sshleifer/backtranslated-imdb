After growing up in Canada, I often saw this on the CBC many times. I've seen it several times, many years in my life, and each time the reactions are the same. It is a joyous bittersweet, beautifully animated movie that tugs into your heart. I'm sure I embraced it on a VHS band somewhere. <br /> <br /> Every child who grows up can relate to the situation, and wants to fit in with your favorite idols. The scene and the look of the children are faced when his mother fills in the Eatons catalog and she jumps around the room is invaluable. I didn't see anyone catching the carefree mood of the youth on the movie as well as this little one. Certainly, I'm a Montreal habs fan, and that makes me appreciate it more specially. But in the end it's the nostalgic look of dam hockey, and the memories of your family tell you to be great for what you get, even if it's not exactly what you want. And oh yes, the animation is also beautiful;) <br /> <br /> Rating 10 out of 10
