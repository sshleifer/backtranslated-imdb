"Cover Girl" is the best musical Rita Hayworth ever made. Mrs. Hayworth will always be remembered for "Gilda", but the next movie will be "Cover Girl". The story is wonderful. It's about a dancer who wants to be a cover girl and makes it big in the show business. She does this without the help of her talented dancer / director boyfriend (Gene Kelly). Mr. Kelly gets the chance to choreograph the music numbers. The dances are spectacular. It's nice to see Phil Silvers, a comic, do the music numbers with Mrs. Hayworth and Mr. Kelly. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is perfect. Lee Bowman gets the chance to be an interesting third wheel, the other boyfriend.
