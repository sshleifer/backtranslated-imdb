Richard Schickel's 1991 documentary on Gary Cooper - "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" gives us a glimpse of the awesome American star through his films and his life. Given by Clint Eastwood, the theme is definitely "Gary Coooper, American" as we are taken by quick clips of his many performances in Westerns, and scenes of "Meet John Doe," "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," and "Sgt York. "The best part of the documentary is the home movies of Cooper and his family, as well as his childhood photos, which show him a beautiful blonde child with the sunny smile he will have throughout his life. There is also a hilarious Cooper clip on the "Jack Benny Show" making the return to the "Bird Dog" - and Benny lost it. The documentary also briefly takes us through his turbulent relationship with Patricia Neal, who has almost destroyed their lives. <br /> <There is some coherence missing from these bio / retrospectives. It is very popular and does not have interviewed Cooper who has been interviewed, who has added a lot. Clint Eastwood's narrative was also described as inconspicuous. boring and monotonous. Since Cooper was inclined to be the strong, quiet type on the screen, we could have used some animation. <br /> <br /> On a personal note, Gary Cooper was one of the handy men who ever lived - there were a few looks at him in his early movies, not enough for this fan. That smile, that lips, that bone structure - he was right through his life, but in movies like "Morocco" and "Desire", he was devastating. Instead of going through a scene through one of his worst performances, like Howard Roark in "The Fountainhead" gives a speech he acknowledged to the author, he didn't understand it. A young, cute Cooper in a tux would have had a good contact. . This documentary, unfortunately, was definitely produced by a man.
