A good story about Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) who dreams of being on the highway, which means she has to leave the small dining theater where she has to leave with Danny (Gene Kelly) and Genius (Phil Silvers). Rusty is in love with Danny. All three are good friends and every Friday night they go to a local pub where they get oysters to find a pearl (they never eat them). The story line offers numerous opportunities for songs and dance. The film has two questions that Rusty has to answer: Is it known to be cracked? and is less real if you are happy? To answer the questions, make the movie. The movie also does a good job of showing the talents that all three principals had. Never a dull moment!
