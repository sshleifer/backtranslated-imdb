Similar to a guilty concession, these days, it was necessary to watch when I was in high school. This is really a tremendous relief from the emerging punk scene in LA in 1980. As the bands play, Spheeris prints the lyrics in subtitles, which of course is needed if you really want to know what the guy in the microphone is shouting. But it also changes the camera's POV to that of the tourist, who goes through this strange world. The band interviews reveal an honest approach to music that really no longer exists. Then again, it's not that easy to come up with $ 16 / month former church castles like Chavez or Black Flag. How many unheard-of bands do you know that don't like the dickens trying to get a record deal? These guys just didn't mind. And who can't love the comments of the little French dude who was the singer of the Catholic Discipline (of which Phranc was a member). His sharp voice is one of the best solo songs ever captured on film: "I have great news for the world ... there is no such thing as New Wave." Wow! What a relief!
