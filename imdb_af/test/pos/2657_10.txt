This movie is not only good, it is incredible. In addition to providing good performances, original plot, fantastic special effects, thoughtful messages and much more, it has been a completely invisible world to the public. It is the first sci-fi movie that we bring into the unknown space of our galaxy, with such beautiful effects and minds that hide reality that the audience is left without words. I am only 16 years old and so I was educated in a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies. Yet, I was really, and I mean, totally blown away by the quality of these effects, even after almost 40 years. The visual effects were just one of the merits of this movie, the camera was amazing and captivating in the true Kubrick style. It feels like you're being screened through the screen and sucked into this surreal world (especially in the round control room or what you call it). The effects, the camera and the sheer size of this movie caught me from my guards, although I saw the rating before I bought it. But this movie has more than that. The meaning of this movie can also be interpreted as you like, although I think there are clear points about humanity (also true Kubrick style). How humanity, above and beyond its evolution, is only onboard maintenance, and therefore not needed by the computer, one of the humanities instruments. How we appear in space like babies, learning to walk again, losing control of our tools in zero gravity, breathing through equipment such as fish out of the water. At the height of evolution, we set forth eternal ending as simple primates. Many may think that the length and slow pace of this movie is boring? ridiculous? or just a waste of time. But before you can jump to the conclusions, think about why Kubrick spends time with quiet music and a spaceship for a few minutes. This is to illustrate its beauty. Beauty, beauty is in many cases not the rightful respect given by viewers. Kubrick wants to show us beauty, and if we don't succeed and relax, we can't enjoy this movie as intended. It's not an ordinary movie, we can't just sit and watch as we can with other movies, it takes time, thoughts, and especially commitment and feelings to watch. All of this makes this one of the greatest achievements in the world of moving pictures. 10/10 Let me know if you agree with me.
