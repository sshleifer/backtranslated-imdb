This is the last film of a trilogy by brilliant Turkish director, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose latest film Mayis Sikintisi, who was many Cehovian, is featured in prestigious film festivals. Unlike its previous films, the story of 'Uzak' is in Istanbul, which is one of the world's busiest cities. In Ceylan's film, however, we see only small traces of that large crowd. Rather, he chose to focus on two characters, one photographer and one of his family members coming from his small town to get a job on transatlantic ships. The photographer, whatever we understand, has also emigrated to the city, apparently inhabiting the customs of city life, not just in material sense. In his relationship with his family member, we first see him as caring and tolerant, but when he could not find a job, our suburbian character began to be disturbed by the sharing of his private 'space' with someone whose leave date is ambiguous. I will not reveal the tactics he develops to pull his family member out of his life to prevent any damage to your place of entertainment, but it is enough to say that Ceylan shows us the tactics we have in the routine of suburbian life obtained. "tactics" to keep our own private space, "tactics" not to communicate with other people, "tactics" to prevent our relationships from becoming complex (because of our own experience, we believe it is complex enough). <br /> <br /> Ceylan's film provides a clear picture of what one becomes within the boundaries of the modern (or post-modern?) city by portraying the two characters in different ways. But, he does not condemn either of the two characters to do so, but he uses the power of film language to underline this difference. For example, looking for new opportunities, we always see the character from the village in open spaces. Even within the house he prefers balcony as his favorite space. On the other hand, we always see the photographer inside the closed spaces, and usually at his home. Although there are over 10 million people there, and lots of adventures, lots of interesting things to discover (or is there any?), He prefers to sit at home, watch television, etc. His house is like his temple, a kind of holy place. <br /> <br /> Everyone who lives in a big city and is aware of the experience he lives in will find something in himself in Uzak. If you like this movie, I'm sure you'll love Ceylan's other two movies, Mayis Sikintisi and Kasaba (The Town). Go find them!
