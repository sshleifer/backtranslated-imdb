As a veteran writer writing instructor at Richland College in Dallas and a former MGM scriptwriter back in the days of decent movies, I'm excited to accidentally click on Channel 33 in Dallas, and watch this enchanting movie featuring Betty White GORGEOUS is and is craving for the good old days of really good movies before Hollywood has already put out this crap for the teens. If a producer listens, I'd like to say that there are enough of our top 60s who will happily pay a money to see a movie that has no guns, no murder, no special effects, no sex and violence and just a good touch of human relationships that leave you with a good warm feeling, as this movie did for me.
