After a very disappointing Part 3, I wondered if I would bother the next karate child while I could see why this saga would not continue, I enjoyed the next karate child most of the second and the third Karate Kid movie. While there are many unrealistic moments and situations, it was very enjoyable and the story is a catchy and hot one. <br /> <br /> Hilary Swank, has this girl gone a long way or what? She plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents to a car accident and when Miaugi says she's a baby boy, he notices that she has karate skills. He offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life. Now of course there is the boy who loves her and the average bulls that look like the first Karate Kid, but I would recommend this one. I think you will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> 7/10
