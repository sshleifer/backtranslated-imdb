I saw a sneak preview with a group of friends this Tuesday night and we had a blast! Having seen BOOGEYMAN (Horrible! 3/10) and Amityville Remake (so-so 6/10), I really enjoyed it! As I saw in the trailer, I once thought a whole town could be 'forgotten', but it's a cheese-like popcorn horror movie, so I accept it for what it is. <br /> <br /> My only major complaint is that Paris is going to become Hilton wax or be baptized etc. and moan "it's hot" but they didn't do it (how could they resist ???). <br /> <br /> There are NO celebrities of the 2 girls, although Paris looks great in her lingerie! I'm surprised they didn't put a 3rd hot token victim in the movie for some unnecessary nudity that is the norm for this kind of movie! I will not call a death or plot spoiler, but I will say that Paris and Eliza are both getting well up! <br /> <br /> The characters are being developed properly and are somewhat nice (not like Cabin Fever where you wanted them to die) and the movie has a decent fit, but nothing happens in the first 30 minutes like most horror movies. br /> <br /> I give it an 8/10 because it has good scares and gore and I had low expectations in it. If you go with friends who love stockings horror movies, you will have a good time. <br /> <br /> Noah
