It's another one of those movies I remember staying late to watch television, and killing my kitty at the impressive age of twelve or so, and afterwards to a life of horror movie obsession. do. It's a BIG movie, and is a living proof that there were realistic effects for CGI. <br /> <br /> On an isolated basis in Antarctica, this version looks almost like the original version (The Thing From Another World). The American scientists discovered a disapproved Norwegian base a few kilometers away. Everyone is dead, and only half of the discolored remnants of an unidentifiable thing left to melt outside of the compound can provide any answers to what might have happened. The thing is brought back to the American base and too late the scientists come to realize that it is alive and deadly. The thing thaws and is down, not just to kill anyone who is anything that crosses its path, but also to absorb them, to make it into everyone and what it wants. The film then becomes a brilliant paranoia piece. Everyone is suspected, anyone can be the thing, and nobody trusts anyone anymore. Away is the power and security found when people merge, despite their differences in fighting a monster. The group of splinters and fears ruled highest. Who's the thing? <br /> <br /> The gore effects here are absolutely wonderful and commonplace realistic. I could have done without the dog's head split like a banana peel, but it's just the animal lover in me who is picky: kill all the people you want, but leave the kitties and puppies alone. Sanity and reason disintegrates quickly because people are being taken one by one by the Shapeshifting Alien. The power of this film lies in its paranoia, and although I like the original version, I prefer this one; The real threat lies inside and is scarce for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected. When expressed, it is fury, and the results are horrible. <br /> <br /> It's one of Carpenters' best movies, right there with The Fog and Halloween. All the actors give strong, realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they are their own main character. This movie has something for any loved one of the horror genre. Don't miss it.
