Bringing Back The A team was an hour-long special screen on Channel 4 in the UK last year and hosted by presenter and comedian Justin Lee Collins. The show tried to get and reunite the fellow cast members of the A team. , for the first time ever on TV. It was something that has never been attempted by anyone. Well, not by anyone I know, it's. <br /> <br /> Justin makes a great presenter, and his eccentric personality and humorous banter shone throughout this program. The efforts he has failed have ever been so funny, but he was also very stubborn and eager to fulfill this task, which is a credit to him. Remember, he's good on television anyway, whether it's a show like this, or the Friday night project with his co-host, Alan Carr. <br /> <br /> There were performances and interviews with Dirk Benedict - the Faceman himself, Dwight Schultz-aka Howling Mad Murdock, Marla Heasley, who played Tawnia Baker, Jack Ging aka General 'Bull' Full Bright, the creator of the A team, Stephen J Cannell and the big man himself, Mr. T aka BA Baracus. They were just fascinating to watch and hear what they had to say about the program that became a worldwide hit in the 80's, reminding and reviving the good and bad moments of the show: both during and after the scenes. Unfortunately, no George Peppard, but of course he's already in heaven, understandable and strange enough, no Melinda, who played Amy. <br /> <br /> I just didn't understand why she wasn't in the show. Okay, she was after 3 seasons or whatever, but she was the first and original female member of the A-Team just to replace Marla's Tawnia and it would have been good to see and hear her A-team story, in addition to the other members. <br /> <br /> All in all, Bring Back The A team was an excellent documentary style of the show. Perhaps it might be more widely distributed through which it could have been a six-part documentary. Yet it was a great effort from JLC. recommended
