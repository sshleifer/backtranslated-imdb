I really enjoyed this movie for what it is: A funny little movie that doesn't take it too seriously. Plot summaries are available everywhere, so I won't go into details. However, Michael is not about a complex plot. It just builds on a good assumption and takes the viewer on a great road trip. <br /> <br /> John Travolta's performance as a chain smoke, lady-loving, bar-brawling, cake-eating angel is perfect. And who doesn't love Sparky? <br /> <br /> See if you laugh a bit and want an overall good time. Highly recommended.
