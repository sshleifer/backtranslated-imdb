The Beat was an exciting movie about some young punks who tried to survive in 1980 in New York. It involves fighting with the other street gang who share them directly with a high school class, trying to stay at school, as well as local performances that include bands like the Dead Kennedy's and the name Skulls for their band name. Rex (played by David Jacobson) Plays an autistic child who gets a long start with all these types and begins to show that poetry is really beautiful. If applied to what these children do in life, it can really work. it's better like that! Billy Kane (played by William McNamara) and Kate Kane (played by Kara Glover) are brother and sister. Although they are crowded with this crowd, these children are not the same people as this group. They care about Rex and they care about others and really give an enlightened side of themselves. As his sister sleeps with the head of the gang, she also falls in love with Rex, trying to show him that she is not a slut. But in the end, the teachers at school eventually come to him and want to establish themselves in a spiritual institution. He finally felt it was time to end his life, while Animals of Sound played without him. But they like to think he's not dead, he just lives his life to the full, drives sharks and lives happily in the sea. This movie was one of those movies where I was glad I watched it. While it was very entertaining, it also had a great message. For a long time the lines that these children had had no direction, no future, no image heads to check, but because an upset child came together, everyone realized that there were far more important things for life and then the local black children are fighting or destroying everything. Rex showed them the beauty in fierce music. Rex showed them the beauty of rats, illness and murder. Rex showed them the beauty in almost everything, while some of those things are not beauty, they could still see it when used in poems. These poems talk to people. Rex has played an important role in this move, which has changed everyone's heart of depression to see that there is hope for them, and so he started showing them. That mate.
