While not getting closer to the Tarzan of Edgar Rice Burroughs, the Johnny Wiesmuller flicks, it has it own, and entertaining, slant on the story. This is a well done Tarzan movie. Beautiful scenery, good photography, workable continuity, and a Tarzan scream describing the Burroughs. The players are playing well. The only bad points I found were related to me. It moves slowly in places. The slow motion? Make this photo long. It could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter, which I thought would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and character development. But the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leaves the viewer happy with the movie. Short version of all of the above ... This is a very good Tarzan movie.
