As another IMDb judge puts it, "... imagine 2001: A space Odyssey in the desert" and you will not be far from a brief summary of what is expected of this cinema (I hesitate the word "film"). A lecture on philosophical views on creationism, the myths surrounding human science, the pre and what it was, is what is and what is and what will be. For some, it may be a "2001" on sand, but they address different philosophical views, one on evolution and the future, the hope and potential for humanity, while Fata Morgana itself is a somewhat more metaphysical trait. I just hope I can communicate it effectively. <br /> <br /> The Herzogs style will not be all, and those who are not of a perceived hardcore branch of movie viewing can most likely find it. run, and can't even think about it after 72 minutes. Fata Morgana collects a montage of Sahara footage, including villages, villagers and several other places for a somewhat surreal end, music of different genres and an almost mythical narrative. Fata Morgana is very slow but ultimately rewarding. <br /> <br /> The opening with a fitting of several filmed shots of airplanes landing about five minutes, has already confused you at the launch of the movie and the sense that it won't be like anything you've seen do not have. before echoes in your mind become clear. Divide into three divisions, creation, paradise and golden age, try Fata Morgana and succeed in adjusting the scenery of the desert with the instrument-making man. The three segments are told by different people, which relate specifically to the specific section they express and emphasize the long soliloquy and desert settings. <br /> <br /> Fata Morgana is a film about the existence of man on our earth. It looks at the natural beauty the Earth is designed for, and at the same time looks at the potential beauty we have in us, especially our negative contributions to the world in which we live. Each shot is deliberately compiled, and it can only be described in the context of this movie as 'The Holy Trinity Of Filming' in pictures, words and music. Each part of these three pieces gives something special to each shot, but when they come together, they create something bigger than their whole parts, creating unbridled beauty and deep thoughts in our minds. I won't make this movie the fairness it can only earn with mere words, maybe if I have photos and a score, and I know it will not be appreciated by the masses, but it is a profound and I will not the term "art film" because it is merely art. It is the shift of art that moves the mind and the soul stunned. Whether creativity is your will is irrelevant, because this film is about intelligent design.
