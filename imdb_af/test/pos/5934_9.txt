Shawn Michaels vs Edge-8- Kind of hard to believe Shawn Michaels is in the opening match, but still a good game by both men, Edge, whether you are a good performer in the ring or not, and Shawn Michaels is just oblivious when it comes to his performance The Undertaker vs Heidenreich. Casket Match-2- OK, after a good opening game, now this, which is a crappy game. Undertaker had a few good games at the Royal Rumble, and the 1998 Royal Rumble against Shawn Michaels was the same match, but it is much worse than it suits. <br /> <br /> Kurt Angle vs Big Show vs. Bradshaw. Triple Threat WWE Championship-6- It's good, I feel all three men could have given a better performance, but they really didn't show them at their best. <br /> <br /> Randy Orton vs Triple H. World Heavyweight Championship-9-Triple H gets a good win, you can believe it, sure he takes out the Shammer, but doesn't use it. Randy Orton did well when he acted like he had a concussion, but how he got the concussion is really ridiculous. I really liked this game, it was the best show I've ever seen for HHH. <br /> <br /> The Royal Rumble Match-7- It was highly entertaining and I don't usually write the royal rumble game this high. The winner is again very predictable, but it had many moments that were very entertaining to watch. The segments with Flair and Guerrero are hilarious the best segments I've seen for a while. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a good PPV and a must for the wrestling fans.
