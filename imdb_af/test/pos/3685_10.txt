We loved this movie because it was so entertaining and downward. Don't drive your usual Hollywood. <br /> <br /> My husband got a Blockbuster coupon and passed a series of new releases of violent Hollywood stuff. He was about to step out when he saw it and decided to take a chance. There was only one copy - and with some glitches in the DVD we finally had to turn to the wide screen version and then back to the full screen version to stop it. But it was worth it. Cathy Bates is so good and she was so perfect for the role. And she can also sing! <br /> <br /> If only Hollywood were to learn from independent filmmakers! Maybe we're going back to the real movies. But for now, we like the rhythm and really entertaining movies like this! Other examples we enjoyed include: a box full of moonlight, pieces of April, rendering of Milo, the Celestine prophet. Most of Christopher Guest like: Best in Show, For Your Consideration, A Great Wind And Wait For Guffman
