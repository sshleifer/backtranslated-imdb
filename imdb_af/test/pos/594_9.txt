A lot of full-length movies with the Muppets, created by Jim Henson & Co., were made, but "The Muppet Movie" was the first one of them all, and the first in the original trilogy, which is also "The Great Muppet Caper" "and" The Muppets Take Manhattan ". It was released seven years before I was born, so of course I didn't see it at the moment (and I didn't see his two successors when they were first released). However, I saw many of the Muppets during my childhood, mostly after Henson's premature death in 1990. I eventually came to see this movie for the first time in the mid-1990s, after hearing the soundtrack. Surprisingly, I liked it right away and it hasn't really disappointed over the past few years. <br /> <br /> One day, while Kermit puts the Frog in a swamp with his banjo after the song "Rainbow Connection", a Hollywood agent named Bernie comes in a boat and insists on a career in Tinseltown. Kermit takes his advice and goes west. He will soon meet Fozzie Bear, an unsuccessful stand-up comedian in a restaurant, and convince him to come along. The frog is also noticed by Doc Hopper, owner of a frog restaurant chain who wants Kermit to be his mascot. As a frog, Kermit thereby becomes disgusting, so he refuses and leaves with Fozzie. On their journey across the country, Kermit and Fozzie meet other Muppets who join them, including Miss Piggy (who will soon become Kermit's love interest) and Gonzo. Unfortunately, as they all try to make their way to Hollywood, Doc Hopper, assisted by Max, is willing to do something to force Kermit to become his mascot of his restaurant chain. Kermit finds himself in increasing danger! <br /> <br /> One thing many people praise this movie is the songs, and I can understand why. There is, of course, the Oscar-nominated "Rainbow Connection" in the beginning, and more good songs follow such as Kermit and Fozzie's catchy road song, Movin Right Along, and I go there. Someday ", a pleasant ballad sung by Gonzo." Never Never, Never Again ", the song Miss Piggy sings when she first sees Kermit, is the only one I will consider rather poor and their romance suddenly looks. Muppets in this movie are generally fond, just like they are on TV, and some of them give a lot of humor, including Fozzie, who makes his first appearance in the movie and hopelessly tries to entertain people in a restaurant with his stand -up, and, if you are familiar with this well-known Muppets, you need to know what to expect from each of them, and some of the live actors who appear briefly in the movie can be funny, like Dom DeLuise and Bernie the Agent and Steve Martin as the "Insolent Waiter." It's also not 100% comedy, but there are serious parts of the movie that they did well too. <br /> <br /> Watching this original Muppet movie again this year , was my first time to look at any of them since their "Muppets from Space" saw (one of the Muppet films made after Henson's death, released in 1999) for the first time last year. I was very disappointed when I saw that movie that had never happened before when I watched a movie or television show with the popular puppet characters! Not only is the movie not very funny, I also think it is a bit too dark and cruel for the Muppets, as I said in my review! However, I cannot say that I released the same from any of the predecessors of this movie, including those twenty years before. "The Muppet Movie" seems to be the most popular of the bunch, and as it likes so much, not just for children, it's understandable. I have many doubts that there is still much to be said about "The Muppet Movie" that has not been said in the past thirty years, but today it remains good family entertainment.
