Strangeland seems to have a love / hate relationship with many of his viewers. I personally loved the movie and everything about it. <br /> <br /> The acting in some places can be improved, but the filming adds to the atmosphere where the acting cannot. In some areas, the dialogue is a bit cheesy and dramatic, but really, what do you expect from the late 90's? Over all, Dee did a wonderful job of writing what I believe to be one of the frightening thrillers I have ever seen. It plays on the fears of many age groups - adult, parents and children. Every parent fears that their children will get involved with chat rooms and meet strangers from the internet. And this * happens * in the real world. And every child and adult fears are abducted and tortured against their will; It also happens in the real world. This is what makes this film such a sensitive subject for many. <br /> <br /> My only warning is if you * know * you are sensitive to things like strong violence, visible torture and gore, then you * don't * want to see this movie. If you're not sure if this movie will entertain you, read as many reviews as you can, ask people you know who watched this movie and be ready to turn off the movie when you're disturbed.
