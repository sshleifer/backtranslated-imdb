MY Father the hero is sweet, funny and cute. Gerard Depardiu is wonderful as Andre, a divorced father taking his fourteen-year-old daughter Nicole (Kathrine Heigl) to the Caribbean for vacation. While his daughter meets a man named Ben (Dalton James) to impress him, she tells him André is her lover and her father is in prison for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and she has pimped her ran. Everyone on the island is soon under the impression that André is molesting a child. André is between two relationships. One with Isabelle (Emma Thompson, who makes a como in the end of the movie) and Diana (Faith Prince of Spin City). My father the hero has very funny moments. Like when he is at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something French. So he plays "Thank you for little girls" from Gigi. Everyone is disgusted and abandoned. My Father the hero does not deserve a 5.1. I think it deserves a 9.0.
