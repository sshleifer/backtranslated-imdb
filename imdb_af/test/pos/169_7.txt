This movie is great. 80-year-old slasher movie about three children born during an eclipse, killing everyone they see. The reason they kill almost makes no sense, but it just adds to the charm of this movie. And dang, these kids are crazy, especially Curtis. If you saw the movie, you know who I'm talking to. That child is brave! Although the movie does not have much to do, it is entertaining, and for some reason you give some care to the characters. It also has some nice nudity. Have some decent performances, really a decent 80's treasure movie, it's worth a look if you ever get the chance to see it. You will have nightmares over those darn kids, though I guarantee you!
