Peter Watkins's rare Punishment Park is a cruel, uncompromised political weapon that comes across an eternally ending desert community. An unapologetically left-leaning anti-authoritarian abuse feast, the escapes at first seems to be over the top military and sickly that it can come down as a far-off fantastic dystopian alternative history, even one Harry Turtledove would enjoy. But as soon as we go deeper and really pay attention to the horrible diatribe that boasts of the presidents over the tent cover, as well as the gunmen who oversee the bloody affair, our eyes are really opened. Suddenly we realize just how prescient Watkins's film production is, so many of these are the kind of neo-con talk about youth culture and the legality of diverse thoughts that politicians are looking for today. Assigned, much of it was also urgently poured out, but it really shows us how little has changed and tells us how in a few ways we are closer to such a world where Punishment Parks would be a real and frightening operation. <br /> <br /> The main players in almost every scene are seasoned non-actors, mostly chosen for their political views and desire to get them on the camera. It offers an unprecedented hope of authenticity to the whole experience, as we never, even for a second, question the reality of all the chaos. Shot documentary style with 16mm film, it looks like a gritty documentation of some despicable government test project that has been classified until found years later. At least it looks like it's history, maybe not as much as it is (scarcely) released. But it gives an extra weight to all the proceedings and helps you to move into this incredible non-alternative universe of torture for convicted dissidents.
