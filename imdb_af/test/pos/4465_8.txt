A title apparently more suited to a Looney Tunes featurette as a creepy giallo, "Don't Torture a Duck" (1972) is a Grade A player of the horror maestro Lucio Fulci. In this one someone strangled the preteen boys in a rural, southern Italian town and typical of this gialli there are many suspects. There is Barbara Bouchet (Patrizia), who looks more scrumptiolicious than you've ever seen her, a rich girl hiding in a drug scandal; Florinda Bolkan (Martiara), the local epileptic voodoo woman; her witchcraft practitioner; Giuseppe, the local idiot; the sweet priest; his mother-in-law; and on and on. The film features some unusually violent pieces, including a chain injury to one of the main characters in a cemetery (one of the most realistic bloody rows I've ever seen) and a delicate downfall when the killer is finally revealed. The film's outbursts of violence compensate for the fact that there is no real fear or tension to speak. Yet, it fascinates with its unusual rural background, disruptive child murders, strange characters and freaky score by Riz Ortolani. The film is beautifully photographed in what I suppose to be Monte Sant'Angelo, near the Adriatic in southern Italy (at least, the town's police force is resigned in the final credits). And while captions make this finer DVD work even better (the American snake doesn't convince in this rural Italian setting), Anchor Bay needs to be thanked for another great job. Oh ... that title finally makes perfect sense!
