This movie has two new features related to the message conveyed by other equally good films on death penalty and executions. This is the stress that is also given to the drama that the victims' parents endure. To disguise the hatred and desire of revenge, they feel they are reducing or reducing the horror that represents the performance, and the Christian vision of all the questions. We should also point out that in this movie the sentenced man is not the ordinary, innocent person we see in other films dealing with retrenchments that we do not abandon the idea that a sentence is just a legitimate murder in any case . Last but not least, we must indicate the extraordinary emotional weight at the last moments of the execution course with all the catharsis shown by the last words of the condemned and the detail with which the act of execution itself in a parallel cut with images of the murder scenes in the bush to emphasize that we are confronted with another murder are as stupid as the latter, but carried out in a cold and supposed "legal" way.
