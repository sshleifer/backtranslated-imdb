"I wrestled with death. It is the most inconspicuous game you can imagine. It is found in an impeccable gravel, with nothing underfoot, with nothing without spectators, without damp, without glory, without the great desire of victory Without the great fear of defeat, in a sickly atmosphere of clumsy skepticism, without much faith in your own right, and even less in that of your adversary. If this is the form of ultimate wisdom, life is greater mystery if some of us think it is. "Marlow in Joseph Conrad's" Heart of Darkness "<br /> <br /> It's hard to make the subject of death in any artwork. However, films have recently made bold efforts to humanize it to the extent that it is embraced as part of the cycle of all living things, and it can be chosen rather than legislation. "Chosen" is the operative word for Alejandro Amenabar's Sea Inside, loosely based on the true story of the Galician sailor Ramon Sampedro. It is a drama about euthanasia without prejudice in love, poetry and friendship. If it sounds like Barbarian Invasions (2003), in which a cancer professor bid farewell to lifelong friends and love before taking his life, then you're right. In fact, sea is better because it spends more intimate time with the main character before it goes, a remarkable achievement with none of those moments in the least dull or uninteresting. <br /> <br /> Javier Bardem as Ramon has expressive eyes and commands voice for the romantic quadriplegic, a combination of difficult realistic and poetic sufferers. Belen Rueda plays the disabled attorney Julia, who becomes an imaginary lover of Ramon, who grows in radiance as her life becomes ill with disease. At the already almost soap-opera situation, Lola Duenas is Rosa, a blue collar visitor who initially tries to take Ramon off to seek death, but quickly falls in love with him. Talk about romantic disability? This man has incredible happiness that attracts considerable women, and he can't move a finger. But speaking he can, prove the ultimate argument about what women want: love that speaks, not just. <br /> <br /> I will remember to mention the lead film, now for an Oscar that contains euthanasia as its highlight. in order not to spoil the experience for the first rally. Suffice it to say that both films are successful in opening both sides of a controversial subject without forcing a specific point of view. The religious right has the right to complain that the former film and barbaric invasions celebrate suicide; it has no right to accuse the beautifully balanced sea lanes of the same. <br /> <br /> "A life in this state has no dignity," Ramon says. The irony is that he performs himself with the highest dignity that lets someone know he is determined to end his life. "The Sea Inside" is a formidable entry in 2004's Oscar nominations for Best Foreign Language Film.
