Everyone who has ever wondered how to make a movie without any budget should see this documentary. The determination of everyone depicted in this project has moved me a lot and belongs to those of us who ever participated in any part of the show business, whether it's film, music or writing. I think the filmmakers could have done better work on the preview of the events that resulted in this film becoming a documentary, perhaps through a narrator; Other than that, the film emerges as a true example of how performances are not about the show, but rather the business. <br /> <br /> I hope the actual project, "Repo Man II", gets the day's light. I think the filmmakers did a fine job of how little they had to work and everything they had to overcome to complete it.
