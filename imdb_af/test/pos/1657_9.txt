What a guest of a movie! "Film Noir" has always been one of my favorite genres, but this one is separate from the rest. Only "The Big Sleep", "Out of the Past", "Murder My Sweet" and "The Killers" can come close to this caper classic. I know these four American movies I mentioned are not Christmas per se, but rather explorations with complicated story lines that still make up a "noirean", fierce quality over them, similar to "Rififi". <br /> <br /> What is different here is how Jules Dassin puts the overall atmosphere of the film into action, not only in the eager realism of the principals, but also in the use of the streets of Paris as a subliminal character and co-conspirator for himself! The movie centers around "le Stephanois", a dark, moody state and intricate ex-con to get a last chance at the heavy payout. Even though he is an indifferent and stubborn, difficult man, he still feels a desire in him for a kind of salvation by freeing himself of the demons of his past (hey, he saved Toni!). Dassin chose the right man (Jean Servais) for that role. <br /> <br /> These are the rest of the story developments kind of falling into place as we travel through the famous "quiet" gondolas to the ultimate death of the main "perps". Only their wives survived, except for Ida, Mario's honey. They understand the best of the underlying futility of everything!
