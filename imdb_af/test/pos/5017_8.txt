What about certain films that generate such polar reactions? <br /> <br /> Some people have called a "disgusting" role here. Some called it "extraordinary" (as I actually do). <br /> <br /> Why? I think it's because movies like these don't make heroes out of jerks or shine from degeneration, and some people can't handle them emotionally. They need a hero. And I also want to add that if they are gamblers or poker players, they can be personally betrayed when their existence is not justified. <br /> <br /> High Roller in NOT a poker movie. This is a PEOPLE movie. It's not perfect, but it looks good, is well written and performed wonderfully. And best of all, it generates an emotional response and inspires reflection. <br /> <br /> And maybe that's what makes some people so dirty.
