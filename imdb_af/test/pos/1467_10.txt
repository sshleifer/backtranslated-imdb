This movie is a very nice and slow movie. There's nothing Hollywood left over. It is very Danish and the characters are very real. This is the first Danish movie to record this transsexual theme. It's really about love that has no gender. I won't say it's about lesbian love, although the two main characters (the Transsexual Veronika and Charlotte) are attracted to each other. It is a story of love and life. <br /> <br /> The story actually takes place in the two apartments. There is almost no background music, which seems to be more real and intense. The two actors who play the main characters are wonderful. They really make them. They are not archetypes, but real people you can meet in the street. I think it's the first time I've seen a transsexual, who portrayed this well. Well done.
