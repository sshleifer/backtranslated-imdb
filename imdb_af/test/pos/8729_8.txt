I'm amazed at the relatively low rating this movie has. This is a screw-ball comedy and romance film rolled up by someone other than Billy Wilder, but it does a very good job and has even won an Oscar. <br /> <br /> It's been Ingrid Bergman's first film in the US since the 1950s and even though she was no longer the young bombing she was in her early movies, she has brought out a difficult role very handy. This film shows she has many talents outside her appearance. <br /> <br /> Goldie Hawn, who won an Oscar in this, her first film, as supporting actress, is great as the modern, sophisticated and latest latest mistress of Dentist playboy, loves them and lets them Walter Mathaw. Goldie is beautiful for all the senses in this role, which with a big role as a slam dunk for this early career award. <br /> <br /> This movie is not really deep but is a jewel that stood the test of time very well. Not sure why it is average, because I give it a solid 8.
