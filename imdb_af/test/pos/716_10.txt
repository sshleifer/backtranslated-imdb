I watch many movies - DVD, features and classic, call it. The night I looked at Jericho MILE, my wife (who ordered it on the internet) said she remembered when she was in high school, that she had stayed with her all these years. Somewhat unwillingly I sat down (with our daughter and son), and sounded like the opening order to the final titles. We all were. <br /> <br /> She, who remembered the original, and our kids (18 and 16) who didn't know what the movie was about, can't believe it. Our favorite scene? Bar, if Peter Strauss so passionately bounces off his nose and says, "I'll do it again!" It did not plead for violence because it was a defense crime, but we did so. We could not believe it. When his co-companies gave him his efforts, there was no dry eye in our house. <br /> <br /> Please make more movies like this one. UNBELIEVABLE !!
