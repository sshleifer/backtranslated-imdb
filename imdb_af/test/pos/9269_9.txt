I went to "The Closer She Gets" knowing that this is the story of the filmmaker's mother fighting cancer. I expected it to be a very sad, depressing movie. And while the subject is definitely emotional, the remarkable thing about this movie is the positive message it sends. It shows a family's total commitment to meeting the challenge of cancer. They refuse to lose faith in one another, even in the darkest moments. <br /> <br /> The most moving moments for me are when this faith is revealed. Few comments made by the mother and the family who want to reveal her (and her) survival, and their challenging emphasis on love and family attitudes. In this way, it is an exciting and deeply hopeful movie. We must all be so happy to be surrounded by family like this in times of serious illness.
