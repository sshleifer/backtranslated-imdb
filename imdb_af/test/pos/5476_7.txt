What I saw about Wolfgang Petersen's films was pretty good. He knows how to act, create tension and interest you. Eastwood tends to be good, sometimes excellent. This applies to both his acting and his direction. They both work hard here. The concept is not bad, and the cat and mouse game works well. Malkovich performs fairly well, and she and Eastwood's play each other on the film. I suppose it won't introduce anything new, really ... but it never really demands or needs it. These are two great actors, each playing a basic role that they have proven at other points in their careers that they can manage remarkably well and with a wonderful director at the helm. Really, it's entertaining, well done, and it's just ordinary suppliers. Editing and cinematography is good. Act and character writing is also. The movie manages tension and intensity, and if you leave yourself, you'll probably be entertained and engaged, even if there are better movies out there. The pacing is pretty much spot-on. I recommend it to any fan of the main actors, the director and / or this kind of movie. 10/07
