Dolelemite (1975) is a cult classic. Directing Rudy Ray Moore as the pimp superhero to wrong rights while challenging the MAN under the road. He has two enemies, it's not a good Willie Green and the messy mayor. Watch Dolemite kick, punch, hit and pimp his way across the screen. What is the man's name? DOLEMITE! <br /> <br /> Interesting film that paved the way for a generation of rappers and artists. To sell more of his party albums, Rudy Ray Moore made several on the cheap films during the 1970s. Self produced and marketed, he catered for a specific audience. Some people call it black exploitation, others call it trash, I call it entertaining. Dolemite was followed by semi-successor The Human Tornado and a direct video of Return of Dolemite 25 years later. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended, a definite cult classic! <br /> <br /> Footnotes, if the movie is properly videoized, won't see the boom. Dolemite was cut to receive an R score.
