To say it's a good performance is to say nothing at all. After all, this show was made by the same crew responsible for the plane and other hilarious and brilliant movies. Writing is great. Although the display is built on one-liners, it does not become offensive or annoying. Leslie Nielsen bowed his comedy muscle to the fullest extent as if he were saying: You haven't seen anything yet. The format was definitely polished to set Naked Gun. Watching these movies watches how many skticks are taken from the TV show. The brilliant part is that they should not be changed too much. The show was really a test ground for bigger and better versions to come later.
