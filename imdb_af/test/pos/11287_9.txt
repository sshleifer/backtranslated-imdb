E. Elias Merhige's Begotten is one of a kind, surrealistic representation of man's treatment of religion. There are a few different ways in which you can interpret things, but the plot itself is simple: a God evades himself, and from his body mother earth jumps. Mother Earth then breaks the god's body after death, and then satisfies her with the remains of his seed. Then she gives a messiah figure that is malicious, presumably in infancy, but possibly with terror to be born on earth. All this takes place in the first 15-30 minutes, and then the rest of the movie consists of dragged figures dragging the messiah (across a desert landscape). The dressed figures only break to brutalize the messiah and continue to drag him. <br /> <br /> There are a few ways to interpret it, depending on your level of optimism and your world view. It can easily be interpreted as a dark nihilistic atheist allegory about the total lack of apparent power that Christian "deities" can be regarded as in a modern society that only insists on their names to promote their own selfish goals. Or you can interpret it as a postmodern pro-Christian allegory in which you consider the film to be about how man so distorted Christ's message that it can no longer be original purity and innocence in a world where that message and image not used improperly to endorse everything from interpersonal violence, war to totalitarianism. <br /> <br /> The footage of this movie is phenomenal, and you won't see anything like it. If you can, check out the original VHS release, I recommend it. I'm not sure if the footage on the DVD is changing, but I've seen clips of this stream on your tube and the effects are severely reduced. On the VHS version, Merhige TOTAL BINARY CONTRAST achieved. Meaning, there is basically no middle sound, except for some grain in some of the shots. Unlike this, this film offers the rare opportunity to see PURE white and PURE black, and the result is beautiful, hallucinating and reasonably disturbing. This film makes Film Noir look bleak and mediocre. The shots fall surrealistically on one another, reminding Un Chien Andalou, without really complaining, for an effect called a Rorschach cinematic test. <br /> <br /> It is said, the movie can definitely be a viewer's patience and dedication. There is no dialogue for starters. The only sound in the film is a fairly constant loop of cricket that is sometimes cut off with the gurgling and the skull of the dying gods, and an amelodic drone synthesizer texture. Personally, I find the movie best enjoyed listening to experimental industrial music such as the instrumental NIN remixes of the Downward Spiral era, more abstract noise / experimental music such as F * ck Buttons and Odd Nosdam. It also works well with apocalyptic black metal. Actually any music with extreme textures and / or hypnotic rhythms. This is one of the most wonderful and versatile aspects of this film. It is PRIME for post-modern re-contextualization, such as portraying it during an avant-garde performance or compiling avant-garde music. <br /> <br /> Once the messiah figure is born, there really isn't much change for the rest of the movie, which means you're actually hit 45 minutes or more of the Messiah figure through the desert. It looks beautiful, but there isn't really anything new. It helps the filmmakers' intentions to communicate that people have been using thousands of years to use Christ's name and image for personal benefits, but can be tiring for a casual viewer or someone with a short attention span. Basically, if you're looking for a modern horror movie with excitement, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a unique movie experience and you are not particularly fond of the mainstream Hollywood theater, it can be your alleged messiah.
