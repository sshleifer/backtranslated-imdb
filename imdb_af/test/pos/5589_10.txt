I think Crewes did her bad part very well, she had to win an award. Anything that Dunne is in is resilient, because Dunne is a great actress and can break down anything, even a poor writing. Therefore, I will only recommend this for this reason. This movie may have been a little ahead of time, the plot may be more acceptable. <br /> <br /> During the golden age of Hollywood, movies were meant to entertain or learn, mostly to make us feel good or handle the times. This plot seems to deviate from that profile. Yet again I have to say what Irene Dunne was at least, "good" because she made things so credible! The only other actress I can say made me think it was possible, Deborah Kerr. See Silver Cord if you get the chance for the "scene" as nothing else.
