For the first time, I've seen Love in Limbo release free television about five years ago, and since then it's a movie I will always remember as one of those movies you see and be influenced forever. <br /> <br /> For the uninitiated, Australian film has a long history of making cut off comedies about lovely losers, and Love in Limbo is a great example. While Russel Crowe is the only closest actor (although he already needs a movie today), the rest of the Aussie cast is good. He steals the show as a nervous, northern virgin loser. <br /> The general point of departure is much like American Pie. A group of friends being laid and become men. As you would expect, the whole movie focuses on it (with a subplot about the chief's mother and several other incidents), and is full of humorous situations that push it to the inevitable sweet end. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed American Pie, don't expect it to be the same - but expect the same conventions to make. Love in Limbo is not a brutal romantic comedy, but it certainly has its share of laughter, fist-pumping moments when the good guy wins and the situations every man, Australian or otherwise, can have. <br /> <br /> See it if you like: American Pie, Almost Famous. Good luck: Good Aussie throws, easy to relationships to good value. Weaknesses: Predictable on points. My rating: 8 out of 10
