Yes, I felt I was killed after I first saw it. But not until the next day I began to see the true glory of this creation. I won't repeat much that has already been said by those who appreciate the movie, but there is one new area I want to touch ... ** SPOILERS ** Why does the teacher have the broken glass exactly in the student's pocket? Most reviewers have noted that it reflects only her cruelty and response to an unsatisfactory performance. I have to disagree. Look at the scene again. Huppert is moved to tears while she sees her student playing on stage. The student is quite an expressive girl (crying and singing her fears) - just the opposite of Huppert's character. There was later a scene in the movie after the girl was injured, when Huppert discussed the accident with the girl's mother. The mother, visibly upset, says, "We gave up everything so that she could study the piano" and Huppert immediately understood. "You mean she gave up everything." <br /> <br /> It was my thought that Huppert was simply saving this young expressive student from her own destiny. She did not want the girl to be like HER, suppressed and hardened, condemned to a life of considerations ... gradually killing the soul in the pursuit of perfection. Perhaps she saw her on stage several years ago before things got bad. Maybe she wished she'd escaped when she was that age. Does she disturb the student's life or just release her? <br /> <br /> For me, the realization made the difference in what I experienced through this movie. Brilliant.
