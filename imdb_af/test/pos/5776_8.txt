I saw this movie when it first came out. Patty didn't want to be separated from her brothers and sisters. But the Juvenile Justice system doesn't care. When Patty looked at the file, the judge sent her to a juvenile detention center. He alleged that she had violated the private rules, watching private files. She just wanted her family together. I couldn't blame her. The parents were not even suitable parents. One of the smaller children had to have a toilet. The father stopped and let them go. He drove off and stranded the children at the petrol station. Patty had to take authority to protect them, as she was the oldest. They were placed in foster homes. The good part is that the social worker has them back as a family. The chief social worker told him to shake off and not interfere. He was crazy crazy. He was the one who put Patty in the youth facility. Why didn't they go to the Father who was released from prison to abandon. Yet the children in the middle are trapped and feeling unsafe.
