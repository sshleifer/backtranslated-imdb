It's not really about wine. No, Nossiter's real targets are those that will streamline and assimilate the characteristics of local (wine) production for business purposes. For this purpose, he made an excellent, objective film. Frustrated, voluptuous, emotional and deficient independent wine producers stand alongside media-finessed, anodine-spoken Amercians and Auld-Europeans: the art of winemaking against market-driven, manufactured product production. It is an open show that does not lead to conclusion. <br /> <br /> Nossiter's movie is sometimes watching - cameras are not hidden or steadicam. There are also plenty of captions as well as captions to browse through, often short on screen. <br /> <br /> But it does Michael Moore at the game Moore can't play anyway. The characters speak for themselves - and therefore condemn them. Well worth watching 7/10
