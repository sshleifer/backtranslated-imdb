Is very good old - still exciting and exciting today. Certainly one of Hitch's best movies. Beautifully shot, with a good suspense, sex appeal made by beautiful Ruth Roman. Because of the great prospect, you feel you have to see it to the end. If you lose faith in Hitch yourself and doubt his title as the Master of Suspension, I recommend this nice movie as an antidote. 5 out of 5.
