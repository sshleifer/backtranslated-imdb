The first half hour of "Homegrown" was rather boring and not absorbing, but as the film progressed, my interest also touched on the characters and the plot. Several scenes are very scary and you are afraid of the main characters you are actually attached to. The story is about three hired hands on a hidden illegal marijuana farm in southern California. They testify to the murder of the farm owner, Malcolm (John Lithgow), and they take the weeds for their own ear. The three basically simple farming hands will soon be swept into a scary world of mafia and local interest, while everyone tries to convince everyone that Malcolm is still alive. While the movie had several mistakes and a slow start, it was worth it. 7/10 stars.
