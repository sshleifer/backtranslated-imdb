A European musician and composer sets the musical diversity of Istanbul. Alexander Hacke (of German avant-garde band Einstürzende Neubauten), a beloved experiment with the sound, studies the streets of Istanbul with his mobile recording studio and 'magical mike' to set up an inspired portrait of Turkish music. His journey leads to the discovery of a broad spectrum ranging from modern electronic, rock and hip-hop to classic Arabic. While wandering through this seductive world, Alex collects impressions and traces of artists such as neo-psychedelic band Baba Zula, fusion DJs Orient Expressions, rock groups Duman and Replikas, Maverick rocker Erkin Koray, Ceza (Turkey's answer to Public Enemy), Breakdance performances Istanbul Style Breakers, digital dervish Mercan Dede, well-known clarinetist Selim Sesler, Canadian folk songwriter Brenna MacCrimmon, street artists Siyasiababend, Kurdish singer Aynur, "Elvis of Arabesque" Orhan Gencebay, and legendary divas Müzeyyen Senar and Sezen Aksu.
