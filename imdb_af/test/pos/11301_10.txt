I just want to comment on the woman above, that the movie CREDIT ACCEPTED in the begging. In the beginning credits they show it. Thank you. I think it's a great movie. They just picked the right music for the sphere of the movie, the animation is great, and they chose the voices for the characters very well. It teaches children to never give up and always have hope. Princess Annika does not give up, and it shows children that they can do the same. The movie also has humor for all ages, parents and children, to laugh. The colors in this movie are great, and kids can really feel good while watching it. I watched the movie for the first time, now I'm a big fan, and I'm sure your kid will be too. Walmart sells tons of Barbie and Magic or Pegasus stuff, so your child can continue to enjoy the movie even when they don't see it. Thank you!
