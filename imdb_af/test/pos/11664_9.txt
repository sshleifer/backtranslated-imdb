"Dead Man Walking" is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen. I find it hard to believe that after watching the movie, someone can feel indifferent about the movie or his message. Tim Robbins does not attempt to impose his ideas and beliefs on viewers, but manages a movie that is most sympathetic to both views on the death penalty - whether it is right to kill a killer or not. I have always known where I stand in this question, even as a child, and this movie - despite the fact that it doesn't really kiss - even made me confident in my belief that it would never be right to murder * nobody *. <br /> <br /> Sean Penn is absolutely brilliant in his portrayal of Matthew Poncelet, his nomination for an Oscar was well-deserved. Even if Nicolas Cage does a good job in Las Vegas, I'd be happier if Penn won the award. Susan Sarandon is also brilliant and deserves the Oscar she won. And Tim Robbins definitely deserves the voice I gave to this movie: 9/10!
