Lovingly manufactured and terribly interesting to see Garfield's eager, breakthrough performance (a new kind of rebellious acting that will convey the Brandos and Clifts and so on to the war), but all the sister sensitivity is a little smothered. Priscilla Lane is a bright, engaging artist, but the other sisters really don't register (although they may all be tart and greasy) and I just had a hard time buying some of the other male characters next to Garfield. Jeffrey Lynn is a pleasant, enough actor, but he does not have the film-heavyweight to match Garfield's hard luck, Mickey Borden, and it throws the movie off a bit. (Imagine a Jimmy Stewart or someone in the part.) Nor was I convinced that Garfield would make the final decision he made. The movie needs another half hour of running to explain the action better; It feels terribly rushed and under-motivated. Still, it is not difficult to understand how anyone who grew up with this photo would remember it. It doesn't seem to be classic, but it does have a few classic moments. The two gate screen tones are pure film art.
