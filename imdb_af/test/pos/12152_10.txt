I've become a big fan of Barbet Schroeder's work, so maybe I'm a bit biased, but I think this movie is good, though there may be some lengths. This is a romantic unromantic view of the Great Liberation in the late sixties, stylistically incredibly polished (wonderful design!) And in my opinion still very viewable. <br /> <br /> It is basically an ironic repetition of the story of Adam and Eve being expelled from paradise after having tasted the "forbidden fruit", which is filled with an apple in an assault with heroine. The woman seduces a man to use it, thereby accelerating his punishment. man seems to be doomed and bound for an intensive life and an early grave, right off the big title line. There is no place for any hope. <br /> <br /> Although the story is rather sad, I was caught by the beauty of the beautiful location of Ibiza and Mimsy Farmer. I found her character to be level, enigmatic, engaging, annoying, interesting and boring at one time. Somehow she represents those who see men in a basic, unofficial way in women. In general, it is very well tackled and used ?? It appears to be a trademark of Schroeder. <br /> <br /> There is even humor, mainly by Stefan, the German main character and his accent. His main nemesis is not a snake, but an older German of dubious reputation ?? and heroine supplier - called Wolf. Although it is a German name and Stefan German, he speaks it English and in jealousy spends the name on his girlfriend regularly? becomes a boy crying ... Sometimes Stefan has to work to earn a celery. "At one point the man is going to snorkel, and then he uncomfortably hits a rock with his rubber buttons? Funny in film history.
