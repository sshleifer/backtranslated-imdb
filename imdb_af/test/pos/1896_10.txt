This movie is funny in more ways than one. It has action. It has humor. It has attitude. It added Dolemite's whole girl army of kung-fu! And that's just what the movie offers as a movie. It is also poorly performed by some, the microphone makes more than one cameo appearance, and some bumps through the feet. But when you make a movie so cool, who has time to pay attention to those "details"? These movie rocks. Rent it tonight, if you can find it ... I had to buy it to see it, but it doesn't hurt me!
