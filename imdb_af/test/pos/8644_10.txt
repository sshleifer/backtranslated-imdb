Hitchcock will be proud of this movie. Even when nothing happens, it's exciting. Director David Lynch left some cheap excitement pieces here and there, but he interspersed them with other cinematographic techniques to make it unusable. <br /> <br /> Quite surreal, this movie is like waking up and most of a dream but not enough to make it meaningful. I'm still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to miss things I missed and that can help me understand it better. It's a very detailed plot that meets very slowly, so be patient and pay attention. Get your bathroom out of the way before it starts. And yet the plot is overshadowed by the theme, the mood, the character development and the filming techniques. <br /> <br /> The dual roles of the main actress, Naomi Watts, show off her immense talent. That's when I could see my fellow star's eyes. What an acting couple. <br /> <br /> Lynch surprises throughout the film with unusual camera angles, the length / timing of cuts, jumping back and forth between screens. Combined with clever use of music and sounds, it all helps build tension in our minds, undoubtedly an important goal of the director. Well, he kept me on the edge of my seat, I even talked to the actors to be here, and not so naive. You know, the kind of things you want your kids to do at the movies.
