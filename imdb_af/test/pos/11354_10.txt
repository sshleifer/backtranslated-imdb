In the 60's Hong Kong, a man and woman were moving the same day in adjoining apartments with their respective spouses. Soon they suspect their ever-absent wife to have a relationship with each other. A strange bond emerges between the man and woman while dealing with their grief by playing in turns playing each other's spouse before a more complex band emerges ... <br /> <br /> No summary can Don't do it right, for Hong Kong author Wong Kar-Wai's "In the Mood for Love" is nothing less than a miracle. A story about sadness that manages to touch and sometimes funny. A romance that never feels forced or fake. There is no doubt that the director's method has much to do with it. <br /> <br /> Targeting an indifferent script (although the concept is mainly from a Japanese short story) to promote improvisation, the film immediately comes through the freshness of its performances. All the film is about it and the rest is pure improvement. At the heart of the film are two characters that will illuminate in your heart and stay there long after the end credits role: Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are simply astonishing and no language barrier undermines a single fragment of immediacy and truth they display. The additional material is also: the movies are great to watch (partially borrowed by "Hero" Christopher Doyle) and the music is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> It is something that everyone should see as just because it is by far the most affectionate, mature and authentic "love story" out there. Thinking away.
