Stephen Sondheim's genius has never been more prominent since it was in his 1979 Musical Thriller SWEENEY TODD, a Gothic, greedy, creepy but delightful musical concession over a demented hairdresser returning to London for revenge to give on the evil judge. who has not only left London permanently, but also raises his daughter as his own and plans to marry her to protect her from all the evils of the world. The hairdresser finds love, sympathy and help from a lonely tertiary owner who has her own agenda where Todd is involved. This musical rocked Broadway and won nine Tony awards, including best musical and best actress in a musical (Angela Lansbury). The production was completely filmed in 1982 with Angela Lansbury who was her Broadway role as Mrs. Lovett, the daffy shop owner, recreated what constitutes a practical use for Todd's heads. George Hearn, who replaced Len Cariou on Broadway, electrified in the title role, so much so you have to wonder why he didn't originally roll the roll. Lansbury and Hearn are knocking from start to finish and escorting 100% to their ghoulish characters, with a first-class Sondaheim score, probably the closest Sondheim wrote to an opera. Lansbury shines on "The Worst Pies in London" and "By the Sea". George Hearn stops the show with Epiphany and is also compelling during 'Pretty Women', a duet he sings with Judge Turpin, the man he has vowed on revenge. Cris Groendahl is impressive as Antony, the young sailor who saves Todd and falls to his daughter Johanna. Betsy Joselyn is a bit over the top as Johanna and really vocal to the point that during a few moments during Green Funch and Linnet Bird she drives her voice straight. The rest of the film is, first and foremost, especially Edmund Lyndeck as Judge Turpin, who performs in this production "Johanna", which was cut off from the original production, and Ken Jennings as Toby, whose wonderful tenor of the auditorium on "Nie While I'm Around. "But it's a breathtaking musical score by Stephen Sondheim and the captivating performance by Lansbury, especially George Hearn, who makes this night of Gothic music theater an experience long after the curtain call. Not for all tastes, but if you have a game and strong heart, SWEENEY TODD is a joy to all music theater lovers and a must for fans of Stephen Sondheim and Angela Lansbury.
