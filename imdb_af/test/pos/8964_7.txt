Great movie, a very worthy 7/10. <br /> <br /> Tom Hanks was at his usual best, the heavy drinking congressman who saved Afghanistan from his communist oppressors! Based on a true story, we tell how the West throws money and weapons on a problem and expects it to go away. Well, it has gone away, though it is temporary. See who we (the British among others) are now fighting the same people who gave the US weapons, training and money in the 80s. <br /> <br /> This movie will always provoke political thoughts by the people who see it, but it depicts a very beautiful story. Once the main goal has been reached, namely the Communists from Afghanistan, it is seen how quickly the fate of people is forgotten. <br /> <br /> This movie was good, it was a well deserved 7/10. It told the story of the Communist invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent secret US operation to some detail and was well-dramatized. Although it is a good movie, I would recommend it to people, but some will not enjoy it. Especially a serious movie about good (USA) v evil (Russia) is not your thing!
