Let me explain it. It's not a good movie, but I'm so glad it's there, I'm so glad I saw it, and for the role it plays in my DVD collection, it's sublime. This is the ultimate PG-13 hull, it is a college as we think it will be when we are high school men, it requires so much suspension of unbelief that it can happen just like Mars. It's so healthy that even when dirty, your grandmother won't make you uncomfortable. To look at it requires so little sophistication (it's actually too hard to think about what's going on, which will appreciate you for this job), it makes me feel like I'm 12 again. And such an experience is worth over $ 9.99.
