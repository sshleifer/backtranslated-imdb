I was about 14 years old when I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the movie so much, as well as the songs I went to the cinema several times to see it again and again. My mom bought the LP and I learned the songs wholeheartedly just as I did with "The Sound of Music" (which people almost know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics whose comments are published is that they don't have a romantic soul and the movie hasn't seen the eyes of a young teenager. Maybe he's an Ingrid Bergman fan, but I was happy with Liv Ullman. Could Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so good about her? Perhaps the critic didn't appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses, seeing a close match with Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and the story behind the film, the philosophy, which was the most important and interesting factor, and a musical color made it more entertaining and enjoyable without damaging the intellectually attractive aspects. It is a pity that many other films with so-called big actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are quite boring.
