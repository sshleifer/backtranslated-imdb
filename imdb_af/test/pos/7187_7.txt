This movie is rather better than the first "Astérix et Obelix contre Cesar", but it is far from perfect. The adaptation of the cartoon is good, some of the pictures and the dialogs of the movie are the same as in the book. But there are few things that the film did not make as interpretive as the animated film released in 1968. For example, the battle between Numerobis and Amonbofis. It wasn't necessary or even believable, even for the little love story of Astérix. There were also a few things missing, like the songs in the animated movie, and some other stuff. I'm being deceived by the movie because they cut in the things I expected to see and they showed things I didn't want or needed to see. I know it would have been very difficult to make the movie exactly the same as the cartoon or animated movie, but that's what I expected. Finally, even if the movie is good, I still prefer the animated movie, which in my opinion is much better.
