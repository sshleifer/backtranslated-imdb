The majesty of Ramin Bahrani's second feature is that, like the work of a poet, he portrays the soul of mankind and thrives on the screen. Besides the scope of most other indie movies out there, CHOP SHOP is sensible, radiating the best of the big film of the ages; We can look back at the works of Bresson and Pasolini and compare Bahrani's work to them, yet CHOP SHOP is fresh and urgent for modern society. We can see the work of a master here? A certain sense of beauty, style and content all hold together in a movie that reminds us of what it means to be alive. Instead of focusing on the side of NYC, we see so often, we live and breathe with our young hero, Alejandro, in the needy Willits Point ?? a fascinating quasi-sub-world of our culture? and yet it is a very, very real place. Alejandro must support himself and his older sister. Look at this movie and feel the sense of raw spiritual understanding that Bahrani leads us to? all with in-depth and concise realism.
