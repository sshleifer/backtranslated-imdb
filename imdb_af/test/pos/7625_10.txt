Once a wise man from India once said: "First, they will laugh at us, then they will hate us. Then they will fear us." Knowing that yes this film's budget was a bit off, but even then with his story our years are still very important, no matter how it looked. But soon, "Masten Thrust" will appear on the big screen again. Then he and the new redesigned T-Rex will shock you. It will scare many centuries! This film is in the pre-production and will be nothing like you have ever seen! <br /> <br /> It will be beyond THX format ..... right in 4-DX format. <br /> <br /> "Be scared, be VERY scared!"
