I recommend the movie shoulders if they go to the Intrepid Museum in the New York City area and get an idea of ​​how closed and upset life was to World War II submarine teams. How much more should it have been for the seamen during World War I. It really must be hell. <br /> <br /> Walter Huston and Robert Montgomery lead the role of hell. Below, Huston as the book captain and Montgomery as his voluntary number two. They are both fairly credible as Naval officers and the rest of the role players such as Robert Young, Eugene Palette, Jimmy Durante, Madge Evans, Sterling Holloway, etc. Their roles are pretty pretty. <br /> <br /> The silent service became more popular during World War II and beyond. It's amazing, but I can call a whole series of submarine photos like Torpedo Run, Operation Pacific, Hellcats of the Navy, Silent Run, Run Deep and many more and you'll see the same plot situations in them all. I think there is actually a limitation on situations. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Durante's performance is interesting. He is pretty funny and his boxing kangaroo scene while on land leave is very funny. But I have to say a character like him in that brief term is probably much needed for morals. If you do not have such a person to break the tire on a submarine, you should immediately be transferred to your ship. <br /> <br /> However, the highlight for me is Sterling Holloway's death scene. Very similar to Sean McClory's in Island in the Sky. It will haunt you long after you have seen this movie.
