This movie has something that most other movies of its genre do: intelligence and good messages. Accept is the story of a child named Bartleby (Justin Long) who is rejected by every college he applies for. His parents are incredibly strict, frustrated and disappointed. So, Bartleby and a few other students experiencing similar problems are starting a false college to pledge their parents and college children. Not everything is going to be planned, and the movie is about them. But behind this ridiculous plot, there are good messages, morals and a new outlook on the American education system. The college they create, South Harmon Institute of Technology, accepts those who have not been accepted elsewhere. The message is that you don't "need money, tradition or fancy books - you just need a desire to improve yourself." they are a completely unorthodox school, but what the film teaches is that it is still OK - and otherwise (whether it's a person or a school) is not necessarily bad, and that everyone doesn't get the chance to improve themselves - despite being "strange". it is a message of non-formality and has also spurred traces of anti-authority. But not only are messages wonderful - it's hilarious! Haha, I laughed very hard. The humor can be subtle, but can also be blatant and good mix. Brothers beware.
