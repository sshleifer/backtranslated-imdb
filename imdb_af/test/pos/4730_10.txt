After reading this documentary, I rented it and watched with my teenage children. It was incredibly well-balanced, showing everyone's perspective and leaving many questions unanswered. It's like it should be. I'm not looking at a documentary to tell what to think. I look at learning and drawing my own conclusions. Then we took a trip to Waco and visited the Davidians branch on the site of the burns. It was a powerful lesson to see yourself. And it drove the basic underlying honesty behind "Waco: the rules of engagement". If you just open your eyes and look, the facts can speak for themselves.
