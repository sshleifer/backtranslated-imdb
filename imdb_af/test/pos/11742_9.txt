The beautifully captivating song of the same name as the movie won the best song Oscar in 1955. <br /> <br /> Love is a very beautiful thing. <br /> <br /> It's the April rose that only grows in early spring. <br /> <br /> Love is nature's way of giving a reason to live. <br /> <br /> The golden crown a man makes a king. <br /> <br /> Once on a high and windy hill <br /> <br /> In the morning mist, two lovers kissed and the world stood still. <br /> <br /> Then your fingers touched my quiet heart and learned how to sing. <br /> <br /> Yes, true love is a very beautiful thing. <br /> <br /> How can we forget such a beautiful song. Henry King, the director, had the privilege of working with Jennifer Jones twice this year for this film and the very good movie "Good Morning, Miss Dove." Jones is nominated for "Splendored Thing", but she can also easily be named Miss Dove. <br /> <br /> William Holden is as good as the war correspondent who reported China on the Communist Revolution in 1949. His love for Jones, an Oriental doctor, was engaging and so memorable to look at. <br /> <br /> While the end is not comfortable, it is still one of the biggest romances ever made on the screen.
