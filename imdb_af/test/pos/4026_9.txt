Valeria, an elegant and beautiful young woman lives in a world surrounded by the walls of her shame and depression. Although she may have a one-night lover or if someone lives with her, it doesn't matter that he is completely alone. Valeria is also a passionate woman who can act to approach that special man, Massimo, and at the same time the fear that allows her to answer his questions with just a "yes", "no" or "I know". The way to emphasize the loneliness of the character is wonderful. An example would be the distance from both, Massimo and Valeria, in the same room, separated by subtle sections and not seeing each other. I can call several rows, but it's better to see the movie. It is impressive to see that not a single detail is out of control. Although all actions are performed in slow motion, no screaming is needed, but special effects, but a good play and a well-written touch. I loved it.
