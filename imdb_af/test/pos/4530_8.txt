This movie is a fun, private eye-tracking story as they are no longer made. That's all there: Tom Conway is the cute detective, The Falcon, Goldie Locke (who is in a name), his wisecracking bumbling sidekick, Louisa Braganza is the girl in distress, and of course there is the dammed girl, professor with the secret formula, the bad guy who wants the formula, and the police inspector who is after The Falcon. There is a murder and the Falcon is involved. The scenery is nightclubs, expensive hotel rooms, a luxury train, the suburbs and beautiful cars. Check out this jeweler if you see it on the afternoon TV!
