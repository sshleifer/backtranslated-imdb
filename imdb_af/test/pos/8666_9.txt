Where is the Andreas (Trond Fausa Aurvaag), exactly? Heaven? Hell? A parallel universe? When the troublesome man comes off the subway platform and a train train, his next conscious moment comes on a bus; drive solo, the latest arrival, in a dead world where all the suicide goes. As he was at the moment of his sudden departure from the bodily biosphere, Andreas was greeted by an official man who processed and transported the difficult man from the barren countryside to a city, if the eyeballs work, is a dead ring for the kind of urban landscapes he once inhabited, if memory serves him right. Andreas retains the look of a sleeping stroller in a trance, a man alienated from people and objects struggling to find his bearings. at home, or rather, his assigned apartment; or at work, where the troublesome man is randomly appointed as an accountant for an independent contractor. Havard (John Joner), his boss, says to him: "You will get used to it," covering more than just creaking numbers, we suspect in this world the same as the old world. <br /> <br /> If life is meaningless, French existential philosopher Jean-Paul Satre says the same can also be said for death. The subculture of office life can be heaven for one man, but it looks like hell to us, under the context of "Brysomme Mannen". Working in the next life is working for the rest of your life. The social intercourse between Andreas's office mates can pass so normally in the physical world, but death is a variable that creates alienation in the viewer, as he / she now recognizes the bravery of white-collar labor carried out by white-collar workers. their inconspicuous small talk and designated work they do in the course of a day like automotons, every day seems irrational in his obvious absurdity. To see how daily life is replicated in a speculative light, Brysomme men seem to have normal human interaction like deadpan comedy, as the quotidian life becomes a show, transforming Karl Marx's meaning of the word "alienation" , because here the men and women in the office, "do" identify with their labor, as actors in a play that conspire to make their fictitious look even. But the awkward man never takes full part in the facade. He is always aware of the cracks. <br /> <br /> From a wooden bench, Andreas sees the aftermath of a jersey that pushes him on a fence while people break at their lunch, indifferent to his escaping intestines. which creates red splatter on the clean pavement. Andreas sees the same flawlessness of his own co-workers after deliberately cutting off his own finger, hoping he will feel the pain on a paper cutter. He does not. It's just another sensation, except to be able to taste and smell what is lost to the difficult man. This inability to comfort in simple enjoyment strengthens the difficult man's need for love, where simple enjoyment compensates for his loneliness in the physical world. At a dinner party, housed by his boss, Andreas Anne Britt (Petonella Barker) meets. They turned it off. He walks home. She invites him out. They become a couple. He moves in. However, when they have sex, it is good for Andreas, or Anne, who apparently enjoys more of interior design. Love is an abstract concept, another sensation that is unattainable in this world, but love matters to the difficult man, and he tries again with Ingeborg (Birgette Lagen), a girl from work. "The Brysomme men" deconstruct love by presenting its foundation as a series of gestures that require performances of both man and woman. When Ingeborg does not elicit the same feelings for Andreas after his hyper-romantic gesture to leave Anne Britt for her, this Norwegian film offers its secrets about the prose, but strange city, with a transparency that is soluble and offers multiple interpretations. <br /> <br /> Wounded by Ingeborg's apathy to his love for her, the difficult man wandering in the same subway station, standing on the same platform, learning from the same couple who are aggressive and jumping. This time he can't die. How can you die if you are already dead? Repeatedly by train to the train, Andreas's face becomes beef; His body began in angles previously seen but only seen in art. When the troublesome man realizes that love and death are out of his grasp, he seeks the man of the club, who was willing to say what goes unnoticed in this city of the undead. It is death, not life, has no meaning. <br /> <br /> Getting the background of Andreas's stay drives the story, and for the film's credit, this riddle is satisfactorily addressed in a scene reminiscent of Spike Jonze's "Being John Malkovich" when Andreas crawls through a tunnel to cross to another world, such as a newborn baby, which looks like the portal to Malkovich's brain that Craig Schwartz asks people to crawl through. Andreas's attempt to cross the great gorge offers a disturbing paradox. Since heaven and earth are literally separated by a wall, this vulnerable border serves as a perfect enclosure of the atheistic belief that "heaven is a place on earth". But at the same time, heaven is proved by the reality of hell; the place Andreas was sent after he was banned from the city of his destination.
