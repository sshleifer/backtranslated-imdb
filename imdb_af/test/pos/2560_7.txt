Better than I expected from a movie that itself sells in front of nimfomania and inter-racial slavery. The music is great, and cinematography focuses largely on the spin of Ricci in a trailer, Betty Paige, and it works. Samuel L. gets to shout a lot, which he is good at, as well as playing a lot of blues guitar, which he looks cool. Even Justin Timberlake was decent as the mentally disturbed boyfriend. I get the feeling that this material would be complete by anyone else, but instead it could only barley carve out its own strange, small transgressive pulp niche, while still being an effective drama.
