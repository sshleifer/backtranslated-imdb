This horrific horror movie looks nothing but bad reviews. My question is: why? I think this movie is pretty good. Dee Snider did very well for his first (and only) time management. He also plays the antagonist, Captain Howdy (Carelton Hendriks). This movie looks like the future. Although it returned in 1998, it seems to be about modern issues. Internet predators seem like the underlying plot is here. Although taken to a different level, it is a problem we are experiencing today. I will admit that the story has fallen a few times, but it does not make it a bad movie. Robert Englund is even in this movie, which makes it automatically better. The action wasn't bad, the characters were pretty good too. Hendriks was a pretty good antagonist I think. I give this discount horror a 7/10. Recommend for Saw fans.
