Despite the previous reviewer's screed, it is a healthy and interesting documentary film with lots of clips from classic 1950's sci-fi films that influenced Spielberg, Lucas and others in their recent efforts. I agree that Spielberg's films are not even in the same league as the films discussed here, like William Cameron Menzies' brilliant INVADERS OF MARS, to name just one of the many titles, but it is still a remarkable one good overview of the 1950s. paranoid sci-fi. Yes, in the last fifteen minutes it becomes a commercial for the low recovery of WORLD WAR you can turn it off. The rest is surprisingly good, and it's nice to see contemporary filmmakers remembering the movies they inspired, even if they can't complement the original.
