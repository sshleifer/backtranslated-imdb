I love this movie !! Maybe it's my generation, but I can really connect with what he speaks and means to do. It kept me for the duration. duration of the film, the next day and after. I think this movie is not one to see if you care about the plot and character development. This movie is almost just for the generation who will understand it. There are many things you just know to be educated in that generation you wouldn't want to say if you were 40. I think Sacha Barren Cohen was a lot and I mean very well. he is a genius. and the reason h is such an idiot is because he can make people believe he is a complete idiot and make it funny at the same time !! <br /> <br /> Very good movie. highly recommended !! (not as strong as you are over 30)
