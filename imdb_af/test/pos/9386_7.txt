As Roger Corman said in an interview, low-budget film film production has the opportunity to use chances for unpaid ideas. Well, you'll be hard pressed to find a movie that is as amazing as George Barry's "Death Bed: The Bed That Eats". <br /> <br /> The movie has a story about it, and it's an interesting one. I will withhold any kind of details so you can hear it for yourself if you have a chance to watch it. Suffice it to say the title item of furniture has an insatiable hunger, which keeps the unconscious busy with a bubbling yellow foam that dissolves its victims like acid. <br /> <br /> "Deadbed" is a horrible, ghostly movie that plays its absurd point of view in such a way that it exceeds the usual variety of shocking. It covers his particular dream world so it was possible for me to take it seriously. It's a strange and unconventional horror. It dabbles in exploitative ingredients - there are some nice puppies of female nudity - and yet it is art, even if it is a totally skewed sensation. <br /> <br /> The special effects aren't too bad for a movie with a microscopic budget. , and Barry gives the movie a good and atmospheric "midnight movie" quality. The drama of the film is as uninspired as you can imagine, although Patrick Spence-Thomas lends a reasonable amount of gravitas to the artist / narrator, and a particular point is to put one well-known face on hand see: future 'Boy Meets World' father William Russ! <br /> <br /> This movie may not even have found the little cult, as it does not have pirated copies that make the rounds; It should definitely be one of those cases where such a practice eventually helped the movie - even if the exposure took years. <br /> <br /> If you have a taste for truly bizarre obscure items, "Deathbed" may just be what you have in mind. <br /> <br /> 7/10
