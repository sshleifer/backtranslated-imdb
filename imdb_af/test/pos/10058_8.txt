If I see a movie, I usually look for entertainment. But of course if I know which genre is the move, then I'll look for what it's meant to do. For example, if it's a deep movie, I expect the movie to pick up thoughts in my skull and consider what it says. But who is that girl? is not a deep movie. But it's entertaining. It's a camping type movie that is a pleasure to watch. There is hardly a boring moment in the movie and there are lots of humorous parts. I watched it when I was younger. The role-play is always entertained as usual. I loved Griffin Dunne a little, though he was not the typical male caregiver at the time. Haviland Morris also stars. And let Austrian actress Bibi Besch is here too! Overall, a joy!
