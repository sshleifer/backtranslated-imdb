Stephanie Meyer will be so remarkable! Now, her book, Breaking Dawn, won't be the first with that title. Sorry, Twilight fans. <br /> <br /> Kelly Overton (The Ring Two) is a medical student, Eva, dedicated to interviewing psychotic Don (James Haven - Angelina Jolie's brother). I suspected the quarrel, and when she found out, they both grew up in the same town, I was sure of that. <br /> <br /> She got deeper and deeper with her patient to the point I felt there was a shared deception. Sometimes she even acted like PTSD. I really thought she'd lost it. <br /> <br /> Well, she didn't lose it and when the end came, I was on the floor. My whole suspicion was wrong. The turn was even more amazing than I believed. <br /> <br /> Overton was fantastic and the story is so much better than Stephanie Meyer would come. A must see.
