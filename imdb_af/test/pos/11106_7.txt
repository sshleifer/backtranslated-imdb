Last night on BBC1, I was on my way to bed, but curiosity was added to a contemporary Irish movie, so I stay a few minutes to look and then stay to the end. I have to admit that the main attraction is the only English actress, Kelly Reilly, who is wonderful to look at. <br /> <br /> It is charged as a black comedy, which is one of the most difficult to draw. . It should be the perfect mix of horror and horrible laughter so you don't know why you're laughing. Martin Scorsese's After Hours (1985) is the best example. Dead bodies are more black than comedy, but the plot rattles along and spirals down to further blackness. I didn't get the final twists in the story, as other posters did. I was quite surprised. <br /> <br /> As a photograph of the Irish film industry in 2003, it all looks worthy; They didn't seem to spend too much on making it, so it had the chance to get back its money. The writing could have been much sharper, but the acting was generally pretty good. I'm glad I watched it, mistakes and everything, I don't think I've learned much from Ireland today, especially their policing methods!
