SPOILER WARNING <br /> <br /> I received this dino documentary on Christmas 2004 on DVD. I longed to see it and was not disappointed at all. The score is memorable (my <br /> <br /> favorites were the "Sauropod" theme song and the "Winters Coming" song). The effects were brilliant, you could almost believe they were there. You actually learn something too; Stegosaurs can pump their plates with blood. Female T-Rexes Perhaps a deadly spree went before they laid their eggs. I know there are many people who thought it was too much based on speculation, but there will always be questions that we can only guess. And there are also many hard core, unmistakable FAXes. We know some dinosaurs have traveled in herds, we know that Diplodocus swallows stones to cut vegetation in their stomach tubes. Despite this "speculation", the series did very well. So good, it gave a sequel, a prequel and some special offers. If you're a dino fan then it's for you. This makes Jurassic Park look small and weedy.
