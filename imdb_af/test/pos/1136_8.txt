When I first heard of Greek, I thought I'd see it because it sounded ridiculous. Another ABC family's bad-they-almost good shows. But with a college friend we both enjoyed the pilot episode much more than we expected. <br /> <br /> As a member of a Greek society, I can say that many of the stereotypes raised here are those who start talking about girls and brothers on a campus every time someone starts talking. And it's also fun to play with just on its own, let alone watch on a TV screen. The opening scene ran into a just slightly dramatic version of the preparations for a real formal rush in some tournaments, and it continued. <br /> <br /> It's not a show for sensitive Greeks. If you are even joking about things that are not so good about Greek life, then you will scream and scream the whole first episode, and many others. But everyone should have a lot of fun watching it. It's nothing new, but when it comes to college, nothing is ever there.
