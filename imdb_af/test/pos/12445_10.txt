Slipknot is a heavy metal band from the big city of Des Moines, Iowa, where the rockers wear their own leading mask (I know someone has said it, but I have to fill space for this review). The group members are Joey, Mick, 133, Sid, Clown, James, Corey, Chris and Paul. This band is in my opinion one of the best new heavy metal bands and should be heard by anyone who loves hardcore rock. Another good movie is called "DISASTERPIECES" which shows the band's performance at the London Arena. The "My Pest" video was shot there and was included on the DVD. The most kick-ass song they have made is also there (Sic). So if you like the group, you should see it and if you like heavy metal music, you should hear this band.
