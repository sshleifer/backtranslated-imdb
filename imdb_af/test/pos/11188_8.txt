One of the classic low budget 70's movies, this movie was found in a bargain video store in London for only 50p. (Interestingly, the package calls the star of the movie "Charles Bone", which looks like a pornstar, but once the credit rolled it is clear that the picture is aligned to the right of the TV screen, so all the movies are members missing the last letter of their names) <br /> <br /> From the moment the narrator ugly introduces us to the situation of the desperate tenants of a turbulent New York City apartment block, you know you're a rollercoaster ride of vanage. The direction of the Ed Wood one-take school - if one or two extras look at the camera crew, then what the hell? <br /> <br /> The movies end with a plot twist that the Theual Suspect is ashamed of.
