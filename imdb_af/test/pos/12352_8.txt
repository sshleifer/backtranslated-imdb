Pam Grier takes the name and kick as the heroine in director William Girdler, an Asylum of Satan director ,'s entertaining beating action, "Sheba Baby," with D'Urville Martin and Austin Stoker. "Sheba Baby" is one of several difficult chick flakes that Grier appeared in the 1970s, including "Coffy", "Foxy Brown" and "Friday Foster." The short-lived Girdler, along with the producer David Shelton, wrote this thorough routine private eye-catcher in one night and contains a female shamus who refuses to rely on a man to help her look after things. Unfortunately, "Sheba Baby" is not as good as the blaze-operated movies made by Grier under director Jack Hill. Hill covered the African American North Carolina in 'Coffy', 'Foxy Brown', 'The Big Bird Cage' and 'The Big Doll House'. Anyone who analyzes images of African American women in cinema should be familiar with these epics. The main problem with "Sheba Baby" is that our heroine gets too many easy breaks. Of course, the secondary villains are faster happy clowns who couldn't hit the side of a hutsitzer. As the main antagonist, Dick Merrifield qualifies as a selfish as well as anointed villain with choice lines like: "Anything worthwhile is worth stealing." In addition, the composer Monk Huggins offers a strong, atmospheric orchestral soundtrack, and the best song, with Barbara Mason conquering it, is "Good Man Is Gone." "Sheba Baby" throws Grier as a stylist Chicago gumshoe Sheba Shayne. She leaves the Windy City to return to her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, to help her father. When she arrives in Louisville, Sheba teaches that her father, Andy (Rudy Challenger of "Detroit 9000"), is having trouble with a local black gang member called Pilot (cigar chomping D'Urville Martin of Hammer) claiming that Andy sells his loan company to Pilot or dies. <br /> <br /> Initially Pilot sends a beating group to Andy's office, but our heroine's dad gets them in the act. They turn Saba's father into a box. Interestingly, during the fighting, Girdler seldom shows fists tearing flesh. Earlier, Andy's right hand, Brick Williams (Horror High's Austin Stoker), sent a telegram to Sheba requesting her to return to Louisville, but she didn't receive it immediately, thanks to her lazy friend who didn't know do not have. where to get her. Brick and Skeba hook, relive their romantic flames and share a night in the bag. Brick spends most of his time encouraging Saba to stay calm in the face of adversity. As former Louisville, Kentucky police officer, Saba prefers to shoot first and asks questions second. After coming home, Sheba borrowed her father's car and barely escaped. As she walks out the door to get into her father's car, Andy receives another troublesome call from Pilot. Previously, Andy refused to sell the prospect of selling his loan company to Pilot, but Andy changed his mind and agreed to talk to the hoodlum. A satisfactory pilot warns Andy about the dynamite associated with his ignition with a delayed action cycle. In other words, dropping the car will not cause the explosion; The explosion comes ten seconds later. Andy and Brick save Sheba in front of the car. Syba earlier agreed to have her father's problems dealt with without her interference. "Dad, I know you think I'm doing a man's job, but I'm not going to sit down, just because I'm a woman," Sheba says. After her near-death experience, Sheba has vows to learn who has sabotaged her father's car. She rasterized an old contact of her days as a policeman and threatened the man with her gun to withdraw the information. Only after Saba ground the face of the face in a bucket of chlorine dust, he tells her of a discount at the town's railway museum. Brick accompanies Sheba and shoots with a cursed pilot who escapes through the skin of his chin. <br /> <br /> Later, Pilot sends a quintet of contract farmers out of town. Andy's office. These gossips ignore their non-kill orders. Not only do they shoot the loan company's office for ribbons, but they also blow Saba's father with a shotgun. Sheba recovers in short order. Wearing her nickel-plated turret, she threw off three of the four attackers' dirty Harry style. The last hit man throws out his weapon and pleads for mercy. Saba put her finger on the trigger as murderer Phil Jackson (Abby's Charles Kissinger) and a uniform policeman arrived at the scene. At the hospital Andy Shayne dies with his daughter's hand. Of course, Pilot is furious with this revelation and its anger limits on apoplexy. Then, Sheba tore a loan shark, Walker (Christopher Joy of Cleopatra Jones), and blows information from him about the Pilot while holding him in the crop in a car wash. It is one of the better-performing scenes with many ominous shots of the car being swinging and humming equipment. Walker warns Pilot about Saba. Pilot and his henchmen confront Saba in a parking lot and exchange lead. Sheba flees on foot to a nearby carnival. While police are holding one of Pilot's men, she treats the other. The pilot shot one of his own and Sheba ran him off. She injects Pilot into a toboggan run and threatens to hold him there until the roller coaster cuts his head. The pilot manages to escape after expressing his soul to Saba about the identity and phone number of the big man, Shark (Dick Merrifield of The Hellcats). His reputation is so impeccable that Detective Jackson describes him as "the man with all the right answers." "Sheba Baby" is not the best Pam Grier. But the idea that our heroine can handle everything with herself without the help of guys makes it interesting and entertaining.
