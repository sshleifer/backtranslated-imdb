When I joined my local PBS station last night to watch "The War That Made America". I got a dull documentary expectation, but I had a very good and credible reenactment of the main events of the time. Now I see the reasons for the American Revolution, and the role played by Indian wars. Larry Nehring IS George Washington, and he's perfect for that part. The narrative to the camera also works great. I'm looking forward to next week to see the rest. It is good to see that PBS really uses the HD format to bring the 1700 right into our living room. <br /> <br /> I hope Larry Nehring will be seen more in the future as he is so talented.
