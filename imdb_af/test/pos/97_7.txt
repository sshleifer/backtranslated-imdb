Well, I don't agree with Leonard Maltin on this animated short. He loves it and claims it is hilarious. I enjoyed it, but I didn't see any humor. He doesn't even like hockey or know anything about it, and still loved the story. Over the border of Canada I have been living hockey for 50 years there and in Buffalo .... but I didn't think much about this cartoon. Oh, it was interesting and I know what will happen if you wear a Toronto jersey in the Quebec area - disaster! This is especially true in the glory years of Les Canadians. However, this does not make the story funny. <br /> <br /> In the 1950s, everyone in the Quebec provinces abolished the Montreal Canadian and their star player, Maurice Richard, and everyone wanted to be like him. When his mother orders a new jersey, it has the Toronto Maple Leafs logo on it, so the child doesn't want to be killed. When he eventually does the main road to the local track, he is exhausted from the rest. of his hockey friends. What's so funny about it? I could see the same thing happening to a child in Boston, who died Roo Sox and his mother got him the Yankees shirt! Horrors! You can't carry it, and vice versa. <br /> <br /> Perhaps someone who doesn't follow sport, like Maltin, looks strange and humorous to him ... but it's a fact of life or a little time sports and she favorite team. It was an interesting story and completely credible, but nothing that made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The art was nice to look through, almost like a long line of chalk paintings done by a talented schoolchild. . The French Canadian accent was also good. This movie was part of the DVD "Leonard Maltin's Animation Favorites of the National Film Council of Canada.
