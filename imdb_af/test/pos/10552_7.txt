This is another case of Hollywood arrogance that supposedly darkened the French style. The original Mon Pere ce heros was one of the most beautiful films of 1991. Of course, the Hollywood accountants thought they could rent Depardieu and engage the rest. However, they took the precaution to hire Francis Veber to write an English language. version though it is one that uses virtually every word of the original. Depardieu brings his Gallic charm and Katherine Heigl shows all the promise now paid off. The thing is that when the French make a kind of Lolita-lite, they get away with it because the 'dirty French postcard' thinking works in their favor; here is the Hollywood idea of ​​lightweight subtlety to have Depardieu (totally unaware that his daughter has let it know he is actually her lover), handed over to play and to sing something 'French' and start in a live version of Heaven for Little Girls. See the original.
