any movie that has a dialogue that goes like this .... "Judy is ready for her date, Butthole!" must be good! I found it on DVD unclassified, uncomfortable and was pleasantly surprised. A lot of hard work has been done to make this movie. I actually enjoyed it, many of the 80's I saw. Good addition to my movie collection. <br /> <br /> The build-up was great, scaring the rest of the movie. Love the GORE and the T&A. I never thought the eyeballs would be thrown out, it would look like a bat, the color of the eye patch was rough! I think "Rog" looks like Tiger Woods, but more black, anyone agrees?
