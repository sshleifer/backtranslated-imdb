It's not that a television series grabs me right from the bat; A recent chance that the pilot had been dropped off for Surface put me on the seat for the whole episode, after which I immediately came across a sought-after search to get to know everything about this amazing series. I noticed that it was canceled after just 15 episodes, despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews. Such a shame. <br /> <br /> Since then I have acquired the remaining episodes and found that the first 5 or 6 is one of the best television I've ever watched. Just fantastic from start to finish, and as another reviewer commented, I LOVED how they ended every episode with a huge finish. I suggest watching it every week, I would have been thrilled and just caught up, desperately waiting for the next episode to be released. I always heard how early serial movies it used, and ended up with a big rock hanger to get the crowd back into the theater for the next episode. Well, it seems for some reason Or else the packs decided to kill it, and the people behind the show should have seen the writing on the wall, because after episode 6 things are definitely going to be the worst. I won't say the episodes actually get BORN, but many of the plot elements become a little more clich√©d, and I have to say, the final episode really made me cheat. I just wish the show's creators were given a fair chance. The * ONLY * other show that made me feel that way was the first season of Stargate SG-1, which has just been immensely perceived, very "true", soulful and heartfelt. Surface was a wonderful series, and one day a beloved TV lover may already see the outpouring of emotion over the show's cancellation and bring back this show. One can at least hope. :)
