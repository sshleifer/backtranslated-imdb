I waited to watch this movie for a long time and finally came yesterday. In short, I'm glad I finally did. The humor is from the wall hilarious. The plot is so incredibly credible that it should have at least a truth to it. If something got up in this movie, it's definitely the coffee shop. I'm where every man has. You get dump. You find out that your ex has walked around with a guy, with whom you're sure is an asshole. Now, every time you see something for the next few days, you only get horrible thoughts that put it in the wrong areas. She is scorching everyone and everyone knows it. I guess I can lick that man and fold his wallet all day and look back at myself and laugh at me.
