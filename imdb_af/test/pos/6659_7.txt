This movie worked for me because I see this movie as the exact opposite of 'Gone With The Wind.' Place owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and fights for what she wants; Ada gets depressed and turns to Ruby, (Renee Zellweger), to save the day. Kind, in a round way. Deserters instead of officials trying to get back to their families, the lists go on and on. Even the love story was over. If that is what the producer and writers are trying to get it done, it did to me. <br /> <br /> There are only two things I don't like about the movie, the rest I thought was well done, and I kept it enough to recommend it to friends. First, I couldn't see the attraction between Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) as strong enough for Inman to return. Inman said he only wrote to her a few times where Ada wrote to him almost constantly. Second, something or someone who killed or died in almost every scene was a bit. I must say it was full of action as a result, but after the second scene I knew something was going to die in the next scene. I'm surprised at the next scene, don't know what will happen before it happens. <br /> <br /> I thought all the plays were done very well, with Zellweger the best. She earned the credit she got for it. I thought she was playing the movie well. She must have done her homework. Zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was. I think it was true. The law did well with his share with everything he had to go back to Kidman. It had to be a much stronger love to go through than I thought it was. Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. Kidman's part might have something to do with the fact that after the other two I chose her performance. Unless she was depressed, she did not show much emotion, I do not know if that part was written or if it was part of her. She did a good job anyway, I just thought the other two were better. <br /> <br /> I like the scene with Zellweer, Kidman and the rooster, even though it was one of the scenes I mentioned above. I thought the Home Guard was exactly like they were at the time. Although we didn't hear much from them, they were part of that time. I thought the landscape was beautiful. The movie needs everything to be a good historical romance.
