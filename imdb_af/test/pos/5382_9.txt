Man! I remember this show with nostalgic ... I really dug Bravestarr because he was not the conventional hero. He was more than a futuristic Texas cowboy. The man has the strength of a bear, the vision of a walk and the agility of a ... I can't remember that one. <br /> <br /> The action ranges were great! I remember Bravestarr would always use his bazooka called SARAJUANA (translated into Spanish) when he was in big trouble. <br /> <br /> It was a quality action cartoon. I loved the characters, the dialogues, the music and of course the opening credit line! Bravestarr! Long live for him. A cult classic in my opinion and a must see.
