Seth McFarlane is a true genius. He made a spectacular, culturally sharp and straightforward hilarious version. <br /> <br /> For those who think it is "offensive", social or cultural topics do not take meaningful comments, just cause "offense", may point to this quote: <br /> <br /> Peter (coming from the stem lab): How long have I been there? // Wait: Five minutes. // Peter: Why don't we finance it?!? <br /> <br /> Why indeed. <br /> <br /> Thank you family member, because it's not just the funniest show on TV (with the possible exception of the beloved, very missed futurama), but also being pretty clever.
