I have never heard from architect Louis Kahn this documentary version. In this very two-hour documentary document that goes very fast, his son, Nathaniel Kahn, explores his father's life from Estonia to the slums of North Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia where he studied and learned. He travels to Bangladesh, Israel, Connecticut, Trenton, and La Jolla, California as well as New York City to explore his father's creative genius. Personally, Louis Kahn had three families, including his wife, Esther, who refused to give him a divorce and their daughter, Sue Ann. Nathaniel joins his family. Louis also has a half-sister, Alexandra Tynge, of his father's previous relationship with Anne Tyne, a fellow architect. Louis's passion was his art.
