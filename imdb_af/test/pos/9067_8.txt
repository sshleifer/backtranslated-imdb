Peter Lorre was born to play Stephen Danel with lines like: "Mr. Smith, you shouldn't keep my wife that way." and "I told you not to keep the monkey in the house!" The poster for this movie is an exciting green and Peter Lorre is learning to never go to his penal colony / island. This movie is not available on DVD, although it is a classic and very seldom on television. What exactly is the relationship between Stephen Danel and the monkey? Why does the monkey disturb him so much. We will never know. The movie must be colored by someone and excerpts must be made in a Kinks video. The film was released in the 1950s and only a few of the Peter Lorre biographies spend any text on this film. Casablanca was right around the corner. Bogart could have been on the island, but they certainly didn't have the budget for him
