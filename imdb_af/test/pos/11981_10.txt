Don't let the score of 5.9 (as of this writing on 12-8-02) deceive you, this is an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> I can't understand how it got such an assault as if it were so solid. at all levels. The direction, acting, cinematography - all good. The story is interesting and original, and my only insight into understanding why rating is so is that it is probably the kind of movie that people's appreciation would not normally see. <br /> <br /> I looked to be playing an 80-year-old modern rock. You can be young, upbeat and like, but he or she was not and as a product of another time and taste - do not care. <br /> <br /> If you want movies and movies that are more used to real people, versus those of mindless action, huge flashing budgets and mediocre talent, give this one the next time you see it ... <br /> <br />
