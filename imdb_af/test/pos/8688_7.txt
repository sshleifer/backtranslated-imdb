For the most part, I just enjoy the kind of movie that allows one to escape the present time in the future or past. This movie is pure escapism. The dance starts almost immediately, and Debra Paget in her "purple harem" bikini dress seems to me not equal. Her dance, while sultry, is surpassed by her dance in Fritz Lang's Tiger or Eschnapur, available on DVD, where she played the Temple dancer Seetha. <br /> <br /> One problem with the movie is the closed setting. There are few outdoor scenes shot, and they as well as other scenes are a bit claustrophobic. The same places are used over and over, but with some interesting secret passages and waterways. Her secret dual identity is absolutely incredible with beauty of that size. Debra even wears a saber and holds 2 hostile soldiers in a staircase on a staircase, she can do it all. <br /> <br /> What work is Debra Paget as princess. With her beauty she will definitely be the center of attention, anytime in history. This movie, if it will hopefully be available on DVD, will have to buy one. Overall, with a little humor, I love it. <br /> <br />
