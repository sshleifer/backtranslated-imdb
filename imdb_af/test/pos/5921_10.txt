It's a wonderful story. Although there are a few Jimmy Stewart grain parts, it is for the most part a compelling story about an individual with a compelling drive, vision and sense of adventure - to say the least. The bottom line is that it's one of my favorites to watch and I've probably done about a dozen times - that is, until someone stole us from a bag I left on a plane on a flight to California! <br /> <br /> Some have commented on too many flashbacks, but I don't know a better way to keep a long flight interesting. For those of us who actually fly, flight hours can be bored, spoken by moments of terror. I didn't want the flight to be shortened shortly. The suppressive need for sleep and the drunk and surrounding loneliness is part of the story. <br /> <br /> There are many parts that I would particularly like to include in the Long Island take-off and go to Paris in the night. (Wow, things have really changed with us and the French ever since!). The planes build scenes and San Diego's record flight is interesting, as the incident across the Atlantic in ice (which I understand is not quite true, but happened on the San Diego flight). <br /> <br /> One gets the feeling that one of Lindbergh's greatest assets is his enlightened supporters, as well as his perseverance. <br /> <br /> Some of the lines that now and then call in my head include "Pull the claws!" on the take-off scene and "I hope I don't use it so" when the submarine-like "periscope" is described to the lady who lent him a mirror so that he could see his overhead instruments better. <br /> This movie is not for everyone, but it is definitely for me. I hope they make it to DVD so I can replace my stolen version!
