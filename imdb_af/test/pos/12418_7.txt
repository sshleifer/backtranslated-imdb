I had Monster Man in a box of three movies where I wanted the other two mainly, but still had a very enjoyable time with it. It combines horror and comedy to reasonable effect, greatly helped by the proper performances of Eric Jungman as the cheeky head, Justin Urich as a hole friend and Aimee Brooks as the love interest. The movie is fairly predictable and exploits ideas from a variety of other films, but remains fun, with some good, gruesome gores being thrown in. It doesn't measure the classic gory comedies, but it's still good. Director Michael Davis even manages one or two creepy scenes, such as in the bathroom or bar. The movie has been watched throughout as a bit of a bit of writing and writing, and it just lost a little to me at the end when the Monster Man of the title began to look like a member of Slipknot and the movie is trying to get more horror, but is not twisted or convincing enough. The last few moments are also a little weak. Yet, despite a lack of tension and total folly, it is a good example of unpretentious, regular, splashing comedy that must apply to the same fans.
