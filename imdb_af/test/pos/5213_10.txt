The only reason I decided to watch this movie is because of the great acting talents of Karen Sillas, (Alyson Haywood), "Bad Money," 1999, who is very much involved with Gary Cole, Dave, Cry Wolf , '05, who is a great war hero and has all sorts of ways to earn money and apparently never ceases to tell LIES. Alyson and Dave are trying to build and restore an old home to comfortable living conditions. The relationship becomes difficult and Alyson decides to figure out what's going on and the plot becomes very secretive. If you're a big fan of Karen Sillas, it's the movie for you. I just wish Karen would appear in more movies, I miss her great talents.
