One unfortunate reality of post-Soviet Russia was that people's welfare did not change much from Soviet times. As we see in "Window to Paris", most people are as depressed as ever, while being encouraged to go money. <br /> <br /> Everything changes to music teacher Nikolai Chizhov (Sergei Dontsov) to find a window leading to Paris. He and his friends are, of course, quite surprised at what they find. This movie has one of the funniest conversations I have ever heard from Elvis Presley and Edith Piaf. So look at this movie. You will surely love it. It's a precursor to John Malkovich.
