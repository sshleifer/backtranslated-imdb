I've always had this concept that Korean movies on comedy and drama are trading, but "Christmas in the Fall" has changed my position. This movie is so simple. It has no melodramatic scenes or the best comedy scenes. Not a single scene where the actors cry out aloud. Not even a scene where the actor and the actress kiss, not even a simple kiss. And yet this movie can reach its viewers in ways that I know existed. The end of the movie left me speechless. I even cried, but my eyes were red hot. This movie gave me a feeling that I can hardly describe in words. <br /> <br /> I don't think I can recommend this movie to anyone, but I recommend this movie to people who want to see real movies. 9.4 / 10
