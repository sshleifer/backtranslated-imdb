** SPOILERS AED ** <br /> <br /> It's really a shame that a movie seems to be so well-produced <br /> <br /> such a disappointment. I thought it was full (stupid) clichés and <br /> <br /> basically trying hard. <br /> <br /> Out to the (American) guys out there: how many of you are spending <br /> <br /> time to jump on your girl's bed and monkey <br /> <br /> make? To the (married) girls: how many of you suddenly went <br /> <br /> from prudes to nymphos - but not with you <br /> <br /> husband? French: Would you really ask someone <br /> <br /> "à la fac" when you know they don't speak French? Wouldn't you use <br /> <br /> a more common word like "universities"? <br /> <br /> I lived in France for a while and I know how to know and understand <br /> <br /> Europe (and I love it) but my (German) roommate And I found it very insulting overall. It looked like a movie funded by the <br /> European Parliament, and it basically tried too hard. It has all the <br /> <br /> differences that try to link it (not a bad thing in <br /> <br /> itself), but the result is at best uncomfortable, but actually ridiculous - < br /> <br /> Many clashes that wouldn't really happen. Then the end of the <br /> <br /> movie - the last 10 minutes - destroyed the rest. Why doesn't Xavier speak <br /> <br /> to the Erasmus students he meets in Paris? Why does he just go away <br /> <br />? Why does he just walk away from work, is it <br /> <br /> "freedom"? And in the end, should the new Europe rest on <br /> <br />? A lot of people who smoke and stop all day? Is that what it <br /> <br /> is? <br /> <br /> The play was also pretty terrible. I can't believe Judith <br /> <br /> Godrèche's role and acting. Why was she made to look so much like Emanuelle Beart? I initially thought Xavier was OK, but <br /> <br /> playing back. I think he was pretty bad. <br /> <br /> And that's all really bad, because technically (open credits, <br /> <br /> scenes when he asks which papers he needs) it was really good <br /> <br /> (except for the sounding around British brothers and sisters), and the <br /> <br /> soundtrack was also good. So the shape was good, but the content <br /> <br /> pretty awful.
