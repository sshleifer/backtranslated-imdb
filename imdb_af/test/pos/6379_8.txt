I think it was back in 1987 that we had our exams and my friend and I saw in the newspapers that one of the theaters is playing 'teen deviyan'. We decided to just fetch something without hoping for something great. But we were pleasantly surprised. The film was made in 1965, but even according to today's standards, the plot was absolutely modern and far from its times. The music was wonderful and Dev Anand was a city bred and did its best. I still remember the rejoicing when we came out of the theater after the movie was over. <br /> <br /> Who thought of this story of one man falling at the same time for three very different girls? No, he is not three timing or deceiving, but he really likes all three of different reasons. One is homely, one is an actress and the third is a "high society" girl who can also help Dev in his career as a poet. The question is which one is for him. What makes the matter worse is that all three of them also love him. When things come to a dead end, a hypnotist takes him in and in his hypnotized state he dreams of his future with each one and reaches the right decision. <br /> <br /> This dream of being the only color in an otherwise black-and-white movie is at the heart of the movie, but surprisingly it is edited from most versions available today. If you want to watch this movie, make sure this section is intact. If you see this movie without this part and get confused, don't worry because you just watched an incomplete movie.
