Crispin Glovers's way of acting (and not just his) is great. You really want to believe him because his body language and performance fit perfectly with the person. He gives Layne this extraordinary little personality that makes this movie a cult. As well as Feck, which role is very well done by Dennis Hopper. It's about choosing the right or wrong side, without logical thinking about the scene. Friendship is more introduced, and that's exactly what I think is making choices difficult. Rivers Edge lets it experience with serious shades and family masters. I really enjoyed watching. I saw it a month ago for the first time, but if you feel like a nice 80's, this is the one you should see. I'm the same as I didn't know before.
