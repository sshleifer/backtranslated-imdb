I plan to write a review of this movie for quite some time, but I just got the chance to get my thoughts on others. <br /> <br /> I never had the chance to see it on the big screen, which is a pity, as it is often visually amazing, but I have repeatedly repeated it on video over the years and enjoyed it great every time. It's definitely on my personal favorite movie list, and more than just watching Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon, two of my `actors. '<br /> <br /> Maybe I appreciate this movie so much because it appeals to my slightly varied taste in entertainment. I like my movies a little bit from the center - unpredictable and fresh. And whether you believe the story line of the movie or not, you must admit it is different! <br /> <br /> Everybody has different tastes and opinions, but my impression of some of the negative reviews on this movie is that viewers never really saw the surface of this movie. They got trapped in technical skills: "Why would there be green lighting in a subway? or why would medical students pull such a stupid stunt? "Yes, there are medical and technical aspects that do not make sense, but if you are willing to suspend unbelief, it is only a little. can be a very interesting movie. <br /> <br /> First, a note on the artistic quality of the movie. Some have complained about the dark lighting and the illogical nature of the sets - but for me, the use of innovative lighting techniques, the plastic and lacquered sets, the unusual settings in old buildings and splashes, dripping tunnels, the use of statuary, rain and wavy curtains - all add a poetic flavor to this movie, a ghostly beauty that is asked at the darkness of the questions about life, death and forgiveness. <br /> <br /> I will focus on just two examples; In an alley, a change in lighting allows for certain elements of the set to come into focus dramatically, and then disappear as soon as the lighting goes normal. It is an innovative way to convey and work beautifully a shift in the "reality" of the moment. We can also see inside the character's apartments - contrasting the warm wood, bright colors, golden lighting and messy comfort of Labraccio's rooms with Nelson's sharp, white void. Both are reflective of the characters themselves. Nelson's lack of "objects" reflects our lack of knowledge about his past. and its beautifully built mask that keeps its companions at bay. His past, we come to learn, is one of chaos and conflict. He was determined to leave it behind in favor of an unashamed emptiness. Unfortunately, emptiness is also reflected in his relationships with others, a realization that he comes to in his film after his personal journey of self-discovery. <br /> <br /> Flatliners are not your typical horror movie. It's also not a typical drama or suspense movie. Rather, it is a merger of all, with the finest elements of all genres interwoven in a complex, tangible plot. <br /> <br /> This is an ensemble piece, and the throwing lives an excellent work of breathing life in their individual characters. Your immediate impression is that the characters each represent an established stereotype: the female ice queen, the slightly neurotic 'doctor', the playboy and the socially conscious 'good guy'. But as the film progresses and The characters are dropped further, they take on various dimensions and depths. <br /> <br /> The most interesting of all is Sutherland's character from Nelson. Nelson is not an easy-to-hold character - indeed, he is a bardard, a master engineer who certainly puts himself above all. Yet Sutherland plays with a hint of uncertainty that gives him a certain job. As events unfold, you realize that many of Nelson's unpleasant personality is a smokescreen, a protective mask after which a very uncertain and vulnerable young man is hidden by a terrible secret. <br /> <br /> Revealing bits and pieces of Nelson's complex personality throughout the film, the writers, directors, and role-players gradually guide you to greater understanding and sympathy for him. The character that started out as a "jerk" becomes important and appreciated in its own right - as you learn to forgive its past behavior in the light of new information. Your journey of discovery with Nelson reflects the characters' own journey to self-understanding, as they also realize that everyone has value, and "everything we do. '<br /> <br /> That leads to my final comment. Although many of the posters picked up on the theme of the death of death, there was little feeling about what I consider the main point of the movie - the importance of forgiveness and the need to take note of everything you do , because it "matters". <br /> <br />
