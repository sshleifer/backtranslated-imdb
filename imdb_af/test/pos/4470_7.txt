This is another movie where cinematography is the best way to recommend it. It would be good if the movie was a travel report, but as a dramatic exercise in filmmaking, it's not good enough. The theme of respect and co-operation between species is scary in the forbidden world of love between different species, but its approach is stereotypical, indicating that the behavioral motives of any species are not understood. As with many films, one always wonders what could be achieved by a more innovative director and a more creative scriptwriter. Oh, we'll probably never know.
