"Black Water" is a movie that surprised me and definitely exceeded my original expectations. "Black Water" is really a very well-structured, unpredictable, exciting, well-directed and well-creepy film. The plot is actually somewhat original, and will definitely keep you in mind. One thing I love about this movie is the direction, especially since it exceeded my original expectations. My original expectation of "Black Water" was that it was a crappily made, acted, directed, paced and boring movie. It really wasn't. Well, the acting is nothing to praise, because there were times when I felt they didn't show enough emotions, and there were a few lines that felt just like that. However, I love the direction because all his shots are predictable, but it's not. As it looks, the camera says a slow shot of the water, and it goes well, you're like the crocodiles are going to attack. The attacks of the crocus are, however, very unpredictable (it was bad for me that doesn't handle as many movies as it does), and it makes you jump. Plus, I just love being one of those horror movies that doesn't rely on the sudden big blast to make you jump, but rather the real movie. I also love how the story is about people trapped in these trees, it really made it look and definitely kept your eyes on the screen. I have to say I didn't think the opening 20 minutes was well done, and I think they made the boat a little heavier than it would have been in real life. Plus, I didn't like how they did their utmost to make the character situation look like it was completely hopeless when it really wasn't. Again, I don't think some of the characters' actions were realistic. For example, I would not have gone anywhere near the water to know they were a crocodile in it, let alone a killer. However, these problems are not so great, and I still enjoyed the movie. Overall, as far as movies go, I've seen better, but as far as animal attack horror movies (a genre I easily get scared of) is one of the better ones you'll see. And it's not perfect, but that doesn't mean it's not worth it.
