Right, here we go, you probably read in previous reviews on this movie that it was terribly, poorly behaved, at all costs avoided. Well, I think that's true, it's fair to say you couldn't write a spoiler in this comment, because there's no plot to spoil. However, there is a fine line between plain terrible and absolutely hilaries and believe me this film is the latter. The acting is so bad, the plot so non-existent and the end so completely stunned, will make you laugh the whole way. There are scenes in this movie that take comedy to a new level. Don't expect an Oscar winner, but believe me for the small price you'll pay for this disaster, it's worth every penny.
