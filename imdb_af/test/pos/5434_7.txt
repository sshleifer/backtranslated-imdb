Not every line in a comedy is funny. This movie takes a serious topic, the dislike of voters and keeps it up to date while it jokes. It would have made the movie The Daily Show if they wanted to change it into a movie. I found that Robin Williams was much nicer in this movie than he was in the RV. And while my wife and I share some opposing political views, we've both doubled for several parts of this movie. The writing writers here can find Fox News some lessons in fair and balanced. Lewis Black was good for his part, but he never really managed to make his particular comedy for his part. Christopher Walken was also good, playing his fairly general muted supportive role and pushing a story together.
