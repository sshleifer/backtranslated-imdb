when I was a child, it was the movie I watched. I think it's a good movie for the kids to watch and parents don't have to worry about any violence or obscene images. rainbow british is a cheerful young girl and she tries to get away the winter. She finds that something or someone is trying to steal the source of life and keep it to themselves. I love this movie and I think even adults can enjoy this movie.
