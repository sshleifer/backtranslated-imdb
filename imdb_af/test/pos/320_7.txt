Touch Bollywood's epic melodrama about a 10-year-old girl who finds out she's adopted, and is determined to find her birth mother. The film's greatest success is the performance of P.S. Keerthana, who plays the girl. The first half of the movie is very good. There are also some very good songs, especially the number that launches the protagonist. Unfortunately, the second half of the film, which is being hit in Sri Lanka during the war, is a completely different and disappointing movie. It's huge on explosions and special effects, with Sri Lankan soldiers and rebels escaping grenades, running from fireballs, and being driven by stunt wires. All the film can offer as insight is cheap platitudes such as, "Summer day there should come peace" and "Maybe the kids will get a way." The final sequence, where the girl and mother are reunited, is good, but over-the-top with the music and a quick precipitation that feels like a scam. I know, I know, it's all in the style of Bollywood. But it is a story where great moments simply detract from the simple, powerful central story. Bollywood can sometimes use a little restraint.
