There have been many (well, more than a few) attempts over the past 30 years to create film that has a "global" look. If it's supposed to be a film director's wish to divorce him from other movies, or just to shine on the low-budget and loose look, Begotten is on the top echelon of this stack. <br /> <br /> Apart from the eternal "Eraserhead" anyway. <br /> <br /> Merhige's tricky process of artificially humiliating his film changes is completely structured. (Imagine how this movie would look like glorious, standard Technicolor). It can almost be envisaged as an artefact from another, unknown culture. Some images are so far removed from what we expect to see on the screen, they disturb mainly when disrupted. It is not a "last-left" disturbance disorder, more like leaving your cave-for-the-first-time-and-see-the-sun disorder. <br /> <br /> Watch this chorus dream if you get the chance and enjoy. Remember, they make other, more standard movies every day. They can wait.
