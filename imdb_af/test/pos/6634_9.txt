Strange vision of a war situation where the couple of Vargtimmen (ok, they have different names and initial situations, but the actors are the same) are caught in the crossfire of two fronts. The depiction of the fighting parties as faceless, exaggerated authorities is often captured in sublime surreal images and draws interesting parallels with Orwell's 1984, even though Bergman rejected this context on a personal level of a slow emerging marriage war. Therefore, many fundamental and philosophical questions about Eve and Jan's marriage are relevant and essential, while the threat and danger of the outside tears open an abyss into the interior, previously covered with lambencies. An intense allegory on the fragile facades of civil conventions.
