As I said earlier in previous remarks, there are some programs that should be 'light entertainment'. So I get somewhat frustrated when commentators apparently expect a program that will reveal the meaning of life, you won't get it from Cleopatra 2525 and it's not going to offer it. What you get is a frozen girl and revived about 500 years later and her adaptation to this new life is realistic. She does not settle within 10 minutes as is the case with other travel adventures, nor is she the female equivalent of James Bond's right to embark on any arrival. Cleopatra is skipped by her new environment and scared by some of the weapons displayed. most of us would be. But it is light entertainment, the stories have a beginning of a middle and an end in quick time and they are some surprisingly good moments of acting. The episode when there is a double of Cleopatra is moving and Jennifer Sky, what I think, is one of the best ideas of someone who has long died and as a movie and television buffalo, I know what I am talk. Lastly, to prove my sincerity, I bought everything but four of the episodes and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The only reason I didn't have the full set is because I bought the other episodes before I realized there was one full box. Victoria Pratt and Gina Torres complete the trio creditworthy and for light entertainment Cleopatra 2525 definitely entertained me.
