Whoever ever places the review as a bad taste is not all right ... it's so funny, genius and fantastic, you can see it until your eyes are square! Not to mention the rest of the work he did on the rest of the series ... everything is as good as Morris's standards. If you think it's "terrible," "unpleasant," or "sick," then I can only think of one thing to say to you: "Go to hell." thank you. it had to be said! I think the way so many people complain was a complete joke. I would like to cry out to all the people who really did it: "Do you have nothing better to do with your time? Are you trying to prove?" Thank you for reading my hearty review on the matter ... cheers
