Super original. Really wonderful movie! James Franco and Sienna Miller really go well on the screen. I hope it's coming out soon. I first saw this movie at a show. Because of my age and gender I was asked to stay for a "talk". We all had commentary on the movie and many didn't look like it. I really loved it and I don't know why so many people didn't think it was so good. Go and see if it comes out and decide for yourself! One thing you might want to do when you see this movie is to go and know nothing about it. I didn't know when I went to the screening, except that it was called, "Camile." It's really worth seeing.
