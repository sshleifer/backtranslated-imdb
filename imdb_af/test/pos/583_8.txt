I first saw this movie as a teenager when it came out in the theaters, then back. To see it again, almost 30 years later, I was amazed at how well it stopped. The gags are still funny, the interaction between characters works well, and the comos come out better than ever before. (Steve Martin's should be the best.) <br /> <br /> My kids (9, 11 and 14) loved it all and the music is good enough to lighten the songs many days later. <br /> <br /> I suggest that you see at least one half-dozen episodes of the Muppet show before the movie is released, to get the back story behind the characters, otherwise the movie doesn't make much sense .
