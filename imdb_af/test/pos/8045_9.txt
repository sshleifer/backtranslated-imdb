This movie really proves that the world is too often an unfair place, especially the world of movies. "The Assignment" has barely received attention on release and not surprisingly slammed the box, but when history will be written, this movie will surely receive a long lost praise. <br /> <br /> Thanks, I am surrounded by friends who know what is good for me. Being a movie like myself is a highly recommended effort: "The Mission", a movie I didn't even hear. I decided to watch what Leonard Maltin gave it, and not surprisingly, he gave it ** 1/2. Knowing it's the same grade, he gave classics like "Alien", "The Usual Suspects" and "The Matrix" (I didn't birth you). I knew his meaning didn't mean diddly squat jack s ***. So without hesitation I went out and bought it on DVD. It was about 3 years ago and the movie is still one of my prime possessions in my DVD collection, despite a cover design that includes a low budget thinker with Casper Van Dien. <br /> <br /> The mission is expertly directed, delivering really intense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film. In addition, it boasts a sometimes brilliant story that you know will turn around with unexpected twists and turns. It stares Aidan Quinn in one of his best performances, serving him with great support from Donald Sutherland and Ben Kingsley, both in good shape. <br /> <br /> Something like 40 out of 42 user comments like this movie, most of them can't seem enough. What are you waiting for? If you call yourself a fan of action thrillers, you should have bought it, hired it, saw it, JUSTERDAY!
