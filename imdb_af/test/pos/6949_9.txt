This is one of my favorite movies. The performances of Rip Torn and Tantoo Cardinal are excellent and their performances combined with the music, landscape and reality of the movie are very compelling. A look at a truth, tell it as it is, sign, mountain man who refuses to give his life in the name of progress and development. The Horseflies' music is very unique and adds a frightening quality to some of the screens. After watching this movie for the first time, I had to buy the video and the soundtrack. Overall, a quiet type of panic-outbreak movie. Both torn and cardinal are very credible in their roles. I put this movie in the same category as Winter People with Kurt Russell and Kelly McGillis, another favorite.
