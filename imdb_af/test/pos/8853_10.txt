In 1982, "The Thing" came out all over the theater, it had a cold reception and very poor checkout results, and almost became a failure in John Carpenter's career as a horror director; However, time proved that "The Thing" was definitely not a failed project and that the disappointing commercial results were not the movie's fault. Today John Carpenter's "The Thing" gained the appreciation it deservedly deserves and is regarded by many horror fans as a horror classic, and not without a reason, such as this new version of John W. Campbell, Jr. . The story of "Who Goes There?" (previously adapted as "The Thing of Another World") is closer to the original story and holds a pessimistic sense of fear and high doses of tension in a masterfully crafted paranoia study. <br /> <br /> The plot of "The Thing" began in the winter of 1982 in an American research station in the remote areas of Antarctica, when crew members arrive at a Norwegian helicopter. The two seemingly insane helicopter pilots are trying to kill a Husky dog ​​making its way to the American base. After the Norwegians accidentally died, the Americans are trying to find out what they have done foolishly. Soon they will discover that the Husky dog ​​hunting the Norwegian was not a normal dog, but a creature that mimics every living creature, and not just that, it has a tremendous hunger. <br /> <br /> Director John Timmerman gained a place in history when, in 1978, he directed the "Halloween" chieftain, where tension and atmosphere were beyond shock. "The thing" can be seen as an evolution of that style, because even when Carpenter makes great use of Rob Bottin's special effects (marked by critics as "repulsive" on his day), the film focuses even more on atmosphere and tension rather than the violent (and very well done) displays of gore. The feeling of loneliness, as well as the "bad karma" among the crew members, increases the sense of paranoia, as someone can be the thing, even our main character, RJ MacReady (Kurt Russell), who ends in a situation where no one can trust. <br /> <br /> This platter element was more faithful to the concept of the source novel, and was blatantly ignored by the previous version (not quite a bad thing, but a big difference), which this version feels less like a remake and more than a new concept of the source novel. Bill Lancaster's script handles the characters with a brilliant domain, which we give enough to distinguish them, but not too much to trust them completely, and this makes them an essential factor in the film's haunting sense of fear that continues through the movie. The secret and the tension are at their peak, since no one can tell who the thing is and what is normal, which increases the paranoia and unpredictability of the plot with excellent results. <br /> <br /> The cast is very effective, and their performances as a whole so effective that one can almost feel the bad feelings between their characters. Carpenter's regular colleague Kurt Russell as MacReady carries the film, and through his eyes we see the madness and the horror the research station becomes, as the situation gets worse. Definitely one of his best achievements. Wilford Brimley is also wonderful as Dr. Blair, a scientist who is insane after discovering the Ding's purposes. <br /> <br /> "The Thing" is a film made so wonderful that its mistakes tend to go unnoticed, though it does exist. The most notorious is the very low key and sometimes unutilized score by Ennio Morricone. It's not really bad, but it just feels on some screens and it's not one of the best works of the legendary composer. Also, due to some deformities with the special effects, some scenes are omitted that actually fill small plot holes, though nothing of major importance or actually annoying. <br /> <br /> If we talk about John Carpenter's movies, most people will almost immediately call "Halloween" as his favorite movie, but personally I will go with The Thing as I am Carpenter's greatest perceived performance so far, and one of the most interesting and really scary horror movies ever made. I will go so far as to call it one of the best films ever made. 10/10
