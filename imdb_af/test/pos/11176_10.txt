What can I say? Curse of Monkey Island is fantastic. The story is good and solid, but pretty stupid, the jokes are hilarious, the puzzles are mysterious ... you can't ask for an adventure game anymore. The "You Don't Need to See My Identification" bit is in itself worth buying the game, not Murray, which has become the hot topic among many of my friends. (Only some of them played the game). You will love this game. And if you're not that bad!
