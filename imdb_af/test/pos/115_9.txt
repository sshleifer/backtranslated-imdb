It is a very sensitive portrayal of life with untapped or limited desires. What does one do with desire in a culture and society with rigid norms? One man finds out at the immigrant - since immigrants do not belong or are not accepted, they do not need to identify their needs. The other man seeks comfort in spirituality and tries to evaporate his desire into nothing. Of course it fails - and he breaks in the last scene for several reasons. Sita still had enough for him to find that moment to let him know that he was not responsible for her deviant exhaust after her blocked desires. The mother in her still couldn't get the power to destroy his myth. She sees him as a child who glorifies himself in his loop control, but must she give him the opportunity to eventually grow up? Both women find courage and togetherness through their shared rejection by their husband. <br /> <br /> But the final act of rejection was by the grandmother - she couldn't detach her rusty disposition to accept Sita's desire. A decade and more of caring care was not enough to break the bonds of her culture. It seems to be the easiest way for the domestic worker to run his desires - as he is condemned by his culture anyway - at the bottom of the hierarchy. Since there is no respect and expectations anyway, sin can also taste.
