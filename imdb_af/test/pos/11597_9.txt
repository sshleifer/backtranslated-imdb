If you're going to the cinema to be entertained, amused to fill your time, don't go out to see this movie. <br /> <br /> Going to the cinema to appreciate the depths of human nature, the feelings of real people, to explore the characteristics of personalities, if you go to the cinema to absorb wonderful photography, You put this movie very high on your list, preferably in the first place. The experience is very satisfying, which causes the intelligent viewer to make diverse reflections on the meaning of life itself. With 'Mar Adentro' Alejandro Amenábar outperformed what he has done so far. He even resolved certain deviations in his previous films, which hit some of Hollywood's goals. This is not the case when this visual poem is set to music: Hollywood can never come close to the effect of this ruthlessly inspired human and human story. <br /> <br /> Never interpret 'Mar Adentro'. as an excuse for euthanasia; This story, based on the real life of Galician fisherman Ramón Sampedro, is a cry from the bottom of the heart for life and love, an outreach for human compassion, to understand emotions. Sampedro was an articulate and intelligent man who was condemned to a dive accident outside the rocks of the Galician coast as a young man to live in bed for the next 27 years. 'Condenado a vivir' (2001) (TV) was the first version of this man's life on which I have already commented. Amenábar, however, remarkably succeeded in portraying this man, with his permanent enigmatic smile and meaningful sense of humor, in an equally articulate and intelligent way. <br /> <br /> And Javier Bardem came to the event, with the challenge head-off, complete with a Galician accent, delivering an electrifying, compelling, exciting performance, blending the actor and fisherman same person on the screen. Here is indeed an opportunity to do your cap, and cheerfully encourage "chapeau". Bardem is named in his task by a wonderful role, especially Belén Rueda, Lola Dueñas, Mabel Rivera, Celso Bugallo (qv) and Clara Segura, Galician and Catalan accent. <br /> <br /> Amenábar produces wonderful dialogues, as these six are one-on-one or in groups with excellent chemistry, showing that this young Chilean-born Spanish director is an artist who knows what he is is at and how to get its results; His global film concept includes his own music, occasionally by Beethoven and Puccini on Sampedro's record player. <br /> <br /> While watching "Mar Adentro", I found myself comparing myself to filming Stephen Daldry and his masterpiece "The Hours" (qv). I refer to the way the dialogues work with flexibility and passion and the cautious sense of timing in each scene. <br /> <br /> Javier Aguirresarobe's photography is excellent as usual. As I mentioned elsewhere on IMDb, he not only symbolizes the events and scenes - he even captures the feelings and atmosphere of the moment, which briefly looks into the eyes, light and shadows, so that his work behind the camera is on one hit another player in the story. A wonderful artist. <br /> <br /> 'Mar Adentro' is another landmark in the history of Spanish cinematography, among the best five or six artworks produced over the past 25 years. This film is accompanied by cinematographic art such as 'El Sur' (qv), 'Los Santos Inocentes' (qv), 'El Abuelo' (qv), 'La Lengua de las Mariposas' (qv), Las Ratas qv), A Los Que Aman (qv), and I think I should add 'To Doy Mis Ojos' (qv). <br /> <br /> Excellent orchestrated story of a real man, and those who loved him around his bed: shouldn't be missed.
