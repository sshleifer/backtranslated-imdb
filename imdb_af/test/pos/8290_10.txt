THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE <br /> <br /> There are a few movies I could see all my life and never get tired of them, and this nostalgic favorite is one of them. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE was a 1987 attempt to bring the old favorites back to the forefront of animation, this time on the big screen. In an era in which Disney dominated the movie industry in terms of animation quality and cash office, the CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE stands out as one of the best animated films Disney did not produce in the 80s. <br /> <br /> The story is Simple and Elementary, with Alvin, Simon & Theodore competing in a global race with the Chipettes (Janette, Eleanor, & Brittany). However, since the chipmunks experience exotic dangers, they are unaware that they are the pawns in a large diamond cage. <br /> <br /> The CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE has never been and will never be a movie thanks to an impressive plot. And for people who didn't love it as a child, the movie would probably never be more than a pleasant but forgetful animated movie. But for me it will always be a little-known masterpiece. Something about the movie just clicks me in a way that few movies do. <br /> <br /> Each song is fun, optimistic and harmless. Highlights include the Chipettes in a slightly bold Arabic dance to calm snakes. There is also a very sweet song in which the Chipmunks travel around the world and we see them at great landmarks around the world. One thing about the Chipmunk characters is that, despite the potentially annoying chorus, the songwriters have always created songs that were captured without ever moving. This movie is no exception ... it actually boasts one of the best Animated movie soundtracks of the 80's when you ask me. <br /> <br /> Every joke is cute, sincere and amusing. The pieces between the bad guys and a pampered puppy are very amusing. And the shock to see that the Chipettes are almost forced by a child to emperor in marriage is also so. The comedy is constantly playing to the kids so they don't miss anything, but everything for adults with enough nostalgia to entertain them. <br /> <br /> It's really just a fun ride that is quite. humble in his ambitions. THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE aims to be nothing more, because it is harmless fun. I will be the first to admit that it is a biased review because I have such a nostalgic love for THE CHIPMUNK ADVENTURE that I could never give it a bad review ... but it still fills me with that a childish satisfaction while being watched. Everyone has their favorite childhood favorite that no one knows, and for me this is the movie. And any movie I can watch over and over whether I'm 5, 12, 23 or older is a good movie in my eyes. <br /> <br /> ...
