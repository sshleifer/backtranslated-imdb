Dead Man Walking, Absolutely Brilliant, Towards the End in Tears! You can't watch this movie and don't think about the issues it causes; how can you kill (whether it's murder or death penalty) and to what point forgiveness is possible (not just in a spiritual way). Don't see this movie when you're off! But see it !!!
