A glance at the 60's through the eyes of four friends from their student day in 1960 until their reunion 10 years later - a Yugoslav immigrant who fell in love with the American dream and struggles to cope with the often violent reality; a premature naked entrepreneur's son; a soldier; and the crazy, hippie girl they all love. Good direction and a strong throw right to Steve Tesich's brilliant screenplay; The dialogue is not as funny as in 'Breaking Away', but the themes of growing up and father-son conflict are equally well handled, and there are still some wonderful comic moments among the shocks and drama.
