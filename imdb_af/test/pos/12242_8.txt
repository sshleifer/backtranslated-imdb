Spoiler Alert <br /> <br /> I've never seen any comment on a movie, which I disagree with more than the comments people made about it. One can learn from critical views of this movie. As an educational film, I rate it a lot because it teaches how to succeed! We don't look at movies to learn; we usually look at entertainment. As entertainment, I rate it low: the end is indifferent and cerebral / intellectual. This conflict leads to my eight star rating. The film follows Jane Craig (Holly Hunter), a television news producer. The network executive suggests Tom Grunnick (William Hurt) to study for the air news anchor position. Tom charmed people immediately with humility. Another potential news anchor has been waiting for her on the air, Aaron Altman (Albert Brooks) for years. Altman knows all the news stories, inside and out. <br /> <br /> The network executive wants Grunnick on the air and Jane argues, Grunnick isn't right, he doesn't know the news. They don't listen to her. Forced to put Grunnick on the air, contact Jane Altman to get information about the news story and Altman's commentary through a plug-in to Grunnick while Grunnick talks. We look at the sharp contrast between Altman's / Jane Craig's words and Grunnick's, as Grunnick proficiently recovers everything Altman and Jane Craig say in his ear, to make it understandable, enjoyable and entertaining. Altman gets a chance on the air and network execs require him coaching Grunnick, the new man. This new (news-telling) guy coaches him? This is something Altman does not see justified, but agrees unwillingly. <br /> <br /> Grunnick coaches Altman and excited to see hundreds of Altman's shortcomings in appearance, sound and vocabulary. Altman had never considered these things when he became an expert on the news himself. The complexity of understanding what Grunnick taught him caused Altman to have a panic sweat ("Flop Sweat") when he was on the air. Grunnick eventually resigned as the best network anchor and Altman before being fired. But Grunnick failed in his attempt to have a romance with Jane Craig because she found out Altman that Grunnick sometimes fell into circumstances to make people feel like him. It turned her away from him. It sends the message that we want people who are real and not trying to make us like them. <br /> <br /> This movie sends the message that people who love you are the most important skill in a job, but this is especially true in Broadcast News. There are many people commenting on what the TV news is and how Grunnick is a beautiful but stupid man or all style, but not dust. The opposite is true, Grunnick has skills and many complex intellects to show people like him, including the presence of mind to know exactly how he appears and sounds when on camera. (He leads Altman to stamp a word in every sentence). Grunnick's mistake that cost him the relationship with Jane Craig is that he is driven to be likeable and to fake a situation. Many people call Altman very intelligent or brilliant. Brookes played Altman is not as intelligent as Grunnick and the flop sweat scene shows that his mind does not handle the complexity Grunnick handles when he is on the air. Altman is angry at the fact that he knew the news and Grunnick was more successful by making people look like him. There are also people who comment that these things are exclusive to the TV news industry. The concept that winning winners is the most important skill in a job, of course, is not popular, but my experience indicates that it is true in most jobs. As an education on how to succeed, this movie is fantastic, though unpopular. Educational, yes, but it doesn't have a lifting end.
