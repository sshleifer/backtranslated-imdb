I know one should not comment on the comments of other users, but I would say that many of the negative reviews appear to be people who already knew a lot about the Manhattan project and were annoyed by things left out. is. (From his book 'Smoking In Bed' it seems that the original screenwriter Bruce Robinson is also like that.) I knew very little before I watched the movie and sounded it. Dwight Schultz is absolutely mesmeric as Oppenheimer - a true magnetic, charismatic presence, an inspired piece that makes me wonder why he doesn't get better roles and more leading roles. John Cusack and Paul Newman are excellent as always. One can choose with several writing or direction choices, but as it is, the movie is extremely intense and horrible, and overall I give it four stars out of five.
