The reader is a very well done and very sweet short. Each element of the piece helps to elicit a pure emotional response to the script. Well acted, directed, shot and written. I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting, not even a reading. The performances stand as a testament to some fine instinctive acting in response to a well-written writing. The actress's work was excellent and there was never any indication that their work would fall into the pure sentimental slip. Less is much better in this case. This film is an excellent example of how these low budget contract actors as well as filmmakers benefit.
