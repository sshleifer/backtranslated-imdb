I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1984 when I was 6 years old (you do the math). I absolutely loved it. I was Tarzan for the 2 weeks after I saw it (climb the furniture, jump around to make monkey sounds). It started a fascination with Tarzan and monkeys, but strangely enough, a longer lasting love for Christopher Lambert (remember I saw Highlander shortly thereafter). 1984 was the last time I saw that movie until about a month ago. It was on the cable while I was at bed at 3:30 and it was late and I was tired and I had to be at 9:00 am at work. I got up to see this movie I loved as a child. <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I realized it wasn't so nice of a movie and equally cute, that Andie MacDowell's voice was mentioned by someone else. Of course, Ian Holme was solid as usual, and surprisingly, the monkey is still similar, but the biggest surprise was how good Lambert was as Tarzan. He was wonderful! The depth he had trapped in so few lines, his primary body language and most important of his ability to bring this character through his vast ark, was just amazing. <br /> <br /> As I said earlier, I'm Lambert, but I'm used to Highlander, The Hunted and Fortress. In this film he was really pretty good and it is a pity that he never had the character to portray a character with such depth. <br /> <br /> To make a short story too long, I was a little disappointed that the movie wasn't that good, but I was glad to see Lambert was good and I'm not sorry 6:00 to see it.
