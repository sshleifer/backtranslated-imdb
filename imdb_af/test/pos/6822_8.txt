There were many people trying to make a movie identical to the story, Heart of Darkness. Some movies are based on Heart of Darkness, such as Apocalypse Now. In 1993, Nicholas Roeg directed a film that was exactly like the book. Heart of Darkness the movie is almost exactly identical to the book. This movie is full of action and adventure. Heart of Darkness is about the journey of a sailor named Marlow sailing along the Congo River to the super-powerful ivory trader, Mr. Kurz, to meet. <br /> <br /> The heart of darkness, the film, has the same exact beginning and set up as the book. It takes place on a boat in the Thames River, and Marlow tells the story to four other men on a boat called the Nellie. The whole movie is a leap from Marlow's journey around See Kurtz on the Congo River. Marlow works for the Belgian company, which operates ivory along the Congo River. He tells of his account in the company's office and all the cards he saw in the office. <br /> <br /> Marlow sits on a steamer to Africa. He arrives at the central station, where he receives commands from the general manager. The general manager told Marlow about Mr. Kurtz and the Ivory Trade Marlow will do. Marlow soon finds out that the general manager does not like Kurtz because he is afraid Kurtz will replace him. Marlow has been waiting for months at the central station because his ship has been destroyed and it is being repaired. Marlow sees the harsh treatment and slavery in Africa while at the central station. When the ship was finally repaired, Marlow, another African character named Mfumu, and other crew members, was on Marlow's steamer for Mr. Kurtz sat. <br /> <br /> Along the Congo River, they are attacked by African natives in the desert. As Marlow's crew is attacked by African natives, they kill and shoot Mfumu. When Marlow finally arrives at Kurtz's station, he meets a Russian who explains Kurtz's power and glory. Marlow is then led to Kurtz's station home. There he sees many cards and pictures painted by Kurtz. Finally, Kurtz comes to the room and starts telling Marlow about everything he did in Africa and talking about his mistress. Marlow soon finds out that Kurtz is insane with power because the Afrikaners take him as a god. Marlow is angry at the hardness and bondage he sees in Africa. After Marlow meets Kurtz, Kurtz begins to die. While Kurtz was on his deathbed, he phoned Marlow in his room. Kurtz's life flashed before his eyes, and his last words were: "The horror, the horror." When Marlow returns to Europe to see Kurtz's fianc√©, Marlow tells her that Kurtz's last words were her name to hide the darkness in Kurtz's life. <br /> <br /> The heart of darkness is well-directed and formed into an adventurous film. I recommend that someone watch this movie because it's full of action and secret. The movie is sometimes slow, but it's really interesting. The heart of darkness will greatly expand your mind and will teach you a lot about how to interpret different scenes.
