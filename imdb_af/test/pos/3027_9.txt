What makes watching and watching movies is a pleasure when every time you least expect a movie like The Cell to turn off your socks! This movie is an excellent horror that has everything you can have if you want to be scared. Without going into the story, all I will say is that it has a good start, middle and end that keeps you on the edge of your seat while transferring with the amazing special effects. The acting is good without being outstanding, but it doesn't matter, because the subject and the way it is placed on the big screen makes this one of the best horror movies I've seen long ago. This is one of those movies that you have proposed as a novel, but to say the credits don't look like an adaptation, so much credit must go to Mark Protosovich, the author. 9 out of 10.
