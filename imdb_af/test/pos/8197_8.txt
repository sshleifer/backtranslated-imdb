This three-hour Chinese epic, created in 220 BC, can ultimately be a well-known theme of an emperor's idealistic dream of peace by uniting in damaged isolation, and there is nothing inherently challenging about the movie, but It is a compelling narrative, packed with plot and passion and betrayal and epic events tell in bright strokes. Even for those who have not been recorded for such historical goggles, it is an amazing feast for the eyes: the scene depicting the Marquis's coup is one of the most astounding statements of physical space and grandeur of memory, and The battle tones are unforgettable in their scope and immediacy. The title summarizes the film's use of compelling contrasts - great rural views against intimate horrors; the most noble motives against the most degraded; hope to turn to dust. If you have never seen a Chinese epic three hours, it would not be a bad place to start.
