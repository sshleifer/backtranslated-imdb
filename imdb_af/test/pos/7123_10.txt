I had the original rough screen a few years ago at Gencon. I was delighted to do so, my daughter is in the movie. <br /> <br /> I was standing in the back of the room watching the many younger fans sitting on the edge of the seat, silent, no one wanting to miss a line. The standing ovation was after looking at the fans when the US hockey team beat the Russians at the Olympic Games in Montreal. <br /> <br /> I love great comedy and siggats. Taxi, Barney Miller, Cheers, Frasier and Getroud with Chilren are my favorite comedy shows. Small shows I won't even see. <br /> <br /> This movie will do for Gamers who did Animal House for College Frat days, which did Dodge Ball for strange sports. Forget the lack of a mega budget that supports production. It's pure art, it's so good. <br /> <br /> I couldn't be happier for the entire casting and production company.
