This movie is powerful. I watched the movie at about 3:00 and I had to be at work at 06:00. Needless to say I was working late. I couldn't get up to go off my bed to work. It's the most powerful movie I've seen in a long time. And it made me cry and feel the pain of the family. I think Emilo did a great job of directing this movie. I agree with previous comments from other views that this is the only movie I saw that brought the war home and showed what a family had to go through, which a veteran had gone through. It is almost sad to think, then people just thought you could come home from a life-changing experience and be the same person you were before you left. Kathy Bates somehow reminded me of my mother. I believe she really showed how women felt and acted earlier. I'm surprised this movie was no longer awards.
