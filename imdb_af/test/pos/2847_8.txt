Well, okay, maybe not perfect, but it was pretty close. This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and returned so quickly again. It seemed as if two different movies were playing simultaneously and then came together at the end. But they did it smoothly, and some in the theater found the bloody parts (such as the scalping scene) to be funny too. I just threw, but I think it's just me. Greg Kinear is perfect as a soap opera actor. He has the ability to perform those over-dramatic soap tones with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations. His scenes with Betty look like something from "Sleepless in Seattle" or another romantic comedy like that. You almost forgot that Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock are looking for Betty. Morgan Freeman's fascination with Betty was pretty scary, as he could be virtually his grandfather, but the screens where he spoke to her were definitely a bit laughing! Chris Rock's performance looks rather wood, but he has moments. Renee Zellweger is as nice as Betty, the lovely waitress with the unreliable man who treats her as dirty. It's very unlikely that she would actually get work at a hospital without any real credentials, but hey, it's a movie, just go with it! Her roommate, Rosa, also shines like a woman who cares for Betty, but doesn't quite know how to deal with Betty's disease. And finally there is Crispin Glover. Of course, as a fan of her, I thought the movie might have been more beautiful if it was more about it. No one else has the same style of acting as Crispin, and the argument between Chris Rock, Crispin and the sheriff over the soap opera is hilarious. I think I said I liked this movie a bit! If you can stomach blood, violence and very dirty language, it is worth the watch and will give you lots of laughs!
