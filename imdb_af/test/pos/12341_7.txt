Thorn-BMI was out of business before they stopped making movies, they made a movie. Use E.S.P. and telekinesis as the basis of the daughter whose father mastered a terrible power. Only after her father's death did Olivia find that Raymar's father Raymar of Raymarkovitch really killed 6 girls and planned two more using the Psyhic Vampirism technique. <br /> <br /> Our photo starts with 6 wagons coming in and music to match the horrific discovery of the 6 girls. Kill everyone with their eyes wide open in a closet. In the walls were all kinds of objects, the parents pulled up an old man, when blue lightning hit the ceiling causing a circular hole, the film made more bizarre! <br /> <br /> If you want very cold scenes for you. Unless you look dead in every level of decay this year, you shouldn't consider it without a friendly companion. Like 'The Changeling' it has some sad horror in it. I gave it a score of 7, it's in color, the actress Meg Tilly debuts in this movie if you can see it.
