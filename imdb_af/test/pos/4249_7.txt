Sure, the movie is full of black militant stereotypes and lots of jargon of the time. In that sense, the film has indeed dated. But as a satirical look at America's number one parasitic industry, advertising, it's still on the target. But equally important is the counter-message, namely the effect of big money on those who would make the industry more socially responsible, and no warlike toys, alcohol, etc. Will not promote. So the film is also about the allure of capitalism. For example, notice how Putney's clothes suddenly change to look like the third-world revolutionary Fidel, just before pulling out of the firm. For a moment, it seems Swope's mini-revolution has passed among his staff, and he moves on, perhaps to spread the movement. But then, the former militants bow to the greatness of money and he is going to shake his head, perhaps to cut a plane to Cuba. However, Downey's final word is an ironic one, as the Arab (I believe) burns the money tower, leaving the metaphorical structure of (advertising, capitalism) a smokestack. For me it seems as if change can only succeed as a cleansing act of destruction and not as a process of reform. A message that is in line with the radical spirit of the time. <br /> <br /> Whatever the subtext, there are some very funny moments, especially with the ads that are now playing as they did at the time. Those who compare the anarchic style with those of the Marx Bros make a good point. The throw lines fly thick and fast with the outrageous setup. Forty years later, it's still a hard movie to get a consistent handle. However, in spite of the cruises, the film remains a work of bold originality with some actually telling moments.
