OK, you have to sit down! This movie is not that bad. I saw it for the first time last night and fell in love with it! I have to admit that I have never been a fan of LeeLee Sobieski, but she grew on me in this movie. I think Josh Hartnett is good looking, but c'mon. Chris Klein is the most beautiful man I think I've ever seen !!! He made that movie better for me. C'mon girls .. when he doesn't have a shirt and goes to get water, I know your mouth has dropped. Yes, I know in the beginning he is a while, but eventually he realizes how he acted and learns to be a good guy. If he didn't come to the end, then I'd be angry. I think some lines don't have to be said, but it was all a good movie! I definitely recommend it!
