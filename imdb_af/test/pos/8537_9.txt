Oh my god. Obviously when you buy or buy it, you don't expect to see a documentary about the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitats. You expect a visual feast of blood and gore and maybe even a fright or two. Well, for those who are as ill and twisted as I do, you won't find much fear, but you'll be very close to laughing at yourself. The catches in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever. The first time I showed it to my friends and colleagues was over 3 years ago, but we still laugh at our asses and use the catches. It's so addictive and funny as Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and Peter Jackson's Dead Alive / Braindead. From the very beginning's absolutely ridiculous dialogue, to the Splatter and Gore section's best works, to the wonderful abilities of Ed the filmmaker, you'll laugh and laugh again. As far as the visual feast of blood and gore, oh yes, they have it. And they are pretty damn good about it ... "The neck bone is attached to the skull ..." This movie also did the best nightmare / hallucination / completely slight nuts I've ever seen. And that doesn't mean it's funny, but man is well done (and creepy.) Overall, for anyone who isn't against a lot of blood and a damn good time, if you ever see this movie! It's on Netflix, I know for sure.
