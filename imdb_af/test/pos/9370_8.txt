"Crossfire" feels like an underdeveloped masterpiece - it is well behaved and beautifully filmed, but written down and short. As it is, it is just a decent police procedure with hints of film noir (at its peak in 1947) and social commentary (also trendy in time). It is remembered today as one of the first two Hollywood films to deal with anti-Semitism, and much better than the similar "Gentleman's Agreement" (no common thing). But his real subject is the problems that World War II soldiers, as trained murderers, had when they made the transition to civilian life. (For a more healthy approach on this topic, try "The Best Years of Our Life.") A man is beaten to death in the first few frames of the film. We don't see his attacker. The movie is about exploring this murder, which is pretty simple, but it takes unnecessary considerations, such as when the main suspect, a depressed soldier, gets into the apartment of Gloria Grahame, a real-life dance hooker pimp played by Paul Kelly. There is also a civilian reading halfway through the movie which slows down the proceedings to a crawl, and the end is neat enough for a police show. But otherwise it's a decent decent secret. Still, what a good noir it could have been. Director Edward Dmytryk gives some tips on the subject of the original novel - homosexuality, not anti-Semitism - as when sadistic creep Monty looks at the image of his friend Mitch, speaks to a strange man at a bar. And the throw is excellent. Robert Ryan makes a very credible cheat a little sympathetic to his final scenes, unlike Peter Lorre as the child killer in "M." no. He earned an Oscar, but that year Edmund lost Gwenn (you can't lose Santa Claus). Robert Mitchum is a soldier friend of the accused killer. Was Mitchum a good actor or a big star? Someone else can figure it out, but his sleepy eyes and moody half-smile work very well here, as it means his character knows something that nobody else is doing. (And he does.) And Robert Young, as the detective assigned to the murder, is surprisingly eager and discarding his usual cut-off commitment even when he has to deliver the civil rights sermon halfway through the picture. There is no doubt that Bogart or Tracy would have been brilliant in the role, but none of them were in RKO in 1947, so you will only have to go with Welby. Yet Young is good enough to make you wish someone threw him into a detective drama instead of "Father Knows Best", which he hated and who led him to alcoholism and suicide attempts. The man earned better than Smarm and Sanka.
