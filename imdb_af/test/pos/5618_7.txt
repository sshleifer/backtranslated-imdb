I think Samuel Goldwyn has tried to achieve two things in this movie. First, the film is a tribute to Jascha Heifetz, who is considered the best violin siros of the past century. Secondly, the Dead End children brought on screen with his film of the same title and saw their sign with Warner Brothers. He tried to create a second gang of enticing hedgehogs. <br /> <br /> Although the movie was good, there was definitely no requirement for the children of this movie to be played for another function again. <br /> <br /> The gang leader is Gene Reynolds who once played the violin, but now leads a street gang of indifferent eggs. His stepfather, Arthur Hohl, breaks the violin his father gave young Reynolds and threatens to send him to reform the school over his mother's poor protest, Marjorie Main. <br /> <br /> Young Reynolds happens to stumble upon a music school run by old music maestro himself, Walter Brennan and his daughter Andrea Leeds. They take him in but they have their financial problems with many creditors led by Porter Hall. <br /> <br /> This movie is mostly seen today because it is a chance for classical music lovers to see and hear Jascha. Heifetz that as you gather is the solution in some way for everyone's problems. Joel McCrea is also in this movie, but has a rather colorless role as Andrea Leeds boyfriend. <br /> <br /> In addition to Heifetz, one thing the movie does is touch, though it is a pity on the subject of child abuse and abused wife. Arthur Hohl is a common man and Marjorie Main is clearly a very injured woman. <br /> <br /> The role-play children do well, Reynolds, Tommy Kelly, Terry Kilburn and a young girl named Jacqueline Nash who grew up and performed as Gale Sherwood, nightclubmate to Nelson Eddy. She had a nice soprano, even as a child. <br /> <br /> But that's Heifetz you see the show.
