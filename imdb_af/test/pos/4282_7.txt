I just gave it a seven because the play is good. And of course that means Wilkinson. The other two principals were "decent". But the characters themselves ... who on earth were so bad about the character Wilkinson played (James Manning)? I didn't see him acting like martin Emily Watson accused him of. Bill Bule, on the other hand, was an insatiable jerk that I had prayed for, would encounter a very cruel and prolonged downfall. Who did I estimate? Tom Wilkinson is not Paul Bettany. So what at EARTH saw Emily Watson's (Anne) character in him ???? She conceded he was a piece of waste in his treatment of her. Why does she even want to be in the same CITY as he is, to say nothing of the same "room". <br /> <br /> I saw other reviews, one person said she was crying at the end to testify of James's tragedy. ??? What tragedy? What do you mean to lose an imbecile who finds someone like Bill Bule AMUSING ??? !!! Give us a break.
