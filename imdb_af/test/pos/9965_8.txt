Michael Radford, director of "The Merchant of Venice", is doing a tremendous job opening the play, making it more accessible to everyone to enjoy a good time in the movie. The delightful production of the Shakespeare play is a feast for the eyes with its rich detail of Venice of the XVI century. <br /> <br /> This is a story of revenge, prejudice and justice, as imagined by William Shakespeare. Having seen the play several times, we were not prepared for what to expect. Mr. Radford ensures that the story is presented with such detail that it can be easily understood by everyone. He also used a version of English that makes sense rather than relying on the original text. In fact, the way in which Shylock speaks in the film does not shock, it is he, a member of a minority marginalized by the Venetian authorities and the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> All Pacino's great portrayal of Shylock shows a man who is vulnerable, arrogant, revengeful, mean and completely human, all at the same time. Mr. Pacino sheds light on the character of the man who is defeated in court by a technical court. His own daughter left him and his whole world looked like he was on him. At the end of the film we see a man who is reduced to the target of hatred and ridiculous by everyone. <br /> <br /> Lynn Collins, as Portia, is a happy discovery. After seeing her in lighter food, she didn't just surprise, but she made the most of her role and time in front of the camera. She shows us she is a high-intelligence woman who comes to the aid of her husband and his best friend, who has threatened his own well-being to try to help Bassanio's hand. <br /> <br /> Jeremy Irons plays Antonio, the man looking for a "bridge loan" for Shylock. After all, he knows that his ships will soon return with the fate of overseas. Antonio gets much more than he had agreed to agree to the terms of the loan with Shylock. Antonio's best laid plans are going down if he is unable to meet his obligations. Mr. Irons gives a subtle display. <br /> <br /> Joseph Fiennes makes a good appearance as Bassanio. His good looks and his charm make an impression on Portia, who clearly sees a soul mate in this young, Venetian as she knows he is the one for her. Also in smaller roles, Kris Marshall, Zuleika Robinson, Charlie Cox, contributes to the movie a pleasant experience. <br /> <br /> Eventually it is Mr. Radford's victory because of the vision he gave us from Venice and his citizens in a terrible time in the history of mankind.
