I like the previous description of this movie as a life poem. I caught randomly on the film channel last night, and was enough to hold onto it. There is actually only a toally unique voice for the film, a narrative that makes sense without being pretentious. There are also many hilarious moments of Wirey's middle school days that are rough without being potty humor. It's sad that this movie has been rated so low. The fact that there are so many 1's makes me think the numbers are cooked. I can't see anyone watching the movie if it's uncomfortable. This is certainly not a typical romantic comedy, but it is a very unique view of a very unique life, of a man whose great appeal comes from his debauchery, a riotousness which he must overcome before it destroys him . Give this movie a chance. It didn't get me anywhere, and I felt the richer for it.
