I hope Robert Redford wants to make more and more films. Hillerman's books are wonderful, and as a young child who wakes up in the South, she's gone home! Adam Beach is a highly subordinate and used actor. Wake up Hollywood, not everyone thinks your Mel Gibson's cool! Many filmmakers today want to watch movies that make you think. I've seen the Redford / Hillerman series. They are considerate, beautiful and have large plots. I hope that if enough people write to Robert Redford, he can decide to make another one! Thanks Adam Beach and Tony Hillerman for great entertainment! If anyone gets the chance to read Tony Hillerman's latest book, do it! It's wonderful. I also recommend traveling through Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Stop at every view yard and feel the setting of Hillerman's books. Wonderful experience.
