The book "The Railway Children" is a children's book published in 1906 by Edith Nesbit, an early British socialist, who had very strong views on the importance of family values ​​for the education of children. The story that told it was supposed to be contemporary. Somewhat surprisingly, it seems like a hundred years later it is an important appeal for today's children. <br /> <br /> A movie adaptation of an Edwardian classic children's story with the main characters of the kids, doesn't sound very exciting to most moviegoers in this day and age. But a very good performance by Jenny Agutter, who played the role of the oldest girl Roberta (Bobby), in the beginning of her long and prominent career, combined with remarkable work by writer and director Lionel Jeffries and excellent photography by Arthur Ibbetson made it a movie that has not yet been missed and one that most of its viewers find unforgettable. It is noteworthy that this book, filmed in 1905, was filmed five times between 1951 and 2000 (four of the BBC for British television) and all of these versions are not only widely admired, but also highly regarded ( something that will confirm users' comments on this database, although it may seem almost inconceivable for a nostalgic period story that is primarily aimed at children. Since I did not see the four BBC TV versions, this comment relates only to the 1970 movie version produced to appear in theaters. Contrary to most children's books, Railroad children can appeal to adults more than children. The structure of family life has changed so much in the past century that many children are completely lost by the way it is portrayed in the film, while many older adults find it has a significant nostalgic appeal. Perhaps it compensates, the children appearing in the movie are full of life and vitality, while the adult characters are both well-rounded, mostly mostly 'stuffed shirts'. The story is a mature one that deals with love, support and encouragement. It is not only timeless, but also in all age groups. It can be reasonably described as sentimental and more than a bit idealized, but it is never in any way, and the rare fair adjective 'uplifting' fits it like a glove. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Front. <Br /> <br /> The movie starts with its up-middle Edwardian family celebrating Christmas in a comfortable and fairly spacious London home when two unexpected visitors call and take Father (who is a senior state official). Mother has to move to a very small house along the railway in a remote Yorkshire area and the children gradually build a new life that is mainly related to the railway line and the few trains passing by. This life proves to be very striking in small ways and the older daughter Bobby is growing fast as she takes on more responsibilities from her mother. At one point she stopped an accident at the train when her sharp eyes saw a landslide as a natural hazard. Father's story is never given much emphasis, but he is never forgotten and it is becoming clear that he is caught and suspected of betrayal. Eventually this suspicion is clarified (we are not told how or why) and he appears unexpectedly at the local station to join his family. <br /> <br /> For years, this movie was not available in any home video format. North America, but Anchor Bay created a DVD three years ago, so they clearly acknowledged that this simple movie has not yet lost its appeal. For anyone who doesn't have one yet, I strongly recommend buying a copy of this DVD while it's still available. It will probably not be disappointing, unless you become totally cynical, or your minimum movie requirements include buckets of blood and / or intense sex scenes.
