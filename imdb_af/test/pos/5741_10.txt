My partner and I sat last night watching this movie over a bottle of wine and although we initially had our discussions as soon as the story was going on, it was actually relative. The scene in which one of the characters was murdered in the brutal killings by knitting needles was particularly shocking and characterized the work of Korean new golf author Park Chan Wook. The choice weapon was a particular masterpiece and allowed us to look in the psyche of 'Grandmother', which changed the connotations of a loving, grandmother into a murderous haunt. The dialogue was incredibly moving and lyrical to express the leading paranoia the main character. Pavlosky's choices of mise and scene enhance the unpleasant and manic atmosphere of the nightly events, combining with the Oscar-worthy performances to create a cold and thought-like masterpiece. The end, which I will not spoil for you here, reminded my mother and myself of M Night Shyamalan's institutional masterpiece, The Sixth Sense, of his intellectual change that made me think weeks after the show. Definitely one to watch repeatedly!
