Unlike some of the former commentators, I was (and is) an avid fan of the carpenter. Get it, Christmas will never be Christmas without The Carpenters. I said the movie did a good, not great job of portraying Karen's life. The movie was great to watch on Primetime TV, but the content has become a bit short. I suggest you all look at some of the carpenters in the 70's. You can't believe how fantastic a drummer Karen was. Cynthia didn't catch up on Karen's talent. Also, Karen was beautiful but had a bad hairdresser. My choice for Karen is Hilary Swank. I would like to see a more substantive story because there was more to Karen than I can see at the eyes when we listen to We just started. I have many unreleased Carpenters' music, and it is absolutely excellent. (Her song from California Dreamin is to die).
