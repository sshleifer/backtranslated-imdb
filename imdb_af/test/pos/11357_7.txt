I'm from Ireland and I thought this movie had the odd minute or two where accent was a bit off but no worse than any Brad Pitt or other Americans doing the accent. Furthermore, I rarely saw a British actor dealing with an American or Canadian accent, except Colin Farrel in the Minority Report. This movie is a small movie and it was entertaining. No, it wasn't a Blockbuster Hollywood production, but frankly, I'm sick of that shine. I laughed more than a few times and had a good time. It was definitely worth it. The main character is a spoof on other hard British gangs. At least that's how I saw it. If you expect a $ 100m production, you'll be disappointed. Enjoy it for what it is - a small entertaining movie.
