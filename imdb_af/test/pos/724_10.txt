I saw a lot of movies and it just blew me out. The trauma, the tension is just amazing. So I ended up in the psychological fear and philosophy of it, and linked it to reality. Movies that play and challenge your thoughts are movies you don't forget, those that make you doubt about your reality. A problem can be the quality, but it doesn't leave the core of the movie. <br /> <br /> The idea itself is brilliant and the end just leaves you completely shocked and with the question that you're looking for the answer. I just loved it completely! So many clues and times and puzzles. One of the best movies ever, hands off.
