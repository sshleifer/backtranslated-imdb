Great adaptation of the Christie novel. Surprising attention to authentic time details for the time (Many mid-1970s early 1980s trying to make the 1920s and early 30s look to my taste until the mid-70s, so expect the worst here and were wrong proof) The costumes and sets are very well done. I really like this production? largely due to the painting of Francesca Annis depicting a carefree, shiny young lady "Frankie" and James Warwick's beautiful Bobbie. The couple continue to portray Christie's Tommy & Tuppence. It's funny as some contemporary book critics compare Frankie and Bobby with her earlier characters from Tommy & Tuppence. The supporting characters were equally well done? the over the top Mrs. Rivington (performed by Miss Marple-to-be Joan H.) and "Badger" are perfectly played as the post-WWI, "Bertie Wooster Type."
