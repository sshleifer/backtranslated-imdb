I just saw it at the Philadelphia Film Festival. It was the most wonderful movie - the best I've seen for a while. The seductive character of Isa is an open, exploratory and (as noted in the film) loving person - depicted innocently by the beautiful Camille Natta. The accompanying music is soft and transportable, a balm for the soul. <br /> <br /> Every character seems to collide in some way - and their interactions (w / conflicts) make a wonderful story. The story told by A.K. Hangal like the Old Man did the most magic. I wanted it to be on and off. <br /> <br /> She seems to have added Hari's place "throughout", gaining power from the story. A refreshing change in the bubble. headers of many modern writers. <br /> <br /> Everything and everyone, a great movie. Go look.
