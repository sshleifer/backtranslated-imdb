Look like Anglo-Irish, I assure you this reviewer is anything but Bias. But I assure you this is a lot of Irish Film - not English, as the last remark seems to have come. This film was written by Neil Earth and Conor McPherson and also by Conor McPherson director - both Irish. The Cast is almost completely Irish - it was shot in Ireland with an Irish crew. Even Michael Gambon was born in Ireland - I remember him in an interview on this movie. <br /> <br /> Michael Cane was apparently brought in to increase office overseas. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie. I just wanted to rectify a totally uninformed comment! <br /> <br /> Now with the review - I loved Dylan Moran, has always been a fan of his, Michael Cane, and he has formed a surprisingly good double. act. It was great to see Morans' series as an actor, as he plays several different styled characters during the film. I would recommend this movie to anyone with an interest in comedy - as it represents a fresh, impressive and inventive twist in Irish feature film chuckle movies. I laughed a lot. what else can you ask for?
