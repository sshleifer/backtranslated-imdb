This movie would have worked much better if it was the first Critters movie, it's a low-budget movie with only two (2) screeners displayed on the screen. Why it seems like a failure, because it is the last Critters movie and it's so low-budget that the director seems to have made the whole movie with his own pocket money. However, I liked this movie, I mostly compare it to the third movie (which was bad). Kritters 4 has a more serious tone in it, the first half of the movie (even if no Critter has been seen), you have a frightening feeling to watch it, too bad not to have the Critters "milk" not, I even mean if they only had two (2) puppets that could use them much more on the screen. The Critters also have different deaths in this movie that made it a bit special, especially at the end with the frozen Critter. Ug has a promotion in this part and is different in this movie that surprised me. Finally, I like this one, because it also has a kind of conclusion to the series, so we will at least not see a Critters 5. Oh, one last thing, I missed one scene in this movie, we never see a Critter a ghost of his back, maybe these dolls didn't have that feature, but I was very disappointed not to see it (In Critters 3 we see lots of sniper shooting, which was the only good thing I like about that movie).
