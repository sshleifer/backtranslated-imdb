Somehow CHANGI lost in the AFI awards to MY BROTHER JACK. The latter, a high-quality adaptation of George Johnston's immortal novel, was outstanding - but I don't think it's as good as CHANGI. I heard that many critics rejected CHANGI as irrelevant, unimportant, historically inaccurate or even disrespectful. Who and where are these critics? CHANGI is outstanding. More than that. Brilliant. It is not supposed to be a documentary documentation - surely, I can forgive the actual Changi survivors (or even any survivors of a POW camp) to be disappointed with the production - but represent the rest of us CHANGI the remarkable power of mateship in times of extreme adversity. It contains a part of the Australian culture that seems to be diminishing as times become easier and less challenging, but we must never forget. Australians are respected worldwide for Gallipoli and WW2 for their comrade and sense of humor. Rating: 96/100. See also: GALLIPOLI; PARADISE PAD; THE LAST BULLET; THE SUGAR FACTORY.
