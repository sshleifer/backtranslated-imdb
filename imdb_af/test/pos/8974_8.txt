Fun to see an adult comedy. Masterfully structured by Aaron Sorkin via Mike Nichols' own mastery. Mr. Nichol's ability to present characters in all their shocking truths, from the sad and sounding Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf" to the sad and sounding Julia Roberts, Clive Owen, Jude Law and Natalie Portman "Closer". In Charlie Wilson's War, the shocking truth is beyond the characters, and sad and resounding Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams are serving something different. It's just once personal. Hanks must bury his luster in some malts and Julia Roberts throws parties and introduces characters with blatant regency. Amy Adams testifies and exists as a character, witness. An insurmountable task that Mrs Adams manages to convince. This is Philip Seymour Hoffman's Gus with a t, but it monopolized my attention. His character may not be the first, but this is the first way Hoffman offered us. Someone who survives the negligence with which he is survived by the absolute conviction is smarter than everyone. Hoffman is wonderful. The speed of the story helps enormously not to fall into a multitude of useless questions. A sharp, short, clever, sad comedy and when was the last time I could say it?
