The 08th MS team has two hopeful romantics from different sides of the conflict. Aina, the Zeon officer and Shiro, the new Federal Force pilot, meets in a space battle, throughout the 12 episode series (and one movie), the two debating their love for each other as they try to Go with the war that surrounds them. It features a Romeo and Juliet romance and unbeatable animation. By far one of the best to hit American Shores. Dress!
