"I'm ... proud of" Head, "Mike Nesmith said. He must be because this film, which has been stung by many of us or studied and reviewed by film professors, works on many levels. Yes, it's unconventional. For many, frustrating. It's almost as if the producers are giving and requesting the movie: "You find it out." <br /> <br /> You've probably already known TV show was a runaway marketing success that was dependent on business acumen and not small ministry of public deception. TV shows deal with the sale of soap and toothpaste, rather than entertainment. Boxing broken to make a headline is evidence of the group's popularity and interest in pop culture, despite where your head is. Get one thing straight: "Head" is not The Monkees TV show. br /> <br /> So, what we have here is a "psychedelic documentary" about Western pop culture from a source that has authority over the subject. is a movie that just comes from the "inside the box". By 1968, The Monkees' team and crew were seasoned and tired of professionals who saw their share of promise and disappointment. The film was a deliberate attempt to reposition the market. So it did three things: Make a movie like the Monkeys suggested. Most importantly, rediscover the group to one who is not subordinate to his old bosses - and you are better off than before. Create a film that has exposed American attitudes to information dissemination. <br /> <br /> "Head" is about media manipulation and its net result: deception. The mass media is supposed to inform us about the events in the world in general and finally ask us to form opinions of these events that can form thoughts in positive action. So we accept the information we absorb to be complete and impartial. Otherwise, how can one make a valued conclusion on any idea presented by a book, newspaper or TV program? In one of the street interviews in "Head", a man admits: "For years I haven't looked at a newspaper or television." Is he less or better the man? Even the drug parallels are a soft sale of "Things are not as they seem." Remember the old joke, "everything you know is wrong"? The script starts with The Monkees' public admission of his own "crafted image" and literally runs with the football. Is the football scene in the movie a visual manifestation of the whole idea behind "Head"? Is the movie a stream of awareness exercise? Is the movie the highlight of pot smoking marathons? There are too many coincidences that occur in the film that otherwise suggest. My guess is that "Head" is the highlight of motivation somewhere between intended and unintended. <br /> <br /> The insiders responsible for "Head" seem to be enjoying themselves in the entertainment that takes place in the film, but there is anger at the chaos that characterized the late 60's and anger in that way. where the media, especially television, has changed the culture negatively. Drugs and violence were strongly negative in the late 60's and are still, but producers of "Head" want you to know that poor "information" is a far greater danger. <br /> <br /> Wars are attributed to hoaxes and lies. What perfect way to spread disinformation than through TV? The mysterious black box is repeatedly seen as a hindrance to The Monkees and, apparently, all of us. In one scene, Peter sits in a salon that has a melting ice cream cone, and is asked by a fellow monkey, "What's wrong?" "I bought this ice cream cone and I didn't want it." The film suggests that the first purpose of the media is NOT to inform, but to sell blindly. "Head" goes further: puts an idea in someone's head and he goes cheerfully. <br /> <br /> The filmmakers know this and the danger is real. "Head" is either a movie that creates itself "as we go" or is a deliberate statement. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe it's just "Pot meet advertising", as critics hit in 1968. The jokes are on The Monkees and us. Be careful what you ask for, you can get it. <br /> <br /> Cheers: A real, guilty pleasure. Very funny. Intelligent. Will the fans please. Find the dust, it's there. Unashamedly strange. Bizarre collection of characters. Good tuning. Length is appropriate. Very good one linen, including my prophetic favorite: "The tragedy of your time, my young friends, is that you can get exactly what you want." <br /> <br /> Caveats: Dated. Drugs. No plot. No linear delivery of any thought in particular. At least twenty-five stories intertwined in the stop-and-go fashion. So, it can easily frustrate. May seem to someone pretentious. People who cannot stand The Monkeys do not have to look, although this is not in itself a reason to avoid it. The psychedelic special effects can kill your bad picture tube or your sour burned eyeballs. <br /> <br /> Fit, cut.
