hey; Belmondo! Look, there is Anna Karina! Great American improvised New Wave (or Independent you want to call it), not as good as Godard or Truffaut, and not flawless, but hey so realism, style, warmth and humor. I love the NY accent; "you know nothing!"; "forget about it". Just like the French New Wave, it's about young people; party, fall in love or just hang around. Lelia Goldoni is so cute; she is wealthy; wonderful. Ben Carruthers' too, remind me of Belmondo. A movie you won't forget. <br /> <br /> a steady 26.5 out of 31 ;-)
