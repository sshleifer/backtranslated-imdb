You can't see the same movie if you didn't grow up in France (or spent at least 10 years there, like me). I don't know if it will ever be outside the French cultural borders (I include Belgium and Luxembourg here). You can't translate his kind of fun - every name is joke (how many people outside Paris will understand the word in Couloirdebus, the name of one of the Roman legions?). But Monica Bel (l?) ​​Ucci is so beautiful, I almost forgot to breathe when I saw her.
