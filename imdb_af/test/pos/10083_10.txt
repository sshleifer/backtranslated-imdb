It's a cut above other movies of the genre: sincere tension, intelligent, brilliant action and visually stunning. Yes, the plot can be confusing - but it is partly what makes it so. Watch it twice as you can. You will almost be so much to look at when you know the turn you do to watch it for the first time. <br /> <br /> Don't be fired by the fact that this movie comes from Korea, a country not known to most Western audiences. While elements of the film are culturally specific, the underlying themes are all too common - guilt, anger, loss, madness and retribution. All these things are handled perfectly by Lim Su-jeong as the main character. Yum Jung-ah, who also delivers a deep and unpleasant performance as a stepmother, is also worth it. <br /> <br /> While having scary moments, it's not really a horrible movie as most people would imagine. It is more a psychological tension story with an element of mystery. It keeps you from the beginning and keeps you to the end - and possibly further!
