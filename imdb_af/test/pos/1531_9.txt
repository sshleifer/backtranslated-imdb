This movie surprised me. I only saw it more than 10 years ago, and it remains with me. It's just boring points, and I would end it personally differently. It did not discourage me at all from seeing it over and over and recommending it to others. The acting is _fantastic_. The film and director do a wonderful job with the script, and anyone who likes 'different' movies, who has the patience to sit and say, "What is hell, is it?" And let them go to give this movie a chance. If you just want Alan Rickman to be goodbye or explode, it's not the movie for you.
