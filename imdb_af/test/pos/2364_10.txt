The funniest film I have ever seen in Britain, "The Supergrass" is a story of sex, drugs, cream tea and sea killing. Dennis Carter (Adrian Edmonson), average moron, is busy impressing his so-called girlfriend, Andrea (Dawn French), because she thinks he's too law-abiding. Allowing her to come with him on a romantic outing, he comes up with a scheme that might impress her and seduce her to spend time with him. In fact, Dennis's lie is that he somehow got involved with an international drug ring, and while she told her, some policemen heard his fame and call him. And so start this spectacular movie, full of dirty comedy and rough jokes. Dennis was bursting into the local nickname, and many of the persistent officers' joy, there seems to be no way out (Andrea's earlier attempts to explain it was a lie caused by a hilarious melody of "Stand by Your Man "dismissed by the two officers"). Then comes Commander Robertson (Ronald Allen), Chief Intelligence, Scotland Yard. He made an agreement with Dennis that if he helped catch the drug traffickers, he would be released and allowed what he wanted. Dennis agrees and is with Harvey Duncan (Peter Richardson) and Lesley Reynolds (Jennifer Saunders). The rest is an unforgettable rib kettle experience, with Robbie Coltrane as Sergeant Troy adding humorous color to the movie. She walks along the dry dock at "Frankie Goes To Hollywood's Two Tribes", and is probably the best scene in film history. The two officers named Nick Dennis have been wonderfully played by Michael Elphick and Patrick Durkin, and Alexei Sayle as the motorcycle man is a laugh! If you want something good to watch on a Saturday night, I suggest you rent it. You won't forget it!
