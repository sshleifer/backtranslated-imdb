Man, I think people have forgotten how to watch a movie. Everyone thinks they are a critic. They comment on things that the average movie doesn't even know or think. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed the movie. That was what I expected, so was not disappointed. Steven is getting a bad rap to put his views into his films, but it's also a reason to look. What's even more funny are the people who complain about his films, say he is the worst and that we shouldn't watch his movies, but still have to watch his movies. So they can comment on how bad they are. Who's the dummy? If you don't like his job, don't look. Then you do not have to submit to this so-called painful event. <br /> <br /> Stop comparing movies with other movies and watch a movie on an individual basis and enjoy movies again.
