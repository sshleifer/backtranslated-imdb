I bought it for a while, during a massive martial arts film phase. Although definitely not the best, I like this kind of filmmaking, and there was a lot to entertain me in this one. Leung Kar Yan is one of my favorite champion stars, I always appreciate the fact that he usually had a versatile fighting performance, while having no formal martial arts training. He also has a good beard. This movie has him in a good, heroic role and although he does not kick as much ass as in some of his other films, he nevertheless releases him. Early appearances of Cherie Chung and Chow Yun Fat are also nice to watch, especially as Chow Yun Fat plays the bad guys without his trademark weapon. He may not be a good fighter, but he does well. Eddy Ko is like a bad guy like ever, he does the same villain as in many of his other movies and does it well as usual. The fellow Bu plays is also good, I remember his name, but he is also in Magnificent Butcher. Although the battles are not as good as other movies of the era, the postman battles make it with lots of imagination, quality cinematography and a pretty peculiar atmosphere. There are some very fine scenes, good characters and a good eclectic mix of Hong Kong talents. All in all, I would recommend it to kung fu and general Hong Kong action fans. It may not be a stylized classic like the Shaw Brothers movies, or as a crowd that is like Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee, but it's rock solid entertainment.
