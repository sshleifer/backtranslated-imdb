A 20-year-old missionary in China is refusing to become the CAT'S PAW for a gang of hometown caps. <br /> <br /> This movie was a departure from Harold Lloyd's previous movies. Comedy comes more from dialogue, often rather serious, dominates here, rather than the extended siggats that Harold's classics of the past have driven. However, there are some wonderful moments, which are pure visual fun, such as when Harold tries to follow a convertible street in a busy street, or when he urgently tries to keep a nightclub robber to lose her clothes. There is also the climate scene, located in a Chinatown cellar, in which Harold jumps unforgettably into the darkest comedy. But most of the humor is the result of Harold's refusal to be the patsy of the criminals who have been doing his hometown for years. <br /> <br /> And that's a collection of crooked politicians and thugs that Harold found himself playing. by a crowd of fine characters: George Barbier, Nat Pendleton, Grant Mitchell, Edwin Maxwell, Alan Dinehart, Warren Hymer & Stuttering Fuzzy Knight. Pert Una Merkel is at hand as the tobacco-standing girl who catches up with Harold's eye and keeps him inspired by her no-nonsense outlook on life. <br /> <br /> Movie mavens will recognize Samuel S. Hinds as Harold's mission father; Charles Sellon as elderly Stockport minister; and Herman Bing as a German gangster - not all accredited. Also, for a few seconds as an attempt at kidnapping, Noah Young, a well-known face of Harold's silent films, is making his final appearance in a Lloyd picture. <br /> <br /> Fox gave the film fine production values, especially in the opening scenes in China.
