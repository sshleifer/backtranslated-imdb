Another brilliant depiction by Kiefer Sutherland, who plays Mickey Hayden, is a police spokesperson for the murdered victims. I absolutely love the movies dealing with the psychic empire, and I was not disappointed with the Eye of the Killer (AKA After Alice). I just wish the movie was first released theater.
