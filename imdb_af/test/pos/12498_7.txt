I was torn over this show. While most of them found it, it was HILARIEUS, other parts of it were stupid and shockingly shocked. The wall parade of some of the cartoons is brilliant, because many of the scenes are indeed among the kids. However, I don't think it's smart to make small children to say rude things. It's not that I think "oh poor children, they're exploited" - it's just that it's not smart! It's something someone can do, so making it as simple and useless as making a paper plane. To make this show better, they must adhere to the natural response of children, which I think may be more funny than the magazine. <br /> <br /> By far, the funniest part of Wonder Shows is Clarence, the blue puppet wondering the streets and talking to strangers. It's really funny and it's mostly improvised. To see him in a long-standing sense of the importance of patience, test the patience of an extraordinarily patient man, in my opinion, was the funniest scene. <br /> <br /> You have to look at this show, because even though it's very funny, sometimes it's stupid.
