I had my concerns about watching The Return to Lonesome Dove after seeing and enjoying the original. Without Tommy Lee Jones, who plays his role as Woodrow Call or Anjelica Huston as Clara, I figured it would just not be authentic enough. When reading 'return' I can honestly say it is a worthy successor. The actors really do show up with Jon Voight, Rick Schroder, and Oliver Reed is doing everything at their best. I admit that the story may not be as staggering as the first, but "return" definitely has a part of excitement and the romance of the old west in a way that few other films have. Anyone who still has reservations can be assured that The Return to Lonesome Dove manages to capture the 'feel' of the original and won't disappoint. Do yourself a favor and look it out, Ol 'Gus will be proud!
