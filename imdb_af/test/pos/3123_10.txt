I don't think I really have a spoil here, but since I describe some funny scenes, I will see the box saying that "spoilers" might just be on the safe side. Now ... <br /> <br /> I know almost where to start. By now, you know the basics of the story. Travis (Ben Johnson) and Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) are leading a Mormon wagon West to their "Promised Land" and on the way a variety of trials and interesting characters, especially the Clegg family. <br /> <br /> Anyone can enjoy this movie. You don't have to be a fan of the Westerners to keep this one. For one thing, Johnson and Carey are two of the fastest characters you'll see in any movie. Carey in particular is animated and outgoing, almost like a big kid - while Johnson is a little calmer and wiser, like an older brother figure. I get a kick from the scene where they sell the sheriff one of their "soft horses" for ten dollars; tell him that the horse has some peculiarities - you may say failures .... Travis elbows sandy loose with a sharp whistle, and send the sheriff's new horse down a wild bend with him in the hall . The look on his face when the horse finally dropped him with the gallop, is priceless. <br /> <br /> Pay attention to the music ... even if you never thought you would be a fan of the Pioneer Boys. , listen to "Shadows in the Dust" as the wagon train is moving in motion with some of the people walking between the wagons. It's a great song, too bad just half an hour or so, it's in the movie. I want to hear the whole thing one day. <br /> <br /> One thing that impressed me a lot about this movie is that it's as much as the real situation that depicts it, should be almost as difficult. Teams of six horses draw wagons on steep mountain paths, which stretch to make the summit - it was not a simple and easy movie. It also had to be dangerous for the actors, the stunt people and the animals. This movie also has a large number of authentic actions that include the movement of the carriage train. It should be noted that both Harry Carey Jr and Ben Johnson were extremely capable riders, both with years of experience driving, calling, and doing all sorts of cowboy stuff. Carey grew up on a farm where his family employed many Navajo Indians. He did indeed learn to speak Navajo before learning English. No strass cowboys in this movie - "Travis" and "Sandy" were the real thing through and through. <br /> <br /> Watch the scene when Miss Denver throws the water bowl out of her wagon and hits Travis's horse. in the face ... the horse starts bucking, eventually throws him off. Look at the look of Sandy's face when Denver tells Travis, "I'm sorry you've fallen off your horse." Another favorite scene of mine is when Harry Carey Jr (Sandy) comes in a bit of a tiff with one of the Mormons. They work back to get their tools ready, and after Sandy strangled the other fellows, the two of them come in a backstage clash that quickly changes into a continuous fist fight. . Even after the Parent (Ward Bond) gets up and separates them, the two warriors continue to try each other. The Mormon (named 'Jackson' in the movie) gets a final kick at Sandy so high that he hits his shoulder. It's a very funny scene from start to finish. <br /> <br /> I don't know what else I can say about this movie, except that it has a good story, lots of engaging characters, beautiful scenery and lots of action balanced with humor and a bit of drama. Oh, it's colored, at least in the version I saw; Not the most beautiful color film you'll ever see, but I think I prefer it to black and white. I give this one a ten and I don't give out 10's. One of my favorite movies, no doubt. And by judging the other comments, I have much of the company in that assessment.
