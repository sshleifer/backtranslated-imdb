From the start of "The Edge of Love" the viewer is transported to the striking world of WW2 London. We follow the lives of four people who could only be created for this movie, an exploration of female friendship and the tribes caused by marriage and infidelity. In addition to one of the characters, Dylan is called Thomas, perhaps the greatest English poet of the 20th century. And his reactions to the world around him were not only selfish, but sometimes indescribable. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on Thomas's writings on love and romance. This was adapted with a sharp script by Sharman MacDonald (Keira Knightley's mother). The director, John Maybury, claims that the other three main characters were real people. <br /> <br /> All four are very much done. Sienna Miller is Dylan's wife, Keira Knightley is cabaret singer Vera Phillips. Matthew Rhys is Dylan Thomas, and Cillian Murphy is William Killick. The first part of the movie takes place in London during the Nazi air strikes, with Vera pursued by Willaim, a soldier waiting for deployment. At a chance meeting, Dylan meets with his first love, Vera. From there, Vera meets Caitlin, Dylan's wife. While the three are drinking, William Vera's guard breaks successfully. <br /> <br /> The movie follows their lives as Vera and William are married and he is sent to war. Vera became pregnant and returned to Wales with Dylan and Caitlin. There they have a keen existence, with Vera supporting Dylan and Caitlin with her husband's war pay. Through these times Vera and Caitlin's friendship grows. So Dylan's imagination does with Vera. She gives in. It creates the first test for the two women. <br /> <br /> When William returns from war, he barely admits his wife and has no connection with his baby son. Things get worse, as Dylan struggles to fight his friendship with difficulty (after traumatic stress disorder). William realized something had happened between Dylan and Vera, and in a drunken rage Dylan's house shot up. <br /> <br /> "Edge Of Love" begins as an attractive romance in war-torn London and ends in the crisp, peaceful life. of motherhood, infidelity and attempted murder in Wales. The treatment of PTSD is well done, and should speak to an American audience. Any day (see end). <br /> <br /> Every star has a good moment. Miller when she puts stitches in her head in response to her abortion of another man's child. Knightley and Murpy when he eventually joined his son. Oh hell, almost all their scenes are wonderful. And Rhys when he gets himself in the stand to get Vera's husband in jail. <br /> <br /> Yet, the real star of the movie is Jonathan Freeman's cinematography and John Maybury's direction. They seem to understand that no matter how good the story or how historic Thomas is, it's a movie dominated by two great actresses of our time. And they cherish their scenes with beautiful shots. Although not the best picture material, it is a very good movie (much more encouraging than "The Dutchess"). It has a visual lyric that emphasizes the use of Thomas's poetry. This is clearly Knightley's second best performance of her career, and perhaps Miller's best. <br /> <br /> I've always had a weakness for the Artist, whether it's Hulce's Mozart or Hoffman's Capote. But I was amazed at how little sympathy I felt for Dylan Thomas. His battle with alcohol is known. But his antagonism of William and Caitlin to possess his first love makes him out to be a bad man. <br /> <br /> So is this academy award worthy? Not clear. At least not this year. It is released in March 2009 and does not qualify for the Academy. It was 9 months after it was released in Britain. Between Reconciliation, Miss. Pettigrew, and Brideshead Revisited, had the USA fill its World War II World War II. Sorry. This movie is better than the other, except reconciliation. But in this one Knightley's soldier comes back, but as a shell of the man who left her.
