This is the Australian TV series. It's a classic. The stories and actors are excellent. Who can forget Picker and his gramophone or Chet? This is cult TV. The Australian actors in the series were the best of their day and have immortality in The Outsiders. What can I say timeless adventure? The music and song are just fantastic. The closing credits that start with the rounding of the wheel, then Keir is sleeping around and then the long shot just doesn't get much better. All 13 episodes are equally solid in the portrayal of the Australian myth and I think that's what this series has. No matter the two main characters from overseas, I think it's the key to the series and why it's so good.
