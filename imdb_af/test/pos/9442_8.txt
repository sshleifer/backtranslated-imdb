If you want to frighten people, choose the devil as your subject. After all, a good part of the population believes that he really is. Therefore, you commit a whole fleshly swathe of existing religious and mythological images. And it will cause quite a few nightmares in your young audience. <br /> <br /> This episode had all the appearance of a Hollywood star. In fact, after watching it, I went to another channel that played a recent Bond movie and couldn't honestly split a hair between the differences in SFX. With a minimal throw, limited by his situation at a space station; Complete with overwhelming panoramic views of an imposing universe, it was as claustrophobic and intense as Alien of Event Horizon. The black hole outside made it feel as if the black hole's weight of dark matter was pushing the station on the planet and all that was sealed inside. And as the horror is exacerbated by the knowledge that Dr and Rose are stranded, the sinister Ood begins to channel a disapproved voice and then the characters begin to pick one by one. <br /> <br /> It has everything The best features of the cream of this new Dr are trying; Girl in the fireplace and the empty child. Emotionally engaging, frightening and humorous all without apparent cheese. It's much scarcer than any number of flying Daleks. But should it be asked, is it really suitable for children? It's not a family-friendly episode. Be sorry for the poor parent who is going to sleep their children after this one. I'm not sure I even want to see what happens next!
