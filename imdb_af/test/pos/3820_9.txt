I caught this show several times when I was young and it was on the side, my parents loved it and now in syndication I feel what they feel. This show did what the original borders and twilight zone (old and old) couldn't do. This show used some old ideas and some real original ideas. <br /> <br /> I still can't believe Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright did it. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show entrenched the audience in the story and set a real and terrible atmosphere. That's not there in the new twilight zone. Rod serling comes in scarce, bush comes in the mood. <br /> <br /> The end or good or bad is made for a frightening time. You can never predict what will happen. I'm still finding the seasons on DVD.
