OK, if you're not a fan of the very low budget horror genre, don't bother it. You really have to be a fan to get the gag. <br /> <br /> The move is basically over snakes. On a train. Many of them. <br /> <br /> There's an old curse involved and a crazy end I didn't spoil. The gore effect is full and actually good ... but the movie is mainly one big gagga about snakes scaring hell out of the forest. <br /> <br /> The tension is built up. Well, there are some memorable and well-composed scenes. Some of the plays are a bit hammy (look for the surf dudes), but that's not really the point ... Give this movie a go. Know what to expect and you won't regret it!
