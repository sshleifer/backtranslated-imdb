I agree that this movie was spectacular. The way Jamie caught Foxx, not just the impression of Ray Charles, but the essence of Ray Charles really made the movie. His life has made a wonderful story and it is good that it is finally told. I also have a great interview with Jamie Foxx about this role played by Ernie Manouse of InnerVIEWS on KUHT, Houston Channel 8. The link is http: //video.google.com/ videoplay?

I encourage everyone to look for it, as it gives in depth, look at what went into his role and his personal feelings about Ray Charles. The only problem I can mention with the movie is that the shotting style was pretty fine at times, but I think it helped to make the story more realistic and focused on the person, Ray Charles, rather than the movie. Ray.
