It's a movie by Oshima, the director of the infamous "In The Realm Of The Senses", a movie so sexually charged and unashamedly controversial, having been banned for a while. This film was originally held in Japan in 1895 and dies the very beautiful Keziko Yoshiyuki as Seki, the wife of a rickshaw driver who falls to a much younger man who inhabits her in kind. That man, Toyoji, comes to her as she sleeps and seduces her, although she is rather willing to be deceived soon. Soon they have an affair and plot to kill Seki's husband, to be together forever. They do and throw him a well. However, they were not hoping for the ghost of the dead man who was Seki and others in town! This film is visually amazing, the use of shadows that emphasizes this story of murder for passion. Me. Yoshiyuki (who is active as an actress) is especially good at her role. It is sometimes sexual, but not like "In the kingdom of the senses". Some of what follows is for our imagination. I found this movie to have a consistency of mood that makes it very viewable. A little creepy but it goes with the area. I would recommend it.
