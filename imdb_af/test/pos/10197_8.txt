As a fan of robocop, I always loved this movie. I saw it when it first came out, and eventually I bought it on DVD from Brazil. It has never been released to us on DVD. I like the movie, but like everything else in this world, everyone has their opinion, it loves or hates it. No matter what a movie is, someone will always say, "Why didn't they do it differently?" In other words, you can't all please. If you like robocop, you will love this movie. For me, it's so unique it's not cheesy, or stupid like a much lower budget movie. this movie always kept me interested. I can see some scenes borrowed from here, but tell me which movies don't do that? many movies use other ideas from other movies and sometimes change them. nice movie!
