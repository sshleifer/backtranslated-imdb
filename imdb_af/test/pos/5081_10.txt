I think it was the most outstanding zip-of-your-seat I've ever seen. The research for the film was thorough, author Kelly Sane left no loose ends. The role-play was seasoned (fantastic performances all around). Omar Metwally was excellent. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is denser, music enchanting and the overall effect highly satisfactory. <br /> <br /> The transition goes into the area that even the media fears. This is really a wakeup call for those involved in espionage and the legal web that is the "War on Terror". <br /> <br /> A woman walked out of the theater and asked me, "Does it really happen?" It speaks for itself of Gavin Hood's masterful performance.
