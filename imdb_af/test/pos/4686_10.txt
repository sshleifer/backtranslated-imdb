The biggest compliments to the other commentator here at IMDb, who asked himself why this series did not "catch" in time, did much longer than many other series in the 80s. <br /> <br /> That is not true, the series would have been worse if it continued. <br /> <br /> At the end of my comment, I'll put some thoughts on the other movie realizations, rather: Robin Hood legend attempts. <br /> <br /> First of all, Robert Addie (Gisburne), you are among us all, you live forever. <br /> <br /> Nothing is as nice as the two, if you like, three seasons of this absolutely unique range. And at the same time totally agree with the latest and revolutionary findings of Terry Jones's history documentation on Egypt, Greece, Rome, Constantinople, Goths and Barbarians, and the Middle Ages and Crusades (... yes, the monthly Python-Terry Jones): <br /> <br /> If you've seen those brilliant and funny Jones Docs, you'll understand better, all the historical backgrounds, Carpenter, the author of the Robin of Sherwood series (what happens to be John's brother Carpenter, who made The Thing, their third brother makes music, which tells us. <br /> <br /> The writer of Dick Turpin, Catweazle and the first two seasons of "Robin of Sherwood", called "Chicken" Carpenter, are my movie master. He's better than anyone else who criticizes his "sword-and-magic" element or "defect" (taken from the Robin of Sherwood Webring) of this series (which I can't see) or other unfounded criticism on which there There was a lot back and forth. <br /> <br /> Therefore, if you get to know this "Robin of Sherwood" better, you'll be serious. You will be off for the third season. Not only that: I went through it myself and in the first two seasons I only recorded in my deepest heart - DESPITE the fact that Robin's actor, Praed, has left this series, because after the series has been very successful, he presented a probably better paid role in an absolutely ridiculous Canadian series called "The New Adeventures of Jules Verne". The title shows all the emptiness of the entire project. Praed went money, and not known, he did not stand with his gang and family. I mean: actors. <br /> <br /> Actors representing the consecutive personal, known in our present day and legendary faces and characters of the Robin Legend. The potential of this series can and must be left much more without any humiliating level of content and historical message and rebellious accuracy with respect to current political issues. Again, compelled to say: A change of the lead role was forced by Praed's stupid decision to leave Robin from Sherwood for a stupid remake series of Verne stories and brilliantly woven into filming the story. Yet, in some respects, it is a disaster. <br /> <br /> In any case: If one is informed of this, and that Connery may have been advertised by his father, but that the young Connery is NOT "", how I thought in the first place , you can definitely enjoy the 3rd season, unfortunately, the writing is no longer written by Superman Kip Carpenter, so we no longer have the critical and liberating historical background such as "The Hitch or Elsdon" or "The King's Fool" ", two episodes of the first series that A) are funny, B) historically educated and C) brilliantly acted. === <br /> <br />" Don't trust the Lion! "<br /> <br /> Unlike many other characters who wanted to kill him for their own power, Richard Lionheart, as shown in RoS and as in real history, was a greater authority than John or others, but only used for his evil idea of ​​the crusade and the war against Normandy in France He has slaughtered and has many more than ten thousands of Christians, Muslims and Jews slaughtered the "clouds" crusades, and his soldiers even devoured the children who threw them out of hunger or poverty. In addition, after its arrest by the Saracens (Muslims), Britain was pushed into crusades for its ransom, 100,000 points (at that time of the 11th century, comparable to about 30 billion - 30,000,000 .- Dollars of present value), to get him back safely, and then he only visited England for a month to return to Normandy (in France, where Norman Invaders first went) for the crusades (one learns in the episode "The King's Fool"). For this new crusade, probably a revenge for his capture, Richard Lionheart once again "land of money" (quoted from Clive Mantle's mouth, when he gives Robin lectures to be critical of even the king). Robin criticizes this warfare, Richard's disobedient judgment, he addresses Richard himself and says to him: "The poor have given everything to release you, how can you ask more of them?" - Richard: "... give me your courage and power, not your words!" ... Later, in private, Richard orders Robin's assassination ... <br /> <br /> So, the crusaders were the real "barbarian". <br /> <br /> PS: Already when I watched Kostner in 91, I was upset because after the weeks I learned in the school's history course that Richard was not such a good man as Sean Connery appeared in his appearance at the end of the "Prince of the Thieves". Well, as Terry Jones would say: It's a lie, a treacherous lie! "Sean plays humorous and charismatic, and his son does a better job than expected in the third season of Robin or Sherwood. <br /> <br /> Weather: Praed is according to my information so far the one that Sherwood leaving for a stupid Verne series, no one with brain, will ever remember or want to remember.
