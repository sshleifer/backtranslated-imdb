First they came to the Communists, and I did not speak, because I was not a Communist. Then they came to the Jews, and I did not speak, because I was not a Jew. Then they came to the Catholics, and I didn't speak, because I was a Protestant. Then they came to me, and by then there was no one left to talk to me. <br /> <br /> attributed to Rev. Martin Niemoller, 1945 <br /> <br /> When it comes to intolerance or injustice, the easiest thing to do is nothing - talk and you run the risk of being mocked. But when is enough enough? Global anti-Semitic sentiments allowed Hitler's genocide to flourish, and equal doses of fear and ignorance made it possible for the anti-communist exchange of McCarthyism to destroy thousands of people's lives. Negligence makes one less punishable. <br /> <br /> Lawrence Newman is a chameleon of a man: silently and indescribably, he blends effortlessly with his environment. Lawrence doesn't like to get involved - when he sees an attack on a young woman, he tells no one and goes over his business. His world spirals in the chaos when he buys some glasses, and is wrong for one of them. Lawrence's view of the world and his view of him has changed forever. <br /> <br /> While the subject of this movie is not new, its offering is definitely unique. It is much easier to understand the irrational nature of prejudice when it is placed within a certain context - Lawrence is more concerned about the assumptions that he is Jewish than he is with the views of his attackers. He believes that if he corrects this "oversight" that everything will be right, do not realize that logic and prejudice never go hand in hand. <br /> <br /> Whether you're playing a twilight (the only thing I liked "Fargo") or a nice old sheriff, William H. Macy's roles, is linked by a common thread - she characters share a subtle, deliberate face that gives them substance. Macy nails Lawrence to the tiniest detail, and says more with a furtive look or shake in his voice as a page of dialogue. By showing, rather than telling, Lawrence is able to share his fear and confusion with the viewer. The supporting film brings the story together. <br /> <br /> Laura Dern is compelling as Gerty, Lawrence's bomber, with a past. Forerunner park rugged, but also other worldly way, she also felt the wrath of bias due to a mistake and unconsciously exacerbated the situation of Lawrence. Michael Lee Aday (aka "Meatloaf") is frightening as Fred, the prototypical redneck next door, equal parts ignorance and poison, who confess neighbors for his virulent cause. In the midst of chaos, Finklestein (David Paymer) is the focus of aggression, and the voice of reason that addresses the important questions. Paymer's self-evident depiction keeps Finklestein from a stereotype or someone whose only purpose is to create sympathy, and make one of the strongest performances in the film. <br /> <br /> The sleek editing and meticulous cinematography makes for a clean picture with little distraction and blends an air of claustrophobia into the small town of USA - it is at the same time comforting and disturbing. The deliberate use of hard two-color lighting to accentuate the malicious aspects of the play and the carefully spoken soundtrack is powerful without being overwhelming. Ultimately, the set and costume designs make the sense of the era again, an essential component in the message of the movie. <br /> <br /> 'Focus'' unconventional approach in dealing with bias is reason enough to recommend this movie. Just think of the great story, solid acting and watching the movie as bonuses.
