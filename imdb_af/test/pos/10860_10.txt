I have nothing but praise for this mini-series. It's only about a year and a half, but I've seen it twice; with greater enjoyment the second time than the first. I think it again seriously to see it again, as I lift it up spiritually. <br /> <br /> It is a very gentle romantic drama with such beautiful performances, sets, costumes, music and scenes that resonate that almost put it in a mini-league of its own. <br /> <br /> Some others commented on the difficulty of living as a lesbian in Britain in the 1890s. Nothing about this difficult; It was just male homosexuality that was against the law, as poor Oscar Wilde experienced to his great expense and as a great loss to the literary world. Anyway, I double. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it is essential television. It may have been one of the greatest tragic romantic plays since Romeo and Juliet, but not in the conventional sense. <br /> <br /> 10 out of 10 of me. <br /> <br /> JMV
