It was sounding. I just couldn't look away. As the film rolled up, I began to feel it was powerful and confrontational, but I didn't know how much more intense it would get. <br /> <br /> The movie gives insight into what unfortunately everyday life is for many school children. Some of us live outside that environment and will walk and do not know what happens. Parents should watch this movie in particular, just to have a look at what their children are going through. Often, parents reject their childhood problems as trivial, but unfortunately it is massive for a high school. And unfortunately the problems can escalate into a tragedy. <br /> <br /> Definitely one has to see everyone.
