I watched this movie back in 1981 when it came out. Although I was great at the first part of the movie I saw, it was wonderful. This movie is hard to find, but if you found it, you should see it. The acting is wonderful. very credible sad film. If I ever get a copy, I'll definitely buy a copy to treasure.
