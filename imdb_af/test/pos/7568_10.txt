Zeke Rippy (Mic) is wonderful, you believe his character completely. And it's scary like hell, I spent half of the film over my eyes, the other half at the edge of my seat. It's cool to see something that is exciting and scary, it's not all blood and gut - but it has given me bad dreams. <br /> <br /> Basically, it's a good movie - see it the first chance you get.
