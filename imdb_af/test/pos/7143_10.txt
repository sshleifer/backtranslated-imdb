Easily one of my favorite dramatic TV movies, in many ways, beautiful but sad, heartwarming and exciting. It is an excellent dramatization of a few years in the life of C.S. Lewis and his relationship with Joy Davidman. I found it to be incredibly absorbing with excellent and 'realistic' dialogue and situations. It was all 'really', but there were also 'magical' moments that almost gave you breath with joy. Ackland and Bloom as the central characters were excellent as well as the supporting role. It's one of those hard-to-find dramas, just because there's nothing to be criticized for. It works just as well on so many levels. Highly recommended.
