It's a good movie, a must own. I really liked every aspect of it, from the sword fight, the romance, the costumes were really well done and put together. The scenery is absolutely beautiful. I also loved the secret and magic. Also, the message of the power of love, love is the greatest power there is. I really like the heart of the king in that he desires peace instead of bloodshed and hatred. I wish I could live in such a world with flying ships, to castles in the sky. I also think it was really nice how they brought the animals into the movie. I also thought the cook was really funny. I watched it many times and never tired of it. I just wish they'd put it on a DVD.
