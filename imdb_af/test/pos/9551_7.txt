Man, I really enjoyed it, even though it was only for Fred Willard's comment at the dog show. There are a few dead spots and a few gags that don't work, but overall the film works very well. When I was younger, my parents bred dogs and the people I met were not significantly less bizarre. The freaks at this show, I can assure you. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed this movie for his artwork. and for his comments on how we tend to take infallible things too seriously ... I enjoyed the acting for its accuracy (most of the accents were flawless) and its subtlety (I have the way everyone walked their dogs) beloved ... <br /> <br /> Rent this movie if you have any appreciation for the strangeness of human existence.
