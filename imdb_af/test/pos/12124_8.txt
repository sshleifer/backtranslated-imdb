First, let me say it's probably in my opinion one of the 10 most underrated movies, as it came out in 72. I absolutely loved this movie, it is very urban, eager, no real Hollywood glamor added to it. You can actually feel for all the characters in this, I like the blood that just splashes in it. Joe Pesci was pretty good here, but it seems he has been eliminated by the lead character Joe Cortese. Now I don't know anything about him, but he can really act. I believe this movie is probably true, because you live in New Jersey, live near Philly, you're here this sort of thing. I think if the movie has a bigger budget, and says Robert deniro as Jerry's boss, you would have a perfect movie, but hey, who should I argue, I was so worried about this movie that it's been there in me thoughts, with middle streets. I wish Hollywood would go back to this urbanized, eager show of filmmaking: it will serve them well to do so. This movie is a great drama with great actors in it. and I recommend it to everyone.
