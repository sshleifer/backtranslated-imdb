Both Jackie and Candice are great in this movie. They are well suited to their roles and have several chances to shine. In particular, the way Candice expresses the words "Puerto Rican" is very funny, as she is friendly, as she can be accommodating at the same time. I saw the original of this movie, "Old Acquaintance", starring Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins. They did not come together, so because the movie is about female friendship, it may have been a problem. Here the actresses admire each other and respect each other. Heart Bochner and Meg Ryan have supportive parts and are both excellent, especially Bochner, who has never had many proper parts in movies. George Cukor didn't make a movie afterwards, so it was a good one to go out.
