It is not difficult to watch this movie as the silence of the Soviet film takes place in so little critical respect. Don't get me wrong. The taps fly, are highly entertaining for the first half and have a light touch completely unexpectedly from his country of origin. a fresh, fast, spacious technique that eventually irritates as much as it initially charms; two beautiful subjective sets; and a romantic lure flirting with, but never quite in the Lelouch area. It's just that, in the subdivision of great social, national and world events into a love affair, it's essentially different from a conventional Hollywood movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, in a Soviet state highlighting the state above all, and in an era (World War II) that suppressed individualism and freedom to maintain murderous symbolism, this foreground of two attractive young lovers a relief. And the thematic similarities - all the love that is rented apart - with two of the most wonderful of all films (SEVEN HEAVEN, LES PARAMELES DE CHERBOURG), also adds to the potential love ability. <br /> <br /> The story is simple enough. Boris, a young factory worker of a bright medical and artistic family, and Veronika, a student, performs a great relationship at night, their only free time. Boris's cousin Mark, a composer, also looks at Veronika. When the Nazis invaded Russia, Boris volunteered in the secrets of his family and lover. He promised to write to Veronika, but never did, thinking she might not be bothered to see him, or maybe the post was simply unreliable. Veronika's parents die during a flight, and she moves with Boris's family and helps at the hospital where his father tends to be wounded soldiers. <br /> <br /> Veronika by Boris's silence also attacked Veronika by the attention of Mark, who obtained military duty exemption by circumventing a local official. She is eventually broken down and marries him to the disapproval of her adopted family. Boris is now being killed in action. Veronika, disgusted with herself and an adulterous Mark, refuses to believe it and waits for his return, promoting a young being who bears his name. <br /> <br /> The title refers to the birds who see the couple knowing about them, symbolically perhaps of their transcendent, epiphanoic power. But it is illusory - the taps fly in a V-shape, and this form penetrates the entire film through the geometric shapes of buildings, interiors, exteriors, groupings of people, composition, camera angles, heroine's name - or by editing in which Feet that run south in one story is met by feet that run southeast in another. <br /> <br /> It captures the lovers who do not have control over their fate and also suggests Stalinist power that is never specifically mentioned in the film. Although the pair seems to be freely in space, either literally in an unoccupied environment or privileged in generous close-ups, they are always hysterized, minimized, torn apart - by circumstances, families, by masses (see brilliant if obvious, sequences where Veronika is engulfed by tanks, or the couple fail to meet in large crowds), or merely through the film's structure, which is constantly distancing through paralellism, their closeness. Although the lightness and brightness of the style at the beginning represent a beautiful romantic idyll, it is continually broken by strange modifications or camera angles of distracting snatches of music. <br /> <br /> What is remarkable is how it obstructs Romance by abstract rather than emphasizing historical powers. The whole movie, but especially the war itself, is strangely unreal and dreamy. We are never shown his hard, cruel reality, just his effects on the lovers. In fact, it is transformed into a majestic spectacle, without nasty Germans. <br /> <br /> On the home front, the air strikes create nice effects of light and shadow, or ruins of almost Gothic decadence. In the bunker, the threat to the Soviet empire is less important than Boris's perceptible indifference. The empty, ironic Moscow spaces, whose lovers initially, as Veronika with her mother, walk, are less real places than emotional spaces. <br /> <br /> When Mark tries to force him to Veronika, the air raid is less a destructive reality than a symbolic release of sexual and emotional frustrations. It's a brilliant sequence, filmed with silent, expressionist terror, bursting with hysteria and violence, all the more compelling for the earlier scene's fickleness. <br /> <br /> It's not much different At the front too, where fights over girls' honor is, is urgent as tactics, Nazis or despair. The movement of Boris and his wounded comrade to a final space is a further summary of the experience of war, its setting in a forest that gives it a sexual dynamic. and Boris's final, pre-dead flashback is an extraordinary blend of dream gratification and increased anxiety, which is longing and threatening. <br /> <br /> From this point on, the movie becomes a little less interesting, slightly more obvious. Another gripe for expressionist overload - Veronika's attempt at suicide and her baby's rescue - is clumsy; and her bleak guilt throws a crippling shadow over the whole movie. The use of the deep focus, with the first surprise, is soon to be worn, without any moral power or meaning put into use by Welles. After what seems to be a silent, clever criticism of totalitarianism in favor of the individual cruelly at the end, when individual suffering, as so often in Russian art, is conveyed in symbolic (ie, sexless, inhuman) hope. Pity.
