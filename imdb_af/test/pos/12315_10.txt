In print, this is one of the greatest short stories ever written. It's brilliant and poetic on the screen of this couple's team. Unfortunately, it works together for the first and last time. It is fitting that John Huston should end his career on a high note by bringing the work of one of his favorite writers to the screen, which is easily the best Joyce screen adjustment. Huston has made a career to adapt large works of literature to film, usually reasonably successful. It's sad, and somewhat mysterious, that Tony Huston almost started and ended his career in film by adapting what would be his father's final project and picking up a well-deserved Oscar nomination in the process. <br /> <br /> Earlier, I had the privilege of being in the company of the great screenwriter / playwright Horton Foote, who named this film as one of his favorites in recent years (at the time it was quite fairly recent version). As a confident writer himself (and a brilliant screen adapter of his own works, as well as great writers such as Faulkner, Steinbeck and Harper Lee), he was obviously impressed with Tony Huston's first attempt, and possibly as surprised by his lack of output ever since. . If anyone has insights to share the subject, I would be interested to hear more.
