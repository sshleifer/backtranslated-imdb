Jack Webb finally gives something except his usual wooden Indian display. He played the chapter of the cross, brainpower, storm the beaches, semper fi, bean hat military idiot. The Corps for all others, even humanity. This big movie has shown the idiosyncrasy of the boat camp to its fullest. 4 stars.
