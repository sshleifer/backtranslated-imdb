After reading a biography of the last Russian Tzar (Nicholas II) and his failure to ensure the army's support, I decided to try this movie. <br /> <br /> I watched it with a completely open mind, not <br /> <br /> These are the things that impressed me the most. <br /> <br /> 1) The shots of field ships, and the soldiers use as extras. More than once I stopped thinking "if it was done at this time and place, 80% of this computer would be generated." <br /> <br /> 2) Realism in it. From the spicy meat to the sailor's lap with its candle and legend "Death for a soup bowl", this movie makes no concessions to the PC cause (unfortunately not yet invented). <br /> 3) The slow descent in madness of the Odessa steps sequence. From the first shot, when the petty man appears, you get the idea that something can be wrong; As the overall shots are made up, you finally get comfortable in your area. Then an official appears and people start to fall dramatically. Yet the shots are composed ... until the Cossacks appear in the scene, and the incredible shot adjustments appear. This scene is easily the admission price. <br /> <br /> 4) The fact that this movie is 100% unrelated propaganda. Then again, when Rambo fought in Afghanistan, he had something to do with "propaganda"; just another kind. <br /> <br /> Overall: A movie surprised by a bit of a slow story. Yet, Metropolis, the cabinet of dr. Caligari and this movie are perfect examples of inventive, edgy movies that are still remembered for their merit today. They really make the modern movies look dull and repetitive.
