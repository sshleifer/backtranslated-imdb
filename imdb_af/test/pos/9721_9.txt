It's been years since I've seen these shows. I look for years for anyone else who has seen or knows something about them. I thought I made them up. The one I remember most is the soldier and death. I want to ask movie fanatics if they have seen it, and call it a Jim Henson and people have not yet known. These are good fables. I was very young when I was, not even 10, and it left a lasting impression on my life and beliefs. I would recommend someone to see it, just remember they are from the 80's, so they don't look like the movies today. just give them a shot. Jim Henson was far away from his time and died early.
