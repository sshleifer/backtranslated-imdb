First of all, I want to say that most people who give it a bad review don't like this kind of comedy, the movie is great if you have an open mind and are not afraid to laugh at some stupid things. <Br /> <br /> This movie was shot just like the TV program with very short clips composed in one long film. Some of the screens don't even have dialogue, someone will just get out and do something unexpected and it's funny !! The only negative I had was that I lost money on my popcorn and ice. There was no way I could eat or drink anything during this movie I constantly laughed at. I was frankly nervous about drinking a few Icee and seeing something that caused me to laugh and shoot it all over. <br /> <br /> If you do not enjoy a male celebrity, and you enjoy Jackass the movie, Jackass the TV show, and viva la bam, then for your sake this movie will see. <br /> <br /> And if you don't like the first movie or TV show. Don't see it, and if you see it, it won't put a bad review on it. Hardcore Christians who see it and bash it just don't look right.
