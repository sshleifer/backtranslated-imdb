A love story reminiscent of 'In the mood for love'. Through great drawings of Chinese poetry and how it is used by eastern people to communicate feelings, the story focuses on a teacher who wants to be as much as a model teacher, as well as a good man and father. A senior student is very attracted to him. As the story unfolds, we see the emotions below the surface in his 20-year marriage and how he wrestles with the moral dilemmas facing him. A beautiful and moving story.
