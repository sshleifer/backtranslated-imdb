William Shakespeare's plays are classified as comedy, tragedy or history. Some of his most memorable - and most often read - creations give us voluptuous humor, soft poetry and hilarious slapstick. Some of them survive as memorable dramas of compelling depth and gravity. Regardless, he could write with unparalleled skill and ingenuity, and contributes greatly to our young language. So in what category is The Merchant of Venice? I was very surprised to find this one of Shakespeare's comedies. I've never read or seen it yet, but after watching this latest movie, I decided it wasn't and it's both. This is one of the many questions the viewer must try to answer when it comes to what is clearly a confusing and deeply disturbing moral tragedy. <br /> <br /> The players are quickly and easily introduced. One of them, first of all, is Venice itself; director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes in the real city and made an impressive live backdrop for the drama's proceedings. To enter this landscape, young Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), returns to Venice to see a dear old friend, Antonio (Jeremy Irons). Poor Bassanio seems to have heard of a princess whose father died and left any potential writer of all sorts. Waiting at the honest lady's estate is three small suitcases, <br /> <br /> of which only one of the princess's images. He who guesses the right one, with only blind intuition and the cryptic teasers written on them, will be given the father's great fortune for life. Oh, and his daughter and her eternal love in marriage, I forgot to mention. Here, the light comedy of Shakespeare takes over the film. This obscurant plot element drives the story and also fills in much of the film's screenplay, as a number of painfully eager opportunists arrive on the island, striving humorously and failing to earn this very rich hand in marriage. But before any of these things happen, Bassanio is much lacking in finance. Antonio suggests borrowing three thousand ducats to pay for the long journey he has to take to get his shot on the prize. <br /> <br /> Antonio, himself almost petty, must embrace indifferent embrace by seeking the financial help of Shylock (Al Pacino), one of countless Jewish providers who keep the slacking economy going, nevertheless despised and persecuted . the city's zealous Christian majority. So they live in society's underbelly, and it is here that the two borrowers must go. Shylock did not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident where Antonio insulted him in the city market and spat on him. He argues this man with pride who has a lot of nerve to ask for help now. But help him with Shylock. He even wipes out any interest on the loan, probably because he has no reason to worry if Antonio can repay him within three months. Still, Shylock's one contractual question is a pound of Antonio's flesh, he must return to their deal. This is a disturbing request, certainly for Antonio and Bassanio as well as for us. But it seems that Shylock, despite his fair pride, doesn't really expect such an abominable act to happen. <br /> <br /> Here is the dramatic groundwork laid. And while the movie goes down to explore its softer side with its love lottery and erroneous identities, there's still the bleak prospect of the loan itself. In the end, what will become of this ominous agreement? Meanwhile, we turn to explore the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has a lot of dramatic weight to carry here, and he does it with convincing grit and passion. There are times when he gets the room for the drama we expected from such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are those in which he energizes this energy, which shows a conflicting personality: honest, sincere, and proud, but fraternal, revengeful and completely relentless. This is one of Pacino's most up-to-date performances to date. And while the rest of the actors play their credit and convincingly, it is Pacino who really owns the movie - especially at the end, when Shakespeare generates this seemingly romantic comedy with a mop of a third act. <br /> <br /> I won't reveal much here; All I can say is that it involves the initial loan - a mighty shoe expected to fall sooner or later. And do it ever. By the end, Shakespeare raised a number of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly insoluble questions of faith, morality, law and grace are thrown before us by the final scenes, and while the playwright's position is near the author's place, it seems some are completely abandoned. There are winners and losers in this one, but did the winners earn their prizes for good reason, or did they lose in a larger sense too? Are virtues rewarded or simply disregarded? Is justice really fair this time? At the end of the play, some efforts are painfully clear and unambiguously sealed. But the audience must be the ones who definitely decide the decision for everyone involved. And for some the verdict is also out for the play. Comedy or tragedy? The author has transparently covered the intense courtroom finals with an end to light joy and pat romantic decisions. Does he say that everything is good that ends well, or is it his final, ironic conviction? The play of the drama serves to set us so fine. And while it also unfortunately holds the Venice merchant to gain the greatness of so many of Shakespeare's other works, it is still entertaining, amusing and thoughtful.
