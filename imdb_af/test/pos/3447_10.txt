I have a couple of mr. Boorman's movies seen and didn't like many of them. Not that they are bad movies, but the opposite is good movies, but not content I personally experienced. But I think where the heart is, but made to conform to the less-than-art-capable American audience, is masterful than satire, and as social commentary on the times in which it was made. I had to replace this movie in my collection at least half a dozen times, because every time I lend it to someone, I can appreciate it at all levels of artworks, my copy fails to come back to me, lol. The last time it took 7 years to replace it as it was not sold for the sale of VHS. It has never been made as a DVD I know of and had to wait for one of the premium cable channels to run before I could paste it again. <br /> <br /> My favorite aspect of the social commentary on the nail-on-the-head is the paintings by Timna Woollard. I have been looking for 15 years to find someone or anywhere that can lead me to where her work is available. Or better yet another copy of the paintings in the movie without the final credits about their role. I have a room in my house that I dedicated to posting copies of her paintings, and no one seems to know if it has ever been released as a coffee table book, or video aquarium, or as a documentary of her work. If someone knows where I can get a copy of Timna's work or where her studio is in England, please do not hesitate to contact me by email.
