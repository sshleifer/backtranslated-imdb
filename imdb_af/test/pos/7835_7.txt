Let's get one thing straight, it doesn't get a 7 out of 10 on a normal scale, but out of the bad movie scale. It's the kind of movie you're deliberately renting, where you deliberately go into knowing it's a horrible knockoff and being affected by everyone else. <br /> <br /> I went with one promise from the movie, that there will be snakes on a train and deliver it! <br /> <br /> The gore itself is really good, and the characters have wonderful roles. Come on, it has everything from stoned train pilots to teenage girls dealing with drugs, even an Electrical Engineer gets his pimp! You get some topless nudity, explosions, snakes, gore and a Mexican chief running to heal his girlfriend by hitting his crack pipe and blowing the smoke in her face !! As I mentioned and many others have, the movie pacing is a bit off but respectful. <br /> <br /> Movies like this, keep our group tradition together to tie together and cut everyone into a buck or two to watch masterpieces like this. There can be no better time to come together to enjoy a good bad movie. <br /> <br /> It may be a thing or two of others like such fine movies like Alien Lock-down or Boa vs Python, but these are some great shoes to fill. <br /> <br /> A solid 7 out of 10.
