I watched this movie on a night, I couldn't sleep, I loved it and looked to find out when it would be again, probably the best movie I've ever seen, and even now the movie is full of people I have never seen before, but it looks like a true life story based on NYC. This is the kind of movie that elevates the viewing pleasure, because you see it, hear it and feel it is from the moment I drink Wirey and watch the game, I thought what it should be like without a dad. be. There are so many lines of this movie that I use daily, like "the personal only time" in the bathroom that drinks a 7-11 drink, LARGE MOVIE
