A young theater actress accepts her first big part in a play like Lady Macbeth, due to the accident of the production's diva falling in front of a moving car. Betty (Christina Marsillach), who has succeeded, finds himself instead of abomination because the one responsible for her to this point satisfies her in cruel ways. <br /> <br /> First, her stage manager's boyfriend, Stefano (William McNamara) was stabbed with a knife while she was looking, tied to a pillar in his uncle's big house. She keeps her eyes from the end, thanks to needles cut under her eyes, with a rash as she shines. To let her escape, Betty finds her again in this unfortunate position when a specific gold chain is found on her Lady Macbeth wardrobe which was torn by the madman after killing a series of crows escaping from their cage in the equipment room has. , by the clothes designer who was first hit with an iron on the floor and then stabbed with scissors (to hide from this nasty scene, the chain falls into her throat as the killer opens her throat to find it While not specifically doing this action, Dario uses the scissors clip for optimal effect with the camera, which often returns to the victim's dead face. Inspector Alan Santini (Urbano Barberini, who gives him cold and greasy on Dario's request has promised to catch the psycho as Betty relies on her few remaining friends for consolation, theater director Marco (Ian Charleson, GHANDI & CHARIOTS OR Fire who would later die from AIDS. A sad footnote, Dario interviewed revealed that Charleson introduced him to be HIV-positive at the end of the shoot, the attempt to make the stage after a successful horror film career, despite being criticized by Mira (Daria Nicolodi, Dario's former squeeze, her agent and confident. But the serial killer was reasonably driven and an appearance between them would, of course, take place in the theater, as Marco made an interesting change in production using the crows at his disposal. <br /> <br /> I think it's Dario on his most brutal and nihilistic. Although he later made gruesome movies. (As she would suggest Masters of Horror Enrollments and SLEEPLESS), this film is really the forefront of pure violence against the victims of the psychopath. His method of forcing Betty to look was admittedly a ghost by Dario about the kind of audience who would like to look away from the more horrific parts of horror movies. Every time I rub my eyes every time she just had to cut. Dario shoots from the point of view to get a painful effect from our perspective as if we were the one with the screwed needles holding our eyes open. ). I love how Dario will see Betty's widened eyes, horrible about what she is forced to watch, as little blood breaks down the needles when she has no choice but shines. The photographic work of Ronnie Taylor is impeccable, like the crow's point of view in the theater at the end as it searches for the killer. Or, when the camera "travels" through rooms in the theater to the killer who wants to see his cap from a box seat. Or the dream series where we are taken in Betty's memory of an event about her mother's death by a certain killer, gives the same mask and gloves as the one that causes her trauma at the moment. The highlight, in my opinion, is the crosshole bullet fire sequence, masterfully performed by everyone involved, as the camera follows a bullet shooting through the eye of a victim, exploding from the back of her head, going through a phone Betty is planning to use to ask for help. We even get a crow throwing the eyeball of the killer (to add to this evil scene, the crow is shown with the eyeball rolling in the bill). Only thing I didn't care about is often the offspring of the movie, the "final" end that I personally felt unnecessary, but I think Dario wanted to point out that Betty was not like her mother, a woman with sadomasochistic tendencies related to why the killer is worried about our heroine. The rock music used during the violent scenes did not bother me, because I felt that those moments of bad graphic attacks needed a frightening swing that heavy metal could often offer.
