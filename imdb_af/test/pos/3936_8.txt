The revelation here is Lana Turner's dance ability. Although she was privately known to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer, Miss Turner rarely had the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on film. <br /> <br /> So, viewers take note! Here, MGM clearly tried to figure out how they would develop the still young starlet, so they transferred her from Andy Hardy to Doctor Kildaire for everything. <br /> <br /> In "Two Girls on Broadway," but she gets an excellent opportunity to show off her native rhythm and ability to pace the cute production number, "My Wonderful, Let's Dance." Designed and filmed, as a kind of hybrid between a Busby Berkely style and the kind of routines Hermes Pan designed for Astaire and Rogers at RKO. <br /> <br /> So, the number starts with George. Murphy and Miss Turner portrayed as bartenders (with full chorus) in front of a black-lame curtain in which Mr. Murphy the number to me. Turner twists. Then the camera (on a sprout) pulls back in a remarkable crane lap to display an enormous stage and a rotating set equipped with steps, columns, fencing and sliding walls. <br /> <br /> From this point, Murphy and Turner perform a quick variety of moods and attitudes, including lifts, spins, soft shoe and ending with an electrifying series of configured pirouettes ending with Murphy, both excitement and rotating gymnast with speeding speed at a racing club. <Br /> <br /> Everyone has told a dizzying feat, which proves to me. Turner was fully able to hold her own as a dancer, although I would have liked most of her admirers to give her away from her throne as the queen of melodrama.
