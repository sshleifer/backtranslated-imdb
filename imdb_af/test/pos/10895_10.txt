Gold simply Goldeneye is the biggest N64 game to date. The learning curve is about perfect, and you play it with your friends for months, as the multiplayer mode is no less exceptional. <br /> <br /> The one-time cheats acquisition system requires a degree of skill, rather than just knowing which buttons to print, and the challenge of Aztec at 00 agent level is amazing. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is the best game I've ever played on the N64.
