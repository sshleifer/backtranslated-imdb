It's easy to see why many people in the Mood for Love are considered Wong Kar-Wai's best movie. The performance of the film, which is placed on the studied view of a relationship, is addressed by an emotional ringer. It bounces back into the Happy Together territory, but without the hyper-kinetic patchwork of movie film supplies and hyper saturated rows that have become a trademark. of Kar-Wai's films since Chungking Express. Like Soderbergh's The Limey, it's another kind of curio for Kar-Wai; where dialogue and plot are abandoned by mood and composition to create a story of two delicate lives in a seemingly restrictive emotional stasis. <br /> <br /> This is evidence of Kar-Wai's genius that he is so resonant that such a simple story. Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move inside the same apartment. He is a journalist who dreams of launching martial arts novels and she is a secretary at a shipping company. Their ultimate link is clear from the start, but the pleasure here is the way Kar-Wai paints twice a trip with his great masterpieces. <br /> <br /> The key to the success of the movie is Kar-Wai's use of the interior, playing with foreground and background planes in ways similar to Polanski's work. During the wooingly sensual first half of the film, Kar-Wai isolates Leung and Cheung in shots in such a way that the second person in a conversation is never visible. Kar-Wai is busy with the environment and space, creating a tight emotional dynamic between his characters. It also says that Kar-Wai never chooses to focus on the physical nature of Mo-Wan and Li-zhen's spouses. Their sightless partners are remarkably absent from the movie, as they are influencing their own love affairs. <br /> <br /> It is not to suggest that In the mood for love is a limited experience, because Kar-Wai manages his broad-space film hypnotic camera movement and sound. There is one shot where Cheung's slow, sensual rise from a metaphorical staircase turns into Leung's descent in the same step; their movements perfectly compliment each other, book the shot and create a sense of erotic duality between the two figures. Their souls are connected, but they have not yet physically united. The erotic displacement of these scenes is both fascinating and frustrating, as two star-crossed lovers reject physical consummation due to their humble faithfulness. <br /> <br /> Other scenes in the movie are played with short, slow-moving shots of Cheung erotic moves through her interior, to Mike Galasso's hauntingly beautiful score. Cheung's dresses compliment her outside room nicely, as she moves slowly through her environment. Her movements are slowly building up, which seems to be an inevitable merger between Li-szhen and her dream lover, even though the seduction process seems quite subconscious. If I look like this, it looks like these two characters are more like two birds that release pheromones, it's probably not as far-fetched from a statement. The close ties that these two characters have, with their internal spaces being almost as intense as their relationship with the outside world. The movie rarely moves in outer space and when the camera does, it is usually to tip through oval windows and symbolic bars that always remind us that these characters are like restricted animals. Kar-Wai is still going to plague us, even when the lovers get close enough to break the couple's closeness by shooting them through mirrors or through gaps in garments inside a closet. Mother Nature even seems to respond to their love of love, which often unleashes a gentle rain smell over the characters after their bodies have slipped close together. <br /> <br /> Kar-Wai's haunting atmospheric shots from a waterfall allowed Leung's Lai. Yu-Fai is experiencing a cathartic release in Happy Together, even though Leslie Cheung's Ho Po wing was not there to enjoy it with him. By the end of the film, love was so inextricably bound to the war that a third man's muted statements of love Yu-Fai's realization that his dreams of seeing a waterfall would bring him inner peace, even if he brought him not back. lover. Mo-Wan's journey ends within the boundaries of a crumbling temple. His own emotional exhaustion is well matched with his country's political climate, and the absence of Li-szhen is only made acceptable by the fact that Kar-Wai allows Mo-Wan to experience a release of all sorts. Mo-Wan caters for an antique myth and his mysterious release into a crack in the temple allows him to live his days hoping that all his loss and sorrow has somehow served a higher purpose .
