This movie is a tour de force by Julie Taymor who directs the scene and masks. No one comes close to her imagination at the modern operational stage. Since making this film in 1992, she has made much success in filmmaking and musicals. One can only hope that she can be persuaded to act opera again one day. I would like to see a Ring cycle directed by her. The current Rheingold in Covent Garden has huge hands, just like the characters in this movie. The current Butterfly at ENO uses Japanese puppetry. Coincidentally, or evidence that Taymor's influence is pervasive. <br /> <br /> Taymar uses fantastic costumes, masks, puppets and origami birds to regain the story of Oedipus on a stage on a silence above a lake. Red ribbons are a recurring theme. They are used as a umbilical cord when Oedipus is born, they hang from Oedipus's eyes after he has blinded himself. In a breathtaking effect, they were used to make a crossroads when Oedipus' death of his father was restored by dolls. <br /> <br /> This neo-classical opera ballet by Stravinsky enjoyed justified darkness until this movie brought it to life. The music is uninspired, but unofficially, Philip Langridge, Jesse Norman and a very young Bryn Terfel make the most of it. The singers are fairly immovable, in line with Stravinsky's wishes. Little Tanaka is the dancing Oedipus after Langridge's song Oedipus. It created a little confusion to the end when the Oedipus dance, the Oedipus's eyes sing. <br /> <br /> The libretto is in Latin, but don't worry if your high school Latin is a bit rusty. There is a helpful narrator who introduces and describes every scene in Japanese.
