If you want some-thin-sided, you'll do this movie, considered the best Italian detective story (giallo), Fulci. <br /> <br /> That's not sure Mickey Spillane. There are scenes designed to disturb anyone. <br /> <br /> Many will be insulted by a local beauty trying to seduce a 12-year-old boy. She was joking, but she was naked, and he would have jumped to jump her legs. She also tries to tempt the local priest. <br /> <br /> Young boys are arriving, and there are several interesting suspects. You need to look carefully to discover the killer. Can you? Don't jump on the first guy, it's too early, and he's too obvious. <br /> <br /> Anyone who is familiar with Fulci will be able to guess the killer who died at the end of a violent death. What mad reason did he have?
