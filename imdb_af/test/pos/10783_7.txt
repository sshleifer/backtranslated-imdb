I really chose this movie for my husband - who works in radio broadcast. I thought it would be more of a movie he would love to enjoy and connect with, even if it was out of the eighties so it was a bit dated. This movie really brings you in. Sometimes you want to strangle the host, Barry. Sometimes you just want to send the bigots that connect to a real concentration camp. Sometimes you feel sorry for Barry because he really grew too big for his jeans when you know what I mean. It was on the Drama channel on Encore-so I think it's a real story. If you really like drama, you'll love it, even though you don't know all the inputs of the broadcasting industry. If you are an Alec Baldwin fan and look to see him, you shouldn't. His part is really a bit part in this movie.
