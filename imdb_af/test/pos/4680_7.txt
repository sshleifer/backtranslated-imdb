If you're looking for a fast-paced movie that won't drill you, it's the place. It's fast and funny with a decent performance that comes from the characters. It's always hard for me to see Mark Walhberg as anything but Marky Mark. That image is burned forever in my mind. As an actor, he is pretty good. This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see some small turns and turns. I'll have to pick up and buy this movie one day.
