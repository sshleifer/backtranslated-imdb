I went straight to the big screen to see this kicker. This is the only movie I know of Tarsem Singh, but the boy was intense. This movie was a total ghost stimulant and one of the best special effects of this kind. <br /> <br /> The characters were alive and nothing less than creatures created in your own mind or nightmare. This movie is scary and interesting and bombs the senses with fear and excitement. This movie compares to no one else I saw except that it is wonderfully strange. In this respect, it's a pretty big step above A Clockwork Orange. Definitely see this movie on the big screen and don't wait for it to come on tape. It won't be half as good on tape. <br /> <br /> This movie is not for the sake of it. It will mess with your mind and leave you with images that take a while to forget. But for those who like to freaked out ..... NEWS!
