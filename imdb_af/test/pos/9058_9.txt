I went to see this movie with caution. A suicidal "comedy" doesn't seem consistent. Having a brother who has committed suicide and having seen the devastation caused by our whole family, I know first and foremost how to fall in love with this problem. I have to say - This movie treats it in a way that allows the viewer "inside" to someone who is suffering and simply doesn't know why or how to stop it. While the film is not perfect, it respects the subject and makes it more important to the masses. I know for our family, humor has helped us with lots of pain. And, Max and Grace are just what it claims to be - a suicide comedy. It's funny - and I also felt that characters were real and alive. This is also extremely intelligent, but simple. It cuts to the chase and I appreciate it! I give it a 9 and will recommend it.
