Four or five episodes edited by Johnnie Socko and his Flying Robot. Amusing Giant Robot Fight Giant Monster Story aimed at children squarely. Of course, parents will be crazy, as the action is violent with the robotic / monster battles that seem to be professional wrestling and man on human violence is the kind of thing you do in the Al Capone St. Find Valentine's Day School and Gangster Training Academy. I liked it, but then I grew up again on the series. If there are any problems, unlike the "men in suits" effects, variety is that the movie plays like a series of episodes that are merged, with a climax every 20 minutes. Recommended for those who run from Ultraman or Godzilla
