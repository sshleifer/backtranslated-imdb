I saw this movie purely by chance. It was very late, or more correctly, very early in the morning on television. I woke up and had trouble sleeping and this movie came on. <br /> <br /> It's about a topic that is covered many times elsewhere (it's certainly not as good as Rita education, despite some additional twists) and has a very predictable end . <br /> <br /> Despite the very clear shortcomings, I enjoyed the movie and it was due to the actions of some of its players rather than the story or the piece as a whole. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of Sam Neil and have seen him in many different movies, including: Dead Calm; The piano; sirens; Children of the Revolution; Event Horizon; Bicentennial Man and the ubiquitous Jurassic Park. He was very good, but he could close this part with his eyes. <br /> <br /> For instance, some of the plays were, I think, awful Rose Byrne, and some of the disruptions were handed over quite a bit (however, all the council woman in empty life did everything in white.) /> But two actors (who I didn't or didn't remember) impressed many of Sin√©ad Cusackn as Frances (Frank) Kennedy, and especially Matthew Newton as her son David. He was especially convincing and I would like to see much more of him.
