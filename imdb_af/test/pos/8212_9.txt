When this movie came out in 1995, I found it incredibly good. Especially with Sandra Bullock. After watching her brilliant performance in Speed, I was ready to enjoy any of her movies. <br /> <br /> Back to The Net, it was a movie that keeps you in suspension. Overall, I enjoyed it so I give it a **** from *****.
