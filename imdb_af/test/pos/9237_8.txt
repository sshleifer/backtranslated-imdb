This movie will be especially enjoyable for everyone in the film industry, especially in any capacity. Those whose heritage includes a movie introduction cannot appreciate it so much. I'm hard to please in the documentary category. This document is different, but the pleasure comes from an earthly realism of that filmmaker's punks who are looking to look around. Whether you have ever wondered what it's like to be in movies, front or back of the camera, or whether you've worked your way through the sometimes painful and difficult but rewarding Indian world, this movie will surely get a kick.
