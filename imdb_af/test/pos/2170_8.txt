This movie was better than I expected. I don't think it deserves an R score. I saw PG-13 movies with worse language and violence. I entertained this movie and I enjoyed it. If you are a person who analyzes everything, you may find it very wrong, but if you take it for his face value, I think you will find it entertaining.
