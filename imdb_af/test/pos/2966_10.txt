I like this movie. I wasn't really sure what it came to before I started to look, but enjoyed it. It was about a girl (Meredith Monroe) whose mother didn't want to turn her off like she did. She meets and falls in love with a boy (Riley Smith) who is a town for a charity football game. It's a good movie. I just hope it will be back or video coming out.
