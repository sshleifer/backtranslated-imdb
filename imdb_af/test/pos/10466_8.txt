It started quietly. If you are looking for an action-packed movie, it is absolutely not the right choice. All characters are slowly depicted on the scene. Stroke after stroke on the scene sails. No one can take his hands to the priest and so the sisters' life span can only stay in the village. Philippa and Martina know their destiny, belongs only to the village. So when you understand it, you're on the movie, in the town that became the world at that time. When can no technology make you think of anything other than the campaign, the town, the sea. You feel the rhythm of the old town's life. If you watch the movie in a cold, snowy afternoon, you can have dinner with some exciting expectations. <br /> <br /> The final sentence given by Babette's sacrifice far from Paris: An artist is never poor. <br /> <br /> Fantastic photography. Many situations portray portraits and landscapes as they were styled on canvas in the 18th century.
