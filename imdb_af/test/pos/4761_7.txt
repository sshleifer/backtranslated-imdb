**** SPOILERS **** Buried under a mountain of medical bills and his funeral business, which could not be excavated by Tony Lo Bianco, entrepreneur Vito Lucia, set up a plan to make a cargo cash with the help of his two crooked poles Moon & Bo, Richard Lynch and Bill Hickman. <br /> <br /> Vito now joins his buddy Buddy Manucci, Roy Scheider, as a mob informant to win over Buddy's confidence and tell him about Vito in the streets of New York. to gang activities. Buddy is a cop who works in a sub-rose association of the NYPD, the Seven Ups, who makes things "their way" to clean the streets of New York from criminals. <br /> <br /> Vito gets information from Buddy and makes it look like Buddy that he really gives him hints about the gang and whatever it is and uses the information to rip his hoodlum co-workers, Moon & Bo . <br /> <br /> Everything goes well for Vito & Co until the crowd decides to repay and wrongly grab and hit a member of the Seven Ups Ansel, Ken Kercheval, who was undercover thought, was one of the hoods they kidnap and rip. Later, Ansel was accidentally murdered by Maan when he blew out the car's suitcase that Ansel was shut down because he thought there was a suitcase full of cash, in the loose belt. <br /> <br /> Quick pass and exciting movie featuring those keen and grim New York City photography that was so effective in the movie "The French Connection", which also starred Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco in this movie is. Incredible motorbike hunting in Brooklyn in the city center and eventually landing in the New Jersey game, it is 15 to 20 miles away with Buddy, who has almost set up for his heroic efforts. <br /> <br /> Roy Scheider, who is not a big man, is as tough and effective as any big action actor. I can think like Clint Eastwood would have been in the same movie. Separator reminds me a lot, he even looks like he, former welterweight and middleweight champion Gene Fullmer, who hit the big Sugar Ray Robinson for the midweight championship in 1957 and also as he plays in the movie: tough durable and destructive. <br /> <br /> Tony Lo Bianco is very good like Vito, the entrepreneur, the lowlife heel who plays Buddy and the crowd until the point that Buddy's partner Ansel is killed. Although dirty, you can't feel sorry for Vito, because he just wants the money he gets from the relaxed babies to pay for his sick wife's Rose's hospital and medical bills. Even the fact that Ansel was killed because of his actions, Vito never wanted to hurt anyone, but as they say when you play with fire, you are burned. In the end, Vito explained a lot to the non-sympathetic and caring crowd. <br /> <br /> The movie "The Seven Ups" has made Bill Hickman do the dangerous stunts with both the motor hunters and the movie. Hickman was also the stuntman in both big movies that made him on the streets and highways of New York and San Francisco "The French Connection" and "Bullitt".
