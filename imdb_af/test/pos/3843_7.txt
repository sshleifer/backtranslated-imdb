After the The Aristocats' special issue in a two-pack with The Fox in the Hound, I decided to buy it, as both of these films were childhood favorites. <br /> <br /> The Aristocats are definitely a classic. It can't be a five-star classic, but it's a fun movie and makes a good evening's entertainment. It is somewhat a light refreshment from the darker, more serious Disney classic. The Aristocats are trying to be a light-hearted musical comedy, and I think it's just about it. <br /> <br /> The storyline doesn't really make much sense and I don't think the plot is very strong, but it's definitely not bad. The animation and backgrounds are a little scraped in places, typical of Disney's 70's, but it has a rustic, old-fashioned charm about it. <br /> <br /> The strongest points of the Aristocats are the characters, the music and the humor. The music is very unforgettable - try to hurry 'Everyone who wants to be a cat' from your head! The songs are written by the Sherman Brothers, who also did the music for The Jungle Book. There was one song called 'She Never Felt Alone' in the movie, but unfortunately it didn't make it to the final feature. This is a pity, because I think it will fit very well. <br /> <br /> The characters are memorable. Thomas O'Malley is pronounced by Phil Harris and is basically Baloo in a feline shape. Eva Gabor gives duchess this warm and maternal feeling and the cats' voices actually sound like children, not an actor who mimics the voice of a child. The secondary characters are here at the dozen and yet you still end up with their personalities. Edgar, the 'villainous' butler, plays a similar role to Cruella De Vil, but he is more comical than scary, and often ends in funny situations. Even though he is the bad man, he has always loved it. <br /> <br /> The two British geese - Abigail and Amelia really scratched me, along with their crazy (and drunk) uncle. I also like the dogs, which tend to argue about who the "leader is". I can go on, but I won't spoil it. But I can tell you, the Aristocats are funny and will entertain everyone without resorting to toilet humor. <br /> <br /> The bottom line - The Aristocats may not be Disney's crown performance, or even their strongest movie of the 70's (that award is a link between rescuers and the many adventures of Whinnie the Pooh). But it's a pleasant skirt and is sure to entertain. If you're looking for a brilliant artwork, you might want to look at Bambi. But if you want a fun night, the Aristocats are the way to go. It is a beautiful and lovely film and it is impossible not to like. Enjoy it! (And besides, it's good to have a movie where cats are not seen as villains).
