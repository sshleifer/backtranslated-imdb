"A Fare to Remember" is a completely derivative, almost ridiculous movie, but has a warmth about it making it a very effective and exciting holiday movie. It's a nice newcomer, Challen Kates, as an executive executive who, just before her wedding, from L.A. to Seattle must rush to keep a client who has rejected every other offer. From the start, she had problems with transport and apparently no money. This is the first stupid thing - were there no ATMs anywhere? She must make a fortune. Anyway, she meets a taxi driver (Warner) who looks like a homeless man, and drives her to her presentation and when she comes with a big box of beef (the client's product), he is there for her to the airport. All flights are canceled so that they can attend the wedding to L.A. can come. She hire him to take her there. <br /> <br /> Along the way they connect and learn from each other. It's a very nice movie, but there's absolutely nothing new in it - it combines "Six Days and Seven Nights" and a few other movies. But the chemistry between the stars is good, they are nice and the acting is good. Search for Jerry Springer as the head of the beef and a cameo by Karl Malden. <br /> <br /> It's a nice movie to take in the holiday season. It is a lifetime.
