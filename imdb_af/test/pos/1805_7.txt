I've seen this movie quite a few times and every time I see it, it's more meaningful and funny. Perhaps this is the lack of research that went into Nicolas Cage's character's punk person or just the cheesiness factor, because it was such a typical eighties film ... it's a cute love story with extremely funny, unique characters. I think it's right there with 'Fast Times' and 'Weird Science' (quintessential eighty-year flash!)
