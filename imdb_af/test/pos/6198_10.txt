I'm not sure how it could have been better, so I gave it a 10. The acting was excellent. The main woman was so hot. The chap Darwyn played was a smoldering, pensive character who excelled the inner turmoil he suffered (the driver's death is one example). The storyline was credible and the series length was about right (ie I love Lost, but will it ever end?). As a Briton, I tend to think of Yanks as Gung Ho. The LAPD was in their badly advised attempts to arrest him, but the other agencies were positively portrayed. My main idea about programs like this (and the excellent 24) is - can it happen? Will this happen? Is it going now? Possibly, probably. <br /> <br /> I hope they do a different series, but after reading some of the previous comments, it doesn't. <br /> <br /> To summarize - If you haven't seen Make sure you do it.
