I think I was recommended this movie by the lady in the shop where I rented it! For once she was scared! What a beautiful movie! First, I was convinced that James McAvoy & Romola Garai were Irish, so convincing was their accent; And halfway through the movie I was completely convinced that Steven Robertson was a disabled actor and that James McAvoy was too! When I watched the special features on the DVD and saw both actors in their 'normal' cover, saying I was blown away, an understatement would be !!! I can remember all the praise. Dustin Hoffmann came back in the 80s for his portrayal of autism in the movie "Rain Man" - honestly (in my opinion, of course!) Steven Robertson's performances / portrayal drew Dustin Hoffmann's right out of the water - and he deserves recognition as such! ! All in all, one of the greatest portrayals of human friendship / love / relationships ever - and made in Britain / Ireland with home-made actors - holds it in your pipe and smokes Hollywood!
