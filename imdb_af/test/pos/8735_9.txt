Everyone told me to see "Cactus Flower" and I finally did. What a wonderful movie - the perfect pick-up for a Sunday night / dreading on Monday morning. Matthau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman really made this movie. After all, it was really about her. The really big actors can do anything, and Mrs. Bergman proves this. She shows us - in the course of one movie - a series of few people in their entire career. The scene in the dance club was so hysterical as it touched. Even if the film came to its obvious conclusion, I cheered myself for Miss. Dickinson as if she were the Boston Red Sox. Fortunately, she made up (no pun intended) much better. ;)
