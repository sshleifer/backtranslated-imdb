This film is about a single mother who is happy, happy to the point that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensible teenage daughter who is adolescent unrest. <br /> <br /> "But But Here" is an engaging movie from beginning to end. Both Ann and Adele are well described at first, so we know how different their personalities are. Clashes inevitably arise, and they are offered captivatingly. I find myself so attracted to their state of mind and their circumstances. it is as if I live their lives, feel what they feel. <br /> <br /> Susan Sarandon gives another great performance in "Anywhere But Here". She is charismatic, fortunately happy, hedonistic, warm and keeps everyone at the same time. I've always had Susan Sarandon, and I think she's barely underestimated. <br /> <br /> "Anywhere But Here" is a fascinating emotional journey.
