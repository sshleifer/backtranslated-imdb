I'm going to the movies to be entertained. I was very entertained by the first movie in this series: the DaVinci code. It had many twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested. Angels and demons are no different. If you enjoy the DaVinci code, you will definitely enjoy this movie as well. Angels and Demons were made pretty much the same style as the previous movie, but faster, which I wanted. Ron Howard stuck me for two full hours without bothering one thing. <br /> <br /> What I really liked about this movie was that it seems to be fictitious, leaving enough real history to make it look very credible. If there is one thing I don't like about this movie, it's that the plot itself is very incredible (don't want to give spoilers). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained by the whole thing and was very happy with what I saw.
