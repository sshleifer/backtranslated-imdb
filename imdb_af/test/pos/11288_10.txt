I want to submit this review by saying that I have no idea what "Begotten" really is. All I really know is that in the beginning, God is killing him, in turn, giving birth to Mother Earth, which continues to satisfy itself with God's semen. His birth then a boy. The rest is fairly subjective, and you have to interpret it in your own way. <br /> <br /> How I chose to interpret the movie was it; God himself drew the beginning of the scientific revolution, when people began to question the teachings imposed by the church, such as the geocentric view of the universe and so on. Mother Earth has begun to think of people to think for themselves and the church's "this is so because God says so" views. The tribal people were the church that drove them back and tried to enforce Christianity on their throat. I'm not quite sure how Sun of Earth fits in here. Mother Earth and the tribes fought over him, so perhaps he represents the freedom of people or something for it. <br /> <br /> I have no idea what the final parts of this movie should mean. Relaxing, rape, then dissolving Mother Earth and Son of the Earth and grinding them into the ground like a mortar and pail can mean everything, but that's where the fun of this movie lies; You can interpret it as you like. There doesn't have to be a definite meaning for it, you can wander your mind. Sometimes you don't even know what to look for, because it is shot in a strange corner or it is too vague. <br /> <br /> The only thing that disappointed me was that I expected the truth to be a scary movie. I was thinking that I would immediately receive a call with a conditional "seven days" warning. What I got was pleasantly different. It was not scary at all, but it stirred my imagination. Decoding the film's cryptic message was a creative challenge. There were many scenes that were actually beautiful. Mother Earth just after she was born and the last shot of the forest path came in mind. <br /> <br /> Overall, I should say I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's definitely the most abstract movie I've ever seen, but it's not bad.
