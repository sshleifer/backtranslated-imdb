Before I saw this movie, I didn't really expect much from it, although my friend advised me otherwise. Because of this request from my friend I decided I was going to watch this movie. The moment I sat down to watch the movie, I was absolutely blown away. Out of the credits I fell from my seat; I couldn't just contain myself. The movie is about Hitler in all the glory of comedy. Hynkel is the absolute double for the Jewish hairdresser, who returns to fight in the war. Because of the heroism of the hairdresser, he manages to save one of the Germans, thereby gaining a member of the enemy on board, which helps in the struggle the Jews had. But things went wrong and Stolz was arrested, but only to escape the borders of the Jewish surbur, "The Ghetto". As a result of this escape, the German army began to seek out, which means that the Barber and Stolz were arrested, but escaped again, to be just for crawling and, consequently, to take his punch. ***** THE SPEECH THAT MAKES CAPLIN TO THE END IS FANTASY. It meets the moral that society can only dream of. IN THE SPEECH, YOU TREAT THE FOLLOWING MEANING OF THE MOVIE DURING THE SERIES AND COMPARISON THAT HAVE USED, AND IT WORKS, WHEN I HAPPY FAITH HOW TO HAVE LIVE AND LIVING THE LITTLE THINGS, AS THIS IMPORTANT IS SOMETHING TO LIVE ANYTHING. TO THE LARGEST, MOST PROMINING THINGS AS WAR.
