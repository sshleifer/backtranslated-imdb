This movie is not for those who expect an excessive martial arts. In terms of historical accuracy, I will address the problem to those who are better informed about the subject. I thought the performances were wonderful. Gong Li never teased as the inventive and (initially) loyal king of Qin's consortium. Fengyi Zhang showed a lot of flexibility that descended into a ruler in madness. He chose Hannibal Lector's route, rather than ranting. For me, Zhiwen Wang's best performance was the supersmoote Marquis. The character appeared to be very oily, but in a subtle Sir Humphrey Appleby. - Yes Minister, kind of way. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is the outstanding feature of this movie. The scene when the Marquis and its men stormed the pole was breathtaking. There are also some amazing battle scenes. Therefore, this film is highly recommended on the big screen.
