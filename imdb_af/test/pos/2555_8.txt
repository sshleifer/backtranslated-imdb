Chop Shop. Written and directed by Ramin Bahrani (Man Push Cart). Bahrani specializes in character-driven studies in naturalistic films about the kind of small people passing by every day, without anyone really noticing it in New York. <br /> <br /> These are people who have been pushed to the limit of society. They exist in a kind of gray world, many of them migrants whose legal status in America looks like a little doubtful. Where did they come from? How did they get there? How do they handle? Where will they end? It does not feel good stories as such, but stories about survival at its most basic, daily level. <br /> <br /> Ale is one such street child. In any case, he has no training and hustles, but to save money, he is no more than small theft. Mostly he is anxious to be reunited with his older sister. We see him in the early scenes calling a safe house to seek her, but has no real success. A young friend, Carlos, gets him a job in a hood shop, in the shade of Shea baseball stadium. Eventually, his older sister joins him on the site, but he is jealous of the motives of her friends and suspicious of how she earns extra money. He dreams of buying a food vehicle and erecting a vending business with his older sister. <br /> <br /> Bahrani shoots all his movies in place. There is nothing bright or shiny about them. This is the life if these people have to mourn it. It's not pretty, but it's never ominous, and the slightly desperate air that hangs over a lot of the movie is the same as that of people's everyday lives. <br /> <br /> The writing is also very natural and the characters get plenty of space and space to work. Polanco is outstanding in the lead and Gonzalez gives solid support to the older sister.
