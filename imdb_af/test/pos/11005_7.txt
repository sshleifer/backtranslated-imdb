I think Gerard's comment on the doctor hit the nail on the head. Interesting movie, but very long. It's definitely the antithesis for the new school of flashy, sexy, Moore style documents. There is no narrator, no facts or lace information, and no other gimmicks. What you see is what you get - a look at the disappearing world of the Saltmen of Tibet. As a great doc fan, I was amazed at how much I lost attention to this movie, due to the length and lack of dialogue. Eventually I would recommend it if the topic is interesting to you. It is beautifully shot, informative and offers a valuable (and closing) window in the way of life of the Tibetan salt people (and women) - all the key features of a good doc. But put on a large pot of coffee, it will help.
