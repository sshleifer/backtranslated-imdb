The GREAT NEWS is that this movie is now available on DVD from http://treasureflix.com for anyone who wants it, as well as on video. That's good news because it's one of my favorite movies! <Br /> <br /> I watched this movie for the first time in the 80's and this is compulsory holiday look. Living in the small town of Tewkesbury, picturesque and with its own traditions, reenactments and traditions, we are also a cozy community. We are now also faced with major housing developments that threaten the community and you can see why I love this movie. First - and most importantly there is snow !!!!! Then there is the beautiful legend of the Christmas tree and also the Christian denial, as the whole community accumulates the money to help the needy farmer to save his farm and stay in the community. The evil developers - only after the money was sent - packed up because the whole town promised their money to help protect what they had, which was very special. I like the way the whole community sends their message at Christmas via the post office misunderstood by the hero. He and his daughter have a long journey to make after the death of the wife and mother of the family. (There is a probable candidate for this). A sloth ride and the most heartwarming of all is that the taxi driver, whose engine is broken, secretly gave a new one on Christmas morning and no one took it! There is a wonderful moment where Denver is singing a lullaby and an exciting search. Great soft movie for everything Christmas is really about.
