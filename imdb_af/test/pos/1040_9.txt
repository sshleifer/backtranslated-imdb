Did anyone find a way to buy copies of this series? I can see many people inquiring, but I can't tell if any of them were successful. It is hard to believe that a series of these good things cannot be viewed by humans today, especially one based on real-world problems faced by real people during tensions and exciting times in our country. How can this be true and what can we do to change it? Aside, I agree with all the comments made by other authors on this series on this site. It's a great story about events that everyone needs to know and know something about today. Many of us saw this series when we were in college or about that time. Now we want to share it with our children ... but we can't? If that is true, what would be some good written material that would re-read the same information?
