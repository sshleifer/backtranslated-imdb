This is my first John Carpenter movie, I have to say I was very impressed by The Thing. From the beginning, the film pulls you in and never excites the tension. The movie's special effects and models still hold well today. Unlike Kurt Russell, I wasn't familiar with any of the role-players, but they were all exceptional in surviving fear, paranoia and despair. The Universal DVD has a wealth of very interesting behind the scenes extras. Highly recommended, 9/10.
