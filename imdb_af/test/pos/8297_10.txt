Once a year in America, Saturday will make room for new cartoons, usually somewhere in America. Just about the time the school started. <br /> <br /> I think it was not schooling on Saturdays because it's better. <br /> <br /> One Friday night before the premiere of the new Saturday morning cartoons, a movie came. <br /> <br /> "At The Earth's Core" I had no idea who Cushing or McClure was. It was clear they weren't from the same country, so I couldn't understand why they were together. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing the mechanism in the respiratory sample's mouth. <br /> <br /> What this film connects to me is the opening with the molten metal and then we suddenly get the tape as we see the factory. <br /> <br /> How do you end a movie like this? The music again, and two cloudy policemen like the drill behind them. <br /> <br /> For whatever reason, I remember watching this movie more that Friday night as I got a new cartoon coming the next morning. <Br /> <br /> It was definitely the late seventies. <br /> <br /> It will believe in Jurassic Park mania, cicra'93, before I see this movie again. <br /> <br /> Yes, people in costumes. There was the rocket again. <br /> <br /> Still loved by the two police. <br /> <br /> Finally, it would be almost a decade before I would be sending out the movie. DVD. <br /> <br /> Now I just want to look at the beginning and intro. <br /> <br /> Oh, I love the movie a lot. Of all these scientists Jules Verne, HG Wells, ERB movies, this one stands as my fave. <br /> <br /> What I notice now is that one of the police soon started turning back a little, then he and the other police officer were synchronized because they turned inwards to look behind themselves on the drill. . <br /> <br /> Perhaps this movie is the best of Saturday morning shows, which is why I enjoy it so much.
