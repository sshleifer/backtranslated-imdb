This movie is almost unknown, but it is very good. In a lonely Danish city, two old sisters live a distant youth, because, due to a strict Puritan education, they had to reject happiness. Lonely, then life lives in a dignified austerity, until Babette, who flies from Paris, frightens the horror of war. In a short time she will be able to change the good and the love she has received when she arrives. With a good lottery price she can organize a large banquet according to the best rules of French gastronomy. All neighborhoods are invited (all fanatical Puritans). They accept, but they pact to show no trace of pleasure or enjoyment, as it would be a sin. But the seductive power of the delicious meal they eat is seduced by the sensuality of French gastronomy. The banquet ends in a lot of feeling, even if it is quiet, happiness. The love between people woke up. The miracle of human friendliness due to the pleasure of the sentence has begun. The movie is surprisingly good, but it's not for all tastes. Nothing happens during most of the movie, everything is so quiet and so peaceful that you can only see the life of the town's inhabitants for many minutes. But, as the film evolves, it becomes more precious, when Babette wins the lottery prize (after 30 minutes of film), the show begins. The author is able to show us how Babette prepares the banquet, how to mix all the ingredients with the most wonderful (Love), in a fun way, with a perfect knowledge of photography and acting. . Then, as the meal is over, the quality to show us how the tastes of all eaters change because of the meal, with only the first shots, with impressive plays one by one, is simply astonishing. In addition, the tact with the colors and photography is also fantastic, virtually every scene of the movie is like a picture, so work is involved. If you can admire good cinema, you can realize that sometimes the way you tell something, rather than being told, is more important, it's your movie. If you like good meals and just love the good gastronomy, you will probably be amused, as most of the movie's feelings will be known to you. Earned an Oscar completely. The only problem is its reluctance to draft the story, but I can forgive it (I hope everyone too)
