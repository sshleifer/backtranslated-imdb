This movie performed well and kept my interest in the main character for the whole movie. Stu Unger lived an extraordinary life. Imagine if Stu lives today! This movie paints a picture of what Stu Unger's life might feel. It was interesting to see how covenants were to grow up. I'd like to have more details about Stu's party, his playing skills and his relationship with Bob Stupak. But all in all, this movie was well done, well-behaved and the story touches many facets of a life full of many events that were bigger than life. <br /> <br /> This movie is worth renting.
