It's fantastic! All of the score - until the final credits roll. This movie is a masterpiece. It's really creepy and its effective hysterical setting is enough to give someone the creep. Clearly, the movie was NOT rushed, and that David Schmoeller (who would later work with Fullmoon on the Puppet Master series) had a clear and concise picture of what he was trying to manage. The professional aspect of the movie is amazing as it is a relatively low budget. It relies on scares without consequences (mainly due to budget constraints), but still creates a tension-filled atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Stephen King said this is one of his favorite movies and I can't seriously blame him! This is one of my favorite horror movies and will always be. This is my favorite Fullmoon Movie and has been buying several times since the first few years ago. <br /> <br /> Money Well Spend! I own both VHS and DVD versions. <br /> <br /> 10/10
