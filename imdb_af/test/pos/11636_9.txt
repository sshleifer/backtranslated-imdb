Okay. To enjoy this quiet comedy short, you need to suspend unbelief about the main point of departure for the movie. If you can't, you'll probably be more likely to make this movie much lower. Charlie Chase has a great overbearing and his wife has a nose big enough to have his own area code. Unknown to each other, they are both repairing to fix these defects. Apparently, plastic and dental surgery was better in the 1920s because it wasn't necessary to recover from these major surgeries and they just watched dandy right away !! Okay, remember I said to ignore it, right? Well, you must also ignore the difficult idea that both can meet and have no idea, the other is their spouse. Okay, now that you've allowed yourself to accept these two foolish premises, the movie is really good. <br /> <br /> Charlie succeeds and she succeeds. Both are shocked and excited because no one really considered them attractive. So, because of this new vanity, they agree to go on a date. But they both sneak home - they don't want to know their spouses! Anyway, they meet later and are very attracted to each other. But how about the poor spouses probably going home? Well, they both learn that the others are married and both expect their marriages to divorce because they really want to be with each other! Late in the movie Charlie says the woman really is his wife and he goes through a very funny sequence in which he plays the boyfriend and the old man - by changing his clothes and playing fake teeth when he plays the hubby! It's really a riot to see him bouncing in and out of the room, as he apparently fights with someone else! You really have to believe it. However, the woman sees an ad with Charlie before and after photos and knows what happens. In the end, they both feel foolish!
