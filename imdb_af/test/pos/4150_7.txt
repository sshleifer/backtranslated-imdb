This movie promises a lot, but produces little. The basic problem concerns the inclusion of Charlotte Gainsbourg's character in this movie. Immigrants from Sicily in no way need a red-headed Anglo - the movie might have needed it, but new citizens certainly didn't. In my opinion, the decision to include her destroys the continuity of the film. This is particularly disturbing, as it does not just look like the characters in the movie, but also the history of immigration itself. Immigrants themselves were heroic figures, fully able to go along without being content with what I believe to be a veil image of the "white man's burden". I wonder if anyone will make a movie of Irish immigrants that will include a Sicilian woman as an important character. The left elbow index evaluates seven aspects of movie viewing, production sets, dialogue, artwork, film continuity, plot and character development. On a scale not exceeding 10 for excellent, 5 average and 1 for needs. Both film continuity and plot rate a low of 1. The continuity as discussed above is further broken down by the surreal end. Doesn't any movie of such an important historical significance more than a conclusion reminiscent of one of Marc Chagall's remarks? The plot is simple enough, until it seems to be too much time in the old land, too little time on the ship, and too much emphasis on the end. The acting and character development is average, as all the characters are captured throughout the film, and the inclusion of the Anglo-Saxon speaking perfect English almost turns the movie into a satire. Where's Groucho when you need him? The production sets, the dialogue and the artworks are very good, every rating is 10. The sets in Sicily, on the ship, and on Ellis Island are as good as one can find. The dialogue is wonderful, and the ethical song is wonderful. I agree with Scorsese that listening to the Sicilian dialect is a pleasure. Note that the immigrants speak of America, not the United States, the ideals of political reality. These are very good artistic scenes, with dreams of America, golden coins raining and giant vegetables among the best. The average left elbow index is 5.25, increasing to a 7.0 when it is equal to the IMDb scale. Another idea seems to be through Ellis Island experience: the afflictions of new immigrants were disturbing, later in 2006, one had to pay only a coyote or boat owner and fall into the neck in the country. No questions asked! The movie is worth seeing, but it seems that what one sees is problematic.
