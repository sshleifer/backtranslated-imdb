Korean "romance" about the owner of a camera shop diagnosed with a fatal disease. As he goes over his daily routine and prepares for the end, he becomes acquainted with a young girl who is a client. A friendship and romance grows, tonight, though no other love expresses the other. Good movie is unlike anything you'll probably see in America again, because the studio insists that the "couple" act on their feelings. He won't say anything, because he doesn't have that long to live, she won't because it's not the thing being done and he doesn't respond like she thinks he should. Of course it is much more complex than I think it is to be honest and that is the kind of thing you have to discover yourself. Is this a good movie? No, but it's a good one that will move you emotionally. The final lines of the movie still fall to me: "I always knew that love would fade like a photo - but you will remain in my heart as you are in my last moment. Thank you and goodbye." It may seem strange from context, but in the context of the movie it is very moving.
