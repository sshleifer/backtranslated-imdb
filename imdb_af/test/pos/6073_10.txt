From 1996, I first watched this movie, I never reached the end of my satisfaction. I feel I want to look more and more till now, my God, I do not believe it was ten years ago and I can believe it I almost remember every word of the dialogues. I love this movie and I love this novel, absolutely perfection. I love Willem Defoe, he has a strange voice to spell the words "black night" and I always say it many times, never bored. I love the music of Szararem, it is so many spiritualistic, has brought me into another world deep in my heart. anyone can feel what i feel and someone can make the movie like that? I do not believe it. Thanks, Ondaatje, thank you Mingela.
