So let's start!))) <br /> <br /> The movie itself is as original as Cronenberg's movies will usually appear ... <br /> <br /> My intention to see it was surely that JJL one of my favorite actresses. She is as nice as usual, this tuck shop! <br /> <br /> I won't say it's my favorite movie of hair. Yet it is quite interesting and entertaining to follow. <br /> <br /> The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive, but it is not a sort of junk box. ;) <br /> <br /> Recommend with confidence!))))
