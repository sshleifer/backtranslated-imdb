Critters 4 is one of the best films of the twentieth century. The word classic has never been used so well to describe this sensible epic. I agree that the original Critters are the best of the series, but the claustrophobic tension of the space station in which Critters 4 was set up should be seen as believed. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in seeing one of the twentieth century's main films.
