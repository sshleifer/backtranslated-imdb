It's such a revered and studied film, a classic among Hitchcock's numerous, it doesn't take any wonder to see it again. Yet do you think: can it stop even when the big (and smart and wonderful) trick of the plot is no surprise? <br /> <br /> Yes. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the beginning, a very beautiful and smooth story of the real story, is the essence of it. Two taxis, two men showing their shoes, each walking on the train, then sitting opposite each other, and oops, a mistake, a little splash and the conversation started and we see the men themselves. They are interchangeable. <br /> <br /> The tone here is characteristic of Hitchcock, as it is in many horror and suspense films - cheerful and light. However, we know that this will not be the case, so we are concerned. What is going to go wrong? <br /> <br /> Lots. In truly Hitchcock fashion, it is a purely innocent man (almost always a man) facing injustice, trapped by circumstances, threatening to be the most valuable to him. The innocent in this case, tennis player Guy Haynes, is played with an innocence that is credible - his collegial politeness in the first scene, as he realizes the other man is a small cuckoo, is just what you or I may do. The not-so-innocent man is the self-absorbed and terrifying intelligent, spoiled child, Bruno Anthony, played by Robert Walker with great shine. (This unusual achievement is equivalent to that of another Hitchcock wacko, played by Anthony Perkins in Psycho.) From stage one, on the train (and the train, really beautiful!), We have the two leaders and we have the thought - blowing and completely simple and ultimately devastating plot, from the first novel by Patricia Highsmith, which is also the books behind the two mr. Ripley movies wrote. And it doesn't hurt that the script was written by co-author Raymond Chandler himself, who knows something about economics and smart dialogue. And crime. <br /> <br /> And of course there is more than just the first scene. What to notice? Well, the smart of a senator's daughter (I thought she was awesome) is Hitchcock's daughter, Patricia, who is still with us (from 2009, she also had a role in Psycho). And there is a distinctive landmark for an important movie scene - the tennis courts in the Hamptons, known to us as the US Open site. The fantastic last full scene with the carousel is the only place where Hitchcock moves in a kind of slow and steady mount, which builds up the tension by making it surreal. The fear becomes positive with the laughing children and the old man crawls under it all. And when it crashes into an accident - it's all back-projected on a set, one of the more naturalistic uses of a director known to be concerned about the realism of his back projections. <br /> <br /> Photography is the perfect Hollywood surprise without being so quiet (as in some noir movies) that it is an object of its own. Look again at the first scene, or the shooting (and editing) of Haynes entering the house for what the audience thinks is a murder. It's sophisticated construction. If we are not completely surprised that Bruno is in bed, it just proves that the director has us on our toes. Something unexpected is always expected. <br /> <br /> Are there glitches? Who knows? It depends on what kind of fake you can accept (or embrace) as beautiful style. The scene where Bruno bumps the old woman into a party is both brilliant (the woman played by Norma Varden is a caricature so credible to take your breath away) and surprised him by the senator's daughter. see and in a deadly trance through her glasses, and her likeness to his former victim. This is a means of the 20th century idea of ​​psychology that interferes with many of Hitchcock's efforts. (The End of Psycho, for Starters.) <br /> <br /> The Wikipedia article on the film highlights the consistent doubling of things in the movie, from the main characters to the murder victim and the senator's daughter. It echoed in very small ways - two men walked to the tennis court, two men accompanied the victim to the amusement park, and so on. Too much can be made from this, but it offers an aesthetic consistency above and below our consciousness. Don't forget, there are two murders needed - that is, the lack of the second murder, the inability to double in that case, causing Bruno to unravel. <br /> <br /> Walker the actor had emotional problems and was institutionalized in the year before this movie was shot, and then he died of a reaction to a drug used to one of his outbursts to calm down. Although he has appeared in other films, Strangers on a Train is easily his tour force. Farley Granger had a long career that never saw him in real death, although his style may have a peculiar nervous sweetness, which really works, especially in their night life. <br /> <br /> And if you watch this one for the first or third time, look at the cold and hilarious scene at the tennis match where the crowds' heads are back and forth except Bruno's. He stared out without moving his head straight to us. As the trailer tells the movie, you won't be talking to strangers on a train after this movie.
