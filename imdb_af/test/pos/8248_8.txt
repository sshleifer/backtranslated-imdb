David, the master of debonair. Niven plays the Big Boss (IVAN) acting on the unlucky Richard Jordan (PINKY) by forcing the fearless ex-con to exploit his bad new position in a bank. Every Summer (Miss PELHAM) offers the best interest in female interest, which Pinkie cannot easily resist. <br /> <br /> It seems they were not able to decide on one name for this movie. make sense ??? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, this is one of Niven's last roles. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is fun and worth checking out if you manage to catch one of its rare or late night TV shows. <br /> <br />
