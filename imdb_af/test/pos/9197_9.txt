It's probably one of those movies too much commentary but undiscovered ... This is probably one masterpiece of Spanish theater like some Bu√±uel's masterpieces. '15 days with you 'can now be a visit to other movies of a long time ago:' Midnight cowboy ', but can also be' Les amants du Pont-Neuf 'or a realistic and not look (but most realistic) "train spotting". This hard story has room for humor, love and of course dramatic sense. In the new social Spanish cinema, this little diamond can be the resurrection of Italian neo-realism, with the best Ken Loach movies. <br /> <br /> Probably the better movie I've discovered in the past 10 years.
