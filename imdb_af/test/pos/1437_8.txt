The golden army man was one of the first films to be the main subject (and in some ways the message) of the heroic addiction tragedy. It is nowhere near a good movie, but its importance lies in Otto Preminger's commitment to making it really and on the verge of melodrama and naturalism. What I would like is that it is not so much, because it is best to uncover naked lunch, if you can, except the point), but the nature of the Frankie Machine urban environment. He expects him to come out of prison to go straight and narrow to become a drummer and legalize it as a musician. But he has his "crippled" wife, Zosch, who can't work and needs money and often complains, and then there's the old neighborhood. He can't escape to see Louie (Darren McGavin). and yes, push dope. Like Mean Streets, it is difficult to escape the minutia unless you leave. <br /> <br /> But then it is difficult for Frankie Machine not to work in this urban quarter of course. It's just that he can't escape the temptation of rubbish (when he is charged with his friend on a fraudulent charge, he sees a junkie freaking out, and it puts the fear back in his clean self) . And Frankie's identification is Sinatra, and I don't see anyone else playing him, even the original Brando choice. He fits nearby and looks like the kind of guy who has to be a step ahead of the game. But there is also a vulnerability to Sinatra that he comes out great, and by the time we see him in a cold turkey in Molly's apartment, it's credible, even if it's not the kind of thing my generation would think to heroin. ie Trainspotting and definitely Requiem for a Dream). If you want nothing else, you want to see the movie to see what happens to Sinatra as this character. <br /> <br /> However, the errors occur in some of the other appearances, but it's a bit difficult. Eleanor Parker seems to be too much for a good part of the movie, Frankie deceives that she is really crippled if she can actually walk and deceive him for some reason. But then it becomes clearer, as it goes together - she must be nuts and nuts with jealousy, and at that level it gets better. Meanwhile, Kim Novak is good, but not Vertigo-worthy, as the possible girl in the side, but more like the voice of reason in the story. Then there's a Detective Bendar, which can ever be one of the most one-note characters / performances. And also Sparrow, Frankie's nerdy friend, and the characters of Louie and Schiefka, and they are all played as one can expect them (McGavin is better than OK). Regarding the other talent around Sinatra, Preminger doesn't do as well. And honestly, some scenes are flat. <br /> <br /> But there is a lot of fascination in the Man with the Golden Arm, and not just some dated pieces of sociological importance. It works as a compelling drama, and as a message conveyed without being a sermon or camp. It's a real article, just not exceptional.
