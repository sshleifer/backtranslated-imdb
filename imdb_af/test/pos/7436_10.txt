It is really not difficult to understand this movie! I watched it without expectations and no knowledge of the story from the games. I was completely blown away! <br /> <br /> Initially, I wondered how most characters have a kind of superpower, but it's called "Final Fantasy ...". I also wondered about Cloud's past, but it was easy enough to look up. In no way did these questions spoil the enjoyment of the film. Just the opposite; It shows that I have seen the story long after the movie. <br /> <br /> It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. The music completely supports the movie. The characters are incredible. <br /> <br /> I want more!
