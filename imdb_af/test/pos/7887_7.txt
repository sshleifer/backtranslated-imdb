Unusual film about a man who is friends with his social opposite, fearing extortion. Peter Boyle makes this film with his dirty, boring portrayal of a working-class Joe who is in love with the past and afraid of the future and worried about the present. The first half-hour of the show, the film debut of a young Susan Sarrandon as Melissa Compton, a poor-willed rich girl demolishing with her in love boyfriend, filled with a full nude scene. Her boyfriend is the weak spot of the movie, a poorly depicted drug addict and trader who meets his downfall after Sarrandon's overdose. We meet Boyle's Joe in a bar while spitting on minorities, crime, hippies and drugs and it is easy to see that the later Norman Lear television character of Archie Bunker is based on a cleared version of Joe. The comparison even goes to Joe's wife and personal life and pastime. Joe shows himself in the life of Bill Compton, Melissa's father, and the two make an unlikely pair because they are looking for Melissa who ran away from drug treatment and back to the drug addicts who call his friends. Their search leads them to an "over-giving" as Joe calls it, a free love-filled party filled with drugs, is a lot of nudity and, surprisingly, Bill Compton and Ultra Conservative Joe are both going. They are being robbed and this results in a violent and murderous termination which, six years later, sheds the strong and cold end of the taxi driver. Joe is a funny film that is at least anti-violence and anti-racist on the surface. Yet, the main character of the film, Joe, becomes the instrument of revolution that he fears when he enters and joins the illegal and unbridled sexual excesses he opposes. In this respect, the movie is not a powerful message and lets you wonder what the final result really is.
