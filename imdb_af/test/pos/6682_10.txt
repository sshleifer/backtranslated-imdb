The always beautiful Kevin Spacey makes us sure again about certain truths in our lives. After believing in faith, he is a mumbling little timelapse (just to uncover the true power of film fraud) in the classic The Usual Suspect; This time he leads us to believe he is Prot, a similar alien who takes a human form while walking around the Earth. <br /> <br /> Prot is a foreign stranger apparently out of nowhere, just to be admitted to the Manhattan psychiatric institution. Dr. Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges) is quickly interested in him and even finds himself afraid of Prot's being a supreme being of planet K-PAX, or perhaps he's just a forgotten person with serious psychiatric problems. Although the end can be seen and discussed in many ways, it remains a complex, enlightening journey that leaves much of the intriguing / philosophical questions behind.
