'Toy Soldiers' is the story of five misfit boys (most notably Sean Astin, Wil Wheaton, and Kieth Coogan) to save their school from a terrorist raid after the US government captured the leader's father. Lou Gosset Jr. play the principal of the school, a worthy man who tries to instill a sense of discipline in his students. <br /> <br /> "Toy Soldiers" is a funny and beautiful action, and definitely the better of hostage-crisis-at-school movies. I think most of the appeal comes from the teenage thief, but also the terrorists do not come out utterly useless, while in some movies they never seem to be the intimidating group they should. Trapped in the residence, and threatened to be killed when the army or police interfere, it is a very formidable challenge for this group of guys who are planning to save the school. They are pretty smart about it. <br /> <br /> I was surprised it was a good movie. It keeps a steady fit and doesn't become ridiculously sentimental or something like that. Astin and Gosset Jr. give good performances. <br /> <br /> I also agree that this is an underestimated action movie.
