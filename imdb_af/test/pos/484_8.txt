I really enjoy this particular production of "The Mikado." The producers added some touches to make it more entertaining for the audience. For example, as a day may happen, it is completely updated, and some rules are advertised throughout the ad. play. Freedom was also taken with the institution. The costumes are not Japanese, but rather 1920's English (although some of the "Tittipudlian" girls wear a 20-inspired kimonos). This production is well choreographed with about 1920 dance styles, and there are a few extra dancing girls and bellhops to entertain your eyes (as well as ears) during the songs. If you're a Gilbert & Sullivan purist, these changes can bother you, but I think they're good - and I love the costumes! <br /> <br /> Felicity Palmer (Katisha) is absolutely hilarious; all her screens make me laugh out loud (one of my favorite additions is when she first makes an entry - the dance shops annoy her with their antics, so they shout at her voice, "STOP IT!!"). All the other main characters also do a good job. I especially like Mark Richardson as Pish-Tush (what toupee!) And Lesley Garrett as Yum-Yum. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is a stage production that is filmed and puts your expectations accordingly. There is no change in the environment, although filmmakers use film techniques to add interest about 1930s. If there is a sign of this production, the stage decoration is not shot for close-ups with a camera. Foundation lines are often visible and there is a surplus of eyeliner, lipstick, and blush everywhere. I've seen this kind of thing before with movies, and it is a little bit initially. However, I hope you will get used to it and enjoy the "Mikado" for its value - an enjoyable version of a classic!
