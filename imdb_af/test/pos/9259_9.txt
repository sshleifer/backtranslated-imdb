My favorite police series of all time changed to a TV movie. Does it work? Yes. Run for mayor and be shot. The murder room of the murder is arriving. Pembleton and almost all the police ever played in this series. Many flashbacks help you see what the TV series hasn't seen, but it also loves the fans. In the last five minutes another murder has been resolved and eventually two of the dead police arrive. And a short look of my favorite crown Juliana Cox. It's a good movie.
