The film is based on a Jules Verne book that I actually read about ten years ago. I remember very much like the book, and this movie does a good job of telling the story. The most important thing in this movie, however, is not the story, but the highly original visual appearance. <br /> <br /> The visual is absolutely beautiful and it is evidently achieved by a clever combination of animated drawings. combined with live actors, stop animation and sets painted to make them look much like an animated movie. Combined by Jules Verne's own unique versions of aircraft and submarines and Karel Zeman's good direction, delivering a very good and convincing visual style manages to keep your attention effective until the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are some problems too, one of the underwater screens at the end may take a lot of time, for example, because the story in the first part of the movie is rushing fast. None of this is very important, as the movie is always very enjoyable. A gem that deserves to be known to today's audiences as well. A recommended movie for the whole family.
