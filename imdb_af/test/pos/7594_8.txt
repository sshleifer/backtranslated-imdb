There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie, although it is a bit predictable. Drew Barrymore is a very good job of being the extinct nerd in this movie - excellent casting choice. What I find a little hard to believe is that the popular girls eventually accept her. In my experience, the crowd has a longer memory than that, and knowing how AWFUL Drew's character (ostrich feathers) would be at the beginning of the school year keeps them miles away, regardless of what rumors her brother is emerging. (And "Kole Slaw Food" really makes HIM so popular? I doubt it). As if rooting for Drew's character to grow up as a reporter - well, I would have hoped she might have a story before the promotion. A little confronted. To say all this, it was a piece of fluff that was so entertaining if you didn't expect too much.
