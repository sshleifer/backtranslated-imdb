On March 17, 1974, a man was found dead in the toilets at Manhattan's Penn Station. Although known, he cannot be identified because he has scrapped the personal information in his passport and taken his body to the town's mortuary for three days. It was the body of many regarded as one of the greatest American architects of the twentieth century, Louis I. Kahn. He is 73 years old, on his way from India, where one of his biggest projects, the Institute for Management in Ahmedabad, is near. <br /> <br /> One of the most influential post-war US architects Louis Kahn's architectural heritage includes parliament's home in Dhaka, Bangladesh, the Kimbell art museum in Forth Worth, the Yale art gallery, the Salk Institute in California and a kind of mobile "music boat" designed to deliver concerts in ports. several cities around the world. <br /> <br /> While being celebrated as an architect, very little was known about his private life. In addition to his wife, Esther and their daughter, Sue Ann, Kahn was survived by two mistresses, Harriet Pattison and Anne Tyng, and their two children. All three families live within one kilometer of each other in suburban Philadelphia, but their roads never went to funeral. His son, Nathaniel, the director of this film, was then only 11 years old and has only a few memories of his father's weekly visits to Harriet Patterson, Nathaniel's mother, in Philadelphia. Twenty-five years later, he is on a journey to confront his father by visiting Kahn's buildings, talking to family and colleagues and visiting the places that played a role in Louis Kahn's life. <br /> <br /> One of the most moving confrontations is when Nathaniel asks his mother, a landscape architect and mistress of Louis Kahn, why she continues playing his second wife, and never confronted him. Tears throw her eyes, but she has no regrets. "It was worth it." It's such a very sad moment. She was apparently broken, treated as a wreck at his funeral, which she was forbidden to attend, almost as if she had led a replacement life. Everything feels strange unreal. Another interview with Edward Bacon, Kahn's architectural nemesis, in charge of the rebuilding of his native Philadelpia in the fifties and sixties, is almost in the spotlight when reminded of Kahn's improper ideas about architecture. His son, Nathaniel, listens uncomfortably when a very senior Speck literally shouts with anger when Kahn's name comes up. The final scene is reserved for Kahn's largest creation, the Capitol in Dhaka, Bangladesh. It took 23 years to complete a large and extraordinary building, of which Bangladesh is extremely proud. This is one of the few national symbols with stature in this poor country. Some of the interviews with the residents brought tears to my eyes, especially if they found out they were talking - God forbid - the architect's own son! <br /> <br /> The movie is so much a personal journey as it is a report of Kahn's great architectural heritage and deals especially with the performance of the film itself and filmmaking in general. Maybe Louis I. Kahn whispered like a dad, but these personal life shortcomings make for a more interesting portrait in this extraordinary movie. <br /> <br /> Camera Obscura --- 9/10
