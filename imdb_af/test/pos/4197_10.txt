"Head" is one of those movies, you will have a lot of trouble convincing your friends to see, but once they do, they will fall in love. I don't know how many times this happened to me. This movie is just as funny and bizarre, really a deconstruction of everything the Monkees have been up to now in their career. Much of the credit goes to Bob Rafelson, who has almost finished the Monkee's career with this movie. My guess is that he wants to get the TV program and come in features, which he has done in this respect. Micky Dolenz is absolutely hilarious. I can't believe he didn't have a second life as a comic actor after this movie. This movie has a lot of great cameos and a lot of wonderful psychedelic nonsense. I feel the reputation of this movie continues to build and it will not surprise me if it eventually becomes a full cult classic
