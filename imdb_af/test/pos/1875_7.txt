It's been a long time since the last time someone made a movie like that. A so-called B-movie. Maybe it wasn't a good movie, but it's fun to watch, classic Bruce Cambell, it has its good parts, funny, disgusting, even artists. <br /> <br /> ****** Spoiler Vooruit ******* <br /> <br /> ------------------- ---- ---------------------------------------------- ------ --------------------------- <br /> <br /> The part where his wife is a dummy Robot avenger is about to die, I don't know about you, but it made me feel so strange, so sad and in a good way disgusted. I compare this scene with the scene form the Fly 2 where his dog dies as a monster. Make you think o my god. <br /> <br /> ---------------- ------------------- ------- ------------------- ------------------------ ------ - ------------------------- <br /> <br /> ******** No more Spoilers ***** **** <br /> <br /> If you are a Bruce Cambell fan, you definitely want this movie in your collection. If you're generally interested in movies, you might want to. Just think that the movie target is to make you smile, roar (don't worry, but so bad) and make your time with your friends. Attention, I told friends, not a possible future friend.
