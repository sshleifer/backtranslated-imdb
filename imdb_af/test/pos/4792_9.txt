A black comic story of a dried-up priest, Nazarin, shows the economy that Luis Bunuel was able to tell a deep humanistic fable with a minimum of fuss. As an output of his Mexican era of filmmaking, it was an invaluable talent to possess, with little money and extremely rigorous schedules. Nazarin, however, exceeds many of Bunuel's previous Mexican films in terms of the play (Francisco Rabal is excellent), narrative and theme. <br /> <br /> The theme is interesting to do something that has been re-examined in Viridiana. three years later in Spain. It's about the individual's struggle for humanity and altruism under a society that rejects any understanding of virtue. However, Father Nazarine is portrayed more sympathetically than Sister Viridiana. While the latter apparently chooses charity because she wants to reconcile her (alleged) sins, Nazarin's entire existence and reason for the fact that it helps others, whether they (or we) like it or not. The last scenes of the film in which he doubted his behavior and in a split second between the life he led or the conventional life expected of a priest are so emotional because it is his moral integrity and we are never quite sure if it remains intact or not. <br /> <br /> This is a remarkable movie and I would ask someone interested in the classic theater to look it up. It is one of Bunuel's most moving films, and includes many of his obsessions: frustrated desire, crazy love, religious hypocrisy, etc. In my view, Nazarin is a second one for the exchange angel, in terms of his Mexican movies, and is definitely near the top of the Bunuel's total cinematic list.
