doesn't sound like it was from a fantasy movie. The film is dark, with dark overtones. The soundtrack is too high, up to the point it had on the footage. I'm sure they were looking for something militant, but it just didn't work. The scene when Astin tries to escape is a perfect example. Why does it sound like the Goonies? There is no comedy, there is no brightness! <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the movie is great, and the acting is also very good. I enjoyed everyone's shows. It is available on Netflix's online viewing. <br /> <br /> Definitely worth watching, but write your own soundtrack!
