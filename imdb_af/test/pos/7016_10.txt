I first heard of this movie from a friend. She loved it and always watched it. When she told me about it and said how old it was, I immediately decided I wouldn't want it. I was so wrong. Dirty Dancing was such a wonderful movie! I love the music and the dance. I immediately bought the soundtrack and DVD after watching it. Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Gray were brilliant in it. They caught the emotions and feelings of the characters so well. They were both good dancers. After watching the movie, I wanted me to dance like them and I will hopefully soon be recording ballroom and Latin dance. I became a fan of this kind of dance and are now dedicated to all the movies and programs about it. Dirty Dancing has revealed my passion for dance and music. My favorite parts of the movie is when Baby goes to the Headquarters of the Staff and sees them dancing and of course the last scene where Baby and Johnny dance together for everyone. I believe that everyone should look at Dirty Dancing at least once in their lifetime. If they don't, it's their loss !!
