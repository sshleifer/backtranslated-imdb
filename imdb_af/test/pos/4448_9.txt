Easy Lucio Fulci's most respected film, "Do Not Torture and Duckling", is highly known for his noble subject, horrific images and strong story. Terror enters a small Italian village when young boys begin to be murdered, the confused and determined authorities, plus a dedicated detective secret. Was it the creepy hermit? The spastic voodoo witch? One of the hookers? The rich girl? Someone else? Unlike most fans' regular representation on the film's violent content, I consider it much more plot-driven; with only one real moment of memorable bloodshed (with chains and plates). In no case does it detract from the positive qualities that this film produces. Fulci proves himself completely capable of taking a hell of a dark and disturbing giallo with childlike murder, black magic and of course a nice full set of claws. Although I especially love Fulci's "Lizard in a Woman's Skin" and "New York Ripper", "Don't Torture a Duck" dominates the giallo genre as a moody and compelling murder mystery!
