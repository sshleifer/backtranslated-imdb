I just watched this movie on the front night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia. I loved Mork & Mindy as a child, mostly for Robin William's zany energetic show. This movie reminded me why. Was the original show good? Not really, but Robin was definitely. This brings me to this movie. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised and didn't expect anything more than a paint by numbers chronologically telling the show (which was somehow). But of course the real focus was on Robin. It was interesting to see Robin's journey from struggling street hunter to national tv star, and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long-suffering wife. And my hat is off to die Chris Diamantopoulos as he mr. Williams depicted with integrity, sensitivity and heart; not just a cute impression, even though it was dead. (On a non-related note, I noticed that Robin's struggle in some respects was similar to Andy Kaufman, who was underestimated by network TV and was held back in a creative way, but that's the "Taxi" behind the scenes biopsy.) All this was a very pleasant movie, in which I felt I got a little more from the man behind the Hurricane. The acting was solid through al-melodramatic as I suspect - and the story went well. Exceptionally good performances were by those who played Garry Marshall and John Belushi (the scene in which Belushi Robin was beaten!). Not a great masterpiece in any way (I'd like to see a little more about Pam Dawber), but definitely viewable, especially for those Robin Williams and Mork & Mindy fans out there. Nanoo, nanoo!
