The Beatles have just done Magical Mystery Tour. There was the general feeling that performance, peace and drugs came together. In LA there was a movie subculture that knew something was popping up. Nicholson was in several of these gangs. <br /> <br /> Before deciding to become a serious actor, before 'Easy Rider' for 'Pink Flamingos' for 'Day for Night' there were several experiments with what to do about it. An important one is' Saragossa Manuscript. "It's another. <br /> <br /> Writing Jack. He plays with circular, self-referencing, film reference, self-rotting, the pain of creation, all on the outskirts of safe kiddie doll. You have to see it if you know something about Jack. <br /> <br /> Certain actors act by digging themselves. This is a common technique. Some dig deep, but after a while they become boring because they are incredibly shallow. There is not just enough to maintain a career. Think of DeNiro and Hackman. <br /> <br /> Others are pretty interesting people who become more interesting over time. As they fall into the barrel, they put in stuff again due to the pain of the digs. Think Sean Penn and Jack. At the bottom of Jack's walk, he turns to the end of the wire, because the basis of each character is this experimental, risky writer / filmmaker. <br /> <br /> Who cares if it's a bad movie? It's bad because it took risks. See when a tear is cleared by Annette's cheek director. It's a loving roof on the whole Brando thing, something I hear, Marlon laughed. It is one of the richest moments in Hollywood film history. <br /> <br /> There's another reason to look at it. Music in film is a strong root in dance. Revolution in film often relies on music. Whole cultures are therefore whipped together. <br /> <br /> An unusual giant to find out how billions are dancing now is Toni Basil. She was as influential in pop choreography as the Beatles were in music. She was good at her career when she insisted on working on it. But this is one of her earliest screen acts. You can see her work all the time and she has herself in the nice cool 'Daddy's Girl' segment, about one of Nilsson's better songs. (Followed by the Frank Zappa cameo.) McCartney would refer this scene to his TeeVee special years later. <br /> <br /> A third reason to watch is early (about 6 1/2 minutes) in the movie: a character called 'Lady Pleasure' kisses each monkey in a long, continuous shot and then leaves rejecting . She is credited as I. J. Jefferson, but is really Mimi Manchu, Nicholson's lover of that time and LSD partner. Red hair, psychedelic attitude. Pretty. This scene tells me all about how Jack feels about the boys. <br /> <br /> Ted's evaluation - 3 out of 3: worth watching.
