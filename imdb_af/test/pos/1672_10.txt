If the caper genre owes much to Walter Huston, it also has a gratitude to Jules Dassin, a man who was before his time, and who suffered greatly as a result of his black list when Edward Dmytryk accused him of A communist was. The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr Dassin, but Europe proved to be bigger than the same people who contributed to his Hollywood downfall. <br /> <br /> "Rififi" is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together, thanks to Mr. Dassin's vision. He decided to adapt Auguste Le Breton's novel because he saw the possibilities of making it into a caper movie that became an instant classic. Jules Dassin was strange in Paris when he discovered the city that would serve as a backdrop to his film. The bad weather paid for Mr. Dassin as the streets were always wet and not much had to be done to show them so. <br /> <br /> Once we meet Tony, he plays cards. Tony seems to be in bad health; he coughs all the time and soar a lot. After losing all his money, he goes to Jo, the Swedish, who tells him about a robbery at Maupin & Webb, the fine jewelery shop at a Tony section of Paris. They pass by the idea by Mario, the Milanese emperor Cesar, who is a knowledgeable safe cracker. <br /> <br /> Tony, who recently came out of prison, learns that his former lover, Mado, is now with Grutter, a creepy who owns a nightclub. When confronting Mado, instead of love, he only feels contempt, and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his place. Grutter has no love for Tony, which is his natural enemy because of his association with Mado. <br /> <br /> When the day arrives, the gang building can be built on the second floor right next to the jewelery store, but he is gone. Everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels. Cesar, the Milanese, a typical ladies man, takes a ring as a souvenir, which in turn gives the chanteuse to the Grutter's nightclub. This tactical mistake is the spark that unraveled the well-thought-out plan. <br /> <br /> Jean Servais made an excellent Tony. He showed a tired man who might have done his last robbery. Carl Mohner, Robert Manuel and director Jules Dassin are seen as Jo, Mario and Cesar, the quartet jewelry. Marie Sabouret plays Mado. Marcel Lupovici plays Grutter with a muted intensity. Robert Hussein, who later makes movies, impresses with his Remi, one of Grutter's men. <br /> <br /> The best movie of the movie is the great camera work by Philippe Agostini, which has the atmosphere of Paris and the places where all these criminals work. Georges Auric's music plays well with the action in the movie. Jules Dassin was peculiar in his choice of films that he directed, and unfortunately this is our loss because this man was a genius who was proven primarily with "The Naked City", "Night and the City" and "Rififi".
