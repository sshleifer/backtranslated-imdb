This is the only Pauly Shore movie you should ever see. Oh, that's the only one I've ever seen, and I think I've made good choices. I find Shore's shtick kind of tired, but he is very funny in this movie. Actually, the writing is pretty funny, and Shore doesn't overwhelm the other actors with her ... what are you calling it? Tomfoolery? Anyway, it's a funny, but eventually forgotten movie. --Frink 3
