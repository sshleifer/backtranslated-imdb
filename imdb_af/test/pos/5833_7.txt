Hi To read the whole plot to "OZ" just look at IMDb here to find it. <br /> <br /> ** WARNINGS SPOILERS WITHIN THIS OVERVIEW! ** Oz is the series that has not only moved me, but also shows a little. From the American prison system, but I have to say (judging the channel's discovery program), it's not really realistic. <br /> <br /> Although I have to say, there is no shame, rape, impoundment (stabbing) happen. Yet it is television, so for you what is there, it is realistically wrong. There is a good deal of violence in it, and some here and there exaggerated scenes (plot on plot about plot) It can be quite boring. But remember the series is almost old. So times change so well. I believe I should judge it in the timeline as it came out. <br /> <br /> As the season extended to season 5, it was pretty good! Until one of the drawbacks of winning a 2 million dollar lottery ticket, because he spoke to God, it hit me as "ok it goes to the point when I don't want to see this series" Still I continued! And now I just saw the episode 3 of season 6. This is where grain gets zapped and its "mother" keeps him behind while he is batting. Then you see O Reilly cry and see his brother as well. (RL BROTHERS So good). It's by far the best scene in the whole OZ series. Still don't read it wrong, I'm trying to crash and burn it. It's a very good series! And even now 2010 is a watch worth it! I give it a 7 because of the storyline that is weakening with the season. But still a golden glove.
