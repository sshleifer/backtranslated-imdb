I mention words from my favorite author, Paulo Coelho, as the commentary for this movie. <br /> <br /> "If you really want something, gather the whole universe to help you achieve it. <br /> <br /> It's too easy to forget who we really are and What we would like to do in life, because there is always too much comment and advice to tell us to tell safety, I almost forgot what the passion feels like.In spite of the adventure, I will remove myself from safety zone. I believe the fear is just the price I have to pay for the upcoming brand new journey in life, thank you for inspiring me with this beautiful inspiration story, it is the blessing for me to realize what unconditional love is. is the most treasured love of the light of the soul.
