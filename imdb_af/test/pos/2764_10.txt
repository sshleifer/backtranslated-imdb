I saw this movie on the big screen as a child and loved it - cheeziness and everything. Recently I received a copy on video and checked it again. Bad, sure ... shockingly fun, definitely. It still packs an entertaining punch. It's much nicer than the dull Disney version ("Alive"). The only thing "Alive" did was the special effects. If you are a B-movie lover, I strongly recommend surviving, not all the other Rene Cardona Jr. not to mention movies ... and the Mexican wrestling slips made by his father (Rene Cardona Snr). "Survive" has long been in arrears for DVD special edition treatment. Do you listen, all your friendly people, at Anchor Bay ...?
