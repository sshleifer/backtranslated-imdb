Having read some of the other reviews of this movie, I am reminded of both good and not so good aspects of it. But overall, I have to say it's one of the better movies I've seen recently from any number of genres or countries. More than anything else, it avoided many of the typical traps of recent international theater, such as using beautiful landscapes, either "hip", "fun" or imitating American films such as pulp fiction. The film is unique in many ways. For one thing, it's a movie about relationships in which sex plays no role (unusual, especially for foreign films). It is also a film about two men's relationships with each other (also unusual - not a 'girl movie', no homosexual tension, no ego / phallic competition). It uses a small dialogue, but communicates a tremendous amount. It's a simple story, but full of complex details that are easily understood by any human being and universal in their relevance. I didn't find the movie dark or depressed (everything looks like this if you watch the whole of Hollywood's happy end-films), but rather a true reflection of human emotions. For example, in the scene where Mahmut realizes his cousin is gone, you both see his sense of relief, that the cousin is gone and yet regrets that he is pushing him away. Who has not felt such an ambivalence - when you lose a friend or lover or in another situation? It is rare to display this kind of real human emotion in a non-clich√© way. Regarding culture, whether it's a Turkish movie, I feel it is the very difficult balance between a 'Turkish' movie - about realities that are more applicable to that place (the bigger battle to make it into a Turkish city versus a European one, the greater contrast between country and city) and a universal human story that should not necessarily be set in Turkey. On this day and age where people around the world consume and fetish culture, we do not try to lure us as 'Turkish', nor try to communicate it as a 'hard reality', or so is Turkey / Istanbul IS '. And yet the cultural elements are there. I think the comparison with "lost in translation" that someone made is pretty good. Everyone, at least in the US, was surprised by the film. I personally thought it was mediocre at best. It was good by someone as a vague story that was supposed to deal with 'disorientation' what happens to people living or traveling overseas. Even though the film was supposed to be humorous, the characters and their motivation or crises were never clear (even for a 'lighter' movie or comedy, that's necessary). And I found myself on a typical 'orientalistic' story of the estranged American overseas. Return to 'Distant', like the idea that it is bad or too slow, or has no plot, but sorry, but people who say it know nothing about filmmaking and maybe nothing about being human, no offense. You don't have to be a movie or cultural connoisseur to appreciate this movie. This movie will be spent two hours of your time!
