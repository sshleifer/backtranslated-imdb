Most of this political excitement has featured as a major role of the movie film, with a somewhat better development of many of the main characters. It was very much appreciated that the BIG was spinning and powerful climax experienced in the "Silence of the Lambs". or "The Sixth Sense." Reese Witherspoon as the troubled wife of the missing Egyptian man and Yigal Naor as the strong armed interrogator offers strong achievements. Jake Gyllenhaal is unfortunately given a more two-dimensional character and has to struggle with a stereotypical representation of the emotionally torn CIA analyst previously featured in other movies. Early on there was the beautiful scene with an explosion that looked like a scene at the end of "Private Private Ryan," the quiet scene so effectively used to reflect one of the effects of violence. The script also provides a little more insight into the minds of the "enemy", but does not allow the audience to understand much, and allows the audience to move back into stereotypical characterization. The cinematography and photography are also somewhat of a decay because, unlike "Jarhead" or "Blackhawk Down", the sharp, raw visceral presentation is lacking, so the audience can't really be in the movie, there is some which keeps the audience from realizing the intensity of the emotions on the screen. Generally, the film itself releases at the end, and the audience provides a measured look at the complexity of the United States' use of version and the possible complications and consequences that may occur through its use. Eight out of ten stars.
