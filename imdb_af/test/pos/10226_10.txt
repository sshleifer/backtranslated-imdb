I absolutely love this movie. I just got a copy and saved it to look at my birthday. This movie raises several questions. One is. Who are the monsters of this world? To be different is just that. Different. The true monsters hide behind the masks of regularity. They are the ones who all consider a "calm blue", who "bother no one". Or they are worse, they are the characters played by Croneberg. Men who make fun and power to cut people and create their own Books of Blood. I love the form vendors, people with gifts and those who can be dislike for people to look at. This movie touches on and investigates what is normal. Who is 'other' and what fear do some. Although I gave this movie 10, I'm still sick of women who either scream or so put on their way that they can't see what's happening and a vehicle is for the things that Median destroyed. My other complaint was why they never made a second movie. I would like to see a continuation of this most interesting story that captivates me from beginning to end
