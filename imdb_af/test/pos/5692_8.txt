"Black Water" is one of the most tense movies I've ever seen. The story moves fast, as it follows three tourists (all major actors) in a swamp on a tour with a battle guide on a small boat. Shortly after dropping anchor in a remote area of ​​the marsh, they are inverted by something large in the water. <br /> <br /> The three quickly managed to make it into a long tree, as they realized a crocodile attacked them. During the next two days, they are desperately trying to escape the crocodile's wicked watchful eye, and he does not want to leave. The movie just goes a little, but what can you expect from the environment and the limited budget? It's so much better than "Primeval" and other recent crocodile / underwater predator thrillers. The tension is heavy, and all three leads offer fantastic performances. Actually chilled, this movie hit a deep chord of claustrophobic fear in me. Apparently based on true events.
