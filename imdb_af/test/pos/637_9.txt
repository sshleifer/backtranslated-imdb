It is always a well-known and important legal director to set up the atmosphere of a movie within the first 5 minutes. In the critical opening styles, the film has to encourage itself and inform viewers and interest in the rest of the film. Here, in "Mute Witness", we find an excellent example of this. <br /> <br /> * Scene spoiler * <br /> <br /> In the first 5-10 minutes, the movie makes a very Hitchcockian scene of a beautiful blonde lady in her apartment, with the radio on . She wanders around, adjusts lipstick, squeezes herself, and ignores the news release of a serial killer on the loose. Of course, the serial killer in her home, and monitoring her movements, is knife in hand. She heard a noise, looked into a room, and there was her partner in a pool of blood. At the tip of her shouting, she turned to stand with the knife-moving maniac, repeatedly stabbing her in a brutal and horrible act. <br /> <br /> ... something strange happens. As the woman falls into her dead guard, the killer falls down and takes out a cigarette to see how his victim is killed. Before finding his lighter, his cigarette was relieved ... of someone else in the room! The camera flushes out and we realize that more and more people are in the room. Some take notes, some filming, some who take death and the woman takes a very long time to die and make a lot of stingy work. of this too. When the audience realizes what is going on and the whole scene is part of a movie, the exciting and horrible scene takes on an element of humor. <br /> <br /> * End Scene Spoiler * <br /> <br /> I highlighted this opening scene for various reasons. First, it perfectly portrays the whole movie's atmosphere. A play in the style of Hitchcock or De Palma, with some very disorienting, and even black humorous moments. - It presents a central subject (this is the difference between a movie screen kills and a snuff movie kills, a problem later worked out in the movie), and eventually the viewer introduces the characters, all as quiet as possible. <br /> <br /> The plot of Mute Witness centers around Billy Hughes, a US special effects make-up artist working on the film, is being shot in a large warehouse in Moscow. . Billy can't speak, but she communicates in sign language by her sister. After an evening's filming, Billy accidentally finds herself locked up in the warehouse. In her attempt to escape, two of the crew members who appear to be porn movies are witnessing, but appear to be sniffing. Movie. Suddenly, her escape from the warehouse is a matter of life and death. <br /> <br /> Without doubt, the first half of the movie is powerful and absolutely gripping. Billy's saving grace, and her disability, is the fact that she cannot explain a sound. (In fact, one of the best aspects of the movie is the fact that it's not really full of women screaming). There are some very disturbing moments, and some beautiful pieces of real-life stress (the hallway, and the elevator are ideas). The timing is fluid and the entire first half is in itself an incredibly satisfying experience. <br /> <br /> The second half of the film introduces new concepts. While there are several exciting moments, the focus is on plot turns. New characters are introduced, and it is ambiguous on whose side they are. Although there is nothing wrong with the second half of the movie, it's not really until the first half. There are a few fine moments of black humor that stick out and paste some dramatic scenes, but there are also many lame comedy moments (come specifically from Billy's sister and her fiance, who is the director of the movie Billy is working) , which almost ruins the film, just because they are badly placed and / or missed and destroy the tempo. - At the end, the dots remain at a rapid rate of fire and the climax of the film is appropriate, as tense as the first half. <br /> <br /> There are several things that really make the movie work. The barriers to communication that Billy faces, as well as a dumb and as an American in Moscow, mean that even an emergency call for help becomes a dangerous situation. The actress Billy, Natasha Zudina, does a wonderful job in the film, with an exciting preview and a brilliant performance, and ultimately the direction as a whole, but especially in the first half of the film, which is really a study is in Alfred Hitchcock's suspense / thriller film techniques. <br /> <br /> As I have already said, however, the deviations in the film are of some terrible comic relief moments that really do not need to be added. There is already a consistent and effective line of dark humor appearing in the film, without the characters of Karen Hughes and Andy Clarke (the sister and the filmmaker) changing their scenes into an unusual sit-com. However, despite these shortcomings, the film is an enjoyable thriller, and ideal for a group look at Halloween. (Surely better than the usual horror movie ...!)
