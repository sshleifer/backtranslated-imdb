So start "One Crazy Summer", the evil twins of "Better Death." How can any movie be bad when the opening lines are sung by David Lee Roth? <br /> <br /> This movie is a total blast. John Cusack again with Curtis Armstrong, but this time Bobcat Goldwaith adds very good results to the mix. Hyperactive Bobcat pours the nerves around everyone, Curtis "Ak Ak" is the son of a depraved military with pacifist tendencies, and Demi Moore (with natural breasts ... wow!) As the love interest of once again chronically depressed. Cusack <br /> <br /> The story is good enough. The laugh is there, but both Savage Steve Holland films have a certain quality for them ... they are funny, but they are also sweet. The scene where Curtis finds an inflated doll in the target beach, and starts thinking about how a girl can't sleep, was stupid, funny and touching. The animation used throughout is quite surreal. "The Boat" is hysterical (complete with Watsamatta U. sail and Odie plush pop). Overall, a fun movie, but not as good as "Better Death ..."
