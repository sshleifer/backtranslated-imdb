I was born in '68 with not much older guidance, as far as I watched television (like a child in the 70's). I always loved this movie (and the French Connection) and will always try to catch it when it's turned on (watch the Sunday TV guide ahead of time). I bought it on DVD a few years ago and I've been watching it twice since then and I have to say, I AM THIS LOVE! Roy S. was a good actor of the 70's (Jaws is one of my all-time favs, Marathon Man, etc.) And although the 7-ups are not an Oscar-worthy movie, put it in a time a place (NY, early 70's, just like the French Connection) and give you some hard characters and a look at life as a cop at that time. And yes, the car hunt is one of the best in the best time.
