A teenage girl gets the horse of her dreams and is trained by a former Jockey to participate in London's Grand National Steeplechase. A good adaptation of the classic children's book, with excellent starting performance by Taylor as the energetic but polite youth. Rooney is OK as her coach, though he has too many melodramatic moments. Crisp and Revere are pretty good as Taylor's loving parents. Filmed in Technicolor, it looks pretty. The problem is that there are wheat elements, nothing very interesting, and it takes a little too long. The race is exciting, but could have been much more.
