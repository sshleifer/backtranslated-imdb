When the long-running 'Happy Ever After' came to an end, his characters - 'Terry & June Fletcher' were revived for the longer and popular sequel 'Terry & June', although their Fletcher surnames were changed to Medford. <br /> <br /> Terry received a new job and as a result he and June move to Purley where they end up on all kinds of scrapes - falling unwanted guests by visiting at an awkward moment, the boss who invites himself to Ter dinner and Terry trying to make his arm accidentally by DIY, but it picks up every time. A fellow IMDb user branded this view as "not smart" and "never well written". Good enough, it wasn't smart, but it was the whole point. As for "never well written" - some of the episodes were fairly substandard, I would admit, but overall I found it very well written, very amusing and very well done. <br /> <br /> It was hot heart slapstick, unlike the later BBC sitcom 'Keeping Appearances'. Eight different authors contributed to the nine series, giving the show a lot of scope. Terry Scott was a comic genius, as he has proven well in productions such as 'Hugh & I', the 'Carry On' movies and of course here! June Whitfield was also a comedy legend in its own right. <br /> <br /> I enjoy some modern shows, viz. 'Still Game', 'The Catherine Tate Show', 'Legit' and 'Empty'. I even enjoyed the 'alternative comedy' - 'Naked Video', 'The Young Ones' and 'The Comic Strip Presents', but I'm more likely to enjoy cute comedy, like this one. Humor you don't need to think about is great for when you feel and want to add up. For the record, 'Terry & June' were wonderful things. Special notes must be made of the catchy theme that caught the mood of the show very well!
