You will love or hate movies, like this thriller located inside a lonely asylum in a remote country. It is not so much of an abomination but a fusion of terrifying images and wackozoid spiritual patients. "Scream" is the best term to use in which was, of course, a popular check-in box known for some strange and bad behavior. Notice the "judge", who is going to lay the ax from behind the doctor! BRR-r-r-r !!! Not much else can be described here, except a bloody nice goodness, but if you get a chance, remember the familiar old saying by the hag lady: "Come out! Come out! And never come back!". Don't you want you not looked into the basement?
