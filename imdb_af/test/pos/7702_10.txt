A great exciting thriller the play is first time and the plot keeps you guessing. This well-educated and focused film is based on a true story and worth while, while Joe Penny is very well cast and Ann Gillian is convincing as the concerned and horrible sister. Joe proves again that his acting ability is great and the end done well. It's worth watching I hope they'll repeat it on any channel, I'll definitely record it. For Penny and Gillian fans it's worth your time. Rent it if you better try to buy what I'm going. Perfect early nineties thriller watch this <br /> <br /> movie it's great.
