I have to get old, because I've been seen for the first time. I look at HBO again. It's a very simple movie about 2 people who fall in love after they find out there are spouses a relationship. Plot is very thin, but the actors did very well in this movie. In the mix of Kristen Scott Thomas running for congress and Harrison Ford is a Home Affairs spokesperson, these two meet in unfortunate circumstances and fall in love. I love the soundtrack. Fit perfectly. One thing I can't figure out is that this movie had a $ 68 million budget. Was it spent? The plane crash or Harrison Ford's salary?
