I have never heard of Silverwing, then I saw it on Toon Disney and immediately loved it! I also think it's not just for kids, and people of all ages will enjoy it. It has a good plot, great effect and cool characters. I will always love the show, and I've heard it coming on DVD soon and I'm going to get it! I didn't read any of the books, but I intend to do so. The show deserves a 10 out of 10, and I hope the books are just as good. Well, that's all I have to say. But I still have 2 lines to fill, so ... what do you think is the coolest character? Mine is Shade, and my second favorite is Marina.
