Treading Water is a very beautiful film. I'll put it straight under the wonderful short movie: Cosa bella by Fiona MacKenzie. It's not just about going out, but also about tolerance and acceptance in general. I look forward to seeing more of Laurel Himmel's work in the future. The actors, Angie Redman and Nina Landey, are pretty good. The main character relationship could have been a little strengthened because we understand there is a very strong bond between them, but maybe it might be a bit explained. I'm surprised Angie Redman doesn't appear much in other movies. A good first step as director of Laurel Himmel, I'm sure there is more of her skills to see.
