I put this movie in the queue on a whim after a recent trip to NYC, and I couldn't believe I never heard it! It has all the acts of a cult classic, starting with the characters. They are archetypal roles that we recognize from every day life, but are so nude and fully realized by the actors they play. (Peter Stormare and Bai Ling's performances were particularly strong). Their interactions are poignant and well-grounded while at the same time, with subtle, peculiar humor unfortunately too scarce in American movies. Author / director Ramin Niami does a great job of weighing these scenes into a funny and moving portrait of a city of the past. Highly recommended!
