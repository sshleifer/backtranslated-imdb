"The Cell" is a journey in the mind of a serial killer and I mean it literally. The movie is about the journey, the world it shows during this journey, the destination doesn't matter. In my opinion, this journey through the mind makes such beautiful images other things matter, as long as they are not distracting. In fact, the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> We start with Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) in the mind of a catatonic boy. How it works does not matter, but it looks much like the virtual reality. She and other scientists including Henry West (Dylan Baker) and Miriam Kent (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) believe this method may work. Catherine enters the boy's mind and speaks to him in a world created entirely by the boy. She hopes she can do things that will eventually yield results. <br /> <br /> The real story then. A serial killer named Carl (Vincent D'Onofrio) just dumped the body of one of his victims. FBI Agents Ramsey (Jake Weber) and Novak (Vince Vaughn) are on this case. Another girl (Tara Subkoff) disappears and at that time, after forensic research on the dumping body, Carl can be traced and captured. There are two problems. 1. Carl just came in a coma; He's been sick for a long time. 2. His home and home with his last kidnapped victim are not in the same place. In a way, this part of the story is fairly standard. <br /> <br /> Things will soon become interesting again. To find out where the girl is, Catherine must go into Carl's mind. It is dangerous for many reasons. In short: Carl is unknown territory, schizophrenic and a serial killer. If Catherine Carl's mind starts to believe, the real world is, then her mind can convince her body; she can die in the mind of Carl. A song of how the last victim was killed, a fate this girl will have in about twenty hours, makes sure Catherine will try to get the place out of Carl's mind. <br /> <br /> It is the journey through this sick mind that this movie is worth to watch. Director Tarsem Singh, who previously did music videos, somehow goes back to these music videos. Each room in the imaginative world is another short stone made up of beautiful and sometimes haunting images. For me, the visual style was completely new, the way "Three Kings" had a new visual style one year earlier. If such a thing can make you like a movie, 'The Cell' won't disappoint. But fans of the thriller and horror genre can hold this movie anyway. The story itself, without the great fantasy world, is good enough for it. I think you have to be a little open minded, of course, events are not (yet) possible in our real world. Another very entertaining movie with great ideas that looks great.
