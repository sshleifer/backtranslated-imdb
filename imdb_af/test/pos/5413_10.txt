This film is a powerful commentary on family life in North America today. The story is built so well, it almost feels like it's happening across the street, now! If you are in any way related to your family and community, this movie will grab you and transport you to the Travis's home and not allow you to go until the credits are done. <br /> <br /> Our imaginary heroes, through a myriad of innocent circumstances, often unconsciously lead a path of grief, confusion and isolation. The Travis family, after a terrible tragedy, invites each of us; father, mother, brother and sister, in their respective lives to share their experience in a dynamic set of circumstances that just don't stop. We see all of the above and ultimately the joy, in powerful performances by the big players and the rest of the cast. This movie makes a movie-goer absolute treasure. <br /> <br /> Well done in a movie It's usually hard to find something special, but Sigourney Weaver's portrayal of Sandy Travis was excellent. I would be surprised if others did not recognize it as such. <br /> <br /> Clear a 10. Well done!
