I'm not sure if the television series is being discussed, exactly where the comment has to be made, but it's on television where The Lone Ranger made a name for itself. I am not even referring to the original radio broadcasts of this masked rider of the plains, but I am referring to a point where I had to see a movie, The Lone Ranger, in a little boy, about 9 or 10 years old. and never forgot. I remember being on a line or we were in the direction of the Paramount Theater. The theater was located in the theater district, if I remember correctly. It was straight, east to west of the building that dropped the ball on New Years Eve. Of course, if anyone knows, New York City. High up the street on the roof trusses there was a time and maybe even today large billboards will be advertising what is shown and so on. It was at that time that I looked up and was never again impressed as I was when I looked at that billboard to see The Lone Ranger over the roof trusses. It was wonderful. It made an impression and was never forgotten. That day we saw the Lone Ranger. This was the story of how the Lone Ranger was born. The horrible ambush that the Texas Rangers drove and the subsequent rebirth of one of its fallen heroes. It was in this film that we learn that the Lone Ranger will not shoot to kill, but to injure so that the law can be the judge. This kind of thinking is so worthwhile. that we can be good at learning something from history. This is where we learn that Tonto discovers the fallen Ranger and the symbol of the youth friendship that the Lone Ranger announced earlier when he, as a younger person, is the aide of a Tonto-injured young person. For the sake of the help he gave, Tonto gave his faithful friend, a symbol of his thanks, who was now part of a necklace that Tonto recognized. Tonto said, "You're Kemosabe." The Lone Ranger said, "Kemo Is It Known? Tonto then tells the story of this t rusty exploration" (the meaning of Kemosabe). I think the Lone Ranger is one of the true heroes of the silver screen and one of the great heroes of television. It should also be said that these highly respected individuals tried Clayton Moore and Jay Silverheels to live there according to the legend of The Lone Ranger. It may well be that there is an inspirational story in the story of the Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto. I was so happy with the ability to find and buy the DVDs. , that I have stayed a Saturday morning and look at the many episodes now available. Long Live The Lone Ranger and his faithful companion Tonto-Hi-Ho Silver-
