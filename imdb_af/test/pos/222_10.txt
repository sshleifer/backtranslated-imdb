The funniest show ever on TV, though the humor is not for everyone. I realize it would have been difficult to keep the show fresh if it lasted longer, but it is a pity that only six episodes have been filmed. The gags quickly fly from the opening credits to the end when you see Drebin and his boss, Ed Hocken, pretending to be in the freezer when the closing credits rolled, while the criminal (still-moving) everyone else would see and try escape. In another episode, the building began around them, as Drebin and Hocken remained in freezing mode. <br /> <br /> Leslie Nielsen was comical glamor like Frank Drebin and the perfect fit for this show ?? how he managed to keep a straight face through some of these things is beyond me. Because the jokes and siggats came so often and quickly, you can see and catch the episodes a 2nd and 3rd time you missed for the first time. If you are like me, you can look them over and over and still laugh at yourself. Even the jokes that didn't seem sensible or seemingly worked for any reason, like the "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln" rule in the opening notice, somehow? Maybe they were thrown exactly for that. <br /> <br /> The police group swore old Quinn Martin detectives / police performances of the seventies, with the words "Act Two" appearing on the screen, immediately followed by "Yankees One" or another . The title of the episode will appear on the screen on the opening credits, but the announcer will print a completely different title. My favorite jokes and lines from this series are far too much to list, but one of my favorites is when Drebin has tried a boxer who previously thought fights: "Do you think you can win the Champ?" The boxer responds: "I can take him blindly!" To which Drebin responds, "But what if he's not blindfolded?" A few minutes later, referring to the boxer's small icy apartment, Drebin told him: "I'm going to help you get out of this sewer." The next thing you see is Drebin through a manhole cover on the street! In another episode, Drebin and Hocken questioned a bombing suspect's flimsy alibi. Drebin, don't believe him, says, "Okay, let's say you've gone to the movies." After a slight pause, Drebin, Hocken and the suspect all see the camera and say unique: "You went the movies." A few moments later, when Drebin was forced to run the alleged bomber because of a lack of evidence, he stormed and shouted, "Say the bomber turns off!" What comes next is a policeman who gives the thumb-on signal to a WWII plane on a runway right outside the building! While there were many classic Drebin quotes, one particularly memorable one was: "Sorry to bother your Mrs Twice. We would have come earlier, but your husband was not dead." Another classic was, "I'm a locksmith and I'm a locksmith." When a visibly shaken victim's father is asked, Drebin asks: "What am I doing, do I?" ?? Drebin, in classic deadpan fashion, reacts back, "Well, as I understand it, you're in the textile industry." As I said, the humor is not for everyone? many people will simply not get it. During the show's short run, I remember that the reaction was very mixed. Some people thought it was completely hysterical and one of the funniest things, while others thought it was stupid and unique. For me, Police Office, even 20+ years later, is the funniest thing I've ever seen on TV. For younger viewers who enjoy this kind of humor, but who have never seen the police team, because they were too young when the series initially aired, I strongly recommend. I found the six episodes even funny than the subsequent "Naked Gun" movies.
