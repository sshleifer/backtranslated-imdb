These immortal lines begin with the Jack Starret masterpiece, The Dion Brothers. The plot centers around two blue crows of West Virginia brothers (Stacy Keach and Frederic Forrest) who commit robberies hoping to use the money to open a seafood restaurant !!? What follows is quite an adventure, and many comedic events follow. The action scenes are all in addition and consist of some well-realized shootouts. The latter is absolutely incredible and takes place in a deserted building demolished by a wreckage! The film is written by newly-known director Terrence Malick and features an early appearance by Margot Kidder. All in all, an excellent hidden gem of the 70's and easily one of the best action / comedy hybrids each made. Hopefully it will soon get a decent widescreen DVD release.
