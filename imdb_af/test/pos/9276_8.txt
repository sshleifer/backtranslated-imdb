I suspect there are several tracks of this document that do the rounds. The copy I saw focused heavily on Joe's erotic films, referring to his horror output in passing. There are numerous X-rated movies presented in their X-rated glory, and EMMANUELLE in AMERICA's legendary snuff material (the breasts are cut off) are generated screen time. <br /> <br /> Interviews with the most enjoyable Joe are informative and open-minded. He is a modest, articulating gentleman and discusses his interest in shocking audiences, why he wanted to disgrace eroticism and how he was responsible for one of his gay-changing artists. <br /> <br /> His friendship and working relationship with Indonesian beauty Laura Gemser is touched, and his careless attitude to shooting hardcore. <br /> <br /> Joe D'Amato embodies an incredible time in continental theater that is now over. It's great to see a documentary dedication to him and his fine, unique work. <br /> <br /> RIP, Joe.
