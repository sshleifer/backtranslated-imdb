It's really a good movie. Full of love and humor, it forces the audience to really care for the characters and participate in their journey. Michael Parness has managed to meet a large role-players of top players, a small miracle for a first film. They were undoubtedly moved to help him tell this beautiful story. David Krumoltz carries the film with his understated intensity and honesty. Natasha Lyonne is unpredictable, surprising, and still quite like Grace. Also a big twist by Karen Black (great to see her again on the screen) as Grace's crazy but sympathetic mother. It is cut through, allowing us the relief of laughter when we face the pain of life. The play is immaculate, the editing stiff, the direction inspired, and the music creates an appropriate backdrop of mood. Given the current Hollywood Blockbuster craze, full of budget, big names, car accidents and special effects, 'Max & Grace' is a refreshing departure. Give yourself a treat and see this movie.
