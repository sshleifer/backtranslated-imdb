Clifton Webb as "Mr. Scoutmaster" is one of the all-time greats for comedy and remembers an innocence that is now being reduced in the world. I can't understand why the networks like American Movie Classics and such movies don't show, though I have requested it again and again. <br /> <br /> This movie should now be shown to children for portraying loyalty, respect, dedication and solution to reach the best possible on an individual basis. There is so much low self-esteem that is spoken in today's daily life, but this movie, among many others, will be a great learning tool for today's younger generation to see what can be achieved by common sense and decency and pride in yourself and your achievements to improve yourself. Sad that this type of movie doesn't appeal to modern audiences. It certainly appealed to our 'baby boomer' generation yesterday. OLD LESSIONS ARE UNIVERSAL AND TEMPORARY.
