Without going in any detail of a good thing ... if there is a somewhat challenging ... TV movie, it seems that there is a consensus among the users that there is no one to blame here. <br /> <br /> I disagree. Yes, the young male lover of Beverly D'Angelo, played by Rob Estes, can be young and horny (and beautiful) because he doesn't get as much as he wants from mother, that doesn't mean he can go to bed. don't climb and have sex with daughter OK, he can use the excuse, he just wanted to watch TV, but I didn't buy it. People must take responsibility for their actions. Not only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable teenager, when he was supposedly "the responsible adult", he said, "Your mother should never know about it." How responsible was he then? Yes, it's a good movie, but he has what comes to him. Don't kid yourself children that what happened is "nobody's fault".
