This film was my first introduction to the talents of Chris Cooper. I was deeply impressed with the character he played. I knew when I saw the movie that would get more good stuff from this talented actor. He is playing a union captain who is feeding with some of the men who have been nominated in East Kentucky. They happen on the farm of a Sesech woman whose husband chose to go to the Confederation. <br /> <br /> The depiction of East Kentucky, and its severely divided sentiments during the War, is so accurate. If you are looking for a war movie with lots of blood and guts, it won't be. If you are looking for a drama that explores the psychology of people in war, actually and philosophically, it is the best study of how divided loyalty influenced the interaction of people in border states during the American civil war.
