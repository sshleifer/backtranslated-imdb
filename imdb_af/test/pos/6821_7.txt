Joseph Conrad's timeless novel, Heart of Darkness, was portrayed in the 1994 movie. I read Conrad's novel, and I have to say, although I prefer the novel itself, the movie was a good portrayal. The set and costume designs brought Conrad's novel alive when we followed Marlow's journey. The acting also brought the characters to life through the ways, voices and personalities. When reading the novel, I recommend that you also watch this movie. If you didn't read the novel, the movie might be harder to follow. Conrad's heart of darkness is too full of action, emotion, and information to make in a movie that's just half an hour. Therefore, if you did not read the novel, the plot in the movie may seem to be moving. Overall I gave this movie a seven out of ten. The basic plot of the novel was brought to the screen with great sets, costumes and plays. However, nothing can replace Joseph Conrad's original work.
