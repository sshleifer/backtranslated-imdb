I watched fantabulosa! Michael Sheen has become one of my favorite actors over the past few years, and if you haven't seen him before you are ashamed and second, get your hands on a copy of Heartlands of Dirty Filthy Love. This production has not disappointed - Michael Sheen has turned himself almost magically into Kenneth Williams and has given a show so tragic as it was skillful. To take away nothing of the other performances, but like Kenneth, Michael really stole the shows. I don't know how he does it, but every show I've seen made Michael appear to be metamorphic until the character he plays is truly credible. And no matter how difficult I can, I can't make him guilty. Must fetch my tea, enjoy!
