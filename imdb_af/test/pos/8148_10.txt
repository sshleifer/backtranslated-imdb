Last days for me was a very moving movie, it showed how difficult and respect the gay community really is. The film captures true passion and explores the feelings of these two characters. The movie is a real compassion for the gay community, as it really speaks to the gay man / woman. Personally, I think it's about high time that the homosexual community of all religions no longer needs to be ashamed of it, just because there is a beautiful self. The movie was a lot of eye opener for me, because I couldn't believe how anti-homosexual this world really is. Even at schools if a child doesn't like something, it will refer to him as "gay". I hope that more film like this one is made, and that they are not only labeled as a "Gay" movie, but as a love story, since I believe that gay directors have to get up and make their story have to tell their eyes.
