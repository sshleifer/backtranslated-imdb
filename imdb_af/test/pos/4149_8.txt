This review is in response to the presentation and wondering how the movie was really correct ... <br /> <br /> See this movie last year and found it inspiring immigrants, like my Italian grandparents by Ellis Island arrived at the turn of the last century, would subject themselves to all sorts of intrusive inspections just to enter America. <br /> <br /> It was definitely eye-opening, because my grandparents have never spoken of anything terribly there. My grandmother was 5 years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrived. <br /> <br /> I just returned from a trip to New York where I had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island and the museum is actually walking you through the Immigration Evaluation Process - The filmmaker did, of course, his research, until medical exams and equipment, questions and puzzles. They are all there at the museum. Even the wedding photos and the review board room - Virtually correct! Anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie. Inspiring to say the least.
