An old man drives his bike down a village road when a car comes out of nowhere, kills him and drives him. The rest of the film is spent discovering who hit him, why he was hit, and what the consequences of this murder on the rest of the town would be. Separate Lies are indeed a very British movie. I'm not saying hit accidents are a particularly British phenomenon, but the way everyone responds to this tragedy is very British. Tom Wilkinson plays James Manning, a hard-working, respectful citizen with a "stiff-top lip" attitude to the tragedy. His wife, Anne (Emily Watson), who is 20 years younger than her husband, is more emotional, more impulsive and more prone to drama. <br /> <br /> The man who really lives in this sleepy village is playboy millionaire William Bule, played by a lovely devilish Rupert Everett (most American audiences will remember him forever as Julia Roberts's gay friend who each scene in My best friend's wedding stolen completely). In Separate Lies, Everett is cruel, cold and selfish, but he is an absolute blast on the screen. No, it's not that exciting of a movie title (Separate Lies? How did they end up with that lame and forgetful title? Didn't they just have a marketing team? Did they just care to get people to this film?), but beyond the title is a heartbreaking drama about the power of forgiveness.
