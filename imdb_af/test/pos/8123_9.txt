Through the acting in this movie it is sometimes difficult not to imagine the role players portraying themselves. Unbridled passion and acting make it a very enjoyable and engaging film. Wouldn't even know about it, except for HBO last night. And the biggest reason I like British movies is much better than Americans is that the actors are not afraid to act as needed.
