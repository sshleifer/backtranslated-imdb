Jamie Foxx played an amazing job playing Ray Charles. I loved this movie because every time there will be a flashback scene and then the current movie. When Ray Charles was small, he became blind and his mother didn't give him birth. She was a strong woman who didn't treat him differently because he was blind. She made him do things on his own and it really impressed him to later become a good musician. His mother also sent him to school. When Ray Charles became a man, he could stand for himself, but there was a downfall in drugs, sex and betrayal. If I am discouraged about something, I can only think of this movie and it will inspire me.
