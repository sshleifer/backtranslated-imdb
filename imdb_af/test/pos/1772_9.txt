Sometimes it is difficult to be a pirate ... but by golly Mrs. Jean Peters a lot of fun to try - and this shows especially during her first spot of friendly sword play with Blackbeard (Mr Thomas Gomez - highly surprising) when the sheer joy of performing is evident on her face. Fifty years later Feminists intend to grab this movie as a kind of anthem for empowering women in a male dominant society, but I have serious doubts that either M.Tourneur or Miss. Peters had such a concept in their heads at the time. It was an exciting, entertaining family run with absolutely no pretensions, hidden meanings or alternative agenda. It was fun. Louis Jourdan is both overwhelming and insidious as her love interests. Mr. Herbert Chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor. Mr James Robertson Justice is just a little incredible than the bosun. But it's Miss. Peters who remembers. Usually adolescent, illiterate, tough but vulnerable, wonderful agile, and ultimately courageous, she is everyone's idea of ​​a lady pirate. There was a definite occasion for her in fine costume roles - that she didn't decide to grab it, is a regret at the regret.
