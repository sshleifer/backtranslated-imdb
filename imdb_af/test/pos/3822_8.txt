Oh the Outer Limits. I love the show. It was creepy, or right secret. I loved all the genres of the show, from horror, to tension to secret, whatever the genre, it was good. I think I had to start watching after it was canceled, when Sci-fi showed it again, or played marathons. It was a very good performance. I don't know all about the seasons, and everything, but I remember it every time I fly the screen and the voice on the TV says, "There's nothing wrong with your television. Try to adjust the picture." I will squeel with joy. It was a good performance, and I enjoy watching it come. I give it a healthy 8 out of 10.
