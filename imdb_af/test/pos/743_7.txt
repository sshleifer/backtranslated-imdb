Young, ambitious nurse Mrs. Charlotee (Rosie Holotik) is sent to a spiritual asylum in the middle of nowhere to work. In the course of 3 days she meets strange events, even a patient in her bedroom looks at her, but she remains. The mind patients are all a little eye roller (especially by the Judge), but my favorite was the old mad prayer (Rhea MacAdams). The storyline is good at its best, and the play is surprisingly good, but after a while it becomes a bit much. But it's still fun, strange, strange and original. <br /> <br /> Note: The thing in the basement is hardly awful, so the title is a bit of bananas.
