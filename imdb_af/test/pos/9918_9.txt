If you don't like Italian horror, you won't like this movie. On that note ... <br /> <br /> "Overall ... it was a terrible experience ... A lot of things happened. Vanessa Redgrave was scheduled to be in the movie, and she pulled out. One of the actors I was married, but by the end of the photo that was finished. My dad died during the shooting ... all kinds of things. "-Dario Argento about making" Opera "<br /> <br /> I was really impressed with Argento and the movie he made here - especially at such difficult circumstances. The whole mystique of Macbeth and his curse on those trying to increase the play, add unfinished volumes to "Opera." Through the film, Argento introduces some of its smartest (and audience-oriented) tricks. A young opera singer, Christina, was hit by a violent psychopath, forcing her to watch a series of brutal murders. By attaching various sharp blades to Christina's eyelids, the murderer makes it impossible for her to close her eyes. "Look good. If you close your eyes, you'll tear them apart!" <br /> <br /> Clearly, Argento has great care for building up the faux-Macbeth opera and paying his hard work . Add to this some memorable brutal murders, an incredibly tense sequel and the ingenious use of POV to portray a certain character (the role of Vanessa Redgrave came out, thank God) and you have one of the best Italian horror movies ever created. <br /> <br /> It said - it's still Italian horror. Why Christina never wants to tell anyone of these brutal murders is beyond anyone's understanding. Some scenes can be difficult for some viewers to stomach, but personally, I feel more tension about Christina and her eyes than any of the brutal victims in the movie. The final for "Tenebrae" beat my stomach more than anything in "Opera", but it's probably just me. <br /> <br /> And the last five minutes ... Argento wanted it, he filmed it, and he's fought to keep it in the movie. Absolutely no one likes it, I lock myself in, but it's not enough to ruin the rest of the movie for me. It remains one of Argento's best films so far. <br /> <br /> 9/10
