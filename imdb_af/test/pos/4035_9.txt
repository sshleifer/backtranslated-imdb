"D.O.A" is an acting and entertaining picture from start to finish. Dennis Quaid is at his best; and Quaid is unfortunately one of the most underused talents in Hollywood. His beau Meg Ryan also appears with him, but as usual it doesn't really happen. <br /> <br /> The film is stylish throughout, and captures a number of influences to capture. his 'seamy' feel. Do you want to admit that it is actually directed by two people? The answer is no. The whole thing is wonderful, from its innovative camera work to its unashamed use of black and white photography. All these elements help keep the proceedings fresh. <br /> <br /> The biggest excitement here is to be with the dialogue, it's funny but complicated, don't waste a word and still manages to be entertaining. The script for this is like a bag of art. <br /> <br /> For years I noticed it before catching it late at night. If this is the first thing you heard about it, don't leave it as I did! Catch it soon, it's really ... too! <br /> <br /> If you're in the mood for a solid genre movie that surprises every turn, it's really the account. <Br /> <br />
