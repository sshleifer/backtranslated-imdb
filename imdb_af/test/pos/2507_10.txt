I'm a big, heterosexual, male ex-bouncer, former rugby player and ex-boxer, and I love this movie. <br /> <br /> It's not Mystic River. It's a piece of fluff. But there is a living room for the fluff, and when that fluff is shot in the spectacle, well-acted by attractive, nice people, cleverly typed and full of good dialogue, there's even more room for it. <br /> <br /> I'm not the biggest Tom Selleck fan. But he's good at this. So are Julianne Nich Olson, Ellen Degeneres, Kate Capshaw and even Tom Everett Scott (what you do! Sadness and capriciousness and farce and even some redemption. <br /> <br /> Any (male) judge who is this movie , we will say, not completely confident in his masculinity, meanwhile I will still catch some bits without excuse when it appears on the cable.
