I only saw the movie a few years ago and was completely and completely impressed, but its sensuality. It's one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, though it may seem a bit pretentious and artificial - too much, if you like. Anyway, one thing is for sure - the camera man did a good job - every photo deserves to cut the film and display as a separate art spot, similar to the Chirico's or Bernard Buffet's paintings. <br /> <br /> The music is a perfect background for the story, especially U2's one played on the beach scene between the first and second novels. As far as the casting is concerned, I cannot be objective, as I love Sophie Marceau and Jean Renaue and can't add to the praises of others. <br /> <br /> The fact that many (critics and sophisticated in the film) criticized the film for the second time with a more critical eye. Undoubtedly the environment is wonderful and the casting is beautiful. But it's somehow not enough to make a comprehensive and coherent movie. The second novel (when Sophie Marceau tells her story to Malcovic is somehow superficial and doesn't tell much about the motivations of the people involved. It's just about shooting a beautiful and sensual love image with the naked Marceau or what?). Apparently, it doesn't add to the idea of ​​the movie, and even Malcovic's screaming voice can't link it to the main chart. <br /> <br /> Other stories are more justified and are really well shot, leaving many logical errors within them. The scene when Jean Reneau is the city through the large window of his apartment on the top of the high-rise city view is absolutely incredible. The sense of damp air and delicate haze, spread by the first "Ferrera" scene, can literally be traced through the screen. No doubt, Antonioni is a wonderful master of shades and semi-shades. My favorite novel is the last - the most romantic, deep and meaningful - I think it is the most Antonioni-like in the whole movie - almost a parable. The overall positive impression of the movie is mainly due to the last one shot somewhere in a small Ghotic Italian town, with its winding narrow streets and crooked pavements, fountains with the eau-drinkable and monumental cathedrals. It was laconic but really touching. <br /> <br /> I hope My impressions and comments on the movie, how chaotic they are, will motivate someone to watch an evening (it works better with home theater, to give someone on your side, as in the movie). Enjoy. <br /> <br /> I beg for the imperfect English and any possible misconceptions
