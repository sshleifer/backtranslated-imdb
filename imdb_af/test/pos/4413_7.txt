Snap, crackle, pop! The whining sound of every change in camera angle. And it is not to mention the white flashes and the cut ends of almost every saying. What on earth were they in the working room? Or could it be that this approach was deliberate? Certainly not. What purpose can it serve? Despite all its technical shortcomings, it is an interesting film depicting a day in the life of Joe, a hustler, determined to earn $ 200 for his wife's pregnant girlfriend. Joe Dallesandro is outstanding as the easy-going, passive, retracted young man who is willing to leave the other person most of the talk while listening in his eyes with a distant look. <br /> <br /> The story is slim and sketchy, relying on the uncertain life trusted by a man on comfortable street sex to support his young wife and baby. One thing is certain, Joe is unpleasant when it comes to denying sex or an artist. Understandable, because he has a pretty face and just as beautiful body. <br /> <br /> There's a scene in the movie that is remarkably effective. There is no sound, no dialogue. Joe is naked on the floor feeding crumbs to his little baby. There are beautiful tranquility and tenderness trapped in these quiet moments. <br /> <br /> Another scene of entertaining interest is the one in which Joe desperately looks for a $ 100 gym friend loan, which comes to the point of asking a very critical approach. <br /> <br /> Joe is interested but hesitant in his conversation when an artist gives him an uninterrupted resumption of Greek and Roman art. It's a preliminary opportunity for another opportunity when Joe relieves himself of his clothes and throws in the right classical style as the discussion. <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie we get the impression that we need to know Joe well. well. He uncovered more than his soul.
