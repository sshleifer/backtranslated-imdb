This movie is "the" stupid comedy of the year, and probably the best thing about Mike Judge since "Office Space". If you're a Mike Judge fan, or enjoy shows like Futurama, you're doing yourself a serious disservice by jumping over this little-known, limited release. Although the DVD contains very few bonus features, this movie is definitely funny enough to set it up for lack of value. <br /> <br /> This movie is about a lower grunt named Joe Bowers (played by Luke Wilson) which is part of a top secret Army experiment designed to save Army staff in peace time so that they can be thawed in war time to fight for our country. However, it takes an interesting turn as the general is in charge of the operation in a prostitution ring and the experiment is anything but forgotten. Bowers, and his sidekick Rita (played by Maya Rudolph) wake up in the year 2505, where the natural population became more and more stupid by natural selection. Now Joe and Rita have to find their way to a time machine to return to the year 2005 with the help of Frito (played by Dax Shepard). <br /> <br /> What I really enjoyed about this movie was Mike Judge's comic satire over the course of American history over the past 50 years, and how humanity progresses over the next 500 years. This is most evident from the ad in the movie, which has become a staple of American culture. With shows like South Park in mainstream media, it is easy to see how conclusions can be drawn that profanity has become a marketing tool in the future. The film is humorously portrayed with subtle things like "Fudd-Ruckers" that change their name to "Butt-F # # ers" and an advertising billboard. "If you don't smoke Tarryltons ... F # # # You!" I can no longer laugh at Carls Jr's role in the future, with their slogan "F ### you ... I eat" and their automatic kiosks advertising their "Extra Big-A # # Tacos" themselves. (with more molecules)! This movie contains everything I go to for the movies. Excellent, sharp, witty comedy as well as an impressive plot make this DVD one for centuries. But be warned. If you're not a fan of Mike Judge, don't mind Beavis and Butthead, or don't have a sense of humor, then this movie is probably not a good match for you. Otherwise, I'd say it's probably the funniest movie to get out of 2506 ... I mean 2006.
