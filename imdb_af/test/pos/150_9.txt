The big thing about Dors, Chanwook Park's latest movie, is that it's anti-Twilight. Some of you may take it as a minus, but in reality it is a big plus. Park takes the method of vampirism seriously, and also the dry love story between Sang-hyeon and Tae-Joo. We see the conflicts of both characters. Sang-hyeon is a priest who undergoes a medical experiment that does not reveal him, but turns him into a sickly but blue vampire, and Tae-Joo with her mother and "idiot" brother. , the latter is murdered by singing like in a very strong melodrama. There is nothing terribly indifferent or indifferent to the story and characters at any stage, and the implications come out of religion well in advance. (For example, singing is seen as a healer of all kinds, because he rose from the dead because of his vampirism, even if he just can't be and knows it) on top of that of good against evil, press it in another plane kinematic. <br /> <br /> The Thirst also comes up with the wonderful standard of works that Park has exhibited with Oldboy, Lady Vengeance and the underdogs I'm a Cyborg but that's good, should be considered a given. Thirst is a film with a juicy story and bizarre suburban characters, and is shot and edited for a mood that is satirical, romantic / erotic, dramatic and ultimately fantastic. And it doesn't always treat vampirsim as something of a simple horror movie set-up (though as a horror movie Park has more than its part of scary scenes). It is more akin to the movie Near Dark, which has never called the word vampire, but lets it know it and treated it with sincerity and some sort of clear command and that the disease itself and its effect on man's existence Maybe scarcer. as the murder or bloodshed. Once you see that one vampire jumps or makes his wounds really big, you've seen everything. <br /> <br /> Dors also meant a bad sense of humor, like Oldboy, just here with a bite meant to emphasize bizarre physical conditions of being. An example of this can be found in the prosperity of the priest to suck blood from people in the coma, taking their blood tube and sucking on the floor. Or the way Tae-Joo holds on to one human scrap by keeping her mother alive, even though she had something like a stroke and could just cut her eyes and tap one finger as a way to respond to the leeches I brought pain and horror to her house. But these moments are like icing sugar on the cake to make it a complete experience. What thirsts in the mind is how elements come together, from drama and existential pains, to a Bunuelian-surreal sense of Catholicism. I especially loved the dynamic between Sang-Hyeon and the other priest who gives his arm sucked but actually wants to be a vampire), and of the erotic: the scenes that the priest eventually gives in Tae-Joo are incredible in their fit and length of shots and how real it gets. Not in a pornographic way, but in the sense of the characters' release and escape, which does not go long over the scope of the story. <br /> <br /> If it's not as old as Oldboy, it's not something to carp over. Not all movies Chanwook Park directs will reach the stature of his masterpiece (and at least he will always be known as the man who directed that movie). But Thrist is an excellent addition to his oeuvre, and to the serious series of vampire films in general. The movies are sharp and exciting and even dangerous (and what a white room of 'daylight' lives the characters!), The humor is dark and hilarious, the play is intense and moody, especially from the subtle strokes of Song Kangho And the odd evil and surprising vulnerability of Kim OK-fin, and the end, when it finally comes there, is one of the most wonderful vampire movie ends you've been talking about for years, in a good way. In a fight between Thirst and Twilight, Thirst takes the knockout in the first round. Between the right one in or near dark it is harder to call. 9.5 / 10
