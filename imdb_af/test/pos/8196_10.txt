After watching the movie a few times, I found so many subtle touches and emotions in the dialogue. Jing Ke, the Assassin is one of the favorite movie characters of all time. This fine Chinese actress says more with his eyes and his economy of words and movements, then a big screen American actor today. The emperor, Qin, is brilliant because he leads the audience to believe in the kindness in his heart, just for the cruel acts on the people to unleash him. The promises he made with incredible passion and broken with an evil fist. Gong Li, as in just about every movie I've ever seen her, is simply fantastic. Her screen domination is so graceful and emotionally charged. <br /> <br /> If you couldn't say, I loved this movie. <br /> <br />
