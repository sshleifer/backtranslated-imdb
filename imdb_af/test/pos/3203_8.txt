The Killing Yard is a good movie, although it is sometimes uneven. Morris Chestnut is making a phenomenal effort as a mentally wounded and jailed prison, and Alan Alda's presence as his defense attorney is nothing but genius. The emotion and mourning reality portrayed in the movie's screens has the ability to place viewers directly into the events. I was not even born when the Attica riot took place, but through extensive research I find that "The Killing Yard" is the story, it is just righteous. I would definitely recommend this movie to any educational or activist group as a much needed learning tool.
