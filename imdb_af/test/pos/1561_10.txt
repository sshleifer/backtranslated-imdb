to the story. This is the reality mixed with Americana and very original. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is a young girl tired of her boring work at a minimum wage job in New England. Her messy boss suggested her - she stopped and took some cash from the register. Driving from New Hampshire to Miami, Florida, is not a short trip, and her Ford Escort dies out. She then meets a personal older couple, portrayed by Judith Ivey and Bill Raymond. They have a garage and merely offer her help. It's not safe for a girl to be alone on the road. Especially I-95. <br /> <br /> Emily Grace is very realistic like Alice, and initially the Judith Ivey character helps her; buy her decent clothes, cosmetics, etc. First of all, it's a great holiday for Alice, who hopes to join her friend, who attends the University of Miami. There is interesting cinematography, as the trio run the RV to Florida: the resting place, leafy landscape and ultimately beautiful mountains of North Carolina. <br /> <br /> Eventually something is wrong, and the Ivey character apparently produced stories about her daughter as well as her husband, who now seems a bit sinister. <br /> <br /> I won't spoil the outcome of this movie, but it will end positively when the audience is waiting for tension. remind me a little bit of Spielberg's "Duel" - while it was not so threatening at first - the moral of the story - you never know what people think, especially if you drive over. Beware !!. You will enjoy this movie.
