People who know me say I have a weakness for animated movies. <br /> <br /> To be fair, those people are HALF right. My real weakness is for particularly well-animated movies, like this vintage Max and David Fleischer family movie. <br /> <br /> You may think of yourself, "Well, if it's so good, why didn't I hear it?" Fair question. This movie was released the same week as the attacks on Pearl Harbor. The inevitable bad timing caused the film to sink into relative darkness. However, things look like this is finally released on DVD under the title "BUGVILLE". <br /> <br /> It's funny that the movie went through it, reflecting the mirror image of the real plot. Although some people claim that the movie is trying to send out an environmental message, I personally think that the main idea of ​​the movie is perseverance through adversity and difficult times (at that time the country barely pulled out of the depression). <br /> <br /> Our grasshopper, Hoppity, desperately wants to help his endangered community. Problem: Every time he tries, either by the bad will of others or by simple accident, he fails miserably ... and slowly begins to deserve the contempt of the people he tries to save. Although he does his best to keep a positive outlook, he occasionally breaks down and it is only through the encouragement and support of his friends that he returns to his feet and fights the good fight. Just a healthy reminder that nobody is really self-sufficient. <br /> <br /> "Good," you say. "It has a good message (two actually). Does it really make it really good?" <br /> <br /> My answer: Partly. <br /> <br /> It's not just the message that makes this movie special. This is the characterization. This is one of those movies where you can only see the personality of each rollid in their animation. You almost don't even need the spoken lines. A good way to summarize it all is "energetic" or "alive". Many of the movies used the point of sale, "dearest players". When I hear that line, it always makes me this movie. <br /> <br /> Case in point, the bad guys: Swat the Fly and Smack the Mosquito. Many movies have "lovely" villains, but I don't think you will find it as entertaining or engaging as this community. Forget about 3 Stooges Cartoon from the 60's. Swat and Smack is the closest thing to an animated version of Moe and Curly (but unfortunately not Larry) you'll ever find. Almost all the funniest moments in one way or another involve these gruesome twins. Yes, they are rotten, nothing, but you still care for them. This is the kind of power you only see from a very talented writer, director and crew. <br /> <br /> The movie features two short jokes that revolve around racial stereotypes (Native Americans and Chinese). I don't think they are meant to be malicious; but they are there, regardless. They didn't bother me, but it would be pretty unfair to warn anyone they might be bothering. <br /> <br /> So, if you share my weakness (and I think you do), give this one a turn.
