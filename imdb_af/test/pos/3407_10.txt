A story about love and hate, tragedy and happiness, and above all friendship that takes place in the very interesting time of the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> Find your interest in history, get emotionally involved and wait for your next episode. <br /> <br /> Furthermore, the foundry was fantastic. Many superstars appear briefly, the main roles being played by a large variety of talented mimes. Kirstie Alley and Terri Garber should be mentioned here - this is just an excellent example for a TV production as it should be. <br /> <br /> Not to forget the sheer beauty of Wendy Kilbourne depicting Constance :-)
