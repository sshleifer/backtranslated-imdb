DO NOT LOOK IN THE BASE This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties list. The flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic. The main character, though much warmer than most low-budget items, is a fairly standard low budget lead. The Doctor Masters character is well written and well-done. Some of the smaller characters are a bit stupid, but add to the nostalgia of the movie. It's Campy. I'm not trying to lie. The character that makes this big is a Faulcan Man-Child named Sam, one of the patients in this sanatorium-forged movie. The gore is fairly standard, although I think the color of the blood is wonderful. This is so. Red. This movie, I believe, was poorly received because it was advertising scheme. Some stupid little ad-executives got their dirty hands on it and thought, "Let's scratch the AD campaign for Last House on the left, it's going well." Little ones like this have destroyed the world of film. All balls and no brain. Also, the editor was or may not be an alcoholic. Maybe everyone is drunk. You will see what I mean. Another small note. Don't buy it from the Wally-Mart dollar rack. They cut it and were incompatible. Try to find the longest track you can get.
