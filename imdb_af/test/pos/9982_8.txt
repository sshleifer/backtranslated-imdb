Both Disney and Bill Paxton did a good job of carrying a story that was virtually based. You don't have to keep the game golf to appreciate the story of one man's struggle to overcome the odds. This can be based on any sport or simply on any other situation involving competition, although this one is only related to Golf. The only problem I have with the story is that I like all the main characters, esp. Mr Ouimet. Mr. Francis Ouimet is a typical young man of his time, the turn of the century America, where "class lines" are well defined and woe to anyone who resigns to try to rise above his "class". I did some historical research and my biggest question was indeed answered, to my satisfaction. Although the circumstances are a little different to those portrayed in the movie, I have lost a sense of content. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, I believe you will.
