I expected this movie to suck, but what I got was a nice good slasher / gore movie. Most of the deaths are sufficiently brutal. The teens are decent, with Penny McNamee definitely the best of the bunch. Rachael Taylor looks like a young Christie Brinkley, but doesn't bring much to the movie. Kane was good as the killer and is totally credible as a scary juggernaut. I saw the "twist" from miles, but I still enjoyed the movie. <br /> <br /> But that really gave me the direction. Gregory Dark can actually have a career in legitimate film in front of him. Aside from using the horror movie "speed cam" (you know, where as the man's face is shaken quickly?), There are some good shots here. The camera angles and environments really emphasize Kane's size, so it looks even bigger than it actually is. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a deep story or characters, that's not the case. But that's not what treasure movies are about. If you are looking for good violence or if you are in gory movies, it goes out!
