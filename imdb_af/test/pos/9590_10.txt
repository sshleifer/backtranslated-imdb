I'm like the rest of the fans who love this comedy, I expected it on DVD. I got it on VHS and got so tired and waiting for a release and worried that my VHS copy would ruin, I got the equipment to get it on DVD. The picture and sound are excellent to my utmost surprise. If someone else wants a copy, leave me a line <br /> <br /> stone_stew@yahoo.co.uk <br /> <br /> and for £ 7.00 I put it on a DVD, print the DVD and get it in the post to you. £ 7.00 only covers my costs and included deliveries, etc. With maybe a little over, so I don't want to make money, I just want the world to see this ignored jewel of a comedy. I recently saw a copy of ebay. got over £ 26, amazing. How they can't release this classic. Email me for payment details such as check or Paypal etc. etc.
