Uzumaki is a visually beautiful movie, and I don't think anyone can argue it. But unfortunately the story is somewhat flat. <br /> <br /> The movie is very entertaining. It uses it's wild style to tell a somewhat non-existent story. The film works almost, just based on its characters and style, but in my opinion there is something to be desired.
