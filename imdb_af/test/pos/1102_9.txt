I watched this movie by one of the actors, and it definitely agrees with a lot coming from Sth. Australia in terms of overall * tone, * which is really dark and moody. <br /> <br /> I thought the little boy in the movie was excellent. Mostly, child actors are * hammed * and embarrassing, but not in this case. He was really good. In terms of the * surrealism * thing called by jingo, well, I just think this movie is simply "strange". It's a real weirdo movie, with strange places, storyline, strange things going on. But 'good' is strange rather than 'bad'. It's hard to think of other movies, but it's not like CARS ATE Paris, maybe more like a REPULSION, but actually I think more like a 60's Hammer movie. It certainly has an interesting idea working on it. <br /> <br /> JINGO, my question is also about the title. Why Modern Love ?? Anyone? Also, jingo, what did you mean by "God Forsaken" when talking about Australia, hmmm? Just curious
