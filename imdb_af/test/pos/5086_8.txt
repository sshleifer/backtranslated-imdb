When I was a kid, I remember this show, but thought it was a bit dated as an adult. Well it is for me that makes the show more retro (and the music is very funky). <br /> <br /> This show is mostly written well. I think it's a travesty that this show was canceled after one season, especially when this show was more popular than the amazing Hulk. <br /> <br /> I think fans should overlook the bad special effects and enjoy the stories. <br /> <br /> This next sentence contains spoilers: My favorite episode as a kid was when there were two spiderman who had an interesting idea of ​​a similar battle, was confronted in Spiderman 3's movie. I like the ideas in this TV show, some will hate it. I believe Stan Lee wasn't a fan.
