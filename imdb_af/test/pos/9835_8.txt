As a fan of history, mythology and fantasy "Mystic Knights" show pulled me off. It has semi-decent dissertation, the costumes are fantastic (there are exceptions), it's pretty good acting, and the heroes and villains all play well apart. <br /> <br /> SCRIPTURES - A half-writing is Pretty great, the other half is flat, but it's all mixed, meaning many episodes stay that way. Also, some of the key players are repeatedly given dead lines (for example, King Conchobar and Angus) they must be given something ... more. I'm not sure what, but the authors should do something. VERB - Except for some people acting by villagers (terrible lines are putting them in too much trouble), the choice of their clues and so on definitely went very well. Everyone, good and bad, works well together! COSTS / WEAPONS - The everyday clothes that everyone wears are spectacular! Mystic Knight Armor who falls short is Deirdre's and Garrett's. A chain mail bikini will probably have better protection in her case ... and won't look plastic; she looks like a bunch of snap-it-together pieces of brown plastic, when it has to look bronze. Ivar's trident seems to have been bought at a discount store and while Garretts weapons look cool, they also look plastic. <br /> <br /> Recently, "Mystic Knights" have taken on too many Power Rangers features, if you watch The Show, you'll know what I mean. As the series progresses, however, it must find its niche and make its style perfect. Overall, it's a great show that all ages should enjoy (most of my friends and I watch it and we're all 20+). The plot thickens and turns, even though it gets a little young, and everything just gets interesting. It may be of interest to fans of the movie Willow or the TV series "The Adventures of Sinbad". A lot of adventure, a drop of mystery, a dash of romance, a sprinkling of powers on nature ... Check it out! (My Score: 7/10)
