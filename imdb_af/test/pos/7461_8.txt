To find the foreground, and to read the reviews, and to be an Angel fan, I watched this movie. It's sexy and original, and quite entertaining. David Boreanaz is Keith. He is a drunk married man, staying at home with Dad, and he feels a little inadequate in his marriage. He makes the mistake of penetrating a close circle of teenage girls who are fascinated with the idea of ​​dealing with an older man. They will do anything to get into his bed, including fraud, lies and extortion, but they usually try to push his buttons. The utility that comes out sends Keith's arrangement and pushes friendships to the edge. David Boreanaz shows a little skin in this one - and he looks warm. Yeah he plays a messy scam - but he shows enough vulnerability and tenderness to the goofy teens that you eventually ultimately keep in mind. One more thing, when someone doesn't "oh yeah, oh .. oh .. yourself!", It's hard to see them as a victim of rape.
