This movie was a very good Universal Monster movie. It's once again Lon Chaney as The Wolfman and Glenn Strange as Frankenstein's Monster. Oh yes, that jerk John Carradine is back as Dracula. I love every actor in this movie. I especially loved Onslow Stevens as dr. Edelmann. (It was spelled with 2 n's) I thought it was a good idea to let the kind-hearted doctor condemn himself like Talbot. One scene I think is very good is the scene when dr. Edelmann keeps in mind when he changes. Everything that struggles, flashes in front of you. The good doctor says no while his evil side says yes. That's the only reason I didn't want the Dracula character to be completely eliminated from this movie. I thought Dracula had no business in House of Frankenstein. If his character is pulled out, you won't miss him. In this film, the doctor's blood is contaminated with Dracula's and gives him his Jekyll and Hyde curse. I hate John Carradine and I don't think he ever had to play Dracula. I didn't think of other actors who played the Frankenstein Monster to the great Karloff, because they all did good work. But when they get another actor to play Dracula, it stops right. John Carradine thought he was so tall and powerful. They offered him the role of the Frankenstein Monster once and he fired it because he thought he was trained too high. I could only make Carradine photos if he played The Monster with the director on the set: "I don't have to take it from you, I did Shakespeare." John Carradine was not Dracula and he would never be. Sorry John, Bela Lugosi is the only Dracula. Thanks, they came back to Bela as Dracula for Abbott and Costello. Meet Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> Don't miss this movie. It does not disappoint you and you will enjoy it as you did the other. It's a very good addition to the monster movies. If you're a collector, don't leave this one out. <br /> <br />
