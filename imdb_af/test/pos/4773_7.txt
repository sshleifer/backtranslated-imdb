... But this is also Minnie's and Pete's! Yes, the grumpy captain may not look like Pete, but it is! Mickey and Minnie are the best characters, both are very sweet and delicious. Interestingly, Minnie is more of a lady in this than she usually is today and Mickey is less than considerate in this than he is now. Pete is still the same guy, but he looks a little different. <br /> <br /> In this well-known episode, aboard a small steamer, Mickey, Minnie and some characters play a lot of fun and annoyance. Even in their first appearances, the three main characters are very developed. <br /> <br /> I like this episode a lot, though I generally prefer the Mickey Mouse in the future. I like the animation, the steamer and music theme, the smart gags - and of course, Mickey and Minnie! <br /> <br /> Like many early cartoons, it's very random, Walt came with a very basic plot and just added gags just to "gear" it. There is also a parrot side character that is very irritating and rather unnecessary. These are the things I don't like about it. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about this episode is that a color version has not been made for it (or if it has never heard of it)! <br /> <br /> Anyone just enjoying Mickey Mouse and Disney will enjoy it.
