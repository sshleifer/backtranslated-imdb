I know that everything in the book should include the movie for a few hours, so I think they did their best to close things that were essential to the story. I thought the casting was great, the kids who played Amir and Hassan were very good actors. And the guy who played Amir as an adult was great! The screens between him and Baby were particularly touching. I thought the places they used were interesting ... scenes in Afghanistan were shot in China and one scene shot in Fremont, CA (the graduation ceremony) was actually shot at Treasure Island in San Francisco. One day I worked as an extra on 'Kite Runner' and it was that day, the day they shot the graduation ceremony. We reported to Treasure Island that morning, they checked everyone's wardrobe to make it look like the late 80's, once we took our places in the audience. They shot the scene over and over until they were satisfied. It was cool to see the actors close by and also to see the author's writer, who was a story consultant on hand. I thought this book was excellent and I recommend the book and the movie to anyone. It is a moving story about friendship, love, guilt and ultimate salvation. "There is a way to be good again."
