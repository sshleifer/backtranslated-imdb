I got this movie on DVD purely by chance over a Blockbuster rental. Voyage to the Planets is an excellent BBC 2 hour documentary / drama about a future "grand tour" of the solar system. This movie tells the story of astronauts on a journey to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Pluto. <br /> <br /> The special effects are great for a TV show. I found the actors credible as astronauts. The presented situations are mostly plausible, and you learn a lot about the science of the planets and spaceflight! Only two small complaints: I sometimes found maudlin from the situations and dialogue. Furthermore, I am not sure that a single crew and ship would be sent on a single mission to see all those destinations at once. More than likely, visits to Venus, Mars, Jupiter, etc. Will / will be separate missions. <br /> <br /> They didn't try to hint at this performance with production values. The scenes of Venus and Mars are actually filmed in the northern deserts of Chile - the driest area on earth and a death toll for the Marsse landscape. Weightlessness traits are filmed in a dive Russian transport jet. The producers could have used one of these studios and CGIs, but chose the right thing. <br /> <br /> I especially want to mention the wonderful music composed for this movie. Don Davis's exciting theme is the first thing that grabs you when the movie starts, as the spectacular shot of the Pegasus passes the screen and David Suchet's intones "this is the fate of man to explore the stars ...". <br /> <br /> Watching it on a small TV screen is one regret I have. What a thrill to see in a movie or even better an IMAX presentation!
