Now that the Advent Children have been watched twice, the storyline is not as shallow as the majority criticized it to be in my opinion. If you didn't play FFVII, or for whatever reason, this movie probably doesn't hold you. Being familiar with the original story is a requirement to fully understand AC, otherwise you will only see the biggest CG animation in your life so far. <br /> <br /> Without spoiling the storyline, I have to admit that after seeing AC we went with my friends with our knowledge of FFVII. Since it was allowed the second time to pay more attention to the story and most of the questions we had were answered. Some were not. AC is clear to FFVII players / fans and does not honestly try anything else. There is little or no realism in this outside the FFVII world that serves the purpose. Music is mostly reconstructed FFVII themes with a heavier touch (TPM team by end credits) and works well with the eyecup without exception. I found the music that improved the experience added to the visual fireworks in all situations. <br /> <br /> We all know that you can't post a FFVII in 1.5 hours and keep in mind that the storyline was offered to me more than I expected. There are two problems in hand: FFVII: AC, and both stories are wrapped very smoothly between the action rows. And trust me when I say there are a lot of them. Action that is. <br /> <br /> I changed my voice from 9 to 10 after watching it for the second time because I had some explanatory rows. I couldn't compile the answers for the first time. As a warning, it will be easy to disregard the story and focus on graphics, but try not to judge the Adevent children. If you don't allow the story, it's not surprising that it looks messy. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to price the charts, because I assume we all know they're great, which may be an understatement. Especially characters speak so much more with their facial expressions than ever before. I hope you pay attention to the storyline because it makes sense and works well with the whole. Get ready for the ride of your life, there is no break.
