Yes, I know this movie is meant to be a comedy! And the humor is on top! But the theme that people become less intelligent in the future may not get that far! I cannot say that this will happen, but if we do not take proper care of our education system, it may be possible! I noticed that some schools are no longer teaching facts! (Like history, geography, basic things). The focus is more on learning practical skills! The theory behind most subjects can be boring, but it is essential to understand how things work! In the movie, there is this ludicrous example of people who grow with Gatorade instead of water! Well, we can laugh about it! But if you've never been taught that water contains minerals needed for plants to grow, how will you know it? For me, this is a scary idea! So now you understand why this box is no longer funny! It may be that Mike makes Judge fun, but at the same time warns people about a real disaster if education doesn't improve fast! Take this movie too seriously! Yes of course! For each one his own pleasure! I loved Mike Judge's work (Beavis and Butthead and Office Space)! At the same time he could be critical and funny! In "Idiocracy" I missed it! Most of the events are too absurd and, as I said before, terrifyingly! I think if you're in the mood, you'll love this movie!
