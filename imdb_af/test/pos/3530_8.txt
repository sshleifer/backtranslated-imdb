September 29, 1990 was a small but important milestone in my appreciation for horror flicks. It was the date BBC1 broadcasted (for the only time I was aware of it) Jeff Lieberman's super-creepy 1981 shocking Just Before Dawn, and that made me a big impression. Almost twenty years later, I am delighted to report that I finally got my hands on the two-disc Shriek Show / Media Blasters special edition, and it's just as terrible and disturbing as I remember, if not so. <br /> <br /> The plot, as usual for genre movies (and it was Lieberman's first movie as a "director for rent", although at least all the religious cult snake-handling mumbo jumbo of the Scatter removal), is a bit thin - five similar twenty (including Chris Lemmon, son of Jack, in some awkwardly white stripes) in the dense Oregon forest lands dare to camp and land a piece of land. go look. It was tested on one of them. But just before Dawn stands out from a crowd of mimics, because Lieberman doesn't waste time just showing us how indignant things are on this particular patch of the mountain, with a complete innocent skewer and a drunk minister's truck. down a hill and refurbished in flames. minutes of the movie begins. The youngsters roll into the picture in a funny Winnebago, Blondie's "Heart of Glass" bumping into the soundtrack, and before you can say "Texas Chainsaw Massacre!" They cloned an innocent deer with the front bumper and have their first taste of aggro of the heavy maniac responsible for the opening disasters. Forest Guardian Roy (George Kennedy) warns them that they are likely to go wrong if they go further, but they are going down the road anyway and refuse to give the whipped minister a ride, though he is understandably scared and nothing more from everywhere. Needless to say, things are going down from here. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is not short on bloody horror and well-acted action scenes, the striking moments for me are those where Lieberman watches his camera, long and slow, from seemingly harmless shots of sweet children lying in the desert, or just letting it settle on the dense, invasive forest world. He made the Oregon exteriors so threatening and so ominous that Kubrick made the Overlook Hotel's space buildings in the Shining, and Brad Fiedel's score (discounted the terribly distorted racket running over the titles) remains the intrigue legal team, underlining the steadily rising threat with subtlety and flair. There are many surprises along the way, nodding to satisfaction with the discovery of a backwoods babe and her freaky, disturbing family, and a truly bizarre killing technique deployed shortly before the end of the film. I won't spoil it for you. I said enough. <br /> <br /> Quite simply why this undervalued horror jewel fell through the cracks and became a culture item instead of an outbreak, it's hard to figure out, but hopefully it will be rediscovered and appreciated for years . come - it deserves to be.
