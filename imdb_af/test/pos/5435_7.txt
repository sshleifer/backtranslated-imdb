Robin Williams shows his stand-up talents and raises his status as a comedian in this movie of "What is wrong in US politics and how can Hollywood try to make an impact without getting boring?" Of course, Hollywood uses hidden or non-hidden agendas movies. I think this movie is for people who hold stand-up and political discussions. And the trailers of this movie were for everyone to make sure as many people as possible see it. Everybody knows Hollywood is more liberal / democratic than the bush & co, so they must occasionally make these movies ... but this one might be too obvious, at least I thought so, to make any real change . <br /> Yet, great position and fresh political issues and conversations ... I enjoyed it and thank IMDb.com ratings, I was pleasantly surprised when I walked out of the kiosk, and yes, I did laughed many times. Sometimes you just let it go and forget all the seriousness. See this movie if you want good and smart uprising or politics, and you won't be insulted by the various references of how things are now not good. Rent it if it doesn't suit you.
