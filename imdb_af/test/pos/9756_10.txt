"The Gay Desperado" is wonderful throughout. The villain between Leo Carrillo and Harold Huber is as funny as anything you would hear in a movie today. Best rule? "That would be my third choice!" "Diego" is of course the archetype for Kevin Smith's "Silent Bob". Lucien N. Andoit's black and white cinematography (especially with the banditos' shadows) was striking. All I can say about Ida Lupino is, "Thanks for DVD!" You can go straight to the scene where she tries on sombreros and serapes and watches her standing in front of the mirror again. <br /> <br /> Let me forget that the Nino Martini man is also really clean. .
