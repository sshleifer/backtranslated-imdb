Darr is a good movie! Shahrukh plays an obsessed lover who will do almost anything to win over his wife, which in this case is Juhi Chawla. Few know Juhi in the movie that Shahrukh has a great loved one on her and constantly stalking her. I must admit, some of the things he did in this movie were pretty stupid ... like the threatening calls. Never in my life will I forget the line, "I love you K..k..k..kiran!" <br /> <br /> It's just bad that Shahrukh and Juhi were not exactly "together". the movie. But Juhi and Sunny make a pretty good couple in the movie. Although Shahrukh's role was pretty psychotic, I still think he did a good job of playing it and it may not be possible for someone else to play that role. No wonder he received an award for Darr in 94 '! <br /> <br /> Juhi ... what can I say ??? She looks especially amazing in this movie! It's not that she doesn't always look great in her other movies, but Darr gave the public a wonderful picture of her! <br /> <br /> As far as music is concerned, it was excellent! Especially "Jaadu Teri Nazar," one of my favorite songs. I also thought "Tu Mere Samne" was also nice. <br /> <br /> See everyone! Overall Earned A 9/10!
