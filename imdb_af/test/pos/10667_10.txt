If you are a film student or one, or think you become one, the name Battleship Potemkin has a resonance. Sergei Eistenstein, like other silent movies like Griffith (although Eisenstein's innovations are not as common as Griffith's) and Murnau, had such an impact on the history of the cinema, it obviously assumed. The reason why I participate in the film students is that at some stage, whether you like it or not, your movie professor 9 times out of 10 shows the "Odessa Stairs" series of this movie. It's hard to tell if it's even the "best" part of the movie's series of series dealing with (currently) times of the Russian revolution. But it does make the most impact, and it can be seen in many movies that show tension, or simply simple mounting. (The Untouchables climax occurs). <br /> <br /> Montage, which was not just Eisenstein's talent, but also his life's blood early in his career is often abused in current theater, or if it is not misused in an improper context for not the story. Sometimes mounting is now used as just another device to get from point A to point B. Montage was something else for Eisenstein; He tried to communicate in the most direct way that he could handle the urgency, the passion (s), and the ultimate tragedies in the Russian people at the moment and place. Even if you haven't seen Eisenstein's story or traditional 'story' ideas to have a lot of foundation (Kubrick said it), one cannot deny the power to see the ships arriving at the harbor, the people on the stairs not, and the soldiers each come with them with firearms. Some may find it hard to believe it's done in the 20's; It has the power of the Passion of Joan or Arc to exceed its time and remain important only if it is technical and emotional. <br /> <br /> Of course, one can continue for books (which has been written hundreds of times, not least by Eisenstein himself). On the film in and of itself, Battleship Potemkin is really more like a dramatized news rule than a specific story in a movie. The first segment is also one of the big rows in the movie, as a mutiny against the Captain and other headers of a certain ship is outlined. It is almost detailed in a manipulative manner, but in some way extremely effective; Mounting is also used here, but in the energy that catches the eye. At other times, Eisenstein is more content to just speak the images for themselves, as the soldiers are tired without food and water. He is not one of the directors who will try to get all sides of the story; He is of course very early 20th century Russian, but he is nothing but honest with how he sees his themes and style. And that is what ultimately prevails. <br /> <br /> Some may have to check it out of the film school, as the "Staircase" sequence is one of the landmarks of serious drama on film, which is the ugly side of revolution. Eisenstein may not be one of the more 'accessible' movie directors, but if montage, detail in the frame, non-actors and Bolshevik themes is your cup of tea, it is truly one of the things to be seen from a lifetime.
