And I do. Peter Falk has created a role that will live forever in TV country! And I'm grateful for this. However, this is not one of his best hours. Columbo goes to school and basically learns how to solve a crime, and yet there are bad guys who continue and think they are smarter than he is. What we all know is that Columbo needs a worthy opponent. Without a big enemy, how could he be the hero in the wrinkled coat? Still, it's better than NO Columbo, and I'll wait to watch the next one.
