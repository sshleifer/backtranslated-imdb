Utopia, made in France in 1950, was the last film produced by Laurel and Hardy. With the bad reputation the duo had for their 1930s production, I expected this movie to be terrible. Although it does not meet the standard of their "cute" comedies, I was pleasantly surprised. It's watches, and in parts it's really funny! And surely, the plot is of the same standard you would expect. Some gags are derived from their previous work, but if you think this movie is their first five years after their last Hollywood-made movie, The Bullfighters, the routines are confidently performed as you expect from these professionals. Some scenes are not much, but the value of this movie is that some scenes are funny and as such absolutely invaluable. I especially enjoyed the bedtime scene. <br /> <br /> I felt sad at the end of the movie. Our hero is on their own desert island. It is such a metaphor for real life truth. Hollywood and audiences of the time conveyed the stars to a desert island memories, and that would be the last image they portrayed in film. Ollie died seven years later and Stan died fifteen years later. Stan offered an offer in 1963 to appear in a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. What a shame - a color film, just two years before he was over. But his health was probably not too much. <br /> <br /> These boys are probably the greatest comedy artists of all time, and although the film is far from their true potential, it's still an honor to watch them appear for the last time in the movie and touch those echoes of their many talents.
