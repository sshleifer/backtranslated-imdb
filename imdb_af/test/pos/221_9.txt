Police Group! (1982) was a funny show that ended too soon. But I think it ran before it became too repetitive and rude, like so many American television programs. The genius behind this funny show was the team of Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker. Since his direct act in the comedy hit AIRPLANE !, Leslie Nielsen found a new career as a comedian. In this short life, he had the chance to play the straight man in a crazy comedy again. The bizarre titles for each episode ended. But Lt. Drebrin (Leslie Nielsen) found in so many strange cases that they should be seen. <br /> <br /> Too bad they never put it on D.V.D. released. If a display has to be made available again, it must be this one. A whole new generation is waiting to see this show! <br /> <br /> Highly recommended!
