One of the most important quotes from the entire film is spoken halfway through the protagonist, Mafia middleman Titta Di Girolamo, a physically non-descriptive middle-aged man originally from Salerno in southern Italy. When we were introduced at the beginning of the film, he has been living in an elegant but sterile hotel in the Italian speaking Canton of Switzerland for the past ten years. He runs a business that is gradually becoming a business. While this turntable, but seemingly unbeatable scene is taking place, Swiss bank employees who are usually counting Di Girolamo's cash are telling him that $ 10 000 of his usual suitcase is full of tightly stacked banknotes. During the news, he threatened to close his account with silence, but somewhat his bank manager. Meanwhile, he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you must immediately bluff to the end, without getting scared or ridiculous. He says: You can't bluff a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. Having finally done so, I just halfway through and telling the truth and accepting the consequences of life and finally love - is exactly why Titta Di Girolamo's problems start. <br /> <br /> This initially unsympathetic character, a rogue, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won't even answer in-kind to roomy and waitresses saying hello and goodbye, is on one point someone after whom the spectator cares. At one stage in his non-life, Titta decides to worry about the "ridiculous" phenomenon. The first half of the movie can be described by some as "slow". It reveals Di Girolamo's days and nights in the hotel on a strange uncovered, deliberate fit, which apparently reveals everyday and irrelevant details. Screens that may seem unnecessary reveal how essential they are, as this masterfully builds and innovates film before your eyes. The existence of Titta Di Girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the uncontrollable character you end up unexpectedly and love for when you least thought - will also be conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music (one theme by the Scottish band Boards or Canada stood out especially). <br /> <br /> Never was the contrast between the way Hollywood and Italy treated people better than they had since the release of films such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore or L'Imbalsamatore. Another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the insomnia of the protagonist. Not unlike The Machinist (and in a much more explicit way, the Al Pacino movie Insomnia), Le Conseguenze dell'Amore uses this condition to symbolize a deeper emotional malaise so deeply placed in the unconsciousness of the unconscious . It is almost impossible to pin-point its cause (if there is one). <br /> <br /> The young and sympathetic hotel keeper Sofia (played by Olivia Magnani, the great daughter of the legendary Anna) and the memory of Titta's best friend, a man he hasn't seen in 20 years , unexpectedly, a small window on life that Titta eventually (although tentatively initially) accepts to look through again. Although never explicitly spoken, the spectator knows that a man like Titta, who accepts the effects of love, will have unimaginable consequences. A film without a single sexual or sexual play, a film that unfolds in its own time and gives nothing to expectation, Le Conseguenze dell'Amore is a fine representative of the small, quiet, quiet Renaissance that took place in Italian theater since the decline of Cinecittà during the second half of the 70s. The world is waiting for Italy to produce more Il Postino-like tariffs, more La Vita è Bella movies ... failing to explore fine creations such as Le Conseguenze dell'Amore, L'Imbalsamatore and others. Your loss, world.
