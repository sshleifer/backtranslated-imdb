So far, only the first episode has been shown, and a great fuss about lesbian sex scenes has been made. But for those who find it difficult to look past, they find an amazingly beautiful love story and one that ended in a disturbing climax / rock hanger in this episode. I found the story so powerful that I was inspired to read the novel based on this fantastic series.
