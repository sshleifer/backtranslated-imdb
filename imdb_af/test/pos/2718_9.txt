So I interpreted the movie: First things first. There wasn't a single scene in the movie where you saw the bad guy (Taylor) who tortured Ben's hands on the wall. But the same cannot be said of the gals. Eventually you see that Taylor disappears as he walks. Looks like the message was "There was no Taylor". And the whole movie was an imagination of Ben's imagination. Also, there was no scene during the torture moments in which any of the gals confronted or in the same frame as Ben. It was Taylor all the time. But in reality, Taylor was Ben. If they were two different people, why wasn't there a scene they both had in one frame during the horrible time? But of course before that, you both see together and THIS is just Ben's imagination at work. Also, when Ben was out of jail, the text on the screen clearly says that Ben's story was unrealistic and there wasn't a place he explained (read me, cars, etc.). Even after Liz Hunter leaves Kristy and comes back to find Ben, she doesn't find him. Why ??? Because Ben (Taylor) was looking for the gals. Instead, Kristy has always been in the world of Taylor's (Ben) webcam, photos, etc. ... <br /> <br /> Somehow, everything counts just one fact that Kristy and Liz, both of them knew Taylor was Ben. So, my conclusion is that Ben was schizophrenic and the movie where you see him and Taylor in one frame was nothing but figs of his imagination. Unlike a Taylor, they had to get him, given all the detailed explanation of Ben.
