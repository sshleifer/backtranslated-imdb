I accidentally watched this show, but I love it. The fact that the main character is in a wheelchair is something that is not lacking in television, especially for children's shows. My five-year-old cousin (as most kids do) will only look at people who were in wheelchairs or had a different type of disability, but after looking at Pelswick, it was just a normal appearance for him. Every time he saw a wheelchair, he would just like "Pelswick" and continue with what he had originally done. And yes, the animation is a bit rough, but if you can stand watching the first season of the Simpsons, it's not that bad. The "Genie" is actually an Angel there to help Pelswick learn life lessons. He could not walk otherwise, said he could walk from time to time, I saw every episode and he never walked to my memory, he was a paraplegic, he had no feeling under his armpits (he called it in an episode). Regarding humor, if you can get a copy of the "Ntalented" section, which songs' son ties, you will immediately like this show.
