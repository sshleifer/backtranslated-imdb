This review has been in arrears for a long time, as I see a story of two sisters as the single biggest movie ever made. I will place this jewelry against any movie in terms of script, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing or any other aspect of film making. It is almost perfect in all of them? a true masterpiece in a sea of ​​faux "masterpieces." <br /> <br /> The structure of this movie is easily the best in the history of the theater. I can't think of any other movie where something else is important. Quite literally, it seems that Ji-living Kim has made a movie that practically seduces the viewer to analyze it at the most detailed levels. An apparently insignificant object can be shown? a stretch of dresses, two diaries, a drop of blood coming out of a floor valve, a bottle of pills, etc. ?? but on careful inspection it seems so much more ?? a clue that helps to make the specific scene (or perhaps the movie in total), almost always a moving reflection on the psychological concepts hidden in the background, to the viewer's intelligence encouraging them to jump to the forefront . Such an event can occur a handful of times during another movie, but in a story of two sisters such events occur in such a fast, inexorable way that the viewer must watch the film in an eternal state of vigilance so they do not miss anything important. In other words, the content of this movie is enough to easily fill a dozen other films. How can someone in their right mind ask something more from a movie than this? It is simply the highest, most superior form of theater imaginable. <br /> <br /> The most commonly cited criticism of a story of two sisters is summed up by Zaphod B Goode, who falsely claims the story is an incoherent, unsolved mess that uses confusion to a false intelligence intelligence creation, because it does not provide a final set of facts underlying the intriguing questions. He suggests that Ji-living Kim gave up a dozen possible statements and left it over. In reality, however, nothing can come from the truth. A two-sister language offers a range of unacceptable objective facts that help the viewer identify the exact look of each scene of the movie. If our good friend Zaphod paid attention, would he have noticed? for example ?? the series of obvious flashbacks that provide enough factual information to make the movie feel. These flashbacks convincingly contradict Zaphod's assertion of complete subjectivity. The objective elements of a story of two sisters is so obvious that anyone is prepared to see that the mere assertion of a lack of objectivity can only compromise the patience of a viewer who apparently does not The slightest effort would not be to see them. Can Ji live Kim really be complained about the impatience of viewers who don't have the desire to understand his movie? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> Please note that I will not offend the intelligence of critics such as Zaphod who cannot find a story of two sisters, because it really has nothing to do with a lack of intelligence than many. a lack of perseverance. The movie speaks so effectively that the only possible explanation for confusion is lack of effort on the part of the viewer. Yes, this movie needs a fairly important amount of puzzle solution, but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture. You just have to put it together. Remember, the script is written by someone with the picture already in mind? He divorced the pieces and consistently put them in a position to offer a wonderful cerebral exercise. when completed? offers an ultimate form of satisfaction and state of awe. <br /> <br /> Don't get me wrong. There are movies that seem to start with an incomplete picture and try to create a puzzle that is insoluble by design. Spider Forest (2004), Perfect Blue (1998) and Donnie Darko (2001) are perfect examples of this. No languages ​​from two sisters. It is ironic that Zaphod claims that Darko is more masterfully built than a story of two sisters, especially since Darko not only offers almost no objective facts, but also a turning end, which is the characteristic deus ex machina cliché that at the end of any movie ever made to offer the ultimate faux intelligence. I am ashamed of the two films in the same sense, but the contrast is an important one. Although it confuses me that Zaphod calls a film that crumbles when exposed to even the slightest intellectual effort, as a way of criticizing a film that will only be visible through a significant application of intellectual efforts. He apparently holds his "intelligent" films in the most superficial form possible. It turns out when he makes 17 consecutive questions in his review that is convincingly answered by the film itself. Just read the threads of Opiemar in the IMDb A Talk of Two Sisters Discussion Forum. Anyone who reads the threads carefully and still claims a lack of objective solution to this movie can also stop watching intelligent movies completely, because the answers are so damned. OORVOLG. <br /> <br /> I want to say more, but I've reached my 1000 word limit. All that has been said here must be said. So be it now!
