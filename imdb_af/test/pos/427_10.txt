I only see three episodes of Hack, with David Morse, and I seem to have missed 37 episodes! It's good if ITV 3 shows them in chronological order. I just watched 'Misty Blue' (episode 38). I really enjoyed the 3 episodes, but then I am a David Morse fan, (especially St Els). For anyone reading it, Hack is excellent. Sorry this is broadcast on ITV 3. The cast is strong, though I can't get used to the idea that David is playing a bent police, but we all know he is the wrong guy. I see Gary Cole having guest star, what ever happened to 'Midnight Caller'? Just wonder if Hack is available on DVD (yet). Lovin this. Cheers.
