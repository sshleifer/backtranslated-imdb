Dirty Harry goes to Atlanta, who named Burt, this fantastic, first-class detective thriller that borrows from his plot from the venerable Dana Andrews movie Laura. Burt Reynolds not only dies in this beautiful saga, but he also did it and he doesn't make a single mistake or action or characters. Not a bad performance in the movie, and Reynolds does a great job of correcting it. Henry Silva is quite icy as a hit. <br /> <br /> Detective Tom Sharky (Burt Reynolds) is in a drug case in underground Atlanta when everything goes wrong. He dared to chase a suspect and shoot with the armed man on a bus. In the vicinity, an innocent bystander dies. John Woo's "The Killer" replicates this scene. Anyway, the Atlanta Police Department breasts off to Vice and he takes orders from a new boss, Frisco (Charles Durning from "Oh, Brother, Where Do You Have?") In the basement. Sharky wind in a real cesspool of crime. Sharky and his co-detectives Arch (Bernie Casey) and Dad (Brian Keith) oversee an affordable calling girl Dominoe (Rachel Ward of "After Dark, My Sweet") who has a luxury apartment she's with another girl share. <br /> <br /> Dominoe sees a local politician Hotchkins (Earl Holliman of the "Policewoman") on the side fighting for governor, but the chief band Victor (Vittorio Gassman of The Dirty Game) wants him to to quit Hotchkins is reluctant to accommodate Victor, so Victor sniffs cocaine ending Billy Score (Henry Silva of "Wipeout"), Dominoe. Billy blows a hole the size of a twelve-inch pizza in the door of Dominoe's apartment and kills her. <br /> <br /> Sharky did the unthinkable. During the surveillance he conceded to Domino to the point that he was hopelessly in love with her. Sharky's mission in life is now Victor, but he learns that Victor has an informant in the Atlanta police service. The plot is really warm when Sharky later discovers Billy has shot the wrong girl and Domino is still alive! Sharky takes her into protective custody and things grow even more complicated. He collects his "Machine" from the title to handle Victor and his hats. <br /> <br /> William Fraker's wide-screen action is immaculate. Unfortunately, these largely underrated classics are only available as a full frame movie. Fraker certainly adds to the atmosphere of the picture, especially during the mutilation scene on the boat, when the villain cut off one of Sharky's fingers. It's a very horrible scene. <br /> <br /> Burt never made a movie that exceeded "Sharky's Machine".
