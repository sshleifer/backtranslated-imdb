What impressed me most of the "One True Thing" was how advance it was when the daughter at the beginning of the film called her mother's cancer. The subject was depressed and it was a refreshing change of pace instead of having the revelation of a character's fatal illness 2/3 in the movie ("Love Story" Terms of Endearment, etc. <br /> <br /> Meryl Streep, Renee Zellweger and William Hurt give very strong performances that don't go over the edge, the characters they play seem human, they are not perfect people (it may not be said that the character playing the "Martha Stewart" -type Streep character, but in the movie I saw her character in a non-juicy way, she is doing her best the best way she knows.) <br /> <br "One True Thing" is a striking, unimaginative family drama in which the end tears are well earned.
