High School. For decades, some look back with love, others with embarrassment. But few find it easy to forget. This is one of the most critical stages of our lives, when changes become quick and furious whether we are ready or not. No more children, not adults, irresistible forces make us a buffet and push us in every direction. <br /> <br /> "Fame" did its best to capture this turbulent, chaotic period for its young characters. For the most part, it has succeeded. It felt meander, but felt like part of life. This movie holds a special place in the hearts of the '80s. We have just said goodbye to a decade, and soon to the end of three or four stimulating and sometimes difficult school years. We were on our way to the cold, cruel world, leaving home for college, then parts are unknown. As we tackled our watershed, this new-born movie was like a two-hour calendar for us.

But the pressure cooker environment has created extraordinary chamber music and esprit de corps, not unlike the hot lunch jam in the cafeteria. On our own graduation day, our spirits have risen almost like the jubilant crescendo in the exciting final. The film leaves us fit on a single triumphant note at the end of "I Sing the Body Electric", which shows the blind bright, unlimited future and all the promise it kept. <br /> <br /> "Fame" couldn There is nothing else set. This story would never have worked in a small or suburban school. Los Angeles has a stronger identification with movies and television, but NYC is a mecca for all the arts. Home not only to what was then called PA, but also world-renowned Juilliard, NYC is a cultural center unmatched by any other city in the world. It is also a time capsule of the rest of the city of time, still struggling with the endemic, grit and filth of New York's fiscal crisis, which has made it almost bankrupt. But especially, it showed vitality as it was muted by the storms of Giuliani, Disney and tourism. <br /> <br /> What I wouldn't give young again. But with "Fame," I can at least remember how it was.
