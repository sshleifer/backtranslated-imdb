Sometimes, but very rarely, a movie tells such a story that it becomes almost difficult. This movie tells several stories so well at the same time that it was a movie I couldn't see for the first time. It was too real .... and the characters so strong that it looked, became a personal battle. As these three men and their families deal with their problems, one in particular has often been too hard on me. Now I have looked several times in its entirety, and I realize what I have always suspected. This movie is a masterpiece. The author, the play, the blend of various stories without even being the least broken, all about this movie is exceptional. Seven Academy Awards? No wonder, they certainly should have earned it.
