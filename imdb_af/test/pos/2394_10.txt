I loved this movie, Independent movies at its best. The cinematography, pacing, rhythm and acting were perfect in synchronization. Fred Carpenter's best work to date! The movie is well written with lots of plot twists that bring you to a great end. It moves well and keeps you involved. As a photographer, I was very impressed by the movies. The lighting creates mood and a beauty that usually occurs in a much larger budget film. This gave the actors a wonderful canvas to start from. And that's just what they did! Great performances by all the actors and each one was well-cast. As I said at the beginning, it's a great movie, and one of Fred Carpenter's best movies. You're going to love it.
