In August Days / Dies d'agost, Marc Recha gave us a sun-saturated Catalan documentary style film that is mostly a winding improvised meditation on brotherhood and the death of death. The beautiful, sometimes large-scale, rich atmospheric 35 mm. Landscape movements, good soundtrack and Catalan language story are captivating as a mood piece, if one is satisfied with a trajectory that does not have much momentum and does not lead in particular. Filmmaker Marc Recha and his non-identical twins David are the stars and the narration is pronounced by their younger sister. Marc explored the life of Ramon Barnils (1940-2001), a socialist editor who was a family friend. He felt he was saturated with information and had to take a break. The break has turned into making this film that wants to see the attitude of interviewing Barnils associates, thoughts about the Spanish Civil War, the drought season they are experiencing, the rugged landscape, the Recha brothers' love for each other, swimming and sun-colored nudity and what characters or stories they ran while sitting out of their bus. This leads to the pursuit of a giant catfish and the temporary disappearance of one of the brothers. In the end, David has to go back to Barcelona to be with his daughter and Marc must return to his project, and there he ends. I found it fascinating to listen to an extensive narrative in the Catalan language with his blend of Spanish and French sounding words (perhaps linked to Provencal?). It's not a big movie, but it pays attention and makes sense like a movie festival choice with its clean visual and auditory beauty and its way of playing with genres and the autobiography with fiction and documentary on a fresh and thoughtful mix way. <br /> <br /> An official choice of the 2006 New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center.
