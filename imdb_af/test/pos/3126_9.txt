Wagon Master (1950) Dir: John Ford <br /> <br /> Production: Argosy Pictures / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> John Ford brings out the stock company in the Utah Desert to make a western movie play and come out with this minor classic. No John Wayne, no conflicting conflicts, no psychological exploration, no fireworks, just a jewel of a photo. <br /> <br /> This ensemble piece nominal star Ben Johnson (as Travis) and Harry Carey Jr. (Sandy). They are horse dealers who come to town to do business just as a group of Mormons, led by Ward Bond, are shown the exit. The group is starting a move to their own settlement, but they know the odds and hard terrain are against them. So they hire Travis and Sandy as wagon masters for their journey. Along the way they enter a travel medicine vendor and his two female cohorts (Alan Mowbray as a doctor remind his appearance in My Darling Clementine and Joanne Dru as his "daughter"). Tension is added when the murderous Clegg gang comes on the wagon train. And there is also an atypical (for Hollywood) encounter with the Navajo. <br /> <br /> Most of the story and humor is driven by the clash of ideals / cultures; First, between Travis and Sandy and the Mormons, between Ward Bond himself (he is constantly trying his cravings and being a reformed man) between the doctor and his ladies and the Mormons between the carriage and the illegal, and finally, all and the Navajo. There is also a classic Ford scene of a rough dance that expresses one of its signature schemes from civilization to the border. <br /> <br /> Again, no Duke here, but I found Ben Johnson, especially the young. , bones bone Johnson, to have an engaging screen presence of his own. He comes with his own background, with that draw and also when you see him riding the stunt. He is wonderful here in one of his early credited appearances. Harry Carey Jr., although he has been around for a few years, is sometimes pretty raw, but he's nice. Ward Bond is his usual wonderful, blustery self. I found that Joanne Dru is a misery in whatever I see her, but here she is graciously unobtrusive. Other well-known faces include Jane Darwell, Francis Ford and Hank Worden, playing "stupid", as he did in The Searchers a few years later. It's no longer amusing here. <br /> <br /> There is some absolutely spectacular b & w photography by regular Ford fellow Bert Glennon. Not only is there a typical master class on the landscapes and horizons, but there are also some thriving in a handful of scenes with shade and sunlight. The soundtrack contains the legendary country music group, The Sons of the Pioneers. Can't get more cowboy than that. <br /> <br /> *** Â½ out of 4
