This movie was exciting and fun to watch. If I was a fan of these kind of movies, I enjoyed it. The starting point is frightening, but the fact that I didn't have a 10 was because the movie was a bit over some places. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS: <br /> <br /> Cmon: NO can identify this girl? I understand the concept of isolating yourself, but I find it hard to believe that SOMEBODY-ANYBODY couldn't identify this girl as Angela Bennet. It was over and so was the scene where she went to someone's desk and started typing. It was generally a very good movie, exciting and keeping your interest. Dennis Miller was wonderful as Allen, VERY credible, Bullock was good as the lone reserved computer worker, the bad guys all underestimated. <br /> <br /> I think the movie's PREMIUM was really different and frightening. In today's times who knows what can happen? But some of the top screens prevented this movie from being 10 out of 10.
