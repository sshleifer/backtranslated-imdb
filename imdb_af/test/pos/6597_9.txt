This movie was wonderful. This is a documentary on how navigation has affected early days. It interviewed skaters like Tony Hawk (my idol) =), and Stacy Peralta to name a couple. Dogtown is a so-called "ghetto" part of California, where was an amusement park that was demolished. People started driving along the dangerous ruins of the park. Soon the Zepher Surf team was formed. This led to skateboarding the first real start in Dogtown. The Z-boys were a team of ragtag teenagers who loved skateboarding and started the phenomenon known as delusion. They started skating in drained pools. It's just a bit of the story behind. It even contains rare footage from Charlie's Angels or Stacy Peralta that makes a cameo. I think you should buy this movie if you are a skater. It will teach you that skateboarding wasn't always popular. Even if you are not, BUY!
