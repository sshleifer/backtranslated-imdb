This movie is not what it seems to be. Clint Eastwood is not Dirty Harry or a "cowboy" here. The movie's appeal comes from its careful manipulation of atmosphere and theme. This is a Gothic story in the Civil War and, as such, finds all the film's "action" or lack thereof in a home populated by Southern Belle of all ages and shapes. <br /> <br /> The horror comes from watching the whole story through the eyes of the Clint Eastwood character. Being stranded in the house and being held in captivity by the women, it is indeed a very bad experience. And who exactly is "cheating" here? Are the women cheated by Eastwood's incredible appearance? Are we, the viewers, saddened by both his sexual allure and the possible deviant sexualities that trigger it? Or refer 'cheating' to what the director is doing here - do we be surprised at a short space to let us (maybe) go? Don Siegel does all of the above in one of the most memorable and disturbing movies I would have liked to watch.
