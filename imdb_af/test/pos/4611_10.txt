This is an excellent example of unrestrained filmmaking at its best. Richard Greene (who is doing well in the role) is looking for his two missing friends, taking him to the Black Forest domain and the castle of single-eyed Count Bruno (Stephen McNally), a passing enemy whom he has never seen face to face do not have. Incredible film has combined so many fantastic elements (for once) into a single movie - a crocodile pit; a salute mute (played by Lon Chaney, Jr.); a clever doctor (played by Boris Karloff); a leopard hunt (very well done and very atmospheric); a love story; a castle; a sword fight; a sadistic, one-eyed score and his two evil accomplices (played by John Hoyt and Michael Pate !!!); an intriguing background story that makes the movie even more interesting; and more! Jerry Sackheim's writing does not allow him to be bound - make a highly recommended movie for anyone who is into unlimited movies with a hint of horror and atmosphere.
