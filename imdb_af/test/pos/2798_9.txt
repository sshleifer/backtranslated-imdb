Clich√© avoidance is one of the major achievements of this film. When you hear a vague overview of the story? Erasmus students of mixed nationalities sharing an apartment in Barcelona? you predict a set of Euro stereotypes in a devastating stranglehold. Customize yourself! In fact, it is a well-judged comedy about a young Frenchman, Xavier, who tries to make sense of human relationships. Some important roles have been observed (the arrogant French neurologist, the indisputable indisputable brother of the English girl, Xavier's lost mother) and some fine visual humor, especially in the opening patterns that mock the bureaucratic complexity of the application process. So how does Xavier learn about relationships? Nothing positive. Instead of a conventional happy ending, is there an unfortunate final on "Identity"? Xavier has become all the friends he has made. Nevertheless, this highly enjoyable film deserves its great success. I saw it in Luxembourg with a mixed Euro-audience, who enjoyed themselves and even welcomed them in the end.
