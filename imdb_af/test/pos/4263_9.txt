Jarl and Moodysson are part of a dying race of political filmmakers. The Swedish population must appreciate that they are trying to uncover the truth when the government and the media are actively distorting and covering the events surrounding the EU meeting in Gothenburg. It is absolutely heartbreaking to see how these innocent children are abused and stunned by Swedish police and found guilty in prison in sending SMS messages and as revenge for other actions. The only unfortunate thing about this movie is that it will not reach the broad masses in Sweden, as it will only show the theaters and not be released on the video or broadcast on television. <br /> <br /> The political film is important as it can bring new perspectives and insight into complex issues and play a role as an educator of the masses.
