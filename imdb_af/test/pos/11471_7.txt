I gave a DVD of Public Enemies and expected it to be the 2009 version, but it wasn't - it was this! Certainly, it wasn't the biggest movie I've ever seen - not ANY - but quite people, it was worth more than 2.8 out of 10! When I saw that awkward rating on IMDb, I wondered what I'm going to get, but since the disk was in the player, I came down to see it. As other commentators pointed out, Public Enemies are NOT a historical movie - and I have noticed that, unlike the 2009 version (which I haven't seen before) IMDb does not categorize it as such. <br /> Come on people! It's a story based on some real people - that's all! If I wanted a history lesson, I would sit at this computer and read Wikipedia or something. Ma Barker (actually name Arizona - or Arrie - Barker) has never even been guilty of any crime and, as other commentators have said, she probably never even took part in the activities of her sons. They sent her to the movies when they were "working"! (I hope she wasn't as critical as some of those who watched this movie!) <br /> <br /> Theresa Russell had the never-easy task of getting a woman from the age of 17 to her depicting death at age 52 - from a young girl running away from home to the hardened mother of four hoodlum boys. I think she did it well. The shaky smile she used in more than one scene was classic! OK, I would agree with some of the critics that the direction of this movie was lower than I and I think with the actors about it. Theresa had to tell the director to forget the topless shots - they didn't contribute to the story. Perhaps some bigger-name stars would have managed to inject their own expertise to persuade the poor direction, while the second-graders were not so brave. Who knows? <br /> <br /> But while it certainly wasn't a blockbuster, it was over 2.8! I have all my DVDs on a personal database where I record them before they look at the IMDb score (although sometimes they are slightly changing). I take what I get on his own merit rather than holding one movie against the same genre and the one I feel was enough to get 6.8. (Yes, I assume that such a practice is mostly dependent on my mood, but then it's not like those on IMDb?) But you can surprise me when I look at IMDb and see the pitiful count that came here. <br /> <br /> Given the surprise, I decided to read some of the other comments hoping to understand the low rating and I noticed they were fairly polarized. I agreed with those who said the movie was worth watching and concluded that some people are just hard to please. Well, because some were absolutely stunned, why didn't they come out and make better movies? I'll look forward to the gems they should be able to turn out! On the other hand, if they can't do that, why don't they just stop?
