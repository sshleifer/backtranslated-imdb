Babette's Feast, for me, is about healing: the split between spirit and body in orthodox Christianity. This Puritan community in remote Denmark lacks sufficient appreciation for all God's gifts in creation. They have the dualism of St. Paul took to the limit and emphasized the life of the "spirit", not the life of the "flesh". Both elderly sisters, in their youth, were scared by the lure of love and the temptations of life outside their simple village. They and their congregation hold on to the close biblical interpretation of their former leader and sisters' father. The aging congregation has been tested and disputed, and the sisters do not know what to do. Give Babette, a French stranger, and someone to whom they can show kindness. They have no way of knowing that she will eventually return their kindness and give fertile ground to their dry, dusty theology. Babette will give everything she has, and in the process the sisters and their herd will learn about grace, about sacrifices about how sensual experience (as in the bread and wine of the Eucharist) can change lives and why true art moves us so deep. When they can forgive each other and themselves, they can focus on God's love that unfolds in a concrete way in the present. As a minister and artist, I can't recommend a movie anymore. True art and true grace !!
