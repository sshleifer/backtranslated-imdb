This nifty little movie shows the stone-solid virtues of a time, place and kind of male power that we no longer want or even want. The Holy One is a paladin with only the best motives, to say nothing of a polished vocabulary and diction. You don't have to scroll the volume or read the dialog. George Sanders is so charming and, yes, low key that all that talent, smart, physical presence and above all masculinity, looks good, almost normal. Some normal! George Clooney can't start the scene like Mr. Sanders not (and do without Mr Clooney's cup). He could play a trigger (witness The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Rebekah), but when he was good, he was very, very good. Surely a man for all reasons and seasons.
