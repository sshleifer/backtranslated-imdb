I first watched this movie when it first came out and also bought a LP recording of the soundtrack. I liked it so well, I looked back to see it several times. Can't understand why it was considered a flop. Julie Andrews was nice in this movie, her voice was in the best shape and the costume was beautiful! <br /> <br /> The movie contains a bit of everything and although some of the screens were a bit heavy-handed, they were still fun. <br /> <br /> I recently found that I could get a copy in DVD format and ordered it ...... I was disappointed that some songs and series in the movie were not in the version of the DVD is not included. I ordered.
