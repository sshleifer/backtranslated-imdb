I saw this movie in the early 1990s when it was on VHS for a while. I found it interesting at the time and was particularly hit by the Ken Russell segment, with the vision of the victim of the triage and surgery accident. <br /> <br /> Last night, at a second race of the latest Indiana Jones movie, John Hurt's vision gave an unexpected backlash to Aria, of which I hadn't thought for years and the sudden reminder of the Russell piece itself was enough to let out a little tears. <br /> <br /> If I can make this observation, I notice with interest the love-hate reaction expressed by the Russell segment, and I have found this interesting difference in other films deep into the trauma. and its offspring effects. Some get it, others, not interesting. <br /> <br /> I see through the comments and grading that overall work hit people in different ways. That's how it touched and touched me.
