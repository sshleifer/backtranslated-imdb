Even for a 17-year-old student who loved history and experienced a smile of emotion and excitement in his childhood, it was a blessing for all time on DVD. North and South are really a series of friendship, love, honor ... you name your own list of feelings you get to look at this series. I still remember the first time I got a look at this series on TV when I was about 8 years old. I wow it looks exciting. To bad I never had the chance to see one and two books on television in the Netherlands. When the book was exhibited in the Netherlands in the summer of 2004 as a late night series, I just knew I had to see the other two series. For most people book three was as far as I know, a huge disappointment. Well, since I've seen one book on DVD, I have to say it's been the best of all 3 books so far. For all the young people who just watch the fancy movies like The Patriot "O America for Freedom", there is a more realistic view to see them here ...
