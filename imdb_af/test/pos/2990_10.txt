I saw the movie in 1972 and like other people commenting on this ... I came back many times to see it over and over. I think 9 times in total. Just wonderful is how I would describe it. I was taken by the soundtrack, the beautiful panorama of southern France, the lifestyle started the kids on their own. An ideal way to live is what they have set up ... of course, the forces that have to intervene, but if I forget that part, I find myself in the movie and live that way! So good that it is now available on DVD ... it wasn't for years! <br /> <br /> TLW
