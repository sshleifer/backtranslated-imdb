Like the 5-year-old protagonists of his latest opus, Hayao Miyazaki's "Ponyo", with his unbridled innocence, elevates as if the anime master himself became a child in the weaving of a story that eases in simplicity and a contagious charm emit. . Miyazaki, who remembers his earlier works, paints a brightly colored world that is apparently aimed at the younger audiences and the raw effervescence scatter the turbulent thematic elements that distinguish its immediate predecessors. <br /> <br /> Ponyo (lovingly spoken by Yuria Nara), a young girl's face (which looks like a cuddly kid in a pink overgrown Halloween costume), escapes from her underwater house and her school of brothers and sisters to explore the surface. On the beach she was saved by Sosuke (Hiroki Doi), a five-year-old boy who lives with his mother Risa (Tomoko Yamaguchi) in a house on the nearby cliff. This initial encounter and ultimately friendship has a profound effect on Ponyo, who wants to become a man now, but by striking a horse, nature's balance and unleashing a land-grinding stream. With Sosuke's help, Ponyo must pass a test to lift this curse and become completely human. <br /> <br /> Despite the plot lacking philosophical sophistication, his most recent "Spirited Away", "Ponyo" says nothing less than an astonishing succession, marked by the extremely diligent attention to detail and masterful balancing of the real and the fantastic, and of the simple joys and great fears. It's a simple story that, although sometimes placed by its tendency to rattle like a toddler, keeps its youthful pedigree in check. "I'll protect you," says Sosuke Ponyo, a childlike assertion, unlike the way Miyazaki gives his story with artificial spirit.
