This movie has an excellent play by Marilia PÃªra and a beautiful dicretcion by Argentine Hector Babenco. In my opinion, this is the best Brazilian movie ever made. The film is filmed with a child from the 'favelas', the Brazilian ghetos. The children were not actors and were thrown by Babenco in the city of Rio de Janeiro. The story is about the criminal children arrested in the correctional prison, which looks much worse than Alcatraz. The children are being raped and beaten by the policeman. Unfortunately, it is not pure fiction, in Brazil it is happening to this day. A must have for those who hold violent movies. But take your mom out of the room because it's a hard movie.
