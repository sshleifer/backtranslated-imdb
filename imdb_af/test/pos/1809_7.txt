This typical teen movie is one of the best. Besides the story is good, the music is well accompanied by the movie. <br /> <br /> Although I don't enjoy classical movie, unless it is classic and better written, this one is exceptional. Perhaps the hairstyle and language should change a little, in the 80's I believe that offensive language is seldom heard. <br /> <br />
