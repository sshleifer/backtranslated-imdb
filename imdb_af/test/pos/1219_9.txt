True Love, I really enjoyed and loved this movie. It was fun, funny and inspiring. I just saw it on DVD. How did I miss this one, it's a winner! I mean Flex was "That Guy". I wanted to marry him. It was my first time seeing him as a straight front man and he pulled it off. I thought Tangi Miller was the best ever and I was also a Felicity head. A fearless woman who only fears her Nana. Thank you for giving women of color in your work and she looks good! Tasha Smith was a blast! Aloma Wright was invaluable as Nana. This cute romantic comedy is "A Must See". Oh, and the new coming Marcus Patrick is the surprise ladies became ... True Love. karen
