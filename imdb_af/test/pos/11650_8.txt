It was the most formidable mainstream movie ever! It refused to look unilateral and the emotions felt by the story are as much as they can get. This movie has one of the most 'human' (And I use this term in a good way) compassionate religious character ever! This movie actually made me go to find and read the book (which is rare for me). Sister Helen exercised more of a spiritual tone than a religious one (also rare). And that has given both sides to the case, so that people on both sides who watched the movie would not feel that a point had been left out. And we have the director to thank for that. It's not a movie for entertainment. But it's a movie that delivers a message that can reach the heart of your heart. I can't think of another movie.
