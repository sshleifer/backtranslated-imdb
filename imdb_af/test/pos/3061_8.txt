This movie has to come out on DVD because it's the only way I can buy it. I thought it was so funny, because there was no real plot. It wasn't supposed to be an Oscar winning movie. I appreciate those movies. Cary Elwes was a very cute Robin Hood. I can't even think of my favorite part of the movie, because they're all pretty good. Anyways peace out. !!!!
