Story entails the release of old demon on Halloween night in a small village. In my entire life I have never seen such a cheese film, but it is so dme, you can forgive his bad acting, effects, direction and writing. This is the best movie created for the Halloween season since the original Halloween. And when they introduce Linnea Quigley's character for the first time, she is neat in the shower for just 5 minutes. Goodness they just don't get any better than that. Rush and buy this strap right away. 10/05
