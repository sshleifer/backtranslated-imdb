The movie was great when it came out. I attended Cooley High and Cooley's high school center. Around 1968 I was also home queen and grew up and lived in the neighborhood of Cabrini Greens. I knew a lot of people in the movie, It was nice to see friends in the movie that also lived in the area, and they had a chance to be a star who once was a lifetime experience to them . I had good times on the north and hard times I could relate to the movie Cooley High is no longer, but a person like me and others still remember the fun we grew up to meet Cooley High. There is a lot of history around this north side to tell.
