The movie was better than I expected. I was working on the film for a short while when Damien made this film. The firearm, stunt and acting came out well at the edit point. All the music wasn't that good. Better music will have this movie top. Some of the music sounds like the hippie days. Damien remembers you have gang gangster's old oldies or hip hop would have done it. It was more realistic than blood in blood. The cupboards are really well chosen. Scouting took a good job in this movie. The movie has brought back a filling of a lifestyle I use to live. But in the end you don't always win. And in my history, that's how it was. I first adapted to the movie. These are congratulations on this movie.
