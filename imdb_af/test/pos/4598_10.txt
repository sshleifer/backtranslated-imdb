I'm not sure why there are no articles or posters or anything about this movie because I just saw it and thought it was AWESOME. I think it's not for everyone because it's basically Kafka's "The Trial" meets "Beevis and Butt-Head", which is a tough combination to swallow. Yet I thought it was wonderful. If you are going to see it because you want a sequel to Office Space, you're likely to be disappointed. But if you want to see one of the most brutal, sour-tongue, and hilarious honest look at where our society is heading, you're in for a surprise. I only saw the opening night of 8:00 in Los Angeles and there were only 12 people in the theater, which meant the movie would probably be away in a week. It's really a shame, because at least idiocy is one of the best satires to come soon. But then again it basically makes fun of the people who make up about 99% of the filmmakers, so I think it's no wonder the studio was panicking and trying to dump it.
