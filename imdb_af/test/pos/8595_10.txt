This movie is the best movie I've ever seen. It's also the best movie that uses a drama to tell history, without speculating like JFK, Nixon or Hoffa. It portrays the clutches that Belgium had in the Congo. It also easily makes us the European and American forces behind the power of the Congo today. The film was specifically specific to the US murder of Lumumba. This film can never be made in the US as American films rarely criticize in acts of imperialism and murder. (Save Stone's JFK) This also allows us to address the problems that were present with the inner conflict of the Congo, between Lumumba, Mobutu and Katanga. We can see how difficult countries are in setting up new governments when their history is one of colonization and those who were the colonizers remain the power and power. The film was excellently shot with Eriq Ebouaney, an excellent Lumumba. The movie is big and they really pull you into the feel of the climate in the Congo at that time. <br /> <br /> Again, this is a must for those who love drama with a correct historical background. See my notes on Quilombo.
