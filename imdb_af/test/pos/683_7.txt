I first saw it as a kid (THE LITTLE RASCALS first bought on TV the year I was born) and it recently bought on DVD. Meanwhile, I looked at the opportunities that were going on, and took cautious notes at 1) the pie itself and 2) how racist some of these were: Farina as a Nubian slave, for example Voodoo. I think Roach and McGowan would have been killed if they tried to do it now. <br /> <br /> Notice how the tart fights in the Half Stooges 'HALFWITS' HOLIDAY AND THE SWEET PIE AND PIE looks like this one ... and this movie has a few years before their initial contract with Harry Cohn at Columbia Pictures came out. Of course, there was some inspiration from SS and Laurel & Hardy's DE BATTLE OF THE CENTURY for these films ... remember that they all stole the best !!! <br /> <br /> Another note: Laurel & Hardy buffs, the bakkie lady was none other than Dorothy Coburn, who also appeared in TBOTC, the 'flap' in her back car. It always escapes me why she has never been credited?
