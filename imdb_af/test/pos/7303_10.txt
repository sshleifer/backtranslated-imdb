Having seen this movie years ago, it never faded from my memory. I always thought it was the best performance by Michelle Pfeiffer I saw. But I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews this movie received. Once I have seen it again, I still think it is powerful, moving and can no longer care if it is "loose" on King Lear. <br /> <br /> I realize now that this is the biggest achievement by Jessica Lange I've ever seen - and she has a lot of shallower awards. <br /> <br /> A thousand acres are complex, human, alive and immensely moving, but certainly do not lead any of the primary female with a touch of shine or "sexiness". I don't think it's well received in these times. <br /> <br /> Perhaps one reason for the film's underlying reaction to the fact that the author (Jane Smiley (screenplay (Laura Jones) and director (Jocelhyn Moorehouse) are all women. I know I'm younger days did not read a book written by a woman, I did not focus on this fact until years. <br /> <br /> If you did not see this movie or in the past " given a chance, try to look at it again, maybe you're ready for it.
