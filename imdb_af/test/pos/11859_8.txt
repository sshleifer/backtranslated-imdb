I rented this movie without hearing or reading about it. What a pity! This movie is intelligent, spiritual, hilarious, quick and realistic ridiculous. The characters can be developed without relying too much on clich√©d, tired stereotypes. It was refreshing to watch. I couldn't help thinking that marketing would have helped this non-mainstream movie work in the famine-for-intelligent comedy mainstream. The quality of the dialogue and the ease with which the actors perform a great variety of discomfort, sadness and comedy are so rare nowadays. I felt the actors really enjoyed taking part in something rich. How is it that the National Treasure was the number one at the box office three weeks in a row for the first time - it is too weak to mention. I think I'm just glad movies like "Seeing .." are still made somewhere.
