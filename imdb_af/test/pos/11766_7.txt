Not your usual movie, but a good one. Billy Bob is very funny in this movie, the way he speaks, what he says, and so on. I was so surprised when I saw it, because I just thought it was a normal comedy, but it was more than that. It had a very good story, great characters and a good balance. <br /> <br /> Share Favorite: Probably when Billy Bob walks around in his robe at the rippers
