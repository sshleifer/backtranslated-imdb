Nice movie. I initially thought it was a medical detective type hi-fi movie, but the end totally surprised me. I think the whole movie covers too many subjects, each can be the major, eg. revenge, friendship and dream. But it all mixed them without focusing on any of them. I think it would be a good movie if it was built around the end of the beginning. <br /> <br />
