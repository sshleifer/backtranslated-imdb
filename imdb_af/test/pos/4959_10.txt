Okay, here's the deal. There is this American pilot flying together and inventing his own business when he is suddenly dominated by evil, cowardly, non-American fighter planes (they are Middle Eastern types, but enough to say they don't like apple pie or Elvis Presley ). who is going to shoot him. Now this American pilot has done nothing wrong, but those evil non-Americans do not care and before you know it, he was put in a strange jail and sentenced to death! <br /> <br /> Now, what would normally happen here is that the US military would bomb some nearby towns until the pilot was released, but not this time. Those bad peace-lovin types probably got involved and managed to stop any form of retaliation. As you can imagine, it is not the pilot's family, and the evil foreign dictator has this smug look over him. He'll pay the Americans, yes yes! <br /> <br /> But he didn't count on Doug Masters, the captive pilots, 16-year-old boy. You see Doug can fly a plane longer than he can drive a car (which can't be that long) and decide to fly into that evil foreign land and get his father back. So with the help of his friends, Doug and his wingman, the pilot had a retired pilot. Chappy 'Sinclair, Doug, announces a two-man air raid on foreigners. <br /> <br /> Now you'll think this plan will be bound to fail, but you'll be wrong. Sure, these Middle Eastern types can be all veteran pilots, but Doug has an ace on his sleeve, he listens to rock music when he flies! After Douglas dropped off at an airport, he inflicted a dozen or so enemy aircraft and inflated an oil refinery. Understandably, the evil, which is no longer so shaky, the dictator gets quite annoyed by these devastations and takes himself to the air to shoot Doug. But the young boy is listening to more rock music and blowing the villain out of the air. HURRAY! <br /> <br /> After Doug and Chappy shot off 90% of their air force, foreigners sent their last few aircraft in a reasonably poor attempt to shoot Doug, but in the neck of time, a flight of US F16's come up and scare them away. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie. It was the first video cassette movie I brought, and until twenty I was hoping my dad would be shot over a foreign land so I could save him. But he's not about to fly, so it didn't happen.
