I really love this movie. It has a very real feel for it. I believe it was never popular because of the subject, but because of the subject, it made the movie so much more important. <br /> <br /> It's a "A" movie and I highly recommend it. . If you liked a book or movie of 1984, I think you'll love this one too. <br /> <br /> It is hard to say the least, including mental and physical acts of torture, a little dirty. Not for the week in the heart or stomach. No movie, but his movie is so big to portray the mental anticipation. It doesn't need blood and gut. <br /> <br /> If you're not a realistic or a pestimistic person, I don't think you'll enjoy it. . It leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling about people, what they are capable of, and the real possibility that our government (s) do not necessarily have our personal interest in his heart.
