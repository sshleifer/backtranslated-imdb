Of course, as a movie buff, I've read all the turbulent reviews and funny, sarcastic remarks about this movie (my favorite is Woody Allen's quip. "If I had to live my life again, I wouldn't change anything except to see Lost Horizon's musical remake "). That's why I've never seen it without looking at the choreography / set / songs. Just recently I got a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, with a friend who has never heard of the film's reputation. He really enjoyed it and after I had excluded all the negative prejudices I naturally had about the movie, I did. There is nothing special about Lost Horizon, and it is much nicer and more visible than many other early 1970s. It's not even camp. The lyrics for some of the songs are quite repetitive and simplistic, but it is not really clear when they are first heard or the mistakes have been noticed beforehand so you are ready to mock them. Like all judges who claim that the cast cannot be sung, this criticism falls apart, as Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch are called (also brilliant, because the voice perfectly matches their voice) and Sally Kellerman has a lot of lovely and completely unique singing style. Strangely enough, Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey is about "The Things I Will Not Miss". Special mention should be made of legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer's brilliant performance as the High Lama - and his comment on humanity that destroys him is chillingly suited to today's broken world. For a moment I will not claim that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece. The things I would not miss are the uninspired choreography, and Bobby Van's number, a question for an answer that can be easily cut), but if you haven't even seen Lost Horizon, or have it not seen long ago, without looking, "Oh boy, let's have a laugh at this hope of the mess" attitude, and you'll be amazed at how pleasing it really is.
