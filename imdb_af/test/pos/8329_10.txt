Walking With Dinoasaurs is a new and exciting program that uses wonderful visual graphics to display the living dinosaurs. The information presented here is wonderful. The moods in the series change to get your attention, things like dramatic music when fighting out. There is clear evidence here for one cracking documentary! My biggest asx for the writers, directors and producers, and not the other people involved, forget. If you bump into this video in stores, I suggest you not only buy it for the graphics, but for the utmost efforts and productive work the series offers. 10/10
