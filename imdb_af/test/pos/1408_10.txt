William Haines denies this story of a brash cadet that thinks West Point will really be something, now that he has arrived. Haines was a fantastic goony comic show. His trademark was one of the best stars of 1928-1932 and one of MGM's biggest stars. Joan Crawford and William Bakewell are also good. And although this storyline may look new, it was a big hit, which tells Haines and Crawford in a college football (a national craze in the 20's). Once, too often, Haines cut off his big mouth and is almost avoided by fellow cadets, turning into a wonderful performance while devouring his pride and coming to the navy in the big game. Even with a broken arm, he wins the game for the army and regains his place at West Point. It's easy to see from this movie and Show People (with always underrated Marion Davies) why Billy Haines was a great star of the time. He needs and deserves to be remembered!
