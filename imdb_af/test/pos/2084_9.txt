Robert Florey and James Wong Howe gave it a frightening, expressionist look. Screens are shot at strange corners - especially scene involving figurative and literal lady-killer Zachary Scott. His sociopathic behavior endures an excellent, medium-budget film, The Stepfather, for more than two decades. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is excellent, although it's not hard to think, it's hard to think of Joyce Compton as anyone but the singer in "The Awful Truth." Scott, Bennett , Emerson, DeCamp (especially, and although they played an older woman, looks pretty). They couldn't get out of here. <br /> <br /> Setting up a creepy lodge-in-the-house woman against a psychiatric background is a risky trick that pays off beautifully. Nothing funny about everything. Nothing creepy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the resolution is a little coward. Neither Emerson came with Bennett. It makes sense. But Scott is sent too fast. I look more like him. Ripley's character, who could escape everything - botulism, the murder rap, the jealous sisters - and disappear into the big world beyond this story. It would not obstruct the substantial happy ending of the secretary and her boss eventually came together.
