It has an underlying air of honesty, intervening with shafts of humor that aren't out of place, and serves to demonstrate the insured direction and production values ​​involved. So many episodic type films are unfounded and untidy, but none of them. The standard of acting helps a lot, and the various diverse characters come in as interesting and credible. All in all, this long-forgotten jeweler is worthy of someone's attention, despite the one in the film that has attracted the censorship's attention!
