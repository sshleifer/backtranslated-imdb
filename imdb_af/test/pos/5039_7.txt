Angels are a bit of an American obsession, but are often rather boring. They are the messengers of God, and also the archangel are great warriors. (Lucifer is the hardest and most beautiful until he is kicked out of heaven.) <br /> <br /> So what happens if you don't believe in anything, let angels go and you're sent to investigate an angel story just to meet one with wings and less than angelic attitude. <br /> <br /> Maybe that's what America needs because a puritan is different from being good. Michael is a rude, peace-loving messenger of heaven who will fulfill your wishes and care enough for the world you will be touched upon. <br /> <br /> Funny, but not very, touching but not too sentimental, intelligent without being smart ... it's just a good simple, small comedy. Watch a lazy Sunday afternoon.
