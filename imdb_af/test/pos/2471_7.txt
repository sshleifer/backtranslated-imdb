The strengths of the film were clear for the beginning and the middle part of the film. It showed how a very violent, reactive authority can respond to resistance. In the form of a documentary film, the director is captured what would have happened if the United States had drafted the martial law. "Penalty Park Volunteering", a police training ground where you are being pooled and harassed, will give you a way out of this serious scenario. It varies between court trials for those charged, those in the park, escaping police attention, training officers preparing to handle these prisoners, the judges in their spare time, under many other things. It was a very strong, deep moving movie. <br /> <br /> The only mistake I had with this was realism. Officers are often seen holding their pistols, as they were seven years old with a plastic toy (that is, a 90 degree curved elbow when showing a gun in someone's face or the way one policeman looks it, is hard to kick somebody when they're down, etc., etc.). It begins as an honest and interesting attempt to capture a very critical state of political affairs. By the end of the film, the viewer is slowly and reminded of the prejudices of the director and the producers. The antagonist characters in the story begin as true, real people and then slowly move into the "stereotypical, objective forces of evil" to the end. The mistakes they make are stupid, the power they demonstrate is unreal and, contrary to the way the actual police act, the judges are shown during this court hearing that stupid and unreal errors occur under many other things. <br /> <br /> The reality of the movie started apart when it became clear that it's just another empty check to make the government look bad. And it comes from an Anarchist. The screens at the end started to get hokey, unreal and a thousand times too dramatic. Yet, for the earlier part, it promises a very moving story.
