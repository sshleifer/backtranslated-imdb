Moving past the words, this heartbreaking story of a divorce leads to a tragic retreat over a seven-year-old boy. <br /> <br /> One of Kramer's great strengths is his director Robert Benton, who has greatly adapted the Avery Corman's novel on the big screen. He keeps things beautifully simple and realistic, delivering all the drama straight from the heart. His talent for telling such emotional stories was to prove him again with 'Places in the Heart' where he showed, as in Kramer v. Kramer, that he has a natural ability to work with children. <br /> <br /> The other highlight of the picture is the wonderful play that received four of the film's nine Oscar awards, two of which are winners. One of them was Dustin Hoffman (Best Actor), who is wonderful as frustrated businessman Ted Kramer, a man who forgot his wife is a person. Like me. Joanne, me. Meryl Streep, claimed the supporting actress Oscar for a strong, sensitive portrayal of a woman who lost her in eight years of marriage. Jane Alexander also nominated for her fantastic turn as the Kramer's good friend Margaret. The final word in the play must go to young Justin Henry, whose amazingly moving performance crawls you back, and a thorough earning Oscar nomination has made its way. <br /> <br /> Brilliant is also Nestor Almendros cinematography and Jerry Greenberg's timely editing, while Henry Purcell's classic piece is used to accomplish. <br /> <br /> Surely this is a touch of how a father and son depend on each other when their wife and mother leave. They grow together, get to know each other and form a completely new and wonderful relationship. Ted finds himself with new responsibilities and a new outlook on life and slowly realizes why Joanne had to go. <br /> <br /> Surely, as nothing else, "Kramer v. Kramer" shows that no one wins when it comes <br /> <br /> Saturday June 10, 1995 - TV <br /> <br / > Strong drama from Avery Corman's novel about the sadness of a custody battle between estranged parents who both feel they have the best interests of the child. Apart from an excellent script and amazingly controlled direction, both by Robert Benton, this is the excellent role this picture makes such a winner. <br /> <br /> Hoffman is brilliant as Ted Kramer, the man tearing between his turnaround career and the boy he desperately wants to keep. Excellent is also Stripe as the woman lost in eight years of marriage, who had to stand out before she did not fade. In support of these two are a very strong Jane Alexander as mutual friend Margaret, an outstanding Justin Henry as the middle-caught boy, and a top throw of extras. <br /> <br /> This highly emotional, heartbreaking drama more than merit is the 1979 Academy Award for Best Film, Best Actor (Hoffman) and Best Supporting Actress (Streep). <br /> <br /> Wednesday, February 28, 1996 - TV
