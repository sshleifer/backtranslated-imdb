Susie Q is a great romantic prom movie. Amy Jo Johnson (Susie Q) is a wonderful actress. I think she did a good performance. I hope the Disney Company can put this movie on DVD. I think it's a little cool and a bit hilarious. It's a little sad when Susie Q dies in a car accident at first, it makes you cry or sigh first. But in the middle when no one suspects Susie Q, it becomes so funny and surprising. There is a little secret in this movie, but not much. But still I would recommend this movie to the whole family if they enjoy comedy, mystery or romance type movies. It's great! I think Amy Jo Johnson as Susie Q is cute.
