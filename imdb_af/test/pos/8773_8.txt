I'm a massive Hitchcock fan, since I've seen a "Rear Window" on television. "Saboteur" is not Hitchcock's best for me, it's very good, but not a masterpiece. It does have its faults, some parts move slowly, and as a result it is suddenly written off. But Hitchcock's direction is wonderful, and the performances were not so bad. While Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane both do well enough, Otto Kruger and Norman Lloyd come close to the show. The story is good, about an aggrieved man, very similar themes used in "39 Steps" and "North North West", and gives cleverly essential escape. The music score was absolutely outstanding; The music in the opening title series was phenomenal, almost like a twisted march, and I kept the tombs at Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concert and Beethoven's 5th Symphony. The cinematography is also sharp and smooth, the landscape and landscapes are almost brilliant and there are also a number of very effective scenes. On behalf of the Statue of Liberty, climax, but the circus group meeting and the Radio Music City Hall shooting are also on the money. Overall, not Hitchcock's best, but definitely worth it. 8/10 Bethany Cox
