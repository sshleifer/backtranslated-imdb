<br /> <br /> Very good 1970's movie about mob operations in New Jersey. When a maverick gangster does not play sooner or later according to neighborhood rules, it is time for elimination. <br /> <br /> Joe Pesci was true to his character - smooth and funny. He just gets better with age. His face and contemporary fame should not be used on the DVD cover to sell this B-grade movie, as he was only the third billed star. <br /> <br /> Dated 1970s printed wide lapel shirts and less quality background music make for a distraction. Nice to see the big cars of the 1970s. <br /> <br /> However, the acting is good. <br /> <br /> Nudity on the part of Anne Johns was not necessary to make this humpback storyline. And she doesn't appear in the database, as each play resumes in any other movie than this one. Sorry; she did a good job! <br /> <br /> Moral of the story: Don't get your "Don" upset. <br /> <br /> If you want to see something else when you wake up In the middle of the night, watch this DVD. It was part of a three-film-on-one DVD $ 5.88 special at the local discount store. <br /> <br />
