Went to the premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival in NYC and I absolutely loved the movie !!! I'm Diane's biggest fan and of course, as always, she has a great show! I've seen one of her movies and I have to say this is one of my new favorites. Diane was funny and moved and just took my breath away. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly humorous but also a good amount of serious. Anton Yelchin is just a wonderful young actor and has a wonderful performance. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a great movie. 10 inches up !!! I will definitely see it again and again. This is the best movie of the year so far !!!
