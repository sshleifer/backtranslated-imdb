Eisenstein created the Russian Montage Theory, and this film is his best example. It took years before anyone could use his ideas and make them work (The Limey, 1999). Nevertheless, the baby carriage demonstrates the discombobulated nature of RMT. Granted, like most movies, it gets long in some parts, the beauty of the movie is wonderful. One of the best silent movies I've ever seen.
