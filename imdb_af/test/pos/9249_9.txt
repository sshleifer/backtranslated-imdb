I'm very biased because I appear in this movie, but I loved it and I'm just about seven scattered minutes and not nearly the most interesting part of it. The film is an honest and intriguing version of a noble independent group of filmmakers trying to make a lovely movie. It is also a report of inflated expectations and cases. The interviews are well merged into the editing. The different people are all interesting and there is never really too much of one person. Also, the interviews are shot in a very interesting way, which keeps the film visually satisfying. Definitely worth a movie. I hope it gets around.
