This little shit is absolutely fascinated for me. <br /> <br /> The only thing I've seen so far is some of the work of Dog Star Man's creator Sam Brakhage. But where Brakhage is trying to get rid of "letting us learn how to see again" and giving us a fright of headaches that cause bright colors and flashes (which I still dig and embrace completely as a high art ... ), this film I would characterize as very relaxing and hypnotic. Man Ray's general use of spinning objects / camera does not create much of a dizzying feeling, but a warm flow of senses, intermingling and with the gravity of the moving world around us. <br /> <br /> An interesting imagination Of this very short work is that objects become more and more recognizable until we end up on a naked torso (of which I am the least female rounded breasts I've ever seen). The circles and spirals of shadow and light over the upper body make it an object of surreal beauty, something you can hang on your wall and survive forever. It is because of this and other images in this movie that I had to see it again and again (finally a total of seven times) just because it fascinated me completely. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
