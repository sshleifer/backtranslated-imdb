this movie may not look like some people, but it has everything I'm looking for in a comedy. Funny moments fall away, accompanied by a moment or two of serious moving scenes, great actors and almost everything a good movie should be. Despite the fact that David played his usual snobbish character, he made this role in an unusual show that I don't think he ever exceeded until he hit the screen with Joe dirty. Whether some people were not Chris Farley fans or not, I saw this movie when it came out and my friends and I still talk about it ... 11 years later. this movie was what finally told me that Chris Farley was the right deal. He's the best comedian I've ever seen in my life. In the words of some, he can be clumsy, clever, funny, serious, crazy, sober and at the same time moving or oppressing. not the same words, but the message is all that matters. one of the true great actors of our time, and one of the true great comedies of all time. along with good acting, good story, hilarious moments, serious scenes that sometimes led me to tears. This movie is on top of the hordes as a movie that marked the beginning of a brief reign at the top of the comedy world by late Chris Farley. no actor before or since then my interest in a movie has since caught. because no actor before or since put so much in his movies. this movie is worth it, if you haven't taken the time to see it, do it the next time you rent a movie.
