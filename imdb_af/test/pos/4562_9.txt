This is one of the most satisfying of the TV adaptation book. The actress who makes us believe that a sponsor can be sexy lets us believe that a scout and traitor can have some redeeming qualities. <br /> <br /> The TV plot line doesn't exactly follow Cornwell's story, but is both exciting and rewarding as a resale of a darn good yarn. If you have a yen for romance in uniform, there is a lot of sexual energy between our husband Sharpe and the lying sparkle sparkle. Let me wish her role was closer to that in the books. But no matter there is enough hero injustice, hero layoff, hero in anger, hero in flight and hero in the fight to keep you on your DVD game.
