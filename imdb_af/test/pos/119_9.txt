I finally watched the third movie in Mehta's trilogy: "Fire". To begin, I would say that "Water" was the undisputed masterpiece at all levels. Fire comes next with Earth near rear in order of quality. Fire: There is so much going on in this movie that I still need some views to drink it all. The writing is wonderful, the writing creates friction that starts the whole process of "heat" from the beginning to the end when it really bursts into a fire, the conflicts are moved into a complete break of relationships. <br /> <br /> Mehta is a brave lady: she sees with an obvious eye, rushed, fake and oppressive about the great society she came from. India is rapidly changing, but many of these are economic change. That she had come up with such a terrible opposition to the making of "Water" after she cleared the script, shows that there are still many taboo subjects that could face more than less in the face of Indians, unable to investigate it or book. Worse, if someone like Mehta has the courage to keep a mirror on these issues, his death threats are confronted. So, as much as India thinks of itself as a pluralistic, tolerant society, the facts are not always so. Whereas "Earth" was merely a historic institution of the victim of the civil war after Indian independence. Brand and Water point to personal, social and religious issues, which I think are so strong (in a negative sense) as an open artistic dialogue are still many years away. As I write this "Water" is scheduled to be shown in India later this year. I will believe it if I see it. <br /> <br /> Fire confronts a similar sexual and emotional confrontation I saw in a price above rubies. Whether it is arranged marriages (which were about 150 years ago among the Jews, or it is among many modern Indians), there is a risk of a bad match being forced on men and women; or, just plain unloving marriages ..... But that is not the right thing. Mehta is clearly impatient with the completely rigid religious attitudes that either widows in misery (Water) or women who are addicted to loveless marriages (Fire). I'm not an expert on the secular or Hindu laws regarding divorce. The film seems to imply that the stigma (of divorce) is almost as bad as the sad marriage. Anyway, Mehta's movie is a very moving, powerful attempt at sexual discourse that puts modern Indian relationships to the test. That all three of these films made themselves feel in India, as an unjustified attack on their culture, sounds like the predictable emphasis of an oppressive mindset. Mehta forces the issues to be looked at, no matter how much flack. I admire her work and can't recommend her movies. Excellent, disturbing, challenging, taboo crushing.
