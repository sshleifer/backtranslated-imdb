I liked this movie too much. My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside. From Corse Ironside is just a low rent Jack Nicholson. I think Mike was busy with "Highlander 2: The Quickening" that year. Unfortunately, "Beastmaster 2" was a much better career. It is definitely the best of the Beastmaster series and reminds of very big screen classic "Masters of the Universe". Not only does it face the unparalleled Mark Singer but also a wonderful supporting role, especially the second Slider girl, Uncle Phil of "Fresh Prince of Belair" and an evil chick of Superman 2. It has grown my world and is Definitely a must for anyone who has no social or physical outlets. BEASTMASTER FOREVER !!! ROCK'N ROLL !!!
