May contain decay <br /> <br /> This historic movie was so refreshing. Although it can admonish the actual events, it shows the heartless nature of Emperor Qui, after which he was later notorious. And there wasn't a single computer-generated person in it. I think it's great that China has made such an epic film. The costumes and settings were beautiful, the performances were also excellent. Dignity against death is an important theme in this movie and I think it reflects Chinese history and culture. I also had some speech on the terracotta fighters, a 3D map cut from the conquest of China with individual soldiers. Emperor Qui of course later than complicated with his life-size terracotta warriors. <br /> <br /> I also enjoyed the scene with the dwarf, he was a very interesting character, even though he had only a small scene. <Br /> <br /> 9/10 <br /> <br />
