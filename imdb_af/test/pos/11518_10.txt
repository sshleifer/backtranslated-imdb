NEW YORK LIGHTS was the first all-taking feature film. It comes in a fast 57 minutes and is directed by Bryan Foy (of the well-known vaudeville family). <br /> <br /> The story has two brave barbers (Cullen Landis, Eugene Palette) longing for a big city life and getting involved with gangsters and bootleg drinks. One of the guys is estimated for the murder of a policeman, but is being rescued by a gun mill (Gladys Brockwell) at the last minute. Much of the story takes place in a nightclub called The Night Hawk, which is led by a crook called Hawk (Wheeler Oakman) who has his eye on a beautiful choirline (Helene Costello) that is the girlfriend of Landis . Costello gets a short dance, and we hear Harry Downing (as Ted Lewis looks) singing "At Dawning" in his best Al Jolson style. <br /> <br /> The scene ranges from good (Palette and Brockwell) Aardig (Oakman). Some of the actors keep their lines, but then they are right on the scene. As noted elsewhere, it was meant to be a short 2-reel and was made on a shocking budget. Surprisingly, the voices are all clear, and there is a neat film-like touch in the silhouette. <br /> <br /> The movie was a cash desk, even though it was shown as a silent movie where theaters were not. Wired for new audio technology. Nobody expected this little movie to earn an incredible $ 1.3m. It briefly made stars of Costello and Landis and ruled Palette on his long career as a strong character actor. <br /> <br /> Co-stars include Mary Carr as mother, Robert Elliott as detective, Eddie Kane as the street quarters, and Tom Dugan as a rogue.
