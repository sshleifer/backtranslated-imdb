Like most women, this movie is the ultimate chick spot. With his warm chemistry, sexy dance routines and beaitiful songs, I mean timeless classic like I had. The time of my life and the wonderful she is like the wind makes this movie. I adore Patrick Swayze in this movie and he shows that he can sing and dance it is so hot. He sings "She is like the wind" in the movie. The chemistry between Swayze and co-star Jennifer Gray is incredible. I love all the dancing and everything that goes with it. But say this Dirty Dancing 2: - Havana Nights is also great, but Patrick Swayze scenes make it. I love the songs, dancing and everything about it, but it's not Dirty Dancing. As I said it was a wonderful chick spot. Please be a 3rd because I like to see what happens to Patrick's character Johnny. Jennifer's character could have been more sexy, but hey, Patrick, get it done if you know what I mean !!! Big movie and I'm so happy Billy Zane didn't win the role of the movie. I whispered, he was meant for the role, but they realized he couldn't dance.
