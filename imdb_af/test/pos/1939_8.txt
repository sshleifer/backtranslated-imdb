River's Edge is more than the story of a murder. It is a wave of apathy that has afflicted youths for decades. Our main characters are a group of who would call me high school as "stoners". One of them just decided to strangle his girlfriend because she apparently had the nerve to talk to him. This dangerous young man played by Daniel Roebuck has an intensity that will annoy you. He takes the other kids in the group to show them his girlfriend's body, and strangely, nobody really looks at it. The balance of the film indicates the desperate circumstances in which these people live, and how they can eventually worm in these apathetic children. <br /> <br /> River's Edge definitely doesn't announce the behavior of its characters. We clearly see the dangers presented by such unnoticed apathy and have only the desire to become drunk or tall. We are shown the dysfunctional home life these children have, and perhaps it is meant to explain their terrible behavior. But can it be just unstable homes that lead to this kind of destructive life? Crispin Glover is his usual, self-confusing self. He drove to the murder in a state of complete paranoia. He tried to sympathize with why his friend had to commit the crime, but clearly he did not understand what the young man could do. Dennis Hopper plays an older man these children get their baptism from. Although he is definitely a rebellious figure, he cannot relate to the apathy and anger of the younger generation. Testify of his confused response when Roebuck describes how killing his girlfriend made him feel. As wild as Hopper's character, he even knows that this young man should not walk on the face of the earth. <br /> <br /> What would you think of these kids? Well, there really is no way to keep their characters. Some are less despicable than others, but you can't help hate or feel sorry for them. Twenty years later there is another apathy alive and well in many young people out there. When will these children get lost? What makes so much of their antisocial will? This movie, and the questions it has about teenagers, will stay with you for a while. This is a fact. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
