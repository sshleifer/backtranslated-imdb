One of the most macabre, depressing, but eye-opening documents. I watched for a while. There is no narrative or story being told, just a "third eye" type camera that follows about 2 couples of heroin addicts in NYC through the seasons. To fire them on the floors of public washrooms, they need to clean their needles in the public toilets ... sometimes it's a bit too much and you just have to stop to just breathe. <br /> <br /> Anyone who needs to look at the restoration of alcohol and drug addiction should see it if they want - it really shows you what you can go back to! After seeing it, it's a wonder how someone can even start this drug. <br /> <br /> The only thing needed was a sequel to the end to tell where these people are today. Judging from what is shown in the document, there is no hope for any of them. They call it better and better, but it seems the only end to their habits is to die. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not for all audiences. I saw myself as a car accident. After I started watching it, I just couldn't turn it off. I had to keep looking with a dark / morbid fascination with what it looks like in the lives of these addicts.
