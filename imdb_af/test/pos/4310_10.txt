A unique combination of musical, film noir and comedy - with some sex scenes thrown in to a good degree. The only other movie I can think of, with a fairly similar game and crazy mix of themes and clichés, is the French movie Billy Ze Kick - but it has a more surreal and peculiar approach. <br /> <br /> Not that this movie wouldn't be surreal or strange. The humor is sometimes quite subtle, at other times blatant in your face - and often exceeds the limit of offensiveness. To give an example: In post-coital chit-chat with a prostitute, our hero Max Müller encourages her to reveal who was responsible for a recent murder with the words "Schiess los!". Literally, this phrase means "Shoot!" in German, and that's exactly what a hidden assassin does in response. In other words, this beautiful lady was sacrificed for a pun. <br /> <br /> Müllers Büro is also one of the very rare examples of movies with funny sex scenes. Larry's romance is accompanied by the song "Ich will mehr" (while supporting the song completely), changing the meaning of his words several times, and ending Larry's inability to render any further service. The film's main love story between Max Müller and Bettina Kant does not have such a subtlety - it is a cake tray, especially if Bettina's song comes down slowly, of course all in the rhythm of the music. <br /> <br /> Unless you are one of the easiest offenders.
