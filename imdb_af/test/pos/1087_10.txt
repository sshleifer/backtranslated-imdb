Satya was excellent. Company was just as good, but more polished, probably because of the money earned from previous movies. However, Ab Tak Chappan is even more entertaining. The dialogue is eager, rough and sometimes hilaries. Nana Pataker shines again in a role he can only fulfill with authority, but the supporting role is very talented. Direction is stiff and the story develops at a satisfying pace with a very dramatic climax. As a portrayal of reality, it can be over-dramatized, but at the end of the day it's a movie, so the balance is in the right place. I ordered my DVD and can't wait to see it again at home. As a lover of this kind of gangster movie, it is very gratifying and highly recommended for the refreshing non-Yash Raj Bollywood gangster movie lovers out there.
