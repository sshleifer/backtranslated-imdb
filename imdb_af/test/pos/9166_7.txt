This movie was much better than I expected. After a few movies by Will Smith which isn't as good as I, Robot, he is nice and nice again in this one. Smith plays, Hitch, a date doctor. Most of the movies center him on teaching Albert how to be himself and an appointment with Allegra Cole, a well-known well-known person with whom he works. Albert is a klutz and goof and always bumps on his feet or whatever. All Hitch teaches him how to be cool and not as nervous about Allegra. <br /> <br /> All in all, Hitch meets Sara, a gossip colonist who has sworn men. Hitch charms her, so of course they go out. But Hitch can teach other guys how to drop the girl for them, he doesn't love himself. He has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college. But he likes Sara, so follow her. Sara's friend was hurt by a man she thought went to the doctor. So Sara follows the doctor, just to teach his Hitch. So, she thinks she's a pig. Then it's about to explain to Sara and Allegra what he's doing, so they're both forgiving. <br /> <br /> FINAL THICKNESS: Okay, laughed a bit and was entertaining. I recommend it.
