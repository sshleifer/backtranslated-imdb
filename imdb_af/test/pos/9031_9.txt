It's too bad that iameracing wants to deny Faulkner's reality and Clarence Brown's purpose in creating the story and movie of "Intruder In The Dust". I suppose the burden of a history of racism is difficult for any Southern to bear and I can understand. But to say that this film is not specifically about racism, is ridiculous and inaccurate. YES (to use your capital letter) iameracing, there are many places where blacks and white people in the South come together very well. But to deny the way black people were sometimes forced to live, the circumstances and injustices they had to endure were not imaginary. Sometimes black and white people merged because of true love and understanding. Sometimes it was as long as blacks knew their place. "The point of making Juano Hernandez's character (in film and print) a somewhat thin type, not hot and vague, was to cause injustice to be wrong. In and of itself and to emphasize human rights only for everyone, whether we are a specific individual or not. <br /> <br /> It will do well to stop the existence of racism and the great harm iameracing The fact is that blacks (indeed) were not, as a rule, an exception, receiving the benefits of the legal system as self-employed as whites, and segregation, discrimination and lynching are historical facts. such as iameracing can claim these things, not as widespread as some think and will probably like to free their ancestors and heroes of any connection with such behavior. This would be a wonderful thing if Iameracing's Southern ancestors (if any) never to any of the terrible racist axis es who took part in this country's history and I hope they did. If it is so congratulations to them, but the fact, if so, does not hide the fact that others did. And even if the terrible things done to blacks in the South (and other areas, let's not forget the Draft riots of the Civil War era) were only half as much, only a third, make them less terrible ? Is the killing of ten children hanging out of ten men, the sexual assault of ten women, less terrible than the same things that happen to a hundred? <br /> <br /> Iameracing asks us to get the "Mississippi Burning" slide off our shoulders before we get "Intruder In The Dust". Well, I ask you, did the killings of civil rights activists happen or not? Why should it be forgotten? Forgive? Can be. But to prevent their recurrence, they cannot be forgotten or reviewed in minor incidents. The racism displayed in "Intruder In The Dust" is being deliberately displayed. It's there to make a point. <br /> <br /> On a historical-historical level, it is also ridiculous that the racial angle is discounted. Any viewer of films filmed before the 1960s knows that black actors / characters / extras are usually deliberately thrown. To judge from our film history; Wars are always fought by middle-aged whites; There were no black people in the Old West; it was possible to walk a street in a big city and never meet a black person; There were no black hospital orders, taxi drivers, clerks, sellers, etc. Blacks were almost never thrown into a role unless race was a factor. If Falukner (and Brown) wanted to tell a simple murder story, he would probably not have made the Hernandez character black. <br /> <br /> Racism exists iameracing. Probably for different reasons I'm sure, we both wish it didn't, but did it. Being things we want them to probably can't be helped, but it doesn't.
