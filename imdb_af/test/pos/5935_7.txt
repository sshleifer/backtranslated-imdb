A proper royal rumble event <br /> <br /> 1. Edge Vs Shawn Michaels <br /> 7.5 / 10 A very strong opener ... rand's heel performance was sublime as it was during the rubbish event. Ooral id says EDGES NIGHT .... <br /> 2. Undertaker Vs Heidenreich CASKET MATCH <br /> 7/10 Many people have hated this rivalry, although I liked it, I thought he had played his character well. The match was not surprising in the excitement that was up to the canals, and it was mysterious. It gets better than it does. <br /> <br /> 3. Kurt Angle Vs Big Show Vs JBL (WWE CHAMP) WWE TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 7.5 / 10 a surprisingly good game because there was only one very exciting in the ring in it .. corner of course .... very good title game .. good fit .. although a predictable end. But not all the royal title titles are predictable. <br /> <br /> 4. Triple H (WORLD TITLE) Vs Randy Orton WORLD TITLE MATCH <br /> <br /> 6.5 / 10 not really as good for the guys involved, have too many dry spots gone, Orton sold his concussion incredibly. of an anti-climax. <br /> <br /> 5. ROYAL RUMBLE EVENT ... VAT during the other games there were a few segments ... two that were really cool ... Cena rapping on Christian and Guerrero stealing flairs number 30 ticket. The event was good. 7/10 would have gotten a 9 if the cena won, but unfortunately, my biggest enemy wins batista (THAT I UNDERSTAND WHY). Vince comes down and takes a drop and the whole arena breaks into the laugh.
