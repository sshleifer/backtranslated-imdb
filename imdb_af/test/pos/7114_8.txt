It's another universal fun-free horror festival. Many people want to compare it to House Of Frankenstein. Although it has similar cast and the same director, it can stand alone. (It turns out that Erle C Kenton most of the 40's Universal horror movies). <br /> <br /> The Plot Recognition: Baron Latos appears at the home of Dr Eidlemann seeking a "cure" for his vampirism. Larry Talbot (who survived House OF Frankenstein) also pointed out the good doctor's door to a healing for his misery. After a failed suicide attempt, Talbot and the doctor found the Frankenstein monster. To complicate things just before biting the dust, Dracula infects the good doctor with his blood. The doctor becomes a bloodthirsty maniac at certain times. Where this results is something you have to see for yourself. <br /> <br /> Carradine actually gives a very good performance as Dracula. He does not visit the scenery as he will play in later roles. It is difficult to suppress giggles when it appears in a top hat. The cape / mantle is traditional, but the hat must go. Where does the hat go when he turns into a bat? <br /> <br /> Onslow Stevens gives an excellent portrayal of the doctor. He is torn between his basic kindness and the increasing bloodlust he now tends to. This is a very underrated performance. Chaney brings more life to the Wolf Man in his 4 appearance in that role. <br /> <br /> The monster is not given much to do this time. Just lying at the table until the end (a few footage of the Ghost Of Frankenstein is used.) At least in the house of Frankenstein he was up and down a bit. <br /> <br /> Yes, it adheres to the basic Universal pattern filled with angry village moles running amber with torches. But it's not a bad way to spend an hour and ten minutes. It gets a low 8.
