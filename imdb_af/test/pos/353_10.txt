The Mario series is back, and in my opinion, better than ever. Galaxy is the most creative Mario yet; even more so than super mario 64. control is great; some of the best for the Wii. beautiful graphic design too. The levels are very large, and the good old bosses are back. there are tons to explore in this game; definitely a high level of repeat value. I have only 2 complaints: 1: the story is a bit similar to Mario 64 and 2: the problem is not very high; although it does require patience. Mario fans: the game you were waiting for. Casual gamers: this game is worth more than that. 9.8 out of 10.
