Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks) is a versatile, female Texas congressman with no observable legislative record. In 1980 he was interested in the fate of Afghanistan, which is in the midst of a brutal war with the USSR. On the protection of his old flame, the archaic Texas socialist Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), he travels to Afghanistan to assess the situation and is astounded by what he sees. He returns to the US, who is determined to help the Afghans, only to find his colleagues extremely indifferent to the situation - and to investigate drug abuse allegations. Wilson recruits Haring and the vulgar, outcast CIA Agent Gust Avrakotos (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) to launch a complicated arms deal with Israel, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and a mostly unknown US Congress. Eventually, the Afghans defeated the Soviet Union, but while America celebrated their victory, Wilson and Avrakotos found their warnings about the instability of post-war Afghanistan falling deaf. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is brain-minded, a very neat movie for the more intellectual viewer and fun entertainment for the average filmmaker. The film brings together an incredible variety of talent, as well as behind the camera, delivering on its promise to be a great time. The movie has only one error, which we will arrive later. As an inquiry into the unlikely way of the 20th century's greatest secret war - and perhaps the way things are done by the CIA and other intelligence agencies, it is fascinating. <br /> <br /> The movie is interesting on a number of levels. The story depicted in the film - with all its far-reaching dual-processions, assassins, and perhaps its greatest success - would be as scandalous as a fiction work that could easily be dismissed as a satire. But things really did that, at least within reasonable limits. The film portrays our three main characters in an interesting way that emphasizes their virtues without obscuring their mistakes. Wilson as a person who is uncomfortable about his vices (even embraces them) - yet ready to embrace a just cause. Herring is something of an elite, and her regenerated attitude of justice is different - but she is deeply committed to the cause of the Afghan people. Avrakotos is a CIA outsider with an attitude problem, looking at his "street" background - but his love of land and hatred of communism is unwavering. The fact that this strange trio can play an important role in the downfall of the USSR has not only proved that anyone can make a difference, but also that the truth is strange to fiction. It's also very interesting that it's all played as a comedy - not too surprising, as our author Aaron Sorkin is, but it's an interesting way to approach this story. <br /> <br /> However, the film does have one drawback, which is a bit surprising. The film seems to celebrate Watson and Co's performance unashamedly. It's good - nothing wrong with defeating the Soviet Union, is there? - One believes that from the axis of Soviet defeat in Afghanistan the Taliban and finally al-Qaeda. Regardless of the US responsibility level, it happened, and the film's portrayal of Wilson's success is almost tireless. To be honest, the movie addresses the problem at the end, with a fair speech by Wilson about SU's inability to clean up themselves, but it is so tertiary that the average viewer probably won't take much of it not. The overall impression would be that these three remarkable people helped the Afghans to defeat the Soviet Union. This is not a fatal disadvantage, but it is a disturbing aspect of an otherwise brilliant movie. <br /> <br /> The film's talent is remarkable. The legendary Mike Nichols delivers a smooth, beautiful view. The material is perfectly suited to its understated, cruel direct style. Sorkin delivers another brilliant script; The film has dozens of quotes and classic Sorkin exchanges (the best of which is the Scotch bottle discussion between Wilson and Avrakotos) and a political and historical perspective. The movie of the movie is a wonder: Tom Hanks gives a good performance as the favorite villain with a cause, Julia Roberts is alternately charming and repulsive as the unpleasant, but Joanne, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman steal every scene (as usual ) than the abusive Gus. The always lovely Amy Adams takes another step on her way to the stars as Wilson's long suffering assistant, and Ned Beatty, Om Puri, Emily Blunt, Christopher Denham and Ken Stott break the supporting role. <br /> <br /> Charlie Wilson's War is an intelligent and fun movie, a great bit of a little more than light entertainment. The fact that it decides not to be more than that should not be kept through it; It's brilliant about what it does. <br /> <br /> 8/10
