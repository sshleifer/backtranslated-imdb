I watch this movie every time it plays on TV. A just brilliant movie. Three men come back from the war and are trying to return to civilian life with great difficulty. All three led opposite lives during the war (Executive Banker became an army corps, a soft drink became an air force captain and the High School soccer hero lost his arms in the fight) and now everyone must rebuild his life and with a new reality committed. . The homes they return to, with adults and independent working women with a depressed economy, just add to the quarrel. It's the screens just outside the camera and the unspoken dialogue that resonates the hardest. The awkward intimacy of Frederich March and Myrna Loy and his struggle to return to his place as leader (at home and at work) is heartbreaking. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is beating as the handsome, decorated captain struggling to keep his life together without the uniform. <br /> <br /> The film is filled with honest characters and each one is portrayed by a gifted actor. <br /> <br /> However, this movie has taken a whole different level after seeing, "Saving Private Ryan." The reality and extent of what these men spent on love and land ... and of course it didn't end up on the battlefield. <br /> <br /> It is essential for any collection. <Br /> <br />
