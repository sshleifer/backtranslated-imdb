The 221 episodes of "The Lone Ranger" were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then they played in local syndication for many years. For most of the original broadcast years, the series was ABC's most watched piece of programming. <br /> <br /> The new DVD series from Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (September 15 - December 29, 1949) and for some reason I'm out of the fifth season unknown for episode 22 for the total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available on last year's Mill Creek Entertainment release, so it's probably in the public domain). These sets make the movie 'The Legend of the Lone Ranger' unnecessary, as all three episodes combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these issues. <br /> <br /> Early episodes rake back to the radio, as much more narrative is used as an introduction and important plot moments are introduced. <br /> <br /> The series itself was pure kiddie western with clear good and bad distinctions and no romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) begins Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes set the scene for his transformation to Lone Ranger status, his partnership with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels), and the tame of his horse, "Silver". <br /> <br /> There is an unambiguous code of positive morality that infuses every episode. The Lone Ranger is quite good, but he accepts the cover of evil. While a masked man in the west is usually feared by the good citizens and an Indian is trusted, the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do evil. One ongoing theme is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto first meet an average citizen, they are greeted with suspicion and by the end of the episode the citizen is convinced of their value. The ending brand was a secondary character who asked the question, "Who was that masked man?" <br /> <br /> To really enjoy the series, you have to accept it for the simplistic morality story it intended to be. If you don't take it seriously and want to stay for some self-reflexive championship parody elements, you'll just get frustrated. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
