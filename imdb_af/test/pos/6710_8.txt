Is this a perfect movie? No. This is a strange adaptation of a scientific book and it contains space vampires, naked beauty and British army efficiency. <br /> <br /> When I first saw, I was quite young and all I can remember is the sense of awe for the movie and Mathilda May. Actually, if it wasn't that this beautiful lady was naked the whole movie, I probably wouldn't have classified it so high, but for her glorious magnificence, I'm actually thinking of voting it! <br /> <br /> I have been reminded of the movie and watched it again. Imagine Raiders of the Lost Ark or Poltergeist's special effects plundered into a pretty good sci-fi story, but totally over the top accomplishments. I still enjoyed the movie immensely (as well as Mathilda May), but it was a mixture of nostalgia that compares to the shit films they make today and actually want more than it ended. <br /> <br /> Bottom line: if you're a sci-fi fan, don't miss this movie. Oh and did I mention Mathilda May is young, beautiful and naked?
