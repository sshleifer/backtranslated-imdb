I would recommend it as the most successful attempt so far to make a film about Soviet Afghan war. And it's a very honest and responsible picture, from small details of uniforms and weapons to human relationships, war routines and Central Asian landscapes. It was shot in Tajikistan just after the withdrawal of the troop that did not happen in 1989 in 1985. The Italian star, Mr. Placido was perfect in the role of Major Bandura. Other characters also look very natural, especially always drunk club manager :-). The scenario seems a bit trapped, but it could be an impact of the Civil War in Tajikistan that started right in the shooting of the movie. All movie teams sometimes had to escape under fire. The last scene is pure "harakiri" type of behavior and reminds me of the final phrase of a well-known samurai movie. "We won all the battles but lost the war." It can also be a metaphor for the USSR collapse - the big country that can get rid of the little offended child.
