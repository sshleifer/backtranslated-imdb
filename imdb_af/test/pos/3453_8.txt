Wow! A wonderful, lost piece of Australiana AND a lost 70-glamrock movie threw in one. This movie only guarantees to see what can be done with next to no budget, but a lot of enthusiasm. As a re-announcement of the Oz story, the movie is too clear on the side of the play, but it is saved by its eccentricity. The chance for a look at how glam rocks are revealed in Australia will entertain the genre of the genre. This movie was double with the Rocky Horror Picture Show, an indication of the type of film that Oz is. Although not as frivolous or well-built as RHPS, it's not hard to enjoy Oz. <br /> <br /> Surprisingly, Oz has gone well - perhaps a by-product of how determined in 1976 in Australia. The history of history shows that many of the ideas being explored would eventually come into the mainstream. The willingness of the movie to give prominence to gay characters is remarkable, especially as it leads to the "revolution" period for Australian gay rights push. <br /> <br /> The performances range from flinchingly amateur to delicate nuance. The direction is lacking in subtlety and much of the dialogue may have benefited from an extra concept or two. Somehow, these mistakes add to the appeal of the movie who is mercilessly unpretentious. Much like Australia in the 1970s, this movie had a certain naive charm. <br /> <br /> There are several connections with the original Australian stays of the Rocky Horror Show that will keep obsessive on their toes. <br /> <br /> Oz is definitely a minor classic and a potential culture photo worthy of review. Laughing at the horrific 70s fashion, swinging along with the AusRock soundtrack, leaving ANY expectations at the door and Oz will probably be delighted.
