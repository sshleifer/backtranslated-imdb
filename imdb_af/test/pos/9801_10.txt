It must be the best movie of all time (in my opinion). This really taught me when I was watching when I was 10 (in 2000) that the freedom of a being would keep a child away, then we expect it. Joseph Mazzello must also be my favorite actor, and I think he and Elijah have done a wonderful job in the roles of brothers. This movie is pretty sad, and some people don't understand the end. But the story itself is pretty incredible. The idea that a poor 7-year-old boy (bobby) is being abused by drunk stepfather is terrible, and what the two boys do about it is sad and important. My favorite part of the movie is when Tom Hanks (older Mike) lists the 7 things a child lost to the big world. However, there are a few parts that could be done better in this movie, like the mother's (lorraine braco) wasting, which I think is a horrible actor. "The King" played his role well, as it is a hard part to play. Joseph and Elijah were definitely the stars of the movie. I couldn't believe how well their victims of an abusive stepfather played, because they were old (7 and 9). But overall, I recommend this movie to anyone who loves great kid actors and a good movie. :)
