"My wife and children," is, in my opinion, an absolute ABC classic! I didn't see every episode, but I still enjoyed it. There are many episodes I enjoyed. One of them was where Junior (George O. Gore II) got his driving license. If you want to know why, you should have seen it yourself. Before I upload it, I would like to say that everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong. To conclude, although it can now be seen in syndication, I strongly advise you to catch it only if it goes out of the air.
