I only saw this movie last night, and I have to say I loved every minute. If it's taken in the spirit of a parody of Bond esquire movies, it's really better. The real comedy of the film is in its blatant disregard for political correctness. The misogyny, cultural insensitivity, and almost smiling macho-ism of the films of this genre are used for great comic effects. It also mentions the illogical and formal elements of the task, with Agent OSS 117 learning difficult things quickly (such as Arabic and how to play a traditional instrument) while some are patently obvious clues. Some of the movie lines made me laugh for hours after the movie was finished. And I have to say I learned a few ... interesting ... French vocabulary that my professors probably would be very surprised to be, I was to use. All in all, I thought this movie was excellent. Intense funny and the first movie I've ever seen, parodying all aspects of the spy movie.
