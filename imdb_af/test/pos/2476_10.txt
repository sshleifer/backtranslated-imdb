I looked at the other night. I must say I was very impressed with how real the movie looks. It feels very much like a documentary. I also think the film offered realistic possibilities. In the film, the Vietnam war escalates to the point where China became involved. What if it happened? I think the scenarios will be similar to the one depicted in the movie. We previously had camps in this country ... and still ... <br /> <br /> Highly recommended for everyone ... especially radical ... <br /> <br /> I was in the position that those children were in that I just lay down my ass. I love America and its great wars (wink)
