Some movies just fade away, but Tourist Trap has resisted the test of time and has just become a cult favorite. Although not quite original, it owes much to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, it holds its own with a sense of humor, rights, scary moments, a brilliant score by Pino Donaggio, and the fun shows by Chuck Connors and the cast. Don't let the PG rating keep you away, but this movie shows that no horror and nudity in every horror movie is needed to make it entertaining. These elements are usually used to cover the lack of tension in a film. Here the scares are more deserving and effective. Plus, just Chuck Connors can wear a scene in which he has to share soup with a mannequin! A classic scene indeed. Now more accessible on widescreen DVD, this movie is a must for fans of '70's ​​horror fare.
