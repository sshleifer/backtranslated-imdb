Without a doubt the most impressive recent gay-oriented movie I've seen. C. Jay Cox hit the nail on the head. The way he dealt with the issues of faith, family and sexuality was done very well. Casting was perfect. West Ramsey did a fantastic job of picking up the character of Christians and Steve Sandvoss will turn your socks off in the role of Aaron. Both have rolled out an incredible amount of realism and the impact these issues have on young gay men. As a gay man who grew up in a very religious environment (though not Mormon), the identification with Aaron's character was phenomenal to me. Recommend this movie to everyone, faithful or not, interested in how young gay men go with family and friends in an often unfriendly world. By the way, the music in this movie rock! Another good job by C. Jay Cox.
