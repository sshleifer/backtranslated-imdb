It has one of the more unusual plots I've seen in a horror movie, but it's based on good, solid Universal Studios Prize: Many monsters, beautiful heroines, torch carriers. But my favorite part is Larry Talbot (The Wolf Man) looking for the drug for his lycanthropy. After dying in the original "Wolf Man", he is resurrected and wandering through "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man" and "House of Frankenstein" in search of a way to end his misery. I think first time viewers will find his search in this particular movie very interesting. <br /> <br />
