I didn't read the Anne Rice novel that this movie was based on, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting the KING OF THE DAMNED and is probably better for your health. It is not that this film is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly does the active part of your brain more than this movie. You can count the number of pages by Anne Rice I read on one side, but after seeing this movie and Interview with a Vampire, I get the feeling that she is really writing good novels. The plots for both movies indicate a whole sea of ​​deep and intertwined vampire history. <br /> <br /> Still, Stuart Townsend's narrative storyline gets a little more annoying than Brad Pitt's ever-vampire story. you can say that the queen of the dam's limited production resources barely gives enough meat to the Anne Rice storyline. While Maintenance has decided to go with lace and elegance, QUEEN relies on low budget special effects that are very difficult to take seriously. One can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. The costumes and rock & roll stage could be replaced with more blood and an earlier soundtrack. <br /> <br /> But I'll give credit where credit is due. The soundtrack is excellent. Korn and Disturbed chopped me off with the illness that my noggin like Butthead bobbing. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with a very cool Goth rock zoom and slide fitting, but after the first ten minutes or so, the straight degenerate gets fast. It was as if the film was so long that the director realized that there was not enough time and money to do an Anne Rice novel. What results are some mediocre vampire counts and many casein special effects. Unfortunately, the QUEEN of the DAMNED fails to do the genre justice, just as his John Carpenter counterparts did not impress. Where are the yellow contacts? Where's the light blue make-up? Scene after stage, I shook my head and recalled the days of Salem's Lot and Fright Night when the low budget was done right. <br /> <br /> There are redeeming features, but it saves this movie as garbage. Stand on Aaliyah, and rest her soul in peace forever. She might have become a well-known actress, if her life was not taken away from us so early, because she gave this movie a decent performance with very nice belly dancing. Did I mention that the soundtrack was good? Let's see, what else can I say? It wasn't too long. The Anne Rice novel could easily be a three-hour film as an ambitious director like Francis Ford Coppola got his hands on it. There are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot. But it was all a legitimate rock and add to the sledge of second-class vampire movies out there. The director of this movie has sent a new Battlestar Galactica mini-series if it tells you anything. <br /> <br /> Jimboduck-dot-com
