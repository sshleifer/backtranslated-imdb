I love this show. It is truly unique. I was under the impression that it would have more seasons. In anticipation of Series 2, I recently bought Series 1 to watch it again to refresh when Part 2 started. Having watched it, I was excited and craving more, so I came to the site to see the schedule for the continuation. I'm really disappointed to see there are no plans for a second series as I have eagerly looked to see more of this story. I think they really dropped the ball on this one. There was a lot of story line left over to build and many unanswered questions. I am now a very unhappy view and I hope they will reconsider their decision and pick up the story where it left off.
