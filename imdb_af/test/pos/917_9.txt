There is a spartan, unimaginative edge to this movie that offers plenty of room for us to take part in the action without any stylistic injury telling us HOW we are meant to feel; In 'Blue' everything was openly sad (sure, powerful like hell, but still); In 'White' it was wonderful. But there are no such emotional clues, or clues to that matter, in this one. It is as if he eventually made the power of the story work his own magic without razzle-blinding embelishment. I think that is what makes it the first mysterious of the three, but ultimately the most transcendent and redeeming. Never inexorable, inexorable honesty was so pretty.
