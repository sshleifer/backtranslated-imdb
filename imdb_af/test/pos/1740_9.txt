First of all, I've never recently been in Dr. Who did not come. Honestly, I never got the opportunity to look at any of the previous incarnations, because it was never "big" here in the US, because it is everywhere else. <br /> <br /> That said I must of course say that it's finished after the second season, being one of the best sci-fi shows I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> Now, I watch many Sci-Fi apps from anywhere and this performance stands out. <br /> <br /> The first season was tops to start with Christopher Eccleston in the title role and I thought he was great. Of course, so was the beautiful Billie Piper who adds humanity and warmth to Rose's character that no one could do better. Let's not forget Camile Coduri as Jackie and Noel Clarke as Mickey / Ricky who is just an explosion to watch. Then there's David Tenannt. Initially I thought he was too gawky to play the character (his ears !!), but after watching the 2nd season, he looked good. His sharp acting and physical comedy are almost flawless. He is wonderful with a funny dialogue and can change seriously without hitting an eye. <br /> <br /> Apart from the great acting from the role play, the play is from most guest actors that have appeared. Many of them are veteran actors, but some are new to me and that's good. <br /> <br /> In addition, the production and direction of the show is. Sometimes there and there are some cheesy effects, but it was always a factor in the original series and, like those episodes, is negligible. <br /> <br /> My favorite thing about everything about the series: The Stories. Writing people is always the key to great entertainment. Russell T. Davies wrote many of the episodes with some other writers and they did an excellent job. They managed to bring excitement, ingenuity, intelligence and pleasure with clever concepts and good dialogue. I also appreciate the fact that they can break the older doctors' past story lines and enemies well (my friend explains a lot to me as we look at the show) and respect. <br /> <br /> I won't mention anything about the 2nd season and how it ends since the Sci-Fi channel just started the second season. <br /> <br /> I don't want to spoil it. It's so much fun and excitement. You will never want to take your eyes off or miss a word of dialogue. <br /> <br /> It's really good. <br /> <br /> PS: Thanks back to Nicholas Briggs producers! ** sure! **
