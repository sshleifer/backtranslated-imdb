I watched this show until my puberty, but I still found it to reflect many situations we worry about when we were teenagers, though it was a family-oriented show. Until the mid-90s, it focused more on young adults and their situations. <br /> <br /> So I loved "Step by Step". I mean, it offers situations for every age and, unlike many shows of its kind, it has delivered expectations. <br /> <br /> Let us be honest; It wasn't a very funny show, but it had some situations you could feel but just funny. <br /> <br /> There was a very good charm between Patrick Duffy and Susan Sommers. Duffy rocked! Summer was soft and actually funny. I was in love with Stacy Keegan because she was very sexy (loves her legs) and spiritually. But Sasha Mitchell stole the show with his Cody character. He was the man back in the day! Oh, the memories. Today, this show was not correct on the new generations correctly and therefore it must be kept in the safe of memories. That's it, just memories. <br /> <br /> Thank you Step by step to make my puberty harder.
