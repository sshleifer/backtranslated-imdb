Biodoc on the mysterious singer / songwriter who, according to friends' accounts, spent the past 15 years on a relatively short life mission on self-destruction. He died at 52, overweight and disappeared, from heart disease, to a prolonged rampage of virtually incessant alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and cocaine, racial party and flagrant abuse of his vocal instrument (he trusted a friend he shouting his lyrics on one performance with such a force that splashes blood on the microphone.) All this, despite the fact that: (1) he was widely considered to have perhaps the most talented doll of his ability gender; (2) successful, after years of effort, in terms of occupational prize - a Grammy, an Oscar, a decent record label with a top label and at least two star albums - 'Nilsson Schmilsson' Touch of Schmilsson in the Night '( standards); and (3) very happily married (for the third time), with a beautiful young family that he seemed to worship. <br /> <br /> The strength of the movie begins with the completeness of his account of Nilsson's life, including good use of archive films and many stills by Nilsson; the editors are doing a particularly good job of bringing motion to silence. We learn from his close ties with John Lennon and later, Ringo Starr (Lennon often said that Nilsson was his favorite American musician). Even more impressive are the talking heads, often a documentary worst aspect. Here we get people like Perry Botkin, Jr., Ray Cooper, Mickey Dolenz, Terry Gilliam, Mark Hudson, Eric Idle, Rick Jarrard, Randy Newman, Van Dyke Parks, Jimmy Webb and Robin Williams. very indifferent funny, others deeply pathetic - and everyone carries their deep love for him. Equally informative and moving are interviews with Nilsson's women? Annie and Una, his son, Zach, and cousin Doug Hoefer. Best set of heads I can remember in a biodoc. <br /> <br /> The brilliant shortage of the movie is that it crowded Nilsson's music. Even the performance of his biggest hit, "Without You," is cut short after about 8 bars. Arrrrgh !! There is no excuse for not giving the movie a full two hours as it is. Lose some headers and we could at least hear the song, and maybe one or two more, like "One" or his Oscar victory of "Everybody's Talking." "The filmmakers are simply meant by the plumbing Nilsson's psychological mysticism and not attention to his music. My grades: 7.5 / 10 (low B +) (seen at the NWK's Reel Music series, 07/07/07)
