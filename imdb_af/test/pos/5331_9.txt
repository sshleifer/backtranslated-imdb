Leland Fitzgerald (Ryan Gosling) is sent to jail for the murder of an autistic child. When to press the question "Why?" he didn't have an answer. While in jail, he meets Pearl (Don Cheadle), his teacher, who decides to take matters into his own hands and helps Leland find out why he has done so. During this film, we learn all about Leland's troubled life, including his ex-girlfriend Becky (Jena Malone), his famous father Albert (Kevin Spacey) and his whole sad life. <br /> <br /> This movie is Matthew Ryan High's second movie, and it's hardly in almost every one. It's a movie that finally makes you think, and wonders how it all works. The movie is pretty dark, but if you can handle it, you will realize how good a movie is. <br /> <br /> In this movie there is no bad man. There is no one to blame for anything that happens. There is no stereotyping, and the audience is not trying to make Leland guilty. Instead, we sit back, relax, and watch this boy's life unfold throughout the chorus of the movie. All the problems portrayed in the story are very real. Drug addiction, parenting expectations, overwhelming sadness; they all exist in our world. <br /> <br /> Ryan Gosling presents one of the greatest shows of his career in this movie, like the depressed teenager Leland. His father lives in Europe and doesn't care much about his son. The only person he loves is Becky, but she has problems herself. He knows exactly what he did, but as he says in the movie, "You want a reason, but maybe there isn't one. Maybe it's just something that happened. "There is a reason, but we don't find it to the end. While watching the movie, the audience finds themselves surprised that such a young person can know so much about the world. Leland looks at things that people tend to ignore. <br /> <br /> One of the really thoughtful scenes that really touched me was during one of Leland's conversations with Pearl. Pearl just cheated on his wife and when Leland asks why, Pearl replies that he is only human. Then Leland says something that never really happens to anyone: "Why do people just say when they did something wrong?" <br /> <br /> Another great working job was provided by Chris Klein. In the film he plays Allen Harris, the boyfriend of Becky's sister Julie (Michelle Williams). Although he is not one of the main characters, I was amazed at how deep his character was. You can very much relate to Allen. You know how much he cares about the Pollard family. It is as if they were their own flesh and blood. By the end of the movie you just realize how far he is going to help them. <br /> Overall, this movie is a masterpiece that has been overlooked by quite a few people. However, if you take the time to see it, you'll probably see that everything I mentioned above is true. And once you have watched it, you will never look at the world again. <br /> <br /> 9.5 / 10
