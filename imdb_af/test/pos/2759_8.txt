This game is very good for the n64. You can skate like Tony Hawk, Bob Burnquist, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campell, Eric Koston, Bucky Lasek, Rune Glifberg, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Jamie Thomas, Rodney Mullen, Chad Muska and maybe even more skaters. The game doesn't have Mike V or Bam Margera. Dang! Well anyway, the game is wonderful. The level School II is a good level with so much skating. In career mode, you collect SKATE, get money, get high scores and other different things in 2 minutes. There is a skater, which is pretty cool. I created a skater named Butt Mulligan, a black man with an afro, and a girl board. There is a park editor, some coolly prepared parks, free skate, and there is a single session where you estimate for 2 minutes and get a score. You can watch replays, which are always cool. Each skater has 2 styles: A and B. The graphics are not so good. Well, they're good for a N64 game. I wish I had a controller package so I could save my data. Overall, this game is great. I give it an 8/10 for n64. But with the GBA version, it's just as nice as the N64 version, but a little difficult to control. I give it a 7/10 for GBA. So go out to a place that still sells n64 games and upload a copy. There are also versions for PS1.
