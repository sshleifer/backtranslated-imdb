In this film, the astronauts sent to explore a new discovered planet have to deal with several dilemmas, and they do so intelligently. The film approaches it in a unique way, and it exploits it gradually, although it can be guessed in advance. <br /> <br /> The play is very good, though sometimes stiff, as some late-60s may be acting. . It can also be somewhat verbal and even melodramatic, especially after the plot theme reveals itself. Visually, it has a scene similar to one in the previous year's "2001: A Space Odyssey", and it tends to date the movie. Some of the actors started dying in the 1970's UFO. It's a great champion and worth watching on DVD. <br /> <br /> Despite these small points, the space flight itself is realistic and taken into account. It was 1969, the spacecraft's screens also had a realistic look. (Also check out some 1990's / 2000 video technology in use!) One thing: I suspect a love play has been cut, but I can't prove it! That would be a distraction anyway. <br /> <br /> Unlike most Sci-Fi movies, this movie will make you think about the plot, and it's worth it. I'm happy to have this movie in my video library.
