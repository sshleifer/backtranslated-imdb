Musical bios are all cut from the same cloth. Hopefully, battling, succeeding and eventually getting the girl, but this one - a life of Irish tenor, Chauncey Olcott / Jack Chancellor - goes more than usual steps. It has great charm and great sincerity and is beautifully played by everyone involved. Dennis Morgan is well on the lookout, just like Arlene Dahl as his love interest. Andrea King's supporting performance as Lillian Russell is much better than Alice Faye's premier bio performance in the film dedicated to her career. William Frawley strikes as aging tenor champion William Scanlon and Sara Allgood is beautiful as Olcott's mother. George Tobias, Ben Blue and Alan Hale lend good support. There are over 25 songs (a real treasure chest): Come Down My Evening Star; My Nellie's Blue Eyes; You tell me your dream; Wait till the sun shines, Nellie; Will you love me in December? By the light of the silver moon; Minstrel Days; Polly Wolly Doodle; The Natchez and Robert E. Lee; Miss. Lindy Lou; If I dream; Wee Rose of Killarney; Shake hand; A girl; A piece of paradise; Mary; Sweet Innescarren; Tiddely Um; When the Irish Eyes Smile Mother Machree; The Kerey Fair; Room In My Heart; My Wild Irish Rose. <br /> <br /> Although the movie earned just one Oscar for Scoring - it also deserves earnings for Art Direction and Costume Design - great and lovely in Technicolor. <br /> <br /> Reasons why it is not on video can be due to much of the time spent in the Minstrel Show atmosphere - at least a quarter of the movie - with a large amount of material that is rather politically indifferent to today's audiences. However, it is historically accurate. <br /> <br /> It's a real gem and is worth looking out for. It leaves one with a hot glow.
