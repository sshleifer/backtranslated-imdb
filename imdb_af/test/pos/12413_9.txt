I know that Chill Wills usually played lovely old types in Western. But his role in this segment is something I've remembered long ago. Wills could be a first-class villain. Yes, Burgess Meredith's Fall was correct! It looks like Hepplewhite's eye! It has voiced porcine greed, ignorance, and the threat of violence all at once. Quite a thing, I think. <br /> <br /> The segment itself was also a good one. Question: Can't the little black bag cure alcoholism? I think it's similar to Fall. But the doctor would have been wise to apply Hepplewhite as soon as possible. <br /> <br /> There is one moment that was annoying but also needed. And it seems to be in these night gallery segments. It is Serling's constant need to preach. Because this is what we have, once again, with Dr. Fall. I do not know what was frustrating, losing the black bag and not doing all its miracles. Falling from preaching the bag's benefit to humanity, rubbing Hepplewhite's greedy face in the mud. Therefore, except to beg for Hepplewhite to iron out. But as I said, it was necessary. At least it was for me. Otherwise, we would not have discussed Wills' performance above. Everything done without moving a muscle or talking a word.
