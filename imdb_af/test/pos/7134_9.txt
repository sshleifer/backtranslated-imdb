I'm definitely not a gamer, but a few people in my family and my boyfriend are. So, a little hesitant, I decided to find out what the big problem was with "fantasy things". I saw Dorkness Rising and thought it was HILARIOUS! It's slapstick, but not disrespectful to those who play games. Also, and most importantly, people who have never played before can enjoy it and do not feel left out or lost to understand the plot. The acting was great and the field shots / numbers were credible. It allows me to see other films by this production company. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this group! Three cheers - well done !!
