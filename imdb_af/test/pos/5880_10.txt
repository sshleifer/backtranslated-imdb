I was blown away when I saw "the best years of our lives". The play, script and master William Wyler's direction (winner of best director in 1946) is brilliant. <br /> <br /> This movie is about three second half of the Second World War, which came back from the war and is reunited with their loved ones, but has to deal with the difficulties of getting rid of the war. <br /> <br /> The first man, Al Stephenson (played by Fredric March in his Oscar winner role), comes home to find his wife Millie (played by Myrna Loy) and children Peggy and Rob (played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall were more big and different than before before going to war. <br /> <br /> The second man, Fred Derry (played by Dana Andrews), must find a good job and come home to a woman he was only married for 20 days before he left for the war. He began to find out that she was not the same. <br /> <br /> Homer Parish (played by Harold Russell in his Oscar-winning role) lost his hands in the war and has to deal with his family and fiance 'Wilma's (played by Cathy O'Donnell). what he has instead of his hands. <br /> <br /> All these men and their families are reunited in different screens. The stories of these men are all closely interwoven. <br /> <br /> This movie really defines the meaning of a "Classic". This memorable drama (winner of best picture in 1946) is a movie that everyone should see. <br /> <br /> If I was asked to choose a favorite movie, it would be! <br /> <br /> Out of 10, I'll give you a 10 year best year. <br /> <br /> So next time you go to your local video store, rent this movie, you won't regret it! <br /> <br /> NO offensive material is a good family movie.
