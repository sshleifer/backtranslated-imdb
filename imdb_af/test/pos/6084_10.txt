I won't go to a generalization and say it's the best love story of all time, as some have said. It's good, people feel very deep about this movie, you also like me believing ... or you just hate it. I don't want to say the best of everything because it's just too wide for me to make such a statement. However, I feel very passionate about the English Patient as well as millions of other people doing. <br /> <br /> The awards say it all. <br /> <br /> I disagree with critics, but on many levels, those who chose this one, I couldn't agree. <br /> <br /> 9-Oscars. <br /> <br /> 41 wins. <br /> <br /> 37 other nominations, make this love story on top of the bunch. <br /> <br /> From the director Anthony Minghella, the story-breaking story like Mr. Peterman (from T.V.s Seinfeld) said, "Elaine, I just can't get my eyes out of it!" In this case, I do not agree with Elaine's response. But the story builds and takes the right time, which is needed to make it beautiful. The cinematography, (John Seale) also won several awards, as it should be. I haven't given much attention to Juliette Binoche so far. Well, not quite where I loved her performance in Sabrina. Beautiful story of a somewhat complicated relationship, next to Harrison Ford. But it was just a very different character to her, and as talented as she was, she just shone in her own subtle and graceful way, just what this movie was looking for. I'm really glad it was her show. and not another actress. Ralph Fiennes was also spectacular to portray Count Laszlo De Almasy. I had a new respect for his ability after I saw this one! What can you say except see this photo again. (*****)
