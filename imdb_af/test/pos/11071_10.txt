WOW I love this movie. It's definitely added to my list of Ghetto Movies. <br /> <br /> Juice - Starring Tupac 'I don't give F ***' Menace II Society - O-Dawg 'I'll smoke Anyone, I just don't give F ****' New Jersey Drive - Hey they steal cars in broad daylight, of course they don't f *** <br /> <br /> New Jersey Drive is the best hood movie ever. It's top of the list, threat II, society is second and juice is third. Clockers is really stupid. <br /> <br /> The New Jersey Drive soundtrack is Pwnage at Mac Mall & Young Lay - All about my fat is heard by the movie. <br /> <br /> Lord of the underground - Brand rubber, another good song, and so is Ill & Al Scratch - don't be locked on a player <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of GTA-SA, you will love freaking this movie, AND the amazing soundtrack. The soundtrack is basically Rap about the stealing of cars ^ _ ^ SWEETTTT Movie!
