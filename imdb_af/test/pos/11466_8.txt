The 80's were overrun by all the HALLOWEEN / Friday THE 13th slasher style scary movies, so it's something of a relief. Ten incredibly annoying teens (do you want to hang out with this jerks?!) Decide to throw a Halloween party at a local former funeral home called "Hull House". During a "past life" a devil is accidentally released, and each person is owned and killed by the other. <br /> <br /> All this sounds very EVIL DEAD / DEMONS-ish, but Tenney lends a fitting style to the proceedings, there are some good one-liners, the music is excellent, the Steve Johnson prosthetic makeup FX is scary and Linnea Quigley is quite fun like a boy-crazy bimbo that expresses her eyes with her fingers and a wonderful new thing with a tube of lipstick! <br /> <br /> Great fun on a no-brainer level! After checking the breakdown of the voices and other uploaded reviews, I don't understand how it got just 4 out of 10 (?!) <br /> <br /> I give it, 8 out of 10.
