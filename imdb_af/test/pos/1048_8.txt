This movie reminds me a lot of the later Rock Hudson movie MAN'S FAVORITE SPORT - about a fish writer who has never caught and is forced to enter a fishing tournament. In this case Barbara Stanwyck is a Martha Stewart writer who can't cook and doesn't really have the perfect family she describes in her articles. She actually has no family. Well, like Rock, she is practiced to perform - in this case, a great holiday meal while on the countryside creates holiday. Since there is no family, she takes home a veteran and a few friends and tries desperately not to let go of the cat, because she can't do any of the things she's known about. A cute little comedy and a welcome movie to the annual holiday movie series.
