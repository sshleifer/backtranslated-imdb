There are times I am convinced that Mikado is the best Sullivan and Gilbert opera ever, but it's just as long as I don't listen to Iolanthe. The Mikado is probably the most filmed of the Savoy Opera. (Yes, I put the composer first. No one says Hammerstein and Rodgers, or Hart and Rodgers, or Boito and Verdi, or What's-His-Face and Strauss. You don't even hear the names of librettists for Offenbach, Suppe or Balfe. Gilbert was the bigger name at that time (and the bigger ego), so they made his name first. It's the time that the foolish practice was falling asleep. <br /> <br /> Anyway, the Mikado is a Completes S&G operetta, which has some of Sullivan's catch numbers, combined with Gilbert's smartest lyrics, with an interesting book and speedy dialogue, which has a wonderful amount of madness, and it opens the door to comprehensive and whimsical costumes br /> <br /> This particular production, filmed in a live show in 1990, transforms its imagination into striking simplicity, throwing in a British coastal resort until the end of the Art Nouveau era this about the original jononerie The result is costumes and in an eye-colored medal y from whites, grays and blacks, accredited by occasional red pieces (and less frequent uses of yellow and green). It does get a little used to, but it's really spiffy. Of course, if the choir tells you that they are from Japan, you will be right to cry out, "Oh, pooh. Bah!" (Did I just say that?) It is very pleasant that this fine production is now on DVD. However, there is a reservation: the print appears to be photographed by a glass of imperfect brightness, so the expected sharpness of the image becomes soft and ever so slightly vague. Unfortunately, the tendency to bridge images is annoying. Why do people who are doing a real-life production want it with artificial things of that sort? But this is the performance that counts most. We can overshoot the transfer, since both are executed, Sullivan never wrote one. (Probably, it may be that he didn't write for any of the Savoys. But the Mikado transfer doesn't even come from Sullivan's lifetime and is made up of using the techniques used in the others.) The rest of the operetta is first class and very funny. <br /> <br /> The Ko-Ko here is the treasured Eric Idle, who gives it credit. There is a tradition of putting a big name in the role. It was an American television production years ago in which Ko-Ko was played through mixed results by Groucho Marx. Idle's performance is wonderfully peculiar ... he does "taken from a prison" assisted by a tennis racket. His "I have a small list" is done as a speech on a microphone. Of course, it has the usual updated lyrics, which are much more funny than the usual running of such things, and its delivery is positively hysterical. It goes through all the time. <br /> <br /> In these operetta it is important to have a good Katisha; it is just not fun if you are not brought in style. This Mikado has a fantastic Katisha in Felicity Palmer, in her way almost like a big name as Idle. She blows with the best of them in a wonderfully rich balloon ... great, especially for a soprano. And her costume ... !!! (Not to mention her verdict with Franz Liszt, apparently, accompanying.) Nanki-Poo is played by Bonaventura Bottone. I struggle to get around is a little un-Nanki-Pooish shaky - but voice is undoubtedly a solid, rich addition to the vocal palette. There is a fine touch during a Wandring ring Minstrel, where the choir responds with deviation with the mention of "his nancy on his knee" - remember the Mikado's decision on flirting. If so, Bottone is a good singing actor and if his appearance does not look the best on Nanki-Poo, she does show. <br /> <br /> Yum-Yum (Lesley Garett) and her friends are pretty pretty and stupid. She and Bottone do beautiful duets. Pish-Tush (Mark Richardson) plays his persona as something a blur and does it very well. Poo Bah (Richard Van Allan) is wonderful like a stuffed shirt from the water ... a role later killed in American sitcoms (you know: proud farmers who are forced to meet bratty children - that kind of thing ). The Mikado (Richard Angas) is a wonderful wonderful voice, with a loud voice in absolute deviance with his ridiculous lyrics. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend getting it as your only Mikado. Also get a good traditional production so you can see what Gilbert (more or less) meant in terms of staging. That being said, I will look at this once while looking at a traditional bit. Generally, it's a fantastic offer, vocal and visual joy, with glorious overworking. It's a DVD to treasure, with dervish-like maids, tap-dancing bellhops, and everyone. Look for the bellhops with signs.
