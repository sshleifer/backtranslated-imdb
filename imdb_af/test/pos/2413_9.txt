For once a sequel to "The Karate Kid" without Ralph Macchio! Hilary Swank has done an excellent job for orphan Julie Pierce. Pat Morita, the one Mr. Miyagi plays, his way worked with Julie completely different from Daniel. Both Daniel and July benefited from karate. Unlike Daniel, Julie was the most ardent person Miyagi ever faced. And there was no tournament to compete with. And there will also be humor in this movie. I love the part where Julie comes to school after school, Miyagi looks at her and sees her clothes in the process. It was very funny! And the classic "Wax on, Wax off" scene was also different. It was funny when Miyagi told Julie, "Uh-oh, missed place". The set in Boston was far from California. The Militante group in that group was like the "Cobra Kai" in Boston. And Michael Ironside's spot. Dugan was not John Kreese. His group almost left him when Julie kicked a serious blow. They all paid the price when they inflated the classic Oldsmoblie. What a cowardly act. At least they find salvation from Dugan's poison. This Karate Kid sets a few morals, unlike the last three, that talked about "Honor" and "Respect". Hilary Swank is extremely hot in any movie and everything she does. Movie 9, Hilary Swank 10!
