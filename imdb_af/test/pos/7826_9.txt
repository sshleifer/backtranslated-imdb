It is very easy to find out why The New Professionals were a dud, at least in New Zealand: it not only followed in the footsteps of the original, followed by Bodyguards, who significantly improved the performance with his boss. - two-agent formula. Cmdr McIntyre was the latter George Cowley: tough on his team, but one who would defend against death against others. The shadow of the show was great. <br /> <br /> Well, not as big as it should have been in the UK. Here it was in the network for the first time. It's even promoted in promotions such as: "They are the professionals." Someone else saw the difference clearly. We were fortunate not to release this exhibition in different regions at different time slots. <br /> <br /> These were the high production values ​​that sealed the deal for me. As other reviewers have noted, it followed the great British tradition of one-hour action, but blended into personal elements at the same time. There is a slight undercurrent of something that develops between Liz and Ian, but it never distracted one of the real plot. Most episodes were based on inflammatory diplomatic events, the kind of thing that spooks help from time to time. <br /> <br /> Contrary to many 2000's, the plot was not sacrificed at the expense of fancy pants photos or over style. Directors like Christopher Young acted and did their job. They used good places, which made Bodyguards slicker than when they were shot on back roads and lanes. It was contemporary, it will still stand up beautifully today, and it was one of the better examples of British action in the 1990s. It shows that the UK can do even better than anyone else. <br /> <br /> Maybe except for the Germans and their Cobra 11.
