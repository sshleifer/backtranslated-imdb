I have never seen such a powerful true storyline. I discovered a city, a country, a lost revolution and even a Nobel laureate, thanks to this masterpiece of the theater. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, you can't say you've seen anything. <br /> <br /> A great lesson of courage, humility and life. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen anything so good yet. <br /> <br /> TO 9 JANUARY 1999
