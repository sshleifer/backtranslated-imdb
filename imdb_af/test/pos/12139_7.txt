I agree with all the strengths mentioned in the other reviews, but there are a few sounds that are avoided here, which keep it in the genre of crime drama or film noir and limit it to a big drama beyond the limits of the "elements" that make up. film noir - not to say that the big movie noirs / cannot / not be big plays, but this one is not. <br /> <br /> One other note the music in the movie is being used sparingly, but I would say it is used to emphasize the action more often than the women's elements. <br /> <br /> Great set-up for this movie casually with a sudden kind of non-finite end, it's either just right or a deviation depends. <br /> <br /> Spoilers are following some details. <br /> <br /> The big turn in the story involves the kids who see their mother die, or it should be the big moment. But the children are never shown to respond in any way. Don't cry, and don't ask their dad what happened, the kids are good actors and the father's reactions, I think it's important, but it's a big mistake. This is the heart of the story and the children are mostly kept white in their response. They really have nothing, in the next scene they look as if nothing has happened. <br /> <br /> Similarly, there is a band that forms between Belmondo and Ventura's characters. Belmondo says he knew the murdered partner - but that is never explained and does not affect Belmondo or anyone else. The Belmondo romantic subplot also has credibility, although it has been convincing. Ventura's character does not allow Belmondo for any reason to involve a total stranger in their escape plan. He doesn't even comment or look to see. Another gap. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie, and I won't spoil it, the end happens with a perfunctory voice over the screen telling you what happened. I think it's trying to make it more true, but again like this other missteps leaving drama from the screen. <br /> <br /> What is the point of not dealing with these problems? I don't know, except perhaps the movie's goals are limited to the audience who want it from a crime melodrama - suggest a few deeper elements and continue to ignore them. <br /> <br /> Also Bad There is much to recommend this movie, Ventura is very good, but bad it was a big drama and a crime story - as with IMDb's favorite movie of all time, the GODFATHER . This film had potential. Would make a good remake, but if done in the US, more problems would probably be the movie, but in the hands of the right director it would be a good remake, although it is doubtful, Ventura's performance can cover be. <br /> <br /> Worth to see, but frustrating as a whole
