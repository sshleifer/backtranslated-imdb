Watchers is a fun movie if not taken too seriously. The novel written by Dean R. Koontz is of course much better, but the movie itself is on its own. The movie has a lot of changes to the Watchers novel, the one difference being the main character Travis. In the book he was an adult and a retired Delta Force soldier while in the movie a teenager. Watchers has good points, the movie has some greedy scenes in parts. I am a fan of Micheal Ironside and it was cool to see him in this movie, he always does a good performance in all his films. The OXCOM costume looks cute, but the camera never shows the creature fully until the end of the movie. The dog Einstien was impressive as it was well trained. <br /> <br /> The film sees two genetic experiments escaping from a laboratory, a dog and a monster. Both experiments are linked telepathically, since the two animals are part of a military project where the dog would infiltrate an enemy base, then Creation would attack and eliminate them. The dog finds a teenager named Travis who takes him home and discovers that he is intelligent and therefore he calls the dog Einstein. Meanwhile, the OXCOM is running around to kill people and swallow their eyes. Two government agents are sent to find the two experiments before this time. incident comes out of hand. Soon Travis learns that she is not safe when the OXCOM is drawn on the dog and he will stop killing him and anyone like that. Travis and his mother then rescue his girlfriend kept by the two agents at the hospital. They are hiding in the woods, while government agents and the OXCOM are not far behind. <br /> <br /> Watchers is not a major adaptation of Dean R. Koontz's novel, but it is a surprise of 80's horrorflick, some fans of The Book may not want to watch, as it is not true The book is not, but fans of Cheesy 80's horror movies may want to see it.
