After a decade of turbulent turmoil, American movies began converting gears and turning their cameras away from war-torn battlefields, political corruption, and general social discomfort into the more intimate world of family function. The toll of selfish Baby Boomers began to take on the American family as they grew up and had their own children. They felt. <br /> <br /> "Kramer vs Kramer" is one of the first of these dysfunctional family dramas that would remain so popular in the 1980s, and this is one of the best. It's getting a little rap now, as it is known as the "Apocalypse Now" movie for the Best Picture Oscar Award for 1979, but comparing these two movies is comparing a banana to a marinated chicken breast: they are not far from the same, but can we not enjoy both of them? Director / writer Robert Benton is not trying anything with his film; His strength lies in his performances, those of Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep, especially, with a divorced couple who are childish and selfish about their son. The courtroom scene in which they arrested it, in which everyone is forced to hurt the others in terrible ways, is devastating and feels authentic. The film does not offer Hoffman's solid father as a hero, or Streep's apostate mother as a villain. They are not good or bad like people - they are just bad to be married. <br /> <br /> The film is scary in the final, but not in a manipulative way. It deserves its right to evoke sobs. <br /> <br /> Degree: A
