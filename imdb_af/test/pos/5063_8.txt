Naughty, topical political excitement, with the square objectives of the controversial US policy of extradition, another terrible Orwell-ian phrase (collateral damage, anyone?) For the illegal interrogation, even torture of terrorist suspects going through the legal process. The inhumane interrogation is supervised by the Egyptian Police Chief, himself the target of a fundamentalist suicide bomb design, capturing the two main plot lines of the movie. Both work very well, the bombing series that is graphic and cold in its realism, with its untangling in a stylish Tarantino-type flashback, and the torture scenes on an innocent man, are also undeniably portrayed in all their greedy details. The film scores points to the use of torture as a credible way of intelligence - gathered in the war against terrorists and against the unpolised faceless bureaucracy (embodied here by a suitable cold steel Meryl Streep, as the CIA boss who incidentally commands give for show) that can destroy innocent lives. Remember Kafka's fiction, think more about the recent murder of the innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, with the head of the Metropolitan police still in his job and no one tried to do the poor man's murder. The play is excellent throughout - the two key roles of the innocent man and terrorist bomber are played realistically and nicely by the unknown actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. Similarly, Yigal Naor is the intimidating chief of police and Zineb Ouhach as his idealistic darling daughter with their actions, their lack of familiarity (at least for me) is the credibility of their characters. Of the larger Hollywood names that are present, Gyllenhaal's stature grows with subsequent films, here the initially detached but later conscience-stricken and agitated government man is finally doing the right thing. Witherspoon plays her disturbed wife mainly in one key, but believes everything the same, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin convincingly see self-sufficient senators and their brothers go as far as helping you to their career prospects. There are some weaknesses suddenly; There is little dramatic need to create the "tension" around El-Ibrahimi's escape and Streep's character may be too obvious a bogey man / woman. The worst of all is the meaningless inclusion of Gyllenhaal's girlfriend, just for decoration and a short, free love scene. Overall, an impressive imaginary film experience.
