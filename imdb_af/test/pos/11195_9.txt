Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant (Uzak) - his third film (the first was 1997's black and white The Small Town-Kasaba), is an important step of his good but erroneous 1999 movie clouds of May (Mayis Sikintisi ). The previous film had potential but looked at the smallest budget and improvised quality in the worst ways - holes and woods made by amateurs. That cloud of May passed at any level was evidence of Ceylan's talent as a budding movie maker. Distant is Ceylan's arrival on the international scene as a great artist, one that has many similar characteristics to other major filmmakers such as Ingmar Bergman (although his screenplay is not as dialogue-heavy, it is just as brilliant, and he has Bergman Lack of love for close-ups - his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose intrusive scenes of contemplation Ceylan reconfigure). The bulk of the film takes place in the snow-hibernal Istanbul (the fact that it is snowing in Turkey will probably surprise some), giving the film a definite Bergmanic feel, as well as the memory of one of the dark snowy plains of Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Decalogue. The natural images evoke the best of Werner Herzog, as they tend to go or dictate two longer than the standard film theory. This makes them even more memorable, while the urban provinces range from the almost Precisionist compositions of Michelangelo Antonioni to the cultural hagiography of Woody Allen - one shot of a water-looking bank, a direct quote (read stealing) from Manhattan , except for the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan also puts on a well-known shot of a ship in the port of Ozu's Tokyo Story. Yet, like all great artists, Ceylan makes his own art by slightly changing and adapting to the needs of his own film. Distant is a film whose title relieves the characterization within the film, and the feeling some viewers will have, but it doesn't describe the movie itself, because scenes remain one long after the movie ends. Perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the movie is when Mahmut steals his ex-wife at Istanbul Airport and watches her go with her new husband while taking the plane on board, which will forever remove her from his life. Seeing her, we see her from afar, just a glimpse of him who sees her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this movie. He pulled back behind a column, and Nazan turned her head back to her future. Mahmut is her past, and she knows how to move best. Just keep moving. Mahmut will never find it. Most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life. That some viewers will get the film, and that Ceylan gets his own creative ability, shows that ignorance can be taught as long as it moves. Do the distance, even if it's just the right length.
