... "Inglorious" if our local theater decided to show its title on their market, minus the second word. It's a great cinema. <br /> <br /> I don't hesitate to recommend this movie, except the exuberant. Never let them know what they are missing. <br /> <br /> I cried to give it ten stars because of my experience of Tarantino's previous films. Anyway, except for Reservoir Dogs, they improved with extra look. <br /> <br /> Although I gave it ten stars, I did so reluctantly. It doesn't leave me an "up" to check. <br /> <br /> Yes Christoph Waltz is the Nazi that we all supposed to be the worst. He is cultivated, sophisticated, suave and most sadistic, the kind of man who can threaten a glass of milk and who suddenly sticks out his cigarette into a strudel, grinds it into the whipped cream as if he were in a victim. <br /> <br /> To understand Tarantino's movies, you only need a sense of dialogue, color and pacing. The colors are as bright as needed and when needed, brighter. In the French farmhouse of the opening scene, they are muted and dark, but excessive. Outside is a brilliant sun shine, but in one room of the house everything is shaded and black bathed. <br /> <br /> This is a brilliant setting for an interrogation by Waltz, as The SS Hunter Hunter Hunter, who rages his host French farmer over the expanse, reveals what he cannot reveal numerous times , then retreat with pursuing friendships and understanding. <br /> <br /> A second sadistic German, well played by August Diehl, functions later as a major actor in the final plot turn. Diehl's Nazi Major, who has an ear for German accents, is almost as good as Waltz ... Almost. <br /> <br /> Film classes will study much of this movie. They should look lovingly at the beautiful pacing. Tarantino knows just how long to draw a scene, discovering Hitchcock's way, then at just the breakpoint, suddenly comes to a decision. <br /> <br /> For color, look for a final shot at a French Theater, where his secret Jewish owner surprises the top Nazi leadership. <br /> <br /> We see her, played by Melanie Laurent, in anticipation of the hated German dignists who will come for a film preview of the latest Deutsch movie masterpiece, a propaganda piece about a German hero and his dubious achievements. <br /> <br /> Laurent was erected on a balcony, reflected in the glass mirrors of the beautiful theater, her red lips and low cut dress reflecting the intensity of her designs everywhere on her guests. It's a single shot that will be a whole movie. <br /> <br /> There are fortunately many more such images, much more tempo scenes of beautiful dialogue and tension. In short, see it. I'm sure you'll see it again and again.
