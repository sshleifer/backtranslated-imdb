This movie is such a good example of the greatness that is 80's entertainment. Oh, don't get me wrong, most of the music was sucked. I just looked the metal bands from the 80's. Tires that had a few balls. Forget that whiny keyboard crap and all that 'life is terrible and I want to kill' rubbish '. But the 80's movies are the best. They had everything about nonsense and just a good time. This movie illustrates it! Party! Get naked! Sleep with someone! WOOOOOOHOOOOO!
