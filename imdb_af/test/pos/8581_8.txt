I've seen this movie twice and am very impressed with it. <br /> <br /> The talks between Nimi and her mother plus Nimi and Matthew are very touching. The Nigerian community is shown very truthfully and as colorful as usual. <br /> <br /> Although some things could have been done with a little more explanation, knowing why Matthew was in the first place in southern France, the screens Matthew found in his car would be more understandable be. <br /> <br /> Fortunately, Optimum Releasing has a website with detailed production notes that help to understand such scenes better. <br /> <br /> I'll see it again, but unfortunately it had a limited release in London and it's no longer available to watch. I hope the video release will make it a bigger audience, because the movie deserves it.
