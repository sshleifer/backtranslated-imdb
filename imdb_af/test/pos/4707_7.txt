I'll give this movie a good strong 7. Although definitely not the greatest movie, or even one, is the best movie of its kind (The Killing Fields better), try it at least an essential story. <Br /> <br /> I think the method of launching Laura in Burma was a bit confronted. First, Burma is not the easiest country to visit, especially in the late 80's. Secondly, if you made it in Burma, your passport will not be lost. A healthy person would make them know where their passport was at all times. With that in mind, I'm sure the writer knew it was bad, but needed something. Patricia Arquette's performance was underestimated, and I just didn't buy his doctor. But at least she didn't dominate the role, which often happens in movies like this. You Aung Ko was good, but also underestimated. The end is difficult to follow as most of the dialogue is in Burmese, with people translating for Laura. It would have been difficult for Laura, and it is also difficult for the viewer. Another plus is the strong SE Asian landscape in the movie, which was nice to watch.
