Tromeo and Juliet may be the best Shakespeare modernization I've ever seen, not much competition, but anyway ... <br /> <br /> All in all, Tromeo and Juliet are definitely one of Troma's 's better movies, one of the little pearls hidden in a barren hop. It is a funny, action-packed, gory action on the world's greatest love story, but still manages the original story as faithfully as it can, except for this kind of movie. Well, except for the end, where Tromeo and Juliet murdered Juliet's abused father and together with their suddenly mutated children live together in a sunny suburban area in a sunny suburban area. <br /> <br /> This is the movie high school literature class should show instead of making poor students read by hundreds and hundreds of pages of Shakespeare's scripts. Thumbs up!
