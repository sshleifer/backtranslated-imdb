This movie is actually one of my favorites. I'm not a Renny Harlin fan, because most of his movies suck, but TLKG hits his point. TLKG is about a woman named Samantha Cain (Davis) who suffers from amnesia. she is married to a child and, as she says, "I am a damn member of the PTA." and then her world comes down as the pieces fall into place over her earlier identity. Samuel Jackson plays an artist-cop who does PI-gigs, he is dragged by her to solve her identity and pay cash for his work. along the way we find out that Samantha really is Charlie Baltimore, a secret spy left dead for death. The plot is great, it really makes this story and Jackson does a good job as a second violin for Davis (who always does a great job). The explosions are endless, the action is intertwined with an unforgettable scene after a memorable scene. beautiful, impressively visual although the child has climbed to my nerves at the end (watch out for the cars!) I'm tired of small children making a movie to be saved, but still this movie is worth seeing add child to the movie. Again, this movie is really good, I never understood why it didn't make it to the box side, but if it was a man in the movie, it would be worth a hundred million. What's good is that over the years more people are discovering this movie and giving it good marks, as the average of this movie on this site has risen over the years. I hope this will continue as it is one big action movie. and i love action movies
