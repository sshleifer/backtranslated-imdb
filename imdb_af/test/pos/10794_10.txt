"Talk Radio" is my favorite Oliver Stone movie, but he made a lot of things, including "Salvador", "JFK", "Natural Born Killers" and "Platoon". But I like the intimacy of Talk Radio, a film extension of Eric Bogosian's searing play based on a real life account of a Dallas talk program. With the work of the movie, Robert Richardson, Stone who could be a very firm exercise turns into a visual arrest of ideological struggles that provide a radio station as an arena of war. Bogosse is devastating as tortured on the air sprayer of abuse Barry Champlain and carries the excess, destructive nature of his character with conviction and ample dose of self-rejection. Alec Baldwin, as his alpha-male boss, hits the perfect note as a man driven by a man whose monstrousness he helped to nurture. Ellen Greene is fantastic as Barry's lovely ex-wife eventually becomes another target of his evil personal vitriol. Stone and bogs fill every frame with interest and every line of dialogue with sweet poison and cut ambiguity. John C. McGinley, like Barry's long-lasting screener / technical producer Stu, turns into a hilarious, sharp show, just like the big Michael Wincott. The film is a flawless, understated masterpiece of beautiful writing, wonderful acting and brutal, uncompromising direction. The Stewart Copeland score is also brilliant.
