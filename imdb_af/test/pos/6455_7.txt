This gangster movie is evident at the first gangster movies that Warner made the same year, Little Caesar (1931) and The Public Enemy (1931). This is one of the better efforts I've seen. Although not quite in the same league as the previous classic, it has a powerful performance by young Sylvia Sidney. She is wonderful and delivers her lines more naturally than at any time. Gary Cooper is better than usual at this stage in his career and shows signs of what will follow in the next few years. The film has some fascinating villains in Paul Lukas (he never saw him abhorrent) and Guy Kibbee (who was shocked to see him). The direction of Rouben Mamoulian is very inventive, probably the first voice to show a person thoughts appear in this movie. If you get the chance to see this little gangster movie, don't let the chance go.
