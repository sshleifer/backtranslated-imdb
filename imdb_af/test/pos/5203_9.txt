This movie shocked me. It was so realistic and the story was incredibly touching. They speak German and Russian, which makes it more credible and real. This is a must-see movie. The actors are also good. Really a good piece of work. The plot takes place in a German troop in World War II. They must go to Stalingrad, Soviet, to fight against the Soviet armies. You are more connected to each soldier in this group and follow them through all the dangers as they are captured within Stalingrad. They get face-to-face meetings with the death, blood, sadness and the cold of Russia. It's a must-see movie, and you can't afford to see it.
