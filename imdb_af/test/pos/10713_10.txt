Just as Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman) gets a break in his professional life, his frustrated wife, Joanna (Meryl Streep), is finally courageous to leave him, and Ted must take care of their five-year-old son, Justin Henry. Being a single parent seems to be Ted, and he has professional suffering, but also learns that there is much more to life than a career, as he is still related to his own son and really knows. But then Joanna returns and intends to get her son back, leading to a cruel law hearing. <br /> <br /> Kramer vs Kramer is a wonderfully well-written and wonderfully maintained human drama that only affects the coldest sadness a viewer. Hoffman's growing relationship with his son is so well portrayed, and the movie never takes an easy approach. It always feels very real and thanks to the film's low-key approach, it makes even more impact and can easily work on multiple views. The dramatic impact of the movie does not diminish. <br /> <br /> Easily recommended; 10 out of 10.
