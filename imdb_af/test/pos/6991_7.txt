Although this movie starts with the usual: something goes wrong, spacecraft crashes, people are stranded etc. It is still pulling off and proposing new ideas to the viewer. Riddick is somewhat of a bad-ass conviction and has shown his eyes so that he can see in the dark, which is a sought-after ability due to the shipping company's situation. The cut in the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystique surrounding the anti-hero and male protagonist: "Riddick." The story in Pitch Black, as already mentioned, is, to some extent, very original and dissatisfied, but the cutting and cutting in the film with some surprising elements added to the story helps to support him very well and one is left behind with a hybrid sense of satisfaction and hunger for more. Vin Diesel performs very well in Riddick's role and although his character is a hard, difficult survivor, he still takes moral decisions almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean that his decisions are not at his expense. ... Why destroy an already perfect reputation? All in all, it's a very good movie, but not perfect. The story looks very unobtrusive on the surface, but under it shines with enough originality to entertain. Some scenes have the wow factor while being overall better than average. It may be described as a cult film and it is definitely a recommendation for people who want a spicy scientific story mixed with a few small psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, Riddick.
