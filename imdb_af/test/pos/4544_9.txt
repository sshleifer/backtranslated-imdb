This movie is probably not the funniest thing I have ever seen, and it certainly does not have much depreciation. In fact, it's really nothing more than a collection of vignettes tied to a loose plot. But this "make-as-i-go-along" attitude actually works to the advantage of the movie. "Tommy Boy" succeeded as a comedy for the same reasons that the SNL sketched Farley and Spade successfully. Their well-married constant silliness and mayhem makes them humorous despite their immaturity.
