I like full house and step by step the same. I don't have a favorite episode, I just love some scenes. but a few scenes I didn't like, but I had to say the reason I started watching this show was because it had Suzanne Summers in it. and my favorite character was Dana. and Karen can sometimes be a snob, but she was also good character. I just love family shows instead of trash that has a lot of drugs and violence. This show is much like other family shows, where one of the parents is always strict about curfews and dates. except step by step, my other favorite shows are full house, Sabrina the teenage witch, eraser arrows usmc, the andy griffith show and dukes of hazzard.
