A £ 3.50 DVD can be a gambling and it was one that kind of paid. <br /> <br /> A decent Saturday night-type movie that is entertaining as you shine on the obvious plot errors. Special effects are a little and far between with a few repetitions (and why does London always look like it's in the 60's?) <br /> <br /> If it's budget, says Armageddon, I'm sure it would have been better at the Box Office, because the story is pretty good. <br /> <br /> Overall, Tycus is being sent to B movie history, but if you see it for £ 3.50, it's worth buying.
