It's one of those movies when you watch it, you're wondering if it's documentary or fiction. After the movie Ramin Bahrani answered many questions and we learned that the movie has a script. <br /> <br /> Bahrani's camera is silent, he is not judgmental, he moves the movie directly from the film, the background is not organized to make the pictures beautiful, but do not make me wrong; There is a lot of preparation for this movie. Start at personal level, the part of the environment, which is ignored when you film. <br /> <br /> The main character is a 'real' actor in every respect. <br /> <br /> I'd like to thank all the crew for this movie, showing us another country in NYC. I strongly suggest you want stories from others. <br /> <br /> Bora Kizilirmak
