Of course, in a movie whose main themes of death, nostalgia and loss of innocence, it is perhaps not surprising that it is considered more by older viewers than younger ones. However, there is a craftsmanship and completeness to the movie anyone can enjoy. The pace is steady and constant, the characters full and enticing, the relationships and interactions that naturally show that you don't need tears of flood to show emotion, screaming to show fear, shouting to show dispute or violence to show anger . Of course, Joyce's short story makes the movie a ready-made structure as perfect as a polished diamond, but the little changes Huston makes as the inclusion of the poem fits neatly into. It is truly a masterpiece of tact, subtle and overwhelming beauty.
