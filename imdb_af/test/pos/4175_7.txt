The Monkeys are surprisingly a great favorite of mine. Yes, they may have been the original rock band; a gym that surpassed the 21st century. But their music stops as much as the best that the 1960s had to offer. Last Train to Clarksville, Daydream Believer, I'm a Believer, (I'm not) Your Stepping Stone, Valleri and Pleasant Valley Sunday are great songs, written by good songwriters like Boyce / Hart, Neil Diamond, Goffen / King and John Stewart . While they were not good musicians or songwriters, they had a pleasant screen presence and lots of appeal and some of their own stuff was really decent. Their TV show is dated in 2007, but I still watch the show on occasion as a time capsule in life in 1966-1968; that magical and dangerous time in the history of the USA. <br /> <br /> But as we all know, as an object of things like Kelly Clarkson, The Monkees didn't want to be regarded as manufactured and just dolls for their recording company. Despite their average talents, they wanted to write their own songs, make their own albums and call the shots when it was touring. Unfortunately, it was a disaster; especially when Peter Tork's choice of Jimi Hendrix was launched as an opening action because of his stealing of the show and heavy sexual suggestions in his music compared to the Monkees G-rated content. <br /> <br /> The final nail In the coffin for the Monkeys (until 1986) was the notorious movie cup. Head was written by Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson while allegedly high on Mary-Jane. The film received poor reviews and made only $ 16,000 in cash. Today, the film is a cult classic, ahead of its time and a message of what was in 1968 the soul of the youth. <br /> <br /> The head really has no plot. Basically, one or four of The Monkees are from stage to stage without any rhyme or reason. They go to dinner in a dinner, to see that Davy Jones is based on Sonny Liston, after a Western, to be sucked into a vacuum, to go to a concert and so on. The film basically offers oblique views of what was wrong with American society. The Monkees bash commercialism, the Vietnam war, US policy, censorship, settlement and greed. You have to read between the lines to see what the targets of shelter were. <br /> <br /> The Monkees spend a lot of time at certain crosses of the movie and symbolize how they feel their record company saw them; as nothing but toys for them to play with when it came time to record another hit album. A scene where they are 16-4 in the Western scene can be a symbol of them against the session musicians, songwriters, record producers and who did not control their careers and the cannon they fire on them is their way to say, "Start!" . <br /> <br /> The movie is truly a psychedelic journey to watch. The flashy tie colors, the hypnotic concert and the belly dance screens and the dreary imagery are everywhere. The acting is really good, but it's biased because I like the The Monkees TV show. A small soundtrack contains "The Porpoise Song" and three songs written by The Monkees themselves. <br /> <br /> The movie actually has hilarious scenes. although they might not be. Mickey Dolenz hit a Coke Machine that didn't give him a soda, or his violent punch-ups in the boxing scene (I mean, he was a angry man who probably didn't weigh more than 135) laughed. /> All in all, this movie is an absolute must-see for any Monkees fan. I think many people will feel this movie is indeed "over their head", but for those who are obsessed with the 60's and society at the moment, it will find a wonderful time capsule.
