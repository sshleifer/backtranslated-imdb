I didn't expect much because of the difficult reviews, and so I enjoyed the movie a lot. Smaller colors and less beautiful compositions of shots than some of his previous films, I think, allowed the story to focus. Although the religious conflict in a vampire movie was commonplace, I felt that many of the other things were not. For example: <br /> <br /> how his powers were often revealed through interaction with her. <br /> <br /> The very strong and well-activated love shows. <br /> <br /> The symbolism of The man who killed them to get closer to each other, actually separates them even more. <br /> <br /> They are strong differences in what it means to be "vampire" created by their past life experiences. <br /> <br /> The lack of scores of other vampires that appear or created by the movie. <br /> <br /> I've heard several things and read about 'tricks used in other movies'. Of course. However, I feel that tricks are being used to emphasize what is happening in the scene and I feel he is doing it well. I don't need a director to use new tricks. I prefer the tricks used, well and appropriately used, which I feel is the case with this movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend it.
