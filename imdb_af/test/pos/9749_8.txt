My friend gives me these 3 big boxes. "They are laser chips of Flash Gordon series," he says. "I'm going to have some giant kiss players," I say. But not so. This serial rocks. (But I almost had to wake everyone up and I got a laser disc player for them.) <br /> <br /> There is really a bit of everything in this series: there are lion men, hawk men , shark men, Earthmen, and I think you want to call Mongo men. The sets and costumes combine, Greek, Roman, Oriental, Egyptian and even weapons such as English knights. Awesome costumes. And some of them were a riot. This terrible panty with shorts over em worn by Zarkov is out of description. And the guys in the oven scene seem to be wearing boxes. <br /> <br /> It's also funny how they rename the octopus to an octosack, the orangutan to orangapoid, and the tiger to a tigron. There is even a dragon (a Godzilla-like creature that threatens Flash several times before it dies). <br /> <br /> You like the invisible man? It covered you. You like sword fighting, wrestling (both animals and men), fist battles? Great for any taste. We have an underwater city, an air city, a city on the mountain, and tons of secret passages and caves. <br /> <br /> Hokey Effects? Massive amounts. The aerial city is supported by radium furnaces fired as take-over steamshots. The rockets are powered by fireworks and have constant backfires and / or humming sounds. Many threads are visible to stop things (such as food when Flash was invisible and of course rockets). There are clouds in space, but no one around the earth when seen from Mongo. "Giant" lizards appear briefly. Fighting sea species threatens to threaten Flash & co. heading to the shark men's underwater city. The "gadgets" in Dr. Zarkov's laboratory broke me. And it seems they are the same, no matter which laboratory he is (he worked in Ming's lab and Vultan's.) And yes, we have romance. Everyone wants Dale; Ming, Vultan, Flash. But at least one person wanted Princess Aura (Prince Baron) not only the person she would have preferred. In fact, many of the sub-plots of Princess Aura's intrigue seem to win Flash. <br /> <br /> Man, I think the characters are great. The thick, horse-smiling King Vultan was hilarious. How he managed those wings was pure works of art. And Ming! What can I say about Ming? He was perfect. They had had him for the emperor in Starwars. Ming must be my favorite character in this series. Princess Aura was quite a small character. And she pulled it off beautifully. I think she's a better actress than Dale Arden by a long shot. Even the sneaky high priest had a special role. Zarkov was good, but not the strongest character --- and he always stood in the background during fights with Dale. Now we get Flash: Flash, of course, was the strong point, the leader, the hero --- and he did it well. Crabbe is a good actor and this role fits him perfectly. <br /> <br /> After looking at it, I think I know where George Lucas got the main idea for Starwars. Look at this, you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> If you have ever considered looking at an old series (or any series for that matter), it should be your first choice. The only reason I did not give this one a 10 is because of some easy-to-fix storefront, as the giant lizards just threw in there and some bad characters (king of shark men & king of lion men).
