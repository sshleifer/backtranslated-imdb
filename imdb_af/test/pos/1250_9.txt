Really a great movie. Bruce Willis gives his always outstanding comic-romantic acting power to this message movie and the movie brings hope to the losers, many of us know we are. A gift to all of the middle-aged whose spending time seems full and empty: there is more to the next and it can be wonderful, enriching and romantic. Leave the recent past and return to the lessons of the distant past, and then take a favorite flight to your better future. If we could relive our youthful experiences, could we really remember the events we formed, would we not find a special kind of freedom? See the movie, open the gift.
