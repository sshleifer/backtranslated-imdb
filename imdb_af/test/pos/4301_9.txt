It was one of the worst Columbo episodes I saw. But I'm only in the second season. <br /> <br /> The typical Columbo activities are both amusing and annoying. His cigar box, making him difficult, has been seen before. And the little bit he always identifies with the killer somehow - in this case, Tho is the scene on the TV cooking program derived from the main theme. <br /> <br /> Also not explained why the brother was part of the mixer wires at the beginning of the show. The reason for this was never explained, nor served any purpose. But the part I didn't have the most was the death of the bride to be. It has never been explained and this is the main reason why I give this episode such a low grade.
