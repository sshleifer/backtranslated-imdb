Many say without words. <br /> <br /> It's a great movie. It is made in color-non-color as in today's films, but uses a special mono-color (with shadow) that depicts meaning, mood, sense and time. It should be seen in color, as it becomes a completely different movie. The story, by Nobel laureate Selma Lagerl√∂f, is presented effectively. One never has a clear sense of true, memory or phantom. Changes in Swedish society are subtly low. Most recommended. Try to rent it or find it online. I saw it in a Swedish movie class and I want to add it to my movie library.
