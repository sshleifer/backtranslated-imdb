When I entered the theater, I thought it would be a good movie. And I wasn't a little disappointed. WOW! This movie is brilliant! The emotions felt throughout the movie are extraordinary! Great play by Madhavan and Simran. Beautiful music by A.R. Rahman. This is probably the best Tamil movie I have already seen. Mani Ratnam has once again shown that he is best at making meaningful and sad films. <br /> <br /> This movie is basically about a young girl (PS Keerthana) looking for her biological mother (Nandita Das) who left her in a refugee camp to fight for her country, just like her husband (JD Chakravathy). A young novelist (Madhavan) finds out about this young girl's story and decides to write a story about her. He and his wife (Simran) decide to take this young child, but one day they find that they are not her real parents and decide to look for her biological mother. <br /> <br /> This movie really shouts excellently. The way Mani Ratnam presented the film is wonderful. <br /> <br /> My Rating - 10/10
