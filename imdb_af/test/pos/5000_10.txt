And what is his genre? The wallpaper hides story; what theater life really is behind those Broadway (and other) curtains. It certainly has a lot of competition: Singin 'in the Rain, both I and II (1929 and 1952), 42nd Street, Golddiggers of (You call that year.); Ladies of 1934; Far from Noises Off (1992) and A Star were born II and II from the 1930s and the 1950s from the tragic side: not to mention the summer supply of 1950: the list stays together. So what makes this movie so special? And why is there so little comment on this great movie? Did so few people actually see it? How wonderful to see a younger Frank Langella pre-Dracula and pre-Frost-Nixon at 30 years! How wonderful to see the fresh and talented Tom Hulce in front of Amadeus! And another great quieter! What a wonderful combination of talented people at their best from so long ago! And such a script! Who was this David Shaber? So full of realistic disillusionment and pathos compared to the usual sentimentality and feel-good comedy! For example, the Star-Is-Born episode where the heroine gets Broadway, while the Langella character has to satisfy him with another provincial tour. <br /> <br /> Langella's later hysterical and sadistic blow up against the star-Latin teacher and his granddaughter, raising his anger and frustration, is just one of many fantastic and psychologically real moments in the film. (The Latin teacher and his love affair with the back life certainly echo Marlene Dietrich and her seductive professor in the Blue Angel of 1929.) Another in the series of mercenaries and cold agents such as Kevin McCarthy, preceded by Burt Lancaster in The Sweet Smell of Success (1957) and passed by Alan Alda in Clubland (2001) in film history. The sexual liberation of the Hulce character is reminiscent of similar incidents in O'Neill's great comedy Ah, Wilderness. <br /> <br /> And a tribute to the disappeared operetta long ago: The Red Mill or Victor Herbert; Rose Marie and the Vagabond King of Rudolf Friml; Sigmund Romberg's Desert Song, etc. Some satirical inserts of bits from the big plays like Romeo and Juliet. Tribute to the theater itself as outlined by the star Langella. The wealth and depth of this movie is simply endless. And anointing such a title! Who can have an idea of ​​what this wonderful movie is about such a ridiculous and unforeseen title? But on the other hand, what title can one apply to such a wonderful drama that could have been its moving emotional content? <br /> <br /> PS: I just saw (2009) Frank Langella in his latest acting spectacular: like Richard Nixon in Frost-Nixon. How this great actor, after 30 years, simply goes to victory to win!
