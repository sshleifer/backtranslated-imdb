Like most other reviewers, I really enjoyed this TV miniseries. I didn't see it when it first came out, but my grandfather - a huge fan of mysteries and war movies - recorded it in 1989. I remember it one night at my grandparents' cabin and I was completely drawn in the story! It has a very interesting plot and a good mix of drama, romance and spying. I saw many movies set during World War II, but no one with such a twist! Fortunately, I could make a VHS copy of the movie a few years ago. I've been watching it a few times and still enjoy it. I would like this movie to be released on DVD. It will be so much easier to see chapters.
