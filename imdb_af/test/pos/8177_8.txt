This movie is excellent (I watched the French version). There are many subplots (which usually detract from the whole), but they exploit and agree well with "discovering one's true self" main theme. In fact, the whole movie (except its background) is the journey to discovering someone's (or someone else's) self. Is the King really a "good peacenik monarch" trying to make a "war to end all wars" or is he just a disturbed, bloodthirsty hoodle? Is he a real king? Is the Queen Mother's servant merely a fun, career-driven, spineless sock doll or rather a sharp thinking, brave individual? Will the woman / wife know who the king really is? What is between the king and the old chancellor? What is the secret know everyone but will not tell? What is the real reason why the killer stops his "work"? Subplots (something I don't really love) are handled well and keep one to the end. Scenes are well-crafted and CGI fits in well, without going overboard. Suspension is properly maintained and actors are tasked with. There are many brain-damaged smiles, but this is how one should be borne by the king's court (as the woman / concubine complains). Realistic movie without superhero moments. This Chinese film really shuts up Hollywood cardboard colossal (Gladiator etc).
