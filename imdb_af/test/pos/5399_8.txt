Imaginary Heroes, the remarkable work of the then 24-year-old Dan Harris, is on the label "People are never who they seem to be". Maybe it's wisely chosen as a stratagem of marketing; Yet I rented this movie, despite the tagline, rather than it. And I'm glad I did. I found the move an insightful investigation of the tragedy. I personally found this to be a movie about dealing with dreams: especially those that are lost. In the case of one boy, "loss" requires a deep examination of what he had and did not have in his life. Yet, the central tragedy of the film, while setting disappointing questions in its own right, is basically the backdrop to different handling styles. I believe the film explores an important question: how do we handle our dreams, especially when heroes are imagined?
