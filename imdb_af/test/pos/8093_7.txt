Most of these films are an alternately hilarious and brutal satire on Nazism and Fascism, which has been informed of the success of the movements. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, in the last moments of the film, Chaplin abandons all the intention of art (not to mention comedy) and completely switches to propaganda. And not anti-Nazi propaganda, but some of the most beautiful and idiotic "progressive" propaganda ever to come out of Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Remember, nothing we've seen so far suggests that the hairdresser is even able to give the speech we see him (ironically, with a disturbing wild eyes fanaticism); such trivialities should not be allowed to interfere with the message.
