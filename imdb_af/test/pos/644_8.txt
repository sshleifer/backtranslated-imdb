I just finished this movie and my only comment is "OH! WOW!". Jennifer Beals is ok as the fiancee, but Yancy Butler as the female dance instructor is purely sexual dynamite! After looking at her in WITCHBLADE, I wasn't prepared for the sheer unobstructed sensuality and raw sexual excitement she started on the screen. <br /> <br /> I need to see this movie again ... if only for Yancy Butler and Corrinne!
