Watched this movie when it was a tournament in Santa Fe Film Festival. Heavy film! The portrayal of a completely dysfunctional family that was taken to another level to the extreme left me deeply depressed, as it was not for many strange facets and dialogue that relieved the film's overall tone. The relatively "lifting" end has given hope to those affected by the initial tragedy. Yet I didn't leave the theater, ready to go to a fun festival. The movie stayed with me for a few days. <br /> <br /> Bringing memories of "Ordinary People", but with humor mixed with the tragedy. I thought the acting was excellent, especially by Sigourney Weaver and Emile Hirsh. How each character who dealt with the tragedy was sometimes sad, self-defeating, but sometimes hilarious. Smart dialogue and situations.
