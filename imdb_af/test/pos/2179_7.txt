Well, I just saw Buster Keaton's film debut in Fatty Arbuckle's The Butcher Boy and despite the rough way, everything just looks for almost no logical reason. I found a lot to laugh. Buster says he puts it in the bucket that has the molasses. Decent molasses in Buster's hat and take money. Buster puts his head back on his head as it gets. fast, oily attempts to remove it while molasses fall to the floor, Buster's feet are now on the floor and so on. It probably didn't read funny, but on the screen it was hilarious like a little more slapstick that poured flour and a later order that took place in Fatty's girl's boarding school, with Fatty dressed in dress and Buster helping Fatty's rival also in tow. As I said, many scenes don't make sense, but the footage, especially those of Arbuckle and Keaton, is still enjoyable today. Recommended show for Keaton finalists.
