I described this movie as surprising ... it is true in many ways. The subject matter (black man wrongly accused), the characters (people you expect to be stereotypes, often show inactive attitudes during the film), the production ... All these factors make for a refreshingly unusual film, especially for her time (1949). The only possible spoilers are the sometimes cute dialogue and sometimes high moral attitude. <br /> <br /> But if you happen to do that if you didn't intend to watch a movie, you might find yourself like me. in the middle of the night just to see what happens. <br /> <br />
