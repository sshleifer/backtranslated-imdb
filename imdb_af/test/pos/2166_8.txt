Black Scorpio is Roger Cormen's Batman. What's cool and there are many cool things in this movie. As the Breathtaker is a cross between Doctor Doom and Darth Vader, it's so cool. The mind control gas in the inhalers was worthy of the Mad Hatter. The Cormen B movie style is everywhere in this puppy which is not always a good thing. There are many stunts and hot babies to make any action fan happy. This movie, the good out weighs the bad. But if you're not one for comic movies, I'd recommend not watching Black Scorpio, but if you want a comic book like movies and don't mind if it's ever a comic incident. Then look at BLACK SCORPION, as I give it 8 stars.
