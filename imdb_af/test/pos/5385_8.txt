I saw this movie recently at our local Helsinkian movie archive from 1918. It appears that the Danish Film Institute reorganized it in 2006 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Nordisk film industry, which was one of the largest in the world in the early 20th century. I believe there are currently several copies of English translations distributed around Europe. <br /> <br /> I found the movie fascinating and well thought out to Mars. The plot line is definitely original, but I don't want to announce it at the moment, because now the danger of spoiling things really exists ;-). <br /> <br /> The film is also available on DVD, ask the Danish Film Institute (Det Danske Filminstitut) web pages at dfi.dk with 'Himmelskibet' for more information.
