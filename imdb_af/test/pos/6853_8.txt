(spoilers?) <br /> <br /> I got a little bit about the special effects. But it must detract from the movie. The movie is a stress movie. And it is very good with it. So from the standpoint, this movie rocks. French rocks. Enjoy your plastic hearts content. So no complaints for this movie. Unless you watch the English dub, that's a total farce. It creates the illusion it is a B-movie. <br /> <br /> One complaint I have is the music video on the DVD. It doesn't say who sings it. I'd like to know. <br /> <br /> 8/10 <br /> Quality: 10/10 Entertainment: 10/10 Repeatable: 5/10
