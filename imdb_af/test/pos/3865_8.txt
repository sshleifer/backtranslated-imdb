No, I don't estimate this one. He was a guest reviewer for Entertainment Weekly and gave this movie positive points. And who can blame him? It's a beautiful, exciting and quite funny Disney movie. Who doesn't love kittens? The music in Ev'body would like to be a cat. It lets me snap my fingers or something. Only years later when Cats Do not Dance came out, I saw a movie that was fun. What Aristocats lacks in animation and story makes it charm. Plus, everything moves into a relaxed pace, and even the villain is not so scary. It's perfect for the younger set while it's not so juicy that adults can't find it. If Snoop was here, I'm sure he'll say the same thing. Yes. Dig the CRAZY cats, man.
