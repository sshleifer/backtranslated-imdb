This documentary is absolutely fantastic. I was very surprised that with such less money you can make such a wonderful thing. Especially the scenes of the birth of the Diplodocus babies or the sad story of the big flying dinosaur were wonderful and breathtaking. Well, the only mistake was: it was short!
