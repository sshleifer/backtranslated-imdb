'Sleight of Hand' is my favorite Rockford Files episode of the entire series. This episode shows a side of Jim Rockford who is usually ignored. Jim is really in love with a beautiful woman and is shown to her young daughter as a father figure. The woman recently divorced and she and Jim recently retired with the youngster of a weekend. Through a strange event, the woman is discovered after returning to her home. <br /> <br /> Rockford tells his father, Rocky, about the events leading to the woman's disappearance, reminiscent of Mickey Spillane's previous era Mike Hamer series. After much devastation and reflection and with Rocky's encouragement, Jim stumbles upon the idea that sends him out to investigate the disappearance with his usual steadfastness. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Jim's girlfriend, Karen, was unaware of a mafia activity while they were staying. at the Buena Vista Inn. The crime bosses responded by killing Karen and replacing another woman in Jim's car. The cheater, who had apparently slept in the back seat, immediately left her exit at home. A few decades have been committed by the murder and Jim goes to their solution while under the suspicion of the LA Police Department, even if the warrant is issued for his arrest. <br /> <br /> This episode calls for more emotional response than all the other Rockford Files episodes combined. James Garner as Jim Rockford is seen at his most vulnerable moment and yet he retains the presence of mind to pursue the cause. It's personal to Jim Rockford. In this case, he is not appointed to do a job, but he tries to restore his lost love to save her life. Unfortunately, it is not possible, but Jim is trying hard to sort out his feelings, but it is clear that he will not soon be hurting. <br /> <br /> Despite the appeal of the main story, many key questions were raised but never answered in this episode. (1) What happens to the young daughter of Jim's girlfriend? (2) What did Karen actually see at the hotel that killed the mafia? (3) How can Jim drive for hours with a cheater in his back seat without noticing it? (4) The daughter said, "Mom didn't come back with us." So why did the girl not shout or cry when she noticed that her mother was absent for the hours long drive? Regardless of these ambiguities, 'Sleight of Hand' is the Rockford file episode closest to a tear runner. The tension is compelling and the story is told in a sensitive and vulnerable style that makes us feel Rockford's pain.
