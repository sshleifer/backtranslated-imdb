just a little can understand Leland's character, and to do this, you're probably innate to see both sides of life and to experience this reality is very difficult and can lead some to bad deeds (like Leland's character do so, but for such sad and real reasons that his intentions were good, in the sense that the intention to save someone else from physical or mental (in this case) pain over a long period of time. and it is very sad how mostly everyone in this movie makes mistakes, but the one character to make one by good intentions is killed by it. The lesson of this movie is for the unique person to see, realize, face and fix the real life situation you see and fix, or inspire what can make right of the wrong situation. but before this ... you must see both sides of something and rationalize it for the sake of the long peace and tranquility of all human life. Don't make it important.
