From the beginning you won't be able to look away and you won't want to. The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (Suzumiya Haruhi No Yuutsu) is one of the most entertaining animations I've seen long ago. Looking away from the mad, and sometimes perverted, humor, it's easy to find a brilliantly constructed and masterfully executed work. <br /> <br /> Part of the brilliance comes from the fact that the episodes are not in chronological order, so you may not even understand the things they are talking about, but as the series progresses, you find yourself "ah, so that's what they meant!" Although it may confuse some people, after the show, you will be working hard to make a story telling the story. <br /> <br /> After all the focus is on the characters. The title character, Haruhi Suzumiya, is by far one of the most eccentric heroines of any anime ever. Her opening speech to her class in which she states that she "is not interested in normal people" and is looking for "espresso, strangers and time travelers," is absolutely bizarre, but she is so sweet. <br /> <br /> Then there is Kyon, the "normal" man drawn in the madness of Suzumiya-san. He is the narrator, and his quick white always makes the scene much more entertaining. He found himself caught in the midst of several factions, all of which are trying to influence Haruhi Suzumiya, and the other three characters are representatives of these factions. Ironically, they are the creatures that Haruhi is looking for, yet they cannot reveal them to her. <br /> <br /> The first is Yuki Nagato, a quiet girl who is the only member of the school. , and also a representative of the Integration Thought Entity; she is basically a stranger, although the best description of her is a computer program in a human body. Her pure emotional reactions make her comic deadpan and always make you think there is more to the eye. Then there is Mikuru Asahina, the time traveler, who is incredibly cute, a big dinz, and the subject of Suzumiya's plans to advertise her club, the SOS Brigade, to the world. The end result is that Suzumiya does things to her that is bound to sexual harassment, which attracts her in fetish uniforms. The last character is Koizumi Itsuki, the rogue and constantly optimistic philosopher who is Haruhi's "esper", but he can only use his powers under certain circumstances. <br /> <br /> The end result of all these characters is a comedy other than any other, it is both rough and deep, and always brilliant. Don't believe me? Watch the first episode, their "student movie." You will see what I mean.
