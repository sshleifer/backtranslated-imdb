Born is definitely an experience, and one of the usual experience. The use of color is fascinating and sometimes frustrating. Much of what is happening on the screen is incredibly difficult to figure out. Your view is either obscured by a sudden bizarre change in color and tone, characters in the road and random cuts to the sky. The sound is very haunting and a welcome addition. It really helps the nihilistic and hopeless show that this movie eats. <br /> <br /> Regarding the Begotten, the "rape of the environment and rebirth" theory feels accurate. But I will not spend much time on its meaning, it is almost unimportant. Obviously the director didn't want to explain anything. He offers it just as it is, and if you want to find a meaning that belongs to you. <br /> <br /> Seeing is definitely not a step in the park, but I was intrigued by the opening. It's really like watching a person's worst nightmare. What we see is sometimes disturbing and very unpleasant, but there is a surreal dream-like beauty. If you are an art house / experimental fan and you haven't seen Begotten, it's a priority. I doubt you will ever forget it. I'm sure I won't.
