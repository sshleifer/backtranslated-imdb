William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Faulkner especially wrote about life in the South especially during the depression years. Many of his stories are adapted to screen. Short stories like two soldiers are an engaging story of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Older brother Pete Greer goes to Memphis, Tennessee to recruit hundreds of thousands of young men, some of whom will never come home. His younger brother didn't take his leave well. He drives a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother. He becomes surprisingly another kind of soldier, because he also wants to be 10 years old. Ron Perlman does a surprising performance as the military leader who manages to have care and bond with the boy. This short film won an Oscar for the best short-live action movie that was well deserved. If it was longer, it could compete with the longer movies. Everything else like costumes, art and the revival of America's era in 1941 is perfect. The film also shows the heartbreaking war at home as most Americans survived the great depression. The actors and actresses are not known, but they do first class performances. If Hollywood were to make more quality movies, I would probably go to the cinema. If Broadway had more quality shows, I would go to the theater more.
