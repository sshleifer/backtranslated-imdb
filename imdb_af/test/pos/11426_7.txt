Seeing Laurel without Hardy in a movie looks strange, but it's both the same. It's a well done parody of what has become a classic silent movie and it shows Stan's talents very well. While his photos were great with Oliver Hardy, these early solo efforts give you an idea of ​​how skilled he was at his craft and how good he could have been, in the tradition of Keaton and Chaplin as an individual star continued his own. The dance series with his real wife in the cafe is the best part of the picture and has some funny pieces to deal with Laurel's excellent dance steps. And the pedigree climax is a jewel, because even the bull takes a fall. And I like the irony in the scene where he is buried in hats and comes with his famous Laurel and Hardy bowler hat. As much as I love the Laurel and Hardy team and feel that there was never a funny comedy duo on their screen, it is nice to see them once on their own (watch the REVIEWING KENTUCKIAN that Hardy with the Duke made another good example.)
