Flawless writing and brilliant acting make this unusual, wonderful plot-twister one of the best American movies I've seen this year. Neil Labute's tremendous decisive and cynical direction keeps this film too sentimental, while Ren√©e Zellweger and Morgan Freeman's authentic performances give it a soul. Violent, challenging and humorous at the same time with a wonderful ending. Chris Rock, Greg Kinnear Aaron Eckhart, Crispin Glover and Allison Janney give everyone riotous, tongue-in-cheek actions. The biggest spoof of soaps since the film soap, but better and smarter. 9 out of 10.
