And I would have classified it higher than 7 out of 10 if it wasn't for the seriously uneven Irish accents of Barbara Hershey starring Mother Madalyn. The accent came and unfortunately went that which I found more than a little distracting. <br /> <br /> However, the performance of William L Petersen in the role of Joad was excellent, but he brought warm and thorough character despite a regular hokey dialogue. Striking and really, I found him quite surprising in the way he caught the character. <br /> <br /> The premise of the movie is pretty simple, building a forgotten staircase in a church. It is based on, rather I believe, a true story and I heard about this staircase before I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> It was a phenomenal engineering for its time - a floating double helix made without nails or screws. It exists to this day, although it is now privately owned. <br /> <br /> ** Minor Spoiler ** Good supporting cast and Barbara dies so well in all her movies and she doesn't disappoint. Very special moments. <br /> <br /> 7/10
