I really enjoyed this movie. It challenged my emotions and beliefs, making it a real piece of artwork in my book. The acting was unsurpassed. I will never see this movie with someone I couldn't cry, I don't think I'm screaming harder for any movie, maybe because it makes me watch, I don't know. This is a must see.
