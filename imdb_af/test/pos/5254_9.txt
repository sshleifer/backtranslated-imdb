This movie was funny from START to FINISH. Everyone in the theater was out loud in the movie! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, Will and Grace's girl) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, best attitudes, etc. Jada Pinkett, who was a lesbian, was really funny, she really played well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the movie was the fact that the other two main characters weren't so funny, though the movie was focused around them ........ All in all, it's a good movie to watch with Your girls (yes guys, this is a girl movie through and through!). Enjoy !!!
