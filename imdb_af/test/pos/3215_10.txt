Wow! I just have to say this show is super cool! I'm in love with the show from the start! The idea of ​​the show is very original and very calming! It's also a pleasure to watch the show giving the two lovely top ladies, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel! they are just wonderful! I am especially a great fan of Lauren Graham! She's not just a pretty face, she's also a "monster" of an actress! I'm not saying Alexis is not a great actress either ... I just love Lauren better! Anyway, it's a real pleasure to see them on the screen, "save" with words! in the words of the immortal Jim Carrey "B-E-A-UTIFUL!"
