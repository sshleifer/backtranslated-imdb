I watched the movie with tears and smiles or alternatives. Anger went into me to see the ruin of Hanoi after the 12-day bombing. And by living with my parents in the country, who has lived in Saigon for 50 years, I understand that we are much better off now, and would have been better if the American didn't bring war here. When I watched the movie, I learned more about the different kinds of wars that America was planning in Vietnam and what disasters they caused. <br /> <br /> Interviews with real people look good. But I don't like some people just giving generic opinions, as the analyst near the end of the series, I forgot his name. <br /> <br /> There should also be more documentary images, such as life in the army camp of the South Vietnam, and that of the North (if possible). There is also a sudden change from the year 1972 to 1975 (I'm not sure if the interrupt was censored, because I watched this series on TV).
