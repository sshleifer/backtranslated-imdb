Nigel Balchin's maze-like novel "A Way Through the Wood" is adapted by Julian Fellowes, who also directs this "terrible British" drawing room thrill. It is a film whose effect relies on the role of the various benign / malignant characters, and it is here that Fellowes' legal representatives are excellent. The story has a linear line that is easy to follow, but the beauty of the movie is the metamorphosis of each player, as a single incident explodes a minefield of disaster. <br /> <br /> James Manning (Tom Wilkinson) is a successful business obsession in London, married to Anne (Emily Watson), who needs more in her life: the childless couple live in the country in a beautiful estate, assisted by their long-term cleaner Maggie (Linda Bassett). They attend social gatherings and meet, among others, William Bule (Rupert Everett), the passively lazy wealthy neighbor. Anne decides to entertain their neighbors and against James's protest. Anne continues planning: James arranges not to attend because of business. On the night of the party there is a hit and accident in which Maggie's husband was accidentally killed by someone in a Range Rover. When James returns home, he sees a scramble on William's Range Rover and suspects William is the offender. Anne discouraged James from going to the police with the information: "What can it do well, but destroy Bill's life as a social and father and son of an important scion?" Of this first 'lie', the virus spreads: James confronts Bill who speaks to James as if he were going to the police. Anne acknowledges that she was what Bill's Rover manages and is responsible for. James convinces Anne to keep it quiet because it will destroy his reputation, Anne admits she has a relationship with Bill, and the three of them agree that they will hold together with their great lie for the sake of the greater good . Anne finally blames not to tell her beloved Maggie that she is the one responsible and Maggie, herself guilty of a previous theft whose life was saved by Anne's grace to rent her anyway, is the agent who draws the story to his surprising conclusion. . Lies had lies that believed lies, and so on. <br /> <br /> The key impact of this plot is the way in which the isolated tragedy affects each of the characters involved. Every change in a dramatic way. Tome Wilkinson gives the best performance of a career full of brilliant performances: he can say more with his posture and facial expressions than any actor in front of the audience today. Likewise, gifted Emily Watson still plays a good role in her repertoire, and also the surprisingly smelly Rupert Everett, who, despite being a rich British man, gives us a man who is both dry and ultimately needy . And the always fine Linda Bassett takes a small role and subtleties that quietly make her character central to the chaotic web of lies. <br /> <br /> The cinematography by Tony Pierce-Roberts and Stanislas Syrewicz's musical score adds immeasurably. to the multiple atmospheres that meet the story. It is an ensemble that plays at its best, which always means the director (Julian Fellowes) has a fine grip on the piece. The interaction of these fine people makes the dodgy story work well.
