I enjoyed the Man Push Cart from Ramin Bahrani, and this movie is just as good. This piece of life is almost a documentary on how life lived on the side. <br /> <br /> Alejandro Polanco and Isamar Gonzales do an excellent job as a 12-year-old brother and a 16-year-old sister. living in a small room over a car shop. There are no parents; they are surviving on their own. Ali complements his revenue by stealing car parts, selling bootleg DVDs and selling candy on the subway. Izzie complements her revenue by selling a food truck by selling herself. They are trying to make money, but their own truck. <br /> <br /> One is tempted to express indignation over the fact that these two children are left to protect themselves, and it can certainly be very upset that Izzie sells her body to willing truck drivers, but the fact is that is that it exists today in the world's richest country, not underdeveloped land. Save the indignation and do something.
