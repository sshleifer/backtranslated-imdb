WOW !! Talk about a movie that divides the audience! It's a real love or it's a treasure. Personally, I really enjoyed it. I noticed that other reviews compare it to Pitch Black - it's a bit stupid as the only thing they have in common is SAND! People can really be stupid. No, this movie is much more common with The Thing (how people don't see it is wonderful. They even have the same basic music). which is not understood. Perhaps, what prevents this movie from being a true classic is that it's important for other Carpenter works. Not least, the darkest thing in common. Would I be interested to know how much it really cost? $ 8,000? Is it even possible? Maybe it's based on a short movie that costs $ 8,000? But I awakened myself strangely when the various space dudes died. They are so underestimated that sometimes it seems like a documentary. It said that the writing is a bit clunky and can only act about half of them and I'm not sure the big man playing the captain is one of them. But his gun is AWESOME !! Give it a chance, if you like early Carpenter, you can fall it, don't expect 2001.
