"Joe" is one of those movies where you, although you think it's running smoothly, finally hit you like ... I can't come up with an analogy. It not only showed that America's long-standing idea of ​​unity, but also the different aspects of our society. Melissa Compton (Susan Sarandon) is the ultimate flower child, while her father Bill (Dennis Patrick) is a cut-out CEO. One day Bill accidentally kills Melissa's boyfriend. In the immediate aftermath, Bill is announced with Joe Curran (Peter Boyle), an ultra-right racist racist workstuff. As a result, the two are more and more associated with the hippies, who find Bill unpleasant and totally hate Joe. But in the end everything has serious consequences. <br /> <br /> True, some parts of the movie are a bit dated, but it's a good composite position of America's two sides during the Vietnam War. And rest assured, the remaining effects of everything that probably never goes away.
