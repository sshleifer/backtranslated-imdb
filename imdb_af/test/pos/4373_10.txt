My brother got addicted to Carlin in the 70's. I always loved his observational humor. It is to look at things every day and find the humor in it, like asking the question: "Have you ever tried to throw an old waste basket? You can't do it! They are back!" And ask questions as to why the word is more acceptable than the "F" word, while prefectively speaking is discussed. <br /> <br /> However, in the 90's his stuff was less funny and angry. What he seems to be was a mirror in the face and took a look! "At this stage, his performances were less of a comedy program, and more of a grip session. But in all fairness he always made a tremendous amount of sentence. He really made you think. <br /> <br /> Here was Carlin old and new. He begins with the fun one can have by getting old, and later relaxing the world of the world. Once again perfect. <br /> <br /> It has been his best since Jammin in New York, and it seems his last. <br /> <br /> I think what "The Shootist" was to John Wayne, or a Prairie Home Companion "to Robert Altman," It's Bad For Ya "to George Carlin. A popular farewell to a real big icon. Love him or hate him, I think he'll be remembered.
