I had the pleasure of seeing this movie when I was 10 years old (with an existing interest in Egyptology). I know there are subtle mistakes in the art and costume, but all this is the best movie, to date with the look of the 18th dynasty. <br /> <br /> The movie just fits in with Mika Walteri's "The Egyptian" in plot. A good portion of the text never made it, as we should consider the running length. <br /> <br /> The music score by B. Hermann and Alfred Newman is beautiful !!! Performances as follows. The late Edmond Purdom delivered an excellent performance as an orphaned by parents, past their child-bearing years. He declares that he loves himself, has the best education available and we can face it, is an emotionally distant person, given his education and high intellect. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons is fine like a humble bar girl; honest love and sincere. Bella Darvi, people complained about her accent, well she's a Babylonian. It's not clear in the film why Sinhue is so mad with Nefer Nefer Nefer. Her real name. In the book Sinhue enjoys her carnal fruit and gets his revenge early in the plot by leaving Nefer Nefer Nefer's stunned body with the "House of the Dead's" workers. Gene Tierney as Baketaten is brilliant! When she tells Sinhue that he is Pharoah, she looks as if she can devour him (in his weakness). She is intense, brilliant and cold beautiful. <br /> <br /> Michael Wilding is sadly tragic in his mission to bring all people to know his one God. I believe we are viewing Ankhnaten through the lens of Egyptologist A. Weigall. A view of time that felt a pre-messiah about Ankhnaten's calling. Has its monotheism influenced the Jewish people? Note Psalm 104 and other Egyptian images in the psalms? <br /> <br /> Mr. Peter Ustinov supplies the alter ego to Sinhue. He is street-wise and cunning a survivor. Excellent as always. <br /> <br /> Adult never thought much of his actions personally. His Horemheb is fine as an ambitious "super patriot" who eventually kills Sinhue more than one person in his quest for power. (Walteri's book). <br /> <br /> I felt the end to the Egyptian was confusing because Sinhue's personality changed too easily. He has a lively son (Toth dies in the novel), power is handed over to him through half-sister Baketaten, he is now world-renowned and has a grip on international affairs. So was he relieved? He could change the Amon Priesthood as he could. <br /> <br /> But NO! Sinhue gives up, everything includes his son's future to be an awkward beggar who proclaims monotheistic love. <br /> <br /> This change was too immediate and the big mistake in writing! <br /> <br /> Watching the movie again, color, most costumes (Nefer Nefer Nefer's golden dress was over, she's more richly dressed than the royal family), music is beautiful. <br /> <br /> I'll see movie again easily. <br /> <br /> PS I know you know wisely that Horemheb didn't pass Ankhnaten directly, but I couldn't resist it.
