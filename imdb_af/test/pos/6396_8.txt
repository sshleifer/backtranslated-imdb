My wife and children are a good and funny series that really prevents the concerns and problems that occur most in the best families. <br /> <br /> Michael Kyle (Dad) is a man who is always trying to keep his children fond of teenager things such as celebrating, drinking, loving, or loving. When they do something wrong, he is ready to correct them. He loves to make bad penalties. Janet 'Jay' Kyle (mother) has a strong personality and rarely agrees with her husband. . She understands that their children are teenagers and do wrong things, unlike Michael. Michael Kyle 'Jr' is a stupid guy who believes in everything else people say. In the beginning of the series he is such a cool man and is trying to be like his father, but lately I don't know why he becomes a very dumb man and starts being a problematic man. At the end of the series, he falls in love with Vanessa and becomes a father, or I must say, a stupid father who's not doing anything right. Kady Kyle is a typical teenager who loves to party, kiss and drink. She has a lot of problems with her parents because they are too much into her privacy. She has a boyfriend named Tony who is Catholic and is afraid of everything, so we can't understand what makes her leave him. I can remember one episode that they are willing to have sex, but Michael Kyle scares Tony and claims that sex is very dangerous and deadly. Therefore, he decides to protect himself until he is married. <br /> <br /> I resume it is the best series of my life and I watch it every day after 3 years so I recommend to all of you - mostly for teenagers.
