My son Adam (5 years old) is a great Scooby Doo fan. He loves this movie a lot. He especially liked the Loch Ness monster attacking Shaggy and Scooby. The voice count is his choice and reflects his love for the characters. <br /> <br /> Once we saw the "Vampire Rock" movie, it wasn't surprising, it was very similar to having a well-used basic plot in another setting. <br /> <br /> Few adults will overpower it without having their own memories of the TV cartoon and even less will see it without children. You like or like it. I loved Scooby Doo for half an hour as a kid, I'm glad my son loves it, I can just do it now.
