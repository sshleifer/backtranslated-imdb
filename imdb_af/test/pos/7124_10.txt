Best fan-boy movie I've ever watched stores "Free Enterprise." <br /> <br /> In some ways it reminded me of an early Kevin Smith movie. <br /> <br /> If you have any kind of role-playing game, this movie will probably be laughing at your insatiable fun. Don't expect a big budget here, but the acting is sometimes too doubtful, but it really adds to the fun of the atmosphere they create. The writing is really humorous with many witty moments that are worth experiencing. <br /> <br /> The beard that is always killed has made me roll. The sexually confused player also laughed me a little. But in the end ... It was just a good movie that showed some better moments in the lives of some geeks with a good time with role play. <br /> <br /> If you're bored, and ever played a role, it'll do well for a distraction. A true unexpected treat.
