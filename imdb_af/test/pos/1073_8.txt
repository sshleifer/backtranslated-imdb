mondovino is a moving and rewarding documentary. In the wine world there is a big difference between the big winery and the little one. It's not just about the size of your vineyard, but also the amount of money and power you have. If you have enough money to place advertisements in the wine spectator and rent a so-called "wine except", no matter how big your estate is. Also in the business world today, wine must often be marketed and suitable for people's tastes. which means many times wine is filtered from its origin. mondovino shows the commercial side of wine in the mega producer Robert Mondavi and Michael Rolland, the wine connoisseur who is wine to the taste of today's critics like Robert Parker, who is also in the movie. Now these guys aren't angry or wrong, because they've done very well for wine. but they have great power. as we all know that power has been damaged. mondovino also shows small winemakers such as Aime Guilbert of the Languedoc and Hubert de Montille of Volnay in Burgundy. These winemakers are not hungry winemakers, but they know like all the winemakers it is about where the grapes come from. The best example of this is not explained by a winemaker, but by a Haitian man who works for Neal rosenthal the wine importer. The area where the grapes are grown is the terroir that goes on, making a leading hand knowing important wine.
