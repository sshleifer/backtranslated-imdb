The Chinese film "In the Mood for Love" is "ye ye nien wah." It can be interpreted as "those blooming years (which were once)." <br /> <br /> The whole movie is a well-composed piece. A complex love story tells in simple visual approach. Author-director Wong Kar-Wai choreographed a dance of the heart - that's it, it's him, it's love. I can hear Galasso's theme: silly silly, silly dumb, and the strings - almost like heartbeat. A piece with predictions, stanzas and epilogue. <br /> <br /> Director improved the use of music (Michael Galasso's score, Nat King Cole sings in Spanish and Chinese songs / songs). The rhythm and lyrics focus on what she and he feel rather than oral dialogues. I can hear Nat King Cole giving us the clues: "Aquello? Ojos verde" (that thing, fling, eyes green) when the two meet, and "Quizas, quizas, quizas" (maybe?) When she is unpredictable. <br /> <br /> Nostalgia penetrates through the movie. Design details abundant: handbags and tires; Japanese rice cooking novelty; the round pattern green glass balls and plates and plates (I remember Dad made it home); mahjong session; kitchen area; bedroom furniture; the thermos for the invitation nodes she swings when she walks. Maggie Cheung, slim and beautiful, looks beautiful in the fashionable patterns and colors of the traditional Chinese women's clothing - 'cheung sam'. Every change of her dress indicates another day, once again in the story. Wong Kar-wai is so inventive. <br /> <br /> The screens can be from the same place, but it's from another mood, progressed to the next stanza. Standing up and down the stairs to the win-ton noodle. Stand at the wall around the corner to the flats while the rain is pouring. Along the passage, back and forth, to his writing angle. <br /> <br /> Trivia: So she helps him with his writing of his martial arts novel. Maggie will be able to help as she was in kungfu / martial arts movies. "Eastern Three Heroes" 1992 is a fun action movie featuring Maggie Cheung (Thief Catcher Chat), Michelle Yeoh and Anita Mui as three superheroes who are angry. <br /> <br /> If you appreciate Tony Leung's performance, don't miss 'Chungking Express' 1994 (in the second segment - romance with a difference) and 'Happy Together 1997' (an intense, emotional colorful painting of friendships, faith and fate), both written and directed by Wong Kar-Wai. <br /> <br /> Understanding the Cantonese and Shanghai dialects, and after visiting the official website, realized that the epilogue was not completely translated. Here is my version of the Chinese subtitles sharing: <br /> <br /> It was kind of an unbearable encounter. Already, she dropped her head. Give him the chance to get closer. He didn't have the courage to be closer. His. turn around, walk away. <br /> <br /> Time and place have come. All that belongs no longer exists. _______ <br /> Those who have disappeared, apparently separated by a glass-collecting substance, can see but cannot understand. <br /> <br /> For a long time, he has longed for everything that is over. If he could break through that dust collecting glass He would walk back in times gone by. ________ <br /> <br /> Wong Kar-Wai's "In the Mood for Love" brings the simple poetry and wisdom of Rumi, the Sufi philosopher - the "inner and outer", the "spirit and body" of the live in thought, love and life. <br /> <br /> [Send again.
