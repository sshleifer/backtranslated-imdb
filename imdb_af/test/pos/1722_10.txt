I love dr so much! I believe David Tennant is the best Dr ever to have the show and Billie Piper the best companion! I like the way the Dr and Rose had such a relationship and had a good relationship and the Dr came up a few times to express his love for rose! Unfortunately, it ended just after two seasons. I'll miss watching rose hops and think the show won't be the same without Rose! But David is still there to make me laugh and make me happy to see him play this fantastic role! I rate this show 110% it's FANTASIES! The graphics and monsters in this show are wonderful and every storyline is different but somewhat connected and I actually learned something about love, the world and relationships of this show. Therefore, it must be one of the most wonderful performances of all time!
