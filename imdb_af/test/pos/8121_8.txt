After a long wait, "Bedrooms and Hallways" made it to the Perth theater - not a commercial one for you to think of - and I thought it was fun, honest and whipped at the "tribal scream" groups running around to find meaning in rocks and 'what's behind my eyes'. It is full of homes here because it tells a story, has a great play and says something about the human condition.
