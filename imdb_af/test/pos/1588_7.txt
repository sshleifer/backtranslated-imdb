Luchino Visconti has become known to the world after its wonderful production THE LEOPARD. Film fans got the style of the director who made him known as one of the post-war new realists, an aristocrat who developed his own free thinking, and consequently expressed them as an artist. But when applied to this movie, MORTE A VENEZIA, based on the novel by Thomas Mann, is a slightly different story. <br /> <br /> At first glance, the entire film is so unique, so psychologically and so much influenced by the different thoughts of an artist (both director and main character Gustav von Aschenbach) that it is "unshakable" for many viewers seems to be. Therefore, such views have risen over the film as "too slow", "useless" or "endless boredom". Why? The reason today seems to be widespread in a significant view: "GOOD PHILIPPINE IS PARALLEL FOR LUCKY ACTIVITY." Here it is appropriate to say, "GOOD MOVIE IS PARALLEL TO NO ACTION." In fact, everyone will be able to say one sentence about the entire film's content and that will suffice. All we find in MORTE A VENEZIA has a feeling of vague reality filled with both depth and salvation that seems to be important for every moment. And that's when we see the psychedelic scenes in Venice, when we see Gustav at the railway station, when we are provided with his intense emotional memories. The insight into his dilapidated thoughts is sometimes so intense that the only way the viewer is going to watch the movie is to do his / her best to feel and experience rather than to see and think. Everyone is doomed to fade, to dry out like flowers on the meadow when they come. In other words, everyone has a sense of loss and death without much opportunity or even dialogue. Consequently, it is very unlikely that you will get the idea of ​​the movie after a single show. It should be seen more than twice with the thoughts that are constantly open. If you like it or not ... it's a different story, very personal. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​are the factor that strikes us at first sight. Beauty as something very significant for the main character that seems to come and leave; rest like something he is so bad on his way and who comes to him in the most unexpected way; feels that he is coming into a teenage boy who looks like a model of all dreams and desires, as a forbidden fruit of homosexual desire that disappears. Costume designer Piero Tosi does a wonderful job in this movie. Through a wonderful wardrobe he provided us with a very realistic view of 1911 when the action took place. The cinematographer Pasqualino De Santis offers us a tremendous visual experience that can be called a real feast for the eyes. And in the background comes Gustav Mahler's music, the composer whose life Thomas Mann inspired to represent the character. <br /> <br /> The performances are, moreover, of Dirk Bogart's main character, Gustav von Aschenbach, who wants a rest for a hard artistic work and tries to find it in vain in filled Venice. For the majority of the film we have a good insight into his thoughts, feelings and anger, exhaustion and despair. Although he is sometimes depressed, he keeps us on the right path until the end does not lose hope for the less tragic end. Tadzio (Bjorn Andersen) suggests the model of decadent homosexual desire, but also a model of beauty and purity that seems to stay pretty short ... "Adieu Tadzio, it was too short," said the main character. A great, but very controversial, work is being done by Mark Burns as a kind of "super ego" Alfred with whom Gustav is controversial about such ideals as beauty, justice, hope, human dignity. For Alfred, beauty belongs to the senses. How Freudies, How Dangerous the Idea Can Be! And always present in artistic Italian films of the time, Silvana Mangano - here as an elegant lady from Poland, Tadzio's mother. <br /> <br /> Memorable moments indeed form the strengths of the movie; Yet not all viewers will find them unforgettable. They, like the whole strange movie, require a lot of effort to get in the right direction in the director's individual ego and within the four walls of his psyche. Under such scenes I consider the beach series quite important, especially the way Gustav Tadzio observes. The physical distance accurately represents the lack of courage to approach. I also appreciate the shots when Gustav is sitting in the gondola and moving the city's view in the background - how memorable it can be to convey existential thoughts. Are we not, people, a kind of "predecessors" in the world, in the journey of life. <br /> <br /> In the end I have to tell you one important thing. I found MORTE A VENEZIA extremely strange until I started looking deeper into what the director really was trying to convey. Then each scene figured out to be meaningful in its interpretation that you should not agree with (I almost agree with everything the main character does), but at least you have to endure it as something the author wished to say badly. Listen to his voice, leave him for a few words on one page of reality ... <br /> <br /> There is a long way to understand the movie, as not many movies like that in 1971 made and now made. Unfortunately, we all seem to want the right feelings about this movie in the long run, just as we all have to experience a strange, inevitable, usually unexpected reality, death is ... 7/10
