As a Dario Argento fan and a Phantom of the Opera fan, I was dying to see his first show, before the bad-it-good-Dario Argento's Phantom of the Opera. The movie is just great, even the plot, which is one of Argento's best in a coherent story. The way he changes a classic novel into a creepy slasher is just great. The movie has a great nightmare feeling, which helps keep you on the edge of your chair. The colors have never been better in an Argento movie since the jaw "Suspiria". The murders are smart and stingy, all in Argento's trademark style. The thing with the eyes in this movie is just disturbing and has done much better than in Fulci's squatter. The acting is so-so, but once you have seen the movie more times, you understand the characters' motivation better, and you get used to it. My two biggest complains about this are the use of rock music. I think it was a clever idea to mix beautiful opera fragments with heavy metal, but this is not done very well here. The end is VERY disappointing, which is the worst aspect of the movie, which looks like Argento's previous "Phenomena" but done terribly, just didn't need it. The same happened in the director's track of The Exorcist. I wish they had preserved the original end. But it's still a fantastic movie and really a must-see, even if it's just for Daria Nicolodi's unforgettable murder sequence.
