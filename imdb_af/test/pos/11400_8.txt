It's not that much of a review, as it proves it's proven that the academy is making money again, not artistic achievement. And I have to say I'm sad that this usually artistic and intelligent band of imbd members left it from the top 250. Boogie Nights is powerful, raw and gutsy through writing, direction and acting. Very few movies can claim this triple crown.
