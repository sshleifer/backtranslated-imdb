I own this movie. I'm actually from the same town as the brother's directors. But it doesn't make the movie better. But if you want to see one night that isn't serious and don't have high expectations, I recommend Demon Summer. Yes, the lines are cheesy and the plot is wheat-like. But it contains important elements of a horror / comedy. I just want to see a small town of children, make a movie full of effects. And I say "bravo" to the Campell brothers. They now make more movies and continue with a long dream. Demon Summer was one of the movies that will help them start a good career with a good future.
