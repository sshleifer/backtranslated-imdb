15 Park Avenue, the name initially mystifies an address from New York and film in Kolkata. But as the story unfolds, one realizes the thin line the director is trying to walk between relationships, social cause and, of course, the world of schizophrenia. I would say Aparna Sen is one director who has so much to say and has so little time available. Well, she managed to make a good movie. In a way, we realize that we are probably looking for our own '15 Park Avenue '. It's an eternal search within each of us ... <br /> <br /> Shabana Azmi's power generation is a surprise to watch. Her screen presence brings a lot of life into the scene. Indeed, it was surprising to see her in a powerful act as long as I expected it to be the entire Konkona Sen site. Shabana makes you feel the skin of an older sister who performs the whole show for a rather unhappy family and during this time she almost forgets to live her own life. She burdened all her ambitions and desires with a sick 18-year-old sister (who is more like a daughter to her) and an aging mother played by veteran Waheeda Rehman. Regarding the leading actress of the guide, I can't repeat anything except few lines and tears here and there. Once reliable Rahul Bose plays another important role in the film, he shows the emotions of a middle-aged man with repentance on his face close to perfection. This man really surprised me with the variety of work he did. From a musician in Jhankar Beats to a liberal Muslim in Mr. And Mrs. More and so many others. He is one versatile that I really wish if he had some shots in the first part of the movie. The cameo in the movie is by Shefali Shah (remember Satya and Monsoon Wedding). She looks really nice and portrays the role of a mother of 2 children. She gives you a look at today's Indian woman who is modern in approach but still conventional when it comes to her husband's previous relationships. <br /> <br /> The focus of the camera is Meethi, depicted by Konkona. She and her schizophrenic world are at the heart of Park Avenue 15. She really worked hard for the character, but there are times when she can't relate to the audience. The fatal accident of her life is trying in sympathy and it is only partially successful. <br /> <br /> The movie tries to address quite a few things at once, from the unique world of the disabled to the unequal status of a female, even in today's modern India and the twisted relationships in a split family. And I believe Aparna has to some extent succeeded. The helplessness of Meethi while working as a journalist in a rural eastern state gives us all a mere picture of the country we are so proud of. <br /> <br /> After completing 15 Park Avenue, there was a feeling of unmanned thirst in me. I wanted more emotional water from this movie. It was a commendable effort on the part of the director, with the exception of few brackets. Must look for everyone who wants to see another theater, something with a strong purpose.
