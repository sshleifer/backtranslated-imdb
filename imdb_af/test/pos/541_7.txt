I was impressed with this movie because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in writing. Susan Sarandon is part of a flying, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly tells her daughter to stay together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting Hollywood scene. The daughter is doubtful, but initially she has no choice --- the relationship with mother is pathologically strong. <br /> <br /> Over time, the girl sees that the mother is in fantasy flights and doesn't have her feet on the ground. She sees her mother head over heels for a handsome, seductive guy who loves them and leaves them. She saw that the mother didn't get it. So how can she look to her mother for guidance? <br /> <br /> The mother leads the girl to a drama test and watches the girl figure out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly by night mother. It causes a period of depression and the girl is terrified of the impact on the mother and is apologetic, but the lesson is stuck. <br /> <br /> There is character growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim to the daughter. and finally being persuaded to let the girl go. It's a pleasant scene and a valuable lesson. The parents, but emotionally dependent, have to let the child go and become her own separate person.
