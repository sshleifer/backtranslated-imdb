There is a serious play in this movie. A scene that lets you know that his movie won't push much cheap. It takes place in a crowded train station and the main players are caught by assassins with automatic weapons. They make a break for it and only succeed in getting out in a hail gunfire. The main hall of the train station is now full of corpses of innocent people caught in the crossfire. Some will call it too sad and / or grim to put in what should be a pleasant action movie. I call it honesty. Most active movies tend to lean towards the "safe side" of displaying violence and plotting elements. It usually means that, despite massive shooting, innocent people tend not to die, or at least we don't see them die. The violence is purely the good guys against the bad guys, especially the bad guys who die. A little common sense clearly shows that it is absurd. <br /> <br /> Renny Harlin showed a hint of this in his first (and unlucky only) hit, Die Hard 2. The villains deliberately set a plane full of people to get their point. The scene was also filmed with a back-up scene of a cargo plane with only a few people on board, but the more grim and probably more realistic scenario was eventually used. However, to fit the spirit of the first movie, Die Hard 2 was mostly a "fun action movie." Here, the grim and more convincing edge is penetrating. The violence is bloody. The one linen is hilarious, but with a certain style that portrays more natural human sarcasm than click-movie erasure on key moments of action. The plot is also packed with more malicious intent than most action films. The villain is not just a crook for revenge or a mad grip on power. It is less ridiculous, but also more scary than that. Of the recent films, the "Bourne" trilogy is almost there with its less cheesy than usual action movie style, but this movie was made from 1996 and 7 years before the "Bourne Identity" with Matt Damon made it on the big screen. <Br /> <br /> Another interesting aspect is that the main hero is actually a heroine. And it's good before the movie version of "Tomb Raider" has become a hit. What's more, this heroine really looks like she could take John McClane off and then take his silent cigarette. This movie shows Geena Davis' second action heroine role and she still hasn't passed a hit. While Angelina Jolie died in "Tomb Raider" years later and counted a hit. The reasons are outside me. Completely. <br /> <br /> Finally, this movie is not all dark. There are many outrageous and spectacular pieces that you can only see in an action movie. The climate bomb explosion of a chemical bomb is an absolutely spectacular display of film piracy, with more than one law of physics making a convenient break. So, there's formula here, but it's the Anti-Formula for everyday Hollywood Action Movie Formula. --- 9/10 <br /> <br /> BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, curse
