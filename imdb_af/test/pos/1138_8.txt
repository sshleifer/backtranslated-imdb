Ten years before "The Matrix" and hot on the healings of "They Live" this brilliant piece of low budget science fiction film made. If you have a bizarre, unconventional, intellectual challenge, David Lynch meets John Carpenter's style movie that you love "Split". There are moments of true genius in the framework and cinematography. Look carefully at a series of shot by wine glass in an art opening party and instantly a scene involving card cards. The plot involves a man named Starker who lives outside of society, who wants to wake us from the dream. Similar to "They Live", "1984" and "The Matrix", it is based on the assumption that we are all continuously monitored by shadow-type Big Brother state agents who know everything about us and we have invisible robotic problems that the city still patrolling. It is revealed early in the plot. POSSIBLE SPOILER: Starker invented a drug that, when placed in the water supply, wakes up to the illusion of reality. Along with the cinematography and the ingenious ways in which the director makes his harmful budget, the other highlights of this film are the monologues. I challenge someone not to retrieve, memorize, and quote the classic quotes of this movie.
