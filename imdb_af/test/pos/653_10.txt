In the early 80's I recorded Honky Tonk Freeway from the cable. Since then I have been waiting and hope it will be on DVD. Yesterday I found it. This is one of the best humorous character studies I've ever seen. The old-fashioned episode is priceless. At this time (4/28/02) only two reviewed it. One hated it, the other loved it. If you have a DVD player, rent it or buy it as I did.
