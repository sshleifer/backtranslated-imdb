I recently posted to IMDb on this series, and gave a snail mail address to the commercial arm of the BBD where one would write to write an appeal. I wrote to the address and prominently named Sam Waterson and his popularity. I just received the following answer: <br /> <br /> From: emilyfussell@hotmail.com Subject: Oppenheimer Date: May 14, 2006 1:44:00 PMT To: kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Dear Kate, <br /> <br /> I work for the BBFC, the British equivalent to the MPAA, and we classify DVDs and videos as well as movies in this country. Anyway, I'm currently giving a certificate to the Oppenheimer 1980s. "During the investigation into the work on the IMDb I noticed your post and thought you might want to know that the work is about to be released (so the need for a certificate). <br /> <br /> I don't know which company is distributing it, but keep your eyes peeled! <br /> <br /> Kind regards, <br /> <br /> Emily +++++++++++++++++ <br /> <br /> hooray! <br /> <br /> I also want to contact Netflix to buy it. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew <br /> <br /> kk2840@earthlink.net I recently informed the BBC whether their massive range of Oppenheimer was ever released on video or DVD. I couldn't find it. I received the following answer. If you write the BBC, make sure Sam Waterston is very popular in the US. You can also enter "Oppenheimer (1980)" on amazon.com, and find a box to look at the release by the owner (BBC) and is notified when it is released. <br /> <br /> Kate Killebrew kk2840@earthlink.net <br /> <br /> Here's the answer from the BBC: <br /> <br /> Dear Kate <br /> <br /> Thanks for your email about 'Oppenheimer'. <br /> <br /> I was interested to read that you would like a copy of this program that you enjoyed. I checked the BBC store and online retailers and couldn't find it available. We are not aware of any plans to abandon this program on DVD. However, if you want to make a proposal, I suggest you put it in writing to the BBC's commercial arm: <br /> <br /> BBC Worldwide Industrial Editor Ltd Woodlands 80 Wood Lane London W12 0TT <br /> < br /> May I thank you again for the time to contact the BBC. <br /> <br /> Greetings <br /> <br /> BBC Info ______________________________________ <br /> <br /> - ---- Original Message ----- <br /> <br /> {Comment:} I'm trying a copy of the awesome BBC production "Oppenheimer", a six-part series made in 1980 with Sam Waterston from a book / script by Peter Prince. I watched parts of it on PBS American Playhouse, but can't find it on any video. <br /> <br /> http://www.bbc.co.uk/
