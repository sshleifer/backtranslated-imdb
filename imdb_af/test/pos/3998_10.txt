This movie may be a bit boring to some, but I find this movie very interesting in terms of trying to reveal a tradition. <br /> <br /> The director, Lim, has made two films about traditional music in Korea for this film. The film before this one has shown the music throughout the film, and this film tries to achieve similar things by having wallpapers in the movie just like a painting. <br /> <br /> Another thing is, the story was written by both director and philosopher Kim, who is well-known scholar in Korea (many doctors at Havard's doctor). I'm not saying that educated people make better movies, but the philosopher is an expert in traditional culture in Korea, so it gives more credit to this movie.
