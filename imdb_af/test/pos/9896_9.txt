I just saw this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival today and loved it. The synopsis is listed in our program as "an old Shakespeare actor inviting his three children to his suicide party." I wasn't sure I'd see it, because when I read about it, I kept the idea of ​​a suicide party. It has become very interesting to me, but 'old Shakespeare actor' worried me the movie would be dry and dull. But I decided to try it. I'm glad I did. It was not dry and boring, the dialogue was wonderful, funny in a smart way, but not pretentious and difficult to understand. Peter Falk was great in this role, he stole the show. I was also pleasantly surprised by Laura San Giacomo's performance, she usually battles me, but I really enjoyed watching her in this movie. I think Judge Reinhold's part could have been better done by another actor. Sometimes he was kind of cheesy and it looked like it was acting, not as if you just looked at this character. But the movie was so good that I could forgive one actor's discomfort. I would recommend this movie to everyone and have already told a few people to see it as soon as it's available to the general public. Who knew suicide could be so hilarious?
