I will freely admit that I have not seen the original movie, but I have read the play, so I have a background with the "original". If you are frightened by the fact that it is a remake of an old classic, this movie is clever, witty, fresh and hilaries. Yes, the decision decisions may seem strange, but they work. <br /> <br /> I'm a strong feminist, and I wasn't the slightest offender to this movie - despite what other women would say. It's not a movie for men to see (so, ladies, don't drag your guys to see it with you, it's just cruel). women will get the jokes, the situations and the relationships. <br /> <br /> I was pleasantly surprised by the depth Annette Bening brought to her character ... she did an excellent job. Debra Messing was treasure, and Candice Bergen was fantastic. I was less impressed by Meg Ryan. She brought emotion to the table, but her comedic approach was less strong. The all-female cast is strong, and it's definitely a laugh-out-loud kind of comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I plan to see it again with my mom. Women will understand.
