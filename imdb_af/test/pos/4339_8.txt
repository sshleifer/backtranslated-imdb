I have never seen the original Death Wish in the book of Death Wish I (film). However, Death Wish 3 was the interested movie. Well-known vigilants, Paul Kersey, tried to visit his friend Charlie, but he only visited him for a few minutes before being killed, because Charlie did not protect the large and notorious underground gang led by Manny Franker. did not pay. After some repression during his jail sentence, Kersey learned that Franker, whom he fought in jail, had his own agenda to make the New York City hellish (and also his influence) by his henchmen every time. to set the crime everywhere and daily. Due to the chance given by Insp. Richard Shriker who knows his profile well and loves him a lot. Kersey decided to set the war with Franker and his gang. <br /> <br /> I assumed Death Wish III was one of the most straightforward and extreme violent films I saw in the past. This movie uses the very straightforward way to tell the story. No wonderful storytelling and less unnecessary scenes that were the one merit of the movie. On the next issue, violence in the film was used continuously. I believed that many of the viewers could hold the action scene of Death Wish III, as it showed the rough, extreme and explosion of action for every minute of the movie, especially the climax show of the movie and the death of Manny Franker what I thought it was the maximum action scene. <br /> <br /> I think everyone is good about the movie and gets their role. Charles Bronson made everyone believe he was still big like Paul Kersey. He doesn't look like the "big old cat", but the big vigilante. Gavan O'Herlihy also did his job very well. His main villain roll in the movie made him look and look like the big bad man. However, Kathryn Davis's role in this movie was pathetic. She doesn't look like the main character. I thought she'd only appeared two or three before being murdered by Franker and his follower to make a heat on Paul Kersey. She may have more role to appear. <br /> <br /> For my comment, the straight style and extreme violence suited this movie for extreme action movie fans. Fast with back and in style this movie had a lot of interest to watch. Nevertheless, this movie had a foolish scene and a plot hole. First, the scene when Insp.Shriker first watched Paul Kersey. It was very funny because you attacked your saint before you want him to help. It looks like you're hitting a guy before you borrow money. Haha! it's like a joke! Although, I like the plot turning when Insp.Shriker later showed that he helped Kersey because Shriker was initially very much due to his actions towards Kersey, but when the movie went to the climax, everything was clear that he had no had hidden agenda with Kersey. <br /> <br /> In another case, the end scene of the movie held me back. It stumbles upon everyone's feelings because it ended too easily. Franker's gangsters seem incredible after finding Franker dead before his girlfriend and other followers decided to escape. Finally, Insp.Shriker allowed Paul Kersey to fly out of town before the police caught him. I thought this style of endings could be found in many Cannon Film movies, but I don't like it. <br /> <br /> For summary, I'm OK with Death Wish 3 because of my explanation I typed first. The cast, and the action was very good and so extreme, even though I had a scene I didn't like. Straightedge and Extreme or Violence can be the best short description of this movie.
