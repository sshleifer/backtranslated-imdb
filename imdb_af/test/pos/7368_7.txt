I recently bought this movie for three dollars at a garage sale, and while I was happy, I didn't have to pay the usual $ 19.99 for this DVD. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the film was. <br /> <br /> It's set up like a horror anthology, recorded in 5 stories, including the "connector" story involving four teenagers' car that darkens the car in the middle of the night. break down path. Apparently these kiddos are like horror stories because that's what they decide to do until the morning - tell spooky stories around a campfire. Each character tells their story a story, after which their own story is wrapped in a nice little twist. <br /> <br /> The first story, "The Hook", is a bit of a waste of time, a little thin and Deaf. Fortunately, it's not one of the main stories and lasts only 5 minutes. It's just meant to introduce the movie and it's easy to explore the unoriginal of this piece. <br /> <br /> The second story, "The Honeymooners" is oh, okay. It's about - you guess - two people on their honeymoon! They travel around in a RV led to Las Vegas. They decide to stop somewhere for the night, but are quickly warned by a mysterious stranger to leave the place, or the danger of being attacked by some dangerous, unknown creatures. This story has a pretty good setup, but just an "ok" delivery. Basically, it's pretty entertaining and mysterious until the monsters pop up, then it's just a little bit iffy. <br /> <br /> The third story, "People Can Lick Too" is my personal favorite. It involves a young girl whose parents go out for the night and whose older sister is a party to her. So, she's going to be alone - a fact she's telling an internet friend of her. Trouble is that internet partner? Is not exactly a thirteen-year-old girl. The conclusion of this story is slightly less climate than I liked, but still very good. <br /> <br /> The final story, "The Locket" is definitely the one with the most atmosphere. In a dark house on a dark, rainy night, it is the story of a young man (played by Glenn Quinn!). He was riding a motorcycle bumping over this house just when he had a problem with his bike. He meets the dumb girl who lives in the house and falls in love with her at first sight. Unfortunately, everything is not fine and dandy - and it may have something with the lock hanging around her pretty neck. <br /> <br /> After the stories are wrapped up, we turn around with a twist that the four teens are in the car, which must be taken for granted, but which has not really seen it, and it is " a very pleasant conclusion to film. <br /> <br /> So, all in all, a good movie. Rent it if you can, unfortunately I don't really think it has much revaluation. But next time you're in the mood for a vaguely cowardly movie in the same vein as Tales of the Darkside or something, grab this movie and some popcorn, turn off all the lights and devour yourself to this surprisingly handsome little movie .
