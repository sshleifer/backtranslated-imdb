This movie has it all! It has a good storyline, good acting, great scenery, adventure and some brilliant gags! Chris Farley plays Tommy Callaghanhe may be successful company 'Callaghan Auto Parts' to stop the company from going down after Big Tom dies. The problem is that Tommy doesn't know anything about breaking pages and needs the help of Callaghan Auto Parts worker Richard (David Spade). From the moment the two villages hit the road, the movie is just as much fun. If you love slapstick with a big storyline, you will love it because the gags are still thick and fast and the movie will just make you laugh out loud! It was so sad about Farley's untimely death in 1997, but a credit for his genius is 'Tommy Boy'. Get it, relax and enjoy this brilliant slapstick!
