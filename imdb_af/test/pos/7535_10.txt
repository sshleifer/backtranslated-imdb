I think this movie is underestimated. For me it was like a nice fresh air. Some people complain about the unreliability of the plot, surviving sequences and lack of sex (the latter is, I believe, the main reason for unreliability, and how do not get drunk teenagers dirty!); but it's just not their thing, and good for them if they can't talk to the story. The performances are wonderful; I'd like to see more of the actors in other movies. The emotions are real. The whole unrequited love thing is presented with stupid subtlety. And it gives you the things you expect to get from a good movie.
