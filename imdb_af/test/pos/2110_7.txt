First, I'm a teenager. OK, and I have to say this movie was pretty good. I think any child will love ten or less, but people who are my age may be a bit, um, ah, well, we'll describe the movie as LAME! But I liked it. It may be that I'm still acting like a child, or I visit a cattle farm every weekend, but this movie is cute. I thought how the actors were like kids, not tiny tuckies, three layers of clothes, a trendy hat and about a thousand ashes (like most shows today, to name a few, Drake & Josh, Lizzie Mc Guire, Well, a kid's show.) And the environment was perfect, but there was a mistake. The family was in debt, right? Why did their home in the world look like something from a "western" versace store? This was a mistake. <br /> <br /> The comos are wonderful, there are about five hundred of them, and the only legible one is Julia Roberts, the main girl's aunt. How in the world did they all get different? This movie looks like a tight budget. <br /> <br /> I like this movie, it was a fun one to watch, and I thought some parts were far-fetched. (Like a cow selling for $ 750,000? Ha! My butt a cow sells so much!) But otherwise it was fine, I liked it and I could see it again. But I will never buy it, there are not even special features on the DVD! How about this? But rent it, especially if you run small children around the house.
