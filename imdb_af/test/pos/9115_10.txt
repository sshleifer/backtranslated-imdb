If you're like me and you've bought the new Tenacious D album, the day came out and went into the movie and knew all the lyrics to all the songs. Then you will definitely enjoy this movie. Yes, I am biased as a great Tenacious D fan, but I really enjoyed this movie that was very popular for me. <br /> <br /> This movie was almost everything I expected. Comedy genius backed by good songs and some great comedy by Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins. I especially enjoyed Tim Robbins. <br /> <br /> However, if you're not familiar with Tenacious D's HBO series and a fantastic debut album, it may not have the same comic impact on you. I would still recommend that you watch it, as it is still worth every penny of the admission price and will make you smile, even if you are not in stitches all the time.
