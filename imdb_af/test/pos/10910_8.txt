Howard (Kevin Kline) teaches English at high school in a small Indiana city. He eventually marries Emily (Joan Cusack), much to his parents. The town is also a pity, as one of his own, Cameron (Matt Dillon) was nominated for an acting Oscar. Everyone, including Howard and Emily, watch the Oscar awards on television as Cameron is the winner! In his acceptance speech, Cameron announced that he could partially fulfill his role as a gay military man because he had learned from a gay teacher he had at high school. You guessed it, she was Howard! But, Howard never came out; In fact, he believes he's straight! With the whole town, and members of the media, waiting and seeing events, Howard and Emily will continue to marry? Or is Howard really gay and realizes he can't go to the ceremony? It's a wonderful, funny and human film about a gay man and his situation. If the man-who-did-not-know-he-was-gay, Kline is excellent and touch. The rest of the movie is just as good, with Cusack as a mixed fiance and Dillon, Bob Newhart, Debbie Reynolds, Tom Selleck, and others on hand to enjoy the audience as well. The costumes are very beautiful and the setting in the beautiful Indiana heartland is beautiful. Then, the writing, the direction and the production are also very, very nice. But the insightful, humorous, and thorough look at the gay population is definitely the best asset of the movie. For those who are offended by a gay-themed movie, yes, just skip this one. But for anyone who wants to laugh warmly and at the same time get a better understanding of the gay situation, it's definitely the best movie out there.
