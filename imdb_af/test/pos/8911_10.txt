First, the stranger saves a little black boy as well as a Mexican, despite what the IMDb plot summary suggests. This film is the fulfillment of the purest male fantasies, interracial rape. The main character in this movie is a George Michaelesque baptism, which does not understand primary human urges such as drug abuse and murder. In fact, every time he uses violence to solve a problem, he has an internal conflict that physically hinders him. What a square. Anyway, my favorite scene is when he writes the gangsters a letter saying they want to get the $ 500 they get from the Reading Center for protection they need to meet with him. At the meeting he is surrounded by many Chicano gang members, but he has a cool head. In slow motion, he pushes the wooden post from a stop sign that falls into contact. Then, slowly in slow motion, point to the leader of the gang and say, "Noooooooooooooooooooo, mooooooooooooore!" The gang members meet. Cool, right? The beauty of this movie shows in these simple solutions to social problems such as prostitution and gang violence.
