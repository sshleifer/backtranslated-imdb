This cartoon draws the second meeting between Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner, and is definitely better than their first meeting in Fast and Furry-ous (1949). <br /> <br /> If measured by aesthetic value, then this cartoon would not be among the top 5 or 6 of the year 1952. However, this is a very funny short. Coyote (Carnivorous Vulgaris) chases the Roadrunner (Accelerati Incredibilus) along the way and becomes completely tired. The curious scientific "Latin" names of the characters are very original, and were previously aimed at other unrelated cartoons. The coyote falls apart and puts on a wonderful expression - I know non-boredom. Such Jonesesque expressions make this cartoon more than its prime part of the seven-minute laugh. Then he has an idea, and another laughing expression is worn. The slapstick jokes are all hilarious, masking the fact that it is really angry to apply such pain to a poor, helpless, GENIUS coyote. Everyone knows, but who cares? <br /> <br /> The old rocket is also present. Coyote ties himself to a rocket, giving him enough to catch Roadrunner and grab him. Instead, the rocket shoots into the air and becomes a firework in the distance: eat at Joe's. This classic gag comes from this cartoon; Although it goes without saying, it still makes people laugh. <br /> <br /> The highlight is truly the chase by the mines. The two carry helmets, and we see the tunnel through which the two go, with only the lights visible. Here comes the comedy highlight. A must-see sequence, perhaps even the best order in the early days of Roadrunner. The final touch is provided by writing Michael Maltese, as Coyote's light goes out and he unconsciously lifts a game in a room full of explosives, showing the surface where a lot of cactus jumps and the letters "YIPE!" Spells. after the explosion. Such little things let you laugh for just seven minutes, and once it starts, the fun is over. The rocket shoes are another good idea, just like the free water drink and the anvil on the rope (a row that appears in Space Jam [1996]). To give away the results of those would be useless. The free drink turns out to be a problem for Wile E. At the end of the second last order: the rocket shoes. <br /> <br /> This classic cartoon is full of fine animation, except for the characters. Although animated very well, the two characters are very primitive; which may be an understatement. Although initially strange, the humor of subsequent rows is forgotten. <br /> <br /> If you like vintage Jones, watch it. If you like Roadrunner, get it on video. Excellent entertainment (Rating: 8/10).
