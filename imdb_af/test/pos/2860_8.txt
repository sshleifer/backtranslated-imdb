Nurse Betty is really an interesting movie. I think everyone knows someone who is so convinced that the characters in a soap opera are real, so you can't explain it, in other words, it's just actors and not real people. <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty 'is not a nurse at all. In real life, she is an ordinary housewife working at a dinner. To escape from her terrible man and the problems in her unhappy life, she has become a very devoted fan of a soap opera. After testifying that her husband was murdered, she went into a kind of shock and lost all grip on reality. She thinks she's in love with one of the soap opera characters, a doctor, and decides she'll visit him and start a family with him. The hits, however, believe she knows too much and goes to her to kill her. <br /> <br /> As I have already said, the subject is fairly recognizable (if you leave the professional men and the murder out of it)) and the movie was funny. The story was well-aimed and the actors did a good job. It has everything I always want to see when I watch a comedy. I give it a 7.5 / 10.
