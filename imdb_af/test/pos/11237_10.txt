I don't know what the last reviewer was talking about, but this show is pure entertainment. Basically, 2 dudes are placed in competitions at a club to pick up girls in 3 different scenarios. They mix the scenarios for each show so they are not the same every time. The panel of 4 judges is not afraid to call or acknowledge people when they recognize the game. They will break down what the man did wrong and what they did. Some participants are weak, some are strong, but what's happening is always entertaining. If you are a guy going out, you can relate it. I saw poor play, I saw strong play, and this show is real. No doubt.
