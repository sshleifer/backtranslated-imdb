Sometimes I wonder if perhaps Meryl Streep has become as acceptable as the most impressive, versatile actress ever since, perhaps just because of the beginning of the audio era that perhaps her talent is now taken for granted. There are probably about three tics that she consistently relies on throughout her actions (mostly a cut lip), but otherwise her performances are incredibly variable and original and fresh expressions of internal work. Although "Sophie's Choice" and "A Cry in the Dark" and "Silkwood" may be cleaner, her work here and in Bridges in Madison County is also remarkable - just more subtle. In "One True Thing" she is mostly sweet and in love with her comfortable life, and makes Stripe what can be routine, even boring, looks attractive and charming. I think she should work out these mini-theses for each character and find what makes this person really and interesting. She works from within with every character, and perhaps it is this essential quality that caused the main criticism of rudeness or self-awareness. I don't think she's cold, but thought her character's unique features. I think her critics confuse self-awareness with intelligence. Not too many other actors would be so intricate and creative to make Kate Muldrun light and carefree in her beloved, homely environment, but to reveal unprecedented depth because of her true attachment to that homely environment. Her actions are of unsurpassed consistency, she seldom does anything wrong. I wonder if it is possible that any of Stripe's pictures will not be reduced due to her presence. Anyway, Kate loves her home and her love for her "family life" is as endearing as her new home conflict. When it all comes together, and Kate realizes that she can no longer function in the same capacity, and she breaks the pie and screams that she is not disabled, it is painfully sad to look because it was not someone inclined to emotion. Stripe is smart enough and spacious enough to recognize how much better everything works because she felt Kate's dramatic validity and it is really the only scene when she allows her character to go. But how refreshing it is to see a character who can really surprise you by showing something you didn't think. Again, Streep's character has at least three dimensions ... God, it sounds like a thesis itself, but as an actress, Streep has only a special kind of intelligence, incredible empathy and good expressive skills. The movie itself is probably somewhat mediocre. I suppose William Hurt is meant to be an indifferent jerk, and he does pumping very well. I think Hurt is really scarce. Script is pretty standard - another tribute to Streep that she was as touchy and credible as she was.
