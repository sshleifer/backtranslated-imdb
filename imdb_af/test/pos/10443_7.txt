This movie was released when I was 15 and I could easily relate to the themes featured in the movie. <br /> <br /> It was over 24 years ago and I didn't see the movie. This time I curled up at some of the plays, but still appreciate the movie for what it is. <br /> <br /> Life is not always fair and the good guys do not always win. I think the movie did well. In particular, as a teenager, the pricks always performed better with many girls. No matter how nice you are, you can't make someone like you. Girls / boys love who they like, no matter how hard you try. Sometimes you just have to go and say next. <br /> <br /> Gary does a good job showing the intensity of his feelings to Karen. It is so true of teens when they are tied to someone. <br /> <br /> I remember having slept with friends to download our donkeys to some of the antics. The play isn't quite there compared to Fast Times at Ridgemount High, but it kicks ass about this movie simply because FTARH has a lame viewer-friendly ending where this movie has a realistic end. Nice guys end last! Gary comes across as a nice shit-worthy material, but we all know guys like this who are far sensitive. We all know David, a funny guy who makes you laugh. <br /> <br /> Some people here are ending, but hello, the end is exactly what can happen in real life. Some chicks just go back for more, no matter how bad the man treats them, especially at that age. I experienced that first hand. <br /> <br /> Great soundtrack too !!
