Dashing Errol Flynn brings his usual flair to drama in this historically flawed but entertaining movie of George Armstrong Custer's life. The dotted Flynn essay Custer of his days at West Point as a reckless, heretical cadet, through the Civil War years in an exceptionally generous and biased interpretation of history, and ultimately as the nonpareil Indian warrior, she was blundering at Little Big Horn is. excused as a sacrifice by Custer of his mission as a way to expose the corruption of civil servants and postal traders, as well as a protest of the unfair treatment of the Plain Indians. Olivia de Havilland, Flynn's co-star in several other films, counts as the dedicated, advertising Libby Bacon, and Anthony Quinn looks like the fiery Sioux head Crazy Horse. The movie's combat tones are excellent. The Civil War campaigns are short and are shown as several vignettes, in which Custer, apparently supported by just a handful of troops, is hammering the confederate army into oppression. Custer's last fight against the Indians is a huge spectacle, a brutal clash between red men and white, without a quarter being given in a wild mix of military power between determined fighters. Great direction, cinematography, decisive and wonderful music by Max Steiner makes this movie a Hollywood classic.
