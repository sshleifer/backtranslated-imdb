Hello all your lovely Dirty Dancing fans !! I came across this message board when I was bored one day and thought it was cool. I absolutely love DD! I first saw it at my friend's house when I was 13 (now I am 17) and got hurt! I saw it at least 10 times and shortly after that I bought the DVD for myself. At this stage I memorized most of the script and can repeat it when someone asks me about it. "" I wore a watermelon?! "It got so bad that I bought the soundtrack and recorded Micky and Sylvia's song, and now it's the ringtone on my phone !! Most of my friends think it's a crap movie, but I don't care what they think about it, I know it's glasses! I was reading the comments earlier and I have a few questions for you. 1. Why do you ask trivial questions like Lisa and Baby? I don't think it matters that much. They are teens in the 60's, isn't it enough? 2. Where did you get this special edition you're talking about? It sounds very interesting ... please reply to this. I'd like to see other supporters' opinions ... Cheers! charliesangel415 xxx
