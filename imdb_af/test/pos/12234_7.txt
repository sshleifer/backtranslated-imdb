Now I love Victor Herbert. And I love Mary Martin and Allan Jones. But it would be nice to see a true biography of Victor Herbert. Walter Connolly as Herbert had a decent deal with him in his last years. <br /> <br /> However, Jones and Martin are beautiful. The Herbert music is just there to decorate the plot line about these two musical artists. Jones's John Ramsay is a bad character, much like Gaylord Ravenal in Showboat who also played Jones. <br /> <br /> As for Mary Martin, it's a mystery why she never had a good Hollywood career. She did movies with Bing Crosby and Dick Powell as well as this one. She did well, but movies didn't take her. The best musical moment in the movie is Jones and Martin in a duet of Both. The recordings I have of the song are individual and written as a duet. There is also a pleasant scene with Jones and Martin bicycles exchanging Herbert songs while driving. <br /> <br /> The true Victor Herbert with his wife and his Irish patriotic background and his musical training in Germany, where he loved all things that would have been German, was a fascinating study. He was also a cello virtuoso before turning full-time to compose. I have to make a strong exception to the reviewer who said Cuddles Sakall would have been a good Victor Herbert. Sakall as Irish, HELLO. <br /> <br /> Nice movie, but real Vic would have been so much better.
