Closet Land is an amazing, terrifying piece of cinema. It only has two actors in a single set, but never loses your attention. The set of designs is imaginative and disturbing, the scene of plays keeps your attention while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror. The play is outstanding, with Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe wearing every scene. <br /> <br /> I only saw this movie in 1991, shortly after it came out on the video. It didn't play in theaters where I lived; not surprising, given its political content. However, this must be seen. It has a brilliant performance of torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to establish fear and obedience in its citizens. The country has never been named, which makes it increasingly striking. It can be anywhere; East, West, 3rd World, 1st World. This illustrates what happens when a small group of people decide what is best for everyone; when government becomes the government of the citizens rather than the servant. <br /> <br /> Madeleine Stowe is a children's writer who was dragged out of her bed at night and subjected to terror and torture. She finds herself in a room with Alan Rickman, a seemingly pleasant functionary. Initially, it seems to be a terrible mistake and she is free to go; but fear causes her to stay and the terror escalates. She is increasingly subjected to physical and spiritual torture. The interrogator uses sensory deprivation, temporary manipulation, confusion, auditory manipulation, role play, and twisted logic to break down the author. She is humiliated and blown, forced to endure severe body positions, deprived of food and water. <br /> <br /> By this she refuses to enter; to do what the interrogator asks. She is told that everything will end if she just signs a confession. A simple little act. She refuses. All this, she has defense mechanisms that have developed since childhood. It is slowly being revealed that she was the victim of child sexual abuse. To survive, she developed fantasy worlds and characters that would take her away from the abuse. These mechanisms allow her to outdo her torture and turn the tables on her interrogator. She starts attacking her own beliefs and profession, forcing him to examine his own life and motives. Eventually she is free because she maintains the freedom of thought. The interrogator is the one trapped by the state. <br /> <br /> This movie was made during the Cold War, Apartheid, and at a time when the crimes of many governments around the world made daily news. It is even more timely in a world where "enemy champions" are held and questioned in secret prisons, denying legal rights or advice; where "ethnic cleansing" wastes the whole society, and humanitarian aid is denied. It shows that the individual can stand up to the state or other oppressor by refusing to give fear and terror.
