For the record, the 1949 version of "The Blue Lagoon" is not the original movie, as many have said. <br /> <br /> This story was filmed in Great Britain in 1923, just after the novel was written. As much as I like to see the 1949 version, I enjoy the opportunity to see the true original version of this story on film. <br /> <br /> Awarded the 1980 film by Christopher Atkins, Brooke Skild, and the two youngsters filmed with beautiful cinematography. The acting doesn't look as good as I first saw this movie, but after watching it several times ... it becomes clear that two children on an island grow up without adult guidance, indeed a simplistic way from closer to life .... whether in their language, appearance or daily activities. <br /> <br /> Although some were lucky enough to see the 1949 Blue Lagoon, I can't help but wonder if anyone remembering the 1923 version of this story.
