First of all - I'm not one who's bad about movies. I saw friends in the 70's when it was first released. At that time I was about 17 years old. Even now, at the age of 50, I can still remember some of the scenes. The movie is sweet and sad and can actually tame for teenagers today, but I love it. The story is about innocence, the purity of young love and the determination of 2 young people to live better when they were at home. By that time it was pretty risky to have a movie about some young runs that successfully set up the house and have a baby on their own. I'm not surprised at the movie and Elton John's soundtrack is almost unknown today. The music is beautiful. It was memorable.
