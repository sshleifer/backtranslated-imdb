Sleeper Cell tries to swim both sides of the pool (terrorism / patriotic Muslim Americans), and it doesn't do very well either. <br /> <br /> I've been watching this show a long time ago, because I have an I feel that it will be too predictable, but after a year in my netflix queue I finally got it in the foreground. <br /> <br /> The show is about an undercover Muslim man working for the FBI to infiltrate. a terrorist cell working in the United States. The shelter agent in the show is actually a Muslim, so we see his conflict / resolution between his patriotism and his religious beliefs. Personally, I'd rather watch a drama about a Muslin American family living in the United States, but it is doubtful that an American TV channel (cable or network) will ever produce something that Muslims in a flattering light. <br /> <I'm not a Muslim, but I have many Muslim American friends, and I can honestly say that none of them are terrorists, and everyone loves America. <br /> <br /> Sleeper Cell comes close to busting Muslim stereotypes, but it also focuses on the worse Muslim stereotypes. In the first episode we see an "honor death", which is a very poor portrayal of Islam, but in the 3rd episode we see a very respected moderate Muslim scholar who teaches the viewer that the true Jihad is a personal battle that is not meant to encourage violence against others. <br /> <br /> If only the moderate Muslim scholar was the main character of the show. <br /> <br /> Americans need to learn a lot more about Islam, Sleeper Cell helps a bit, but it comes a long way from the American audience it really needs to know. <br /> <br /> It is said, the play in this show is wonderful and the drama is extremely annoying. If they had just made this show about Islam in America without terrorism, it would have been the first time.
