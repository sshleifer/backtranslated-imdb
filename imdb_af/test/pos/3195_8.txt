I remember watching this program as a young boy in Australia in the 60's and enjoying it again on DVD as a 50-year-old father of young children. Although the bad guys are mostly shallow characters and there is a component of violence, I am delighted that my 6- and 8-year-old children see this because the central characters are deep, friendly and honorable, the Japanese culture shines through, violence is not a pity, no one glorifies it, and the program is beautiful to watch. It does not promote nightmares, but rather shows much of the culture that mainly influenced the design of Jedi knights in Star Wars. <br /> <br /> The quality of the DVDs leaves something to be desired. Video perfectionists will not like this one. It is reminiscent of something that is kept on 16mm film and projected into some basement on the wall. The soundtrack is also lacking in the quality we expected from home theater. However, my children only noticed that it was not in color, and I suspect they just noticed it because we recently talked about how old things are so often. The beauty of Mt Fuji is also evident in B&W. Something about the seventeenth-century environment makes the quality of the atmosphere as if you were going through a past time frame. <br /> <br /> Overall, this program is better than most things in the air, and a far better ad for Japanese TV than Pokemon, but you may consider it marginal value if you haven't had the experience to do so. in the 60's. My score of 8/10 takes his age into account.
