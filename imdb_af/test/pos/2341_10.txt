A truly accurate and unnecessary look at contemporary life. It can be set up in any UK city. <br /> <br /> I live in a housing complex in Glasgow and can very well relate to this movie. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the situations and characters are too realistic, but not predictable. <br /> <br /> The actors are scarily credible, I felt like I'm spying on my neighbors. It was an intimate dive into the lives of fragile and hopeless people. I was very moved by a few scenes. <br /> <br /> I love the way this movie was shot. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a must see.
