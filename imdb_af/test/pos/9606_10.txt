I saw it back in 99 and I remember loving it. To this day, I can remember parts of the movie in my head, like the oblique pitch. Unfortunately from 99 - now I could never remember the name of this until I looked through the filmography of a friend of my uncles and covered it (he played Clive Kennard). Straight away after reading the description, I knew what it was. After recording, I was shocked to find that it didn't just make a video or DVD release, but still didn't have to be repeated. It's a great shame, I beg your ITV at least to repeat this excellent TV movie. Nick Hancock showed in this movie he can do more than just a show with his character Mike Tonker. It is a movie that most football lovers will love, and even those who are not interested in sports will enjoy the comic value. Yes, it is a short review, but there is not much to say. This is an underrated movie that is earned to be repeated or released on video / DVD, ie ITV, myself and other fans of this movie. PLEASE PLEASE ONE OF THIS!
