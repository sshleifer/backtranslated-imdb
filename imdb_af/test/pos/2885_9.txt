Recreation John Osborne's adaptation of "Picture of Dorian Gray" is a great tribute to Oscar Wilde's talents as both novelist and playwright. On the screen with a bit of editing, it gets a bit messy due to cutting 3 critical scenes from the play. An important scene between Basil and Henry is the time. ‚ÄùThe acting, however, is brilliant. Sir John Gielgud returns to his wild roots as Henry Henry, and although he is about a decade old for the role, he becomes quite the enigmatic, life-loving cad and synika that Wilde brought to life in his novella. Jeremy Brett is also strong and offers a pleasant portrait of the sad artist Basil Hallward. Peter Firth, while not originally my Dorian vision, handled the role with style and grace ... and later with a convincing cruelty. The supporting film is just as good. Gielgud's former 'Importance of Being Earnest' co-star, Gwen Francon-Davies, plays his philanthropic aunt Agatha with dignity and Judi Bowker makes a pleasant Sybil van. The white, pathos and tensions of Wilde's work were remarkably transferred to the screen. My only other blame is on the hairstyles. Many of them no longer look, but look more like 1970's versions of Victorian hairstyles rather than the real style. Overall, however, the acting and writing increase this production to a high level of small screen excellence.
