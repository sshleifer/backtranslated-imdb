I've already seen spin-offs from cartoons like The Flintstones, Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and Looney Tunes, and most of them are great. When I saw the All Growed Up pilot in 2001, I thought it was interesting to see what the Rugrats would look like in their pre-teens / teens and it contained things that would usually happen at that time of life, such as to go to a concert, go to school and be grounded. <br /> <br /> The real TV show is better because the Rugrats wear different clothes in each episode and Angelica is not punished as much as she did in the original Rugrats series. Tommy and Susie are punished in this series. <br /> <br /> I also noticed references to Rugrats in this show and even flashed back on how the Rugrats looked at the original series. They actually talk to the adults in this show because they are 10 years old. <br /> <br /> This show is aimed at a slightly older audience than the original Rugrats. Viewers of the original show may like this.
