As a former Highland Rugby player (HR), I feel that I may be able to answer some of the questions and confusion suggested. I think I'm also able to give insight into the club and back stories. Oh, and it's going to be a long post, I can already tell. <br /> <br /> First, the people who said the movie didn't show real rugby had a valid point. The movie is full of bad suits, people in the wrong places, and more. If you want to know what a real rugby game feels like, you won't get the best idea from this movie. But the thing is, anything other than actually sitting and watching a high point or jumping into a game itself, will not be satisfactory. It's Hollywood, not ESPN! Really, how much sports do you really think you're in the game? Not much I saw. I think it's important to keep in mind that the movie is about rugby players, much more than it is about rugby. <br /> <br /> The Haka is therefore very much part of Highland Rugby. It's not something they just threw into the movie. To be honest, I don't know how the tradition started, but Highland emulates the All Blacks in many ways. The uniform is also based on the All Blacks. The film didn't do a good job explaining the origin of the Haka, and to be honest, I don't think it's right. But I can tell you that every member of the team knows exactly where it comes from and what it means. What the person from China (?) Said that only a Maori can do a Haka, suggests they look at the All Blacks and say they believe they are all Maori. Believe it or not, Utah has a very large Polynesian community, and a good deal of them likes and plays rugby for local teams. I, I'm part Hawaiian. When possible, the Haka is led by a Maori. The team does not do this because they think they are Maori, because of some of the problems shown in the movie. The concept of unity and "those who have gone before" is a big part of the HR culture, and the message behind Haka, for any of those known, supports the values. It is a face by a chief who thought he would die (Ka Mate), and those around him who supported him would stay (Ka Ora) and strengthen him. How appropriate it is for a lot of white boys to do this is not for me to say, but that is the ideology behind it and why it is done. "Kia Kaha" is also a well-used menu, even though the actors had a hard time saying it. <br /> <br /> Also, for those who questioned Highland's Rugby playing ability, I would just remind you that you weren't really Highland playing in this movie. Many of the extras were former players of Highland and other teams, but the main characters were all actors. Believe it or not, Highland is really pretty good for what they do and reasonably respected in the international community. Granted, some years produce better teams than others (that's what you would expect with a sports team), but you don't collect the winner's record by just being right. The year after graduating, Highland (1998) was one of 12 teams to be invited to the World Cup rugby championship in Zimbabwe. The teams were selected from all over the world and were the best of the High School rugby talent. Of course, Highland didn't win the first place, but New Zealand did it, but they scored third in the tournament and beat the Tongan national champions in their last game. And while American rugby can never reach the level of talent that New Zealand or South Africa has, third in the world is also nothing to hang your head over. Highland also has a tradition to tour New Zealand every few years and usually returns with more victories than losses. <br /> <br /> The majority of characters portrayed in this movie are based on real people and real stories. I watched this movie with my brothers, who also played for Highland, and between the four of us we were pretty sure our ALMOST could identify every main character. No one knew a white Rasta. Of course, since it wasn't a documentary, Hollywood did take liberties, but to tell the truth, not as much as you might think. The movie was actually pretty accurate to show the 2 and a half hour daily practices, as well as the compulsory personal running and weight training. Sometimes it was really running until you dropped out. It also showed the service and other team activities (such as the Chuck-a-Ramabuffet) that were very much part of teamwork. <br /> <br /> And finally, the movie, in my (of course very biased) opinion, was a good movie. And I think the reason is that I watched it as an inspiring sports movie. I didn't think it would be a pure rugby movie or an academically acclaimed drama. It was just an uplifting movie about a rugby team, complete with moral, encouragement and a good dose of jokes that were entertained. I hope I have addressed some of the problems people had with the movie and hope you can enjoy it now for what it was. <br /> <br /> Kia Kaha
