Errol Flynn had quite a gift for comedy that unfortunately was rarely exploited. Given the right material, this film shows that he was happy at home in Cary Grant style, soft comedies. From his various forays in the genre, this is definitely the best. Patti Brady gives a good performance in the children's section and Eleanor Parker just looks beautiful in the movie. An added bonus is the wonderful Hattie McDaniel, unfortunately used in the film - a welcome presence. Flynn wears his comedic duties with the same easy style he brings to his goats. The fact that he makes it look is simple, doesn't mean it is. A superior family comedy, ideal for the Christmas period or any other time you feel excited.
