Somehow I missed many of the early Farscape episodes, and I see them in all kinds of orders as they are repeated on several channels. I first caught it - quite by accident - while I was sleeping in a hotel room. The first 10 seconds completely chopped me off - that's what SF is about. <br /> <br /> The characters are strong; and Moya / Pilot is the living ship that Lexx should have been. The plots vary in quality, but no one falls into my opinion. And I must call Rygel - what a glorious irreverent character! Not one of your smarmy, sugar-coated Star Trek strangers here, it's the real thing - cynical, self-serving and full of disgusting personal habits. Rygel is the creation of a genius. <br /> <br /> Last week, the Science channel showed "Out of their mind" (the body exchange episode). A true classic, I couldn't stop laughing from start to finish. <br /> <br /> For a long time Farscape may greet our screens!
