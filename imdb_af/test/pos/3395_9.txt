After just looking at my mother (who got it for Christmas), I was excited to find something different than the usual stuff I usually see. All the stories are detailed and you can feel strong emotion towards each character from the start. Each storyline is followed by brilliant, so you feel completely different things for every single character. The movie is great, my personal favorites are James Read and Lesley-Anne Down, such as George Hazard and Madeline Fabray / LaMotte / Main. The whole thing is in depth and wonderful, very compulsive performance, I recommend it to almost everyone.
