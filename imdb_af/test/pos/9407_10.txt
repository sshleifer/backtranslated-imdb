I thought this movie was excellent. Jon Foster is one of my top favorite actors, he was perfect as Micheal Link. I found everything about being good, acting, costumes, production, directing, photography, writing and music, etc. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Coming Up! You have been warned! <br /> <br /> Martha Moxley, who told the story in the movie, was beaten to death by her violent neighbor Micheal Skakel. Micheal did it from jealousy of his brother Tommy when Martha rejected him and took Tommy instead. Fortunately, they caught him years later and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Although I think he had to be condemned to "natural life" without the possibility of parole. <br /> <br /> Kudos for the film, crew and filmmakers. Two thumbs up.
