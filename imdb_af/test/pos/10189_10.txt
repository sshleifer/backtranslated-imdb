I recently visited the Magic Kingdom as an adult with my mother, her best friend and my adult sister. Disney World is often mistaken for a place for kids, but if you see quality programs like Mickey's Philharmagic, you realize that Disney's magic is for everyone! It was such a good performance that we left the theater and turned around and got in line again. And then a third time. It was absolutely breathtaking. I will encourage someone who goes to Disney World to watch this exhibition, which is not just a show, but a world wind, fun with Donald, as he again makes his temper feel in trouble!
