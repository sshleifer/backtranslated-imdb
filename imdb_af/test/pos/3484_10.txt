This movie really feels so. I actually have all the emotions that have been portrayed here in my life at various times - from both Rory and Michael. I have Duchene's Muscular Dystrophy like Rory, so what you see here is exactly what I felt myself. Some will not believe there are disabled people like Rory, full of anger and rebellion. I know they exist because I am one of them. <br /> <br /> The story is wonderful. For a drama, character-driven movie, the story moves fast. I was never bored, maybe partly because I saw things close to my heart. But I think most people, with intelligence, will be glued to the screen and care about the characters. The acting is phenomenal! James McAvoy is perfect like Rory O'Shea, who has Duchene's muscular dystrophy. He is Steven Robertson's award for his portrayal of Michael Connolly, who has cerebral palsy. <br /> <br /> A girl's love is not returned by a girl and Rory helps him agree. I felt it many times and the question is "doesn't she like me because I'm not the only one or because my disability turns her off?" No matter what the girl says, we will always be skeptical about the truth. It's just natural and it hurts or somehow. <br /> <br /> Some parts have made me cry because it's sad and I have to face the problems myself. People without a terminal disability just can't understand how it can feel. It's a must-see movie for everyone. Disabled people are misunderstood everywhere. This film brings some light on some of the facts of life, which are taken for granted. We want to be like you - to live on our own terms, to go out, get drunk, to love. On the outside we can't do much, but on the inside we dance!
