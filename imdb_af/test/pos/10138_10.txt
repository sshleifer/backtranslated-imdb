The fact that the film is based on a true story contributes to a better and, of course, more realistic experience and keeps the viewer focused on the basic theme of the movie. The story is filled with unexpected twists that keep the viewer at all times from the end of the end. At one moment you think something happens to Coach Jones or Radio. Well, it does, but definitely not what you would expect. <br /> <br /> The movie is in no way bored or too sentimental and the appearances of Ed Harris & Cuba Gooding Jr. is their best in my opinion. The end keeps a long lasting smile on your face and makes you wonder if you're doing right. Well, I think that's what Michael Tollin and Mike Rich are trying to do. First class movie. <br /> <br /> Esbj√∏rn Nordby Birch. Denmark.
