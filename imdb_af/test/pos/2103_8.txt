With the re-reading of ADV Films, I had the opportunity to watch "The Giant Majin" for the first time without the deep cuts and unprecedented words of a late-night Horror Chiller Theaters. Guess what? This is a nice damn good movie! <br /> <br /> The sets are authentic, the acting is muffled and credible, and the giant Maine is stately, powerful and unstoppable. I loved the subtle fantasy touches (the enchanted wood, happy charm, etc.) and the god's pencil as a little less than "good." <br /> <br /> This movie begs for a remake in the new century!
