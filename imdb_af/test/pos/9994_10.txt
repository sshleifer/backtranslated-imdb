I'm not a sports fan, but I love sports movies! So, why ... what is a good sport movie ... this one. And the storytelling style is very good. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a reliable 2 hour entertainment, 'Greatest Game' qualifies a lot. Here is a movie that moves. Bill Paxton went to the same director's school as Ron Howard - including Richie Cunningham, "Happy Days". It's not bad. Look at the huge body of fine work Ron did after moving behind the camera. Bill like Ron was a good actor, but would be a superstar director as "Greatest game ever" indicative of things. To follow. <br /> <br /> Wonderful cinematography - great direction - fine acting, especially by Elias Koteas, Shia LeBeouf, Marnie McPhail, Josh Flitter, Stephen Marcus, Justin Ashforth. <br /> <br /> It's a movie to be seen not just as "feel good" or "sport movie", it's a very good movie.
