I watched this movie at the 3rd Adelaide International Film Festival at the Palace Theater and was completely switched on in the first five minutes. Thank you, kindness for a movie that all the rubbish we often see in Australian movies that seem like a) race b) and c) class, in favor of ... dare I say .... very good theater. The producer, a shy, slightly eccentric chap named Alex Frayne, made his film, with a lot of his friends near the town, which he spent a lot of his childhood. He is apparently ridden by the movie, mostly in Europe, over the past year. The world that creates the film is both brilliant and artistic, especially as it is a strange and confusing editing style, the Gothic characters and the surreal sense of time and place that viewers place in his nightmare empire. <br /> <br /> The producer returned for the Q + A aftercare. Someone asked him what his inspiration was - he replied "South Australia". Hear it! Another asked him what a "day in Alex's life" entails. He replied that he was managing an old Ute, that he had breakfast at the same table at the same restaurant he had been eating well for the past 8 years! and that he plays piano that helps him to think. He doesn't drink liquor and plays cricket once a week. Then the Q and A session suddenly ended due to the next movie show - so my mind is that they should expand the after-sessions for the next festival.
