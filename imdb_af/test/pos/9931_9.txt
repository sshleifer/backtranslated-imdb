Beware of the Scottish Play! Dario Argento, in his exciting Opera, returns to classical form and revives the tranquility he filmed while filming filmed and boring psycho-shockers like Tenebre and Phenomena. Indeed, on a simple story taken from opulent chapters, imaginative brutal murder and refined photography, the film feels like the Argento we once knew. Opera's only true offense is his lack of a score by Goblin, which provided unusual, iconic and timeless music for many of Argento's greatest films (the opera choices used here are wonderful). <br /> <br /> The production is completed by several skilled actors. While not Jessica Harper, Annabella Sciorra lookalike manages Cristina Marsillach enough picking and compassion to understand the role of the tortured heroine. Ian Charleson is interesting as a horror movie helmet-turn-opera director Marco. And Daria Nicolodi is fantastic as always, even in her relatively short role (look at making featurette on the DVD for a hilarious interview with Nicolodi about her role - clearly bitter and resentful about ending her relationship with Argento!). Stage Fright (another excellent 1987 giallo, directed by Michele Soavi, who served as the second unit director for Opera) will hardly recognize the final film girl, Barbara Cupisti, as a stage manager here (I think it's the glasses that do this). <br /> <br /> With me it's often the little things that matter, and Argento's fascination / obsession with lonely nightmare images makes him my ideal movie maker. Opera is full of small details that have left me. For example, I love that we never see the "Big" Mara Czekova's face. I also love the scene where the murderer scrapes the point of his deadly sharp dagger over a television screen showing Betty's performance as Lady Macbeth. Finally, I doubt even the most grizzled treasure veterans not to ring, as the pin grates are placed over Betty's eyes. <br /> <br /> In short, Opera is a clean, tense and naughty stuff. With its solid performances, clear focus and literate cinematography, it calls for being in the same league as Deep Red and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage. Can Opera be the last big giallo?
