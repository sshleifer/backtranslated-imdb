This is a beautiful, clear, silly horror movie that took place in the 1970s Everglades. It's really stupid and lame for the first half, then it actually starts well for the last half. There is a scene with the hero running to save his friends between the shots of a church group singing, I don't know. This is fascinating. I was impressed with the night-time scenes, as it actually looked like the night, as opposed to most low-budget horror movies where it still looks like day. I feel like the director was very talented, but was busy with a minimal budget and a difficult schedule. There are a few scenes to the end, the one mentioned above, as well as the end credits that are extremely cool. This movie could have been a real classic if it left its Scooby Doo conventions and went straight to the throat. I was surprised at how good this movie seems to be. I couldn't turn my eyes off, and I had to ask myself why?
