This movie is about six men assigned to transport money from bank to businesses. Ty Hackett (Columbus Short) was in Iraq for the war serving his country and is just being helped to make a living by his friend Mike Cochrone (Matt Dillon) to make sure he doesn't lose his home. Mike tells him it wasn't the life his parents expected him to live and he had to live a better life than he now is with his brother Jimmy Hackett (Andr√© Kinney). While he and Jimmy have always been a family for him and would do something to help them, Mike tells Ty a plan to make a lift. The money will be about 43 million in six ways between the other transporters. Ty doesn't like the idea he tells his friend Mike, as long as no one is hurt, he will soon be. The last night, Ty was forced to speak to a welfare lady about setting up his brother in foster care, giving him a dilemma to lose most of his life. Although the plan is only safe, greed is not all it takes to take lives. <br /> <br /> When it comes to elevators, it is yours or not, so if you're not planning a hero with a Plan, stingy people stop when it comes to big sums of money. This film comes with a star-studded cast interested in starring Jean Reno, Laurence Fishburne, Amaury Nolasco, Fred Ward, Skeet Ulrich and Milo Ventimiglia. Shortly I recently remembered him in "Stomp the Yard" who was a child who had lost his brother and lived his dream to college. It was probably one of his best movies I've seen and the one he is so good at is good to see him on the big screen again.
