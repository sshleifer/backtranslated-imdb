From any category, it's one demented and over the edge movie, even in today's standards. The movie is filmed in crap-o-rama. This movie will make your mind (and something else too!) <br /> <br /> The amount of hilarious bad taste and slumber is amazing. The dialogue is breathtakingly fast and campy. You will love or hate this movie, but give it up. I saw it 4 times and absolutely loved it. Divine is striving to be the dirtiest person alive, but it is also her adversaries in this obscene and disgusting (but funny) and attractive little movie. <br /> <br /> Divine was phenomenal, and "she" would always be missed. Edith Massey does the unforgettable performance as the "egglady" and don't forget the energetic Mink chairs! <br /> <br /> About mold s ** t! <br /> <br /> Also recommend for your sick puppies; <br /> <br /> Female Problems <br /> <br /> Desperate Living <br /> <br /> Polyester
