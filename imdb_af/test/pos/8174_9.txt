I found this epic of an astounding, striking, even heartbreaking beauty. Some kind of monumentality in beauty and decorative wealth, a wonderful dramatic movement and dynamics. The choreography in this is very pleasant, the actors are very pleasant. I was a big fan of CROUCHING TIGER ?? so good, but this one was even better. They rejoice in Kitano's ingenuity in what is pleasant. This beauty-enhancing adventure theater is an act of courage. When was the tension so beautiful and sincere? And the art of displaying large crowds, giant armies ??. The film has something deeply satisfying and a good taste. There is a great pleasure in making such a deliberate, impressive and clean show. These are good words. Few, little adventure films, let alone epics, gave me such a continuous joy. <br /> <br /> Fan can be monumental. ?? is not monumental art, but is monumental fun, like Leone's movies, like some sixties; Also like the hobbits trilogy. It's great? Great fun.
