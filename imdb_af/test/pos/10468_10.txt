The general in a carriage with his aunt returned to her estate. And the elderly guests leave the sisters' home to return to their own homes. They break and look at the clear night sky and the stars above. They spontaneously hold hands in a circle and dance and sing this song ... <br /> <br /> "The clock stops and the time goes by eternity is near.
