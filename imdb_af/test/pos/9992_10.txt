I will split my review into the following 5 categories. Each accountant will have a maximum of 100% (if perfect). ________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> Visual Enjoyment: [100%] This is extremely enjoyable film visual. I had a good time looking at it. Gholftonele was shot very well and the dramatic effects on the green were quite amazing. I also loved seeing the old wooden golf clubs and the bag. <br /> <br /> Director's work: [70%] Bill Paxton is more related to acting, but this film shows that he has talent. Has done a decent job. <br /> <br /> Acting: [90%] Shia LeBeouf was very good at Francis Ouimet's role (this man can do well). The rest of the roll was also good. <br /> <br /> Entertainment value: [100%] I enjoyed every minute of it. It was overwhelmingly entertaining. <br /> <br /> Script: [91%] Based on a true story and therefore it makes the movie much more special. It was intriguing from the beginning and loved every scene to the end. <br /> <br /> My Advice: Definitely a MUST look for all the sports lovers especially golf (you will all love it). Anyone looking for a nice entertaining movie and not hate it can see it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
