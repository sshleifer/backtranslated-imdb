I saw FAREWELL at HARRY at the Plaza Theater while in New York City and was completely taken. The show by William Hall Jr. is great. It is a movie for the classic filmmaker. Garrett Bennett's direction reminds me of the early Barry Levinson and Robert Redford's work. The film seems to outperform the typical independent movie. It has a soul and a visual power that is very unique. I saw it with a small audience (400) who was enchanted from the moment of the first credit until the last and although I wasn't out and about (like the lady next to me), I have to admit that I'm a little had water in the eyes ... <br /> <br />
