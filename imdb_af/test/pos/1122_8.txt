It's a decent effort for a B-Movie Martial Arts action. Ian Jacklin, a former North American cross-weight Kickboxing champion, is the lead and frees himself into action scenes. Muscular Matthias Hues gets a chance to give more to his Martial Arts bad guy in this movie than in his many others and if you are a fan of the Teutonic Titan, rent this movie now! <br /> <br /> Renee Griffin is also remarkable as the romantic interest in this movie. She starts with attitude, but quickly gets excited about the hero and makes the "Beast with two backs" very attractive. <br /> <br /> The fights are good in the American tradition (NO Hong Kong acrobatics here!) with more realism to play Benny "The Jet" Urquidez himself as John Larson's (Jacklin) coach. <br /> <br /> All in all, this movie looks more subpleasant than most in its genre, so you get more of a story.
