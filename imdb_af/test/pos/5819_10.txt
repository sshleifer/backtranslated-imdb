I feel like I know these people and know people similar to them. Nowadays, however, people are discouraged from showing such passion for anything especially love and loneliness. It has a slow start, but watch out! If you love romantic comedies, but want to see someone who actually has some change (or at least back in the 70's), then you should see this movie!
