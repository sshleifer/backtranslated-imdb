I have no words to really describe this series. <br /> <br /> The premise behind this concept (a highly hyperactive girl with a very eccentric personality that eventually generates a team of oddballs in her own delivery of the world, which after all was a creation of Haruhi, Since she wants a world of strangers, teams and time travelers, she is a fresh air in a world driven by repetitive anime series and non-innovative TV shows. <br /> <br /> Characters are well developed, and you will eventually love them, some less than others. The word to describe the animation work does not exist, as "excellent" would really be short to describe how it was done. There are many funny situations that will also make you smile or sit in deep thoughts. Don't get the impression of the first episode as it's just the tip of the iceberg, as the novels still have to come. <br /> <br /> The only problem comes because of the lack of chronological order in the episodes, but you can solve the problem, no? <br /> <br /> Conclusion: Undoubtedly, one of the best ranges of 2006.
