As a first year in college, this movie reminds me of my relationship with my mother. Of course, my situation is not in line with Natalie Portman and Surandon's situation; but my mother and I grew up with the typical mother and daughter fights. There is always the mother who tells you what to do, or not the kind of mother you want to be. I blocked my eyes at the end of this movie. Surandon's response from her daughter, to the east coast, miles away, after all they had gone through, reminded me of how I felt, from a small town in the West Coast, to New York. <br /> <br /> The movie is intended for women who have children who are growing up now. It is very touching, I was moved by the movie. Every feeling of the characters in this movie was really real, you didn't get dirty sentimentality. I sat by the credits at the show of this movie, alone, wishing my mom was sitting next to me so I could hug her and thank her for everything. Of course, this movie is a little wreath, but everything is important. It's all about what a mother can learn from her child; and what a child learns from her mother. 8/10
