Just got a preview show, and wow this movie was hilarious. Probably better than the first one, but at least she looked right. If you don't like jackass, or really unnecessary amounts of male nudity (much more than first), then stay far, far away. But if you dig the whole Jackass thing, this movie won't disappoint. Toro Totter is the greatest invention ever. OK. So my review wasn't long enough ... All I have to say is poor, poor Dunn, they really kick the crap out of him in this. So if you enjoy masochistic humor, and productive masculine nudity, and by far the most disgusting female nudity ever (John Waters is involved, I have to say more)? I never stopped laughing and actually dried up.
