Of course I'm going to think it's a good movie. I also recognized several people I didn't see during the filming. I was the one who practiced the wait in the film in the death penalty for an hour, who wanted a light for a cigarette. I also changed this one scene. They originally chose to go into the backyard and straighten the prisoner and turn him around and walk him out. The director said: "It will take a long time, what will you do to Gower." I said, "We have to go in and chop the arms and pull him backwards. That way your camera can stay on its face if we delay it." I also lived in the same prison as a young child because my father was the Assistant Secretary of Security. I am also a current employee with the Tennessee Deaprtment of Corrections as supervisor at the Riverbend Maximum Security Institution. Although much of the movie was a joke, the part I was, was real enough. Also in the bar scene, the dancer kicked high in the air and left the stage, a real stripper I used to work at a club called "The Classic Cat".
