10/10 <br /> <br /> PLOT DISCUSSION <br /> <br /> It's one of the best movies ever made and I don't say it because I'm being deceived by the seemingly nonsensical presentation. Those who don't like the film because they don't understand the story often criticize those who praise the film by saying they accept their genius because they don't understand it. I don't see this movie as very allegorical. For me this is a story with a beginning, middle and end. People are confused by the film because they expect them to have a deep, philosophical meaning that must interpret them from the allegedly meaningless scenes. I don't think they realize that the cryptic character of a chopped and rearranged plot comes along with a very long and rather explanatory fantasy direction and not a chaos of visual allegory. Because of the limitation of length, I will try to keep it short and to the point and address the main concepts. <br /> <br /> The common plot: Diane moves to L.A. after jitterbug game to act. At an audition she meets Camilla with whom she falls in love. Diane is furious with jealousy as Camilla sleeps with other men and women. Diane discovers the other man (the director) at a movie shooter and discovers the other woman (a random blonde) at the engagement party for Camilla and the director. Named by her anger and possessiveness, Diane rents a hit to kill Camilla. Then she is survived by loneliness and slipping into an unconscious fantasy world where she lives alive what she wants. Diane is then woken up. In her conscious state she is being followed by what she has done. <br /> <br /> The Meaning of the Fantasy: The movie begins, after the credits, with a 1st person by shot protruding someone falling on a bed and slipping into unconscious. That's where Diane's fantasy begins. The accident is there as an excuse for her to bring back her dead girlfriend and justify the fantasy life. She depicts her girl so softly and innocently because that is what she wanted her to be. Meanwhile, she acts like everything is in the movies because she has an escapist personality. She also kills herself to some extent and accepts the identity of a waitress named Betty at dinner. The story about the director is a direct result of her feeling that he was in reality in reality, as she herself was and "convinced" that he was forced to choose Camilla. It was also an unconscious expression of the lack of control she felt during the festival. Camilla Rhoades in the fantasy is actually the random blonde of the engagement party. She hated her so much that she changed her into Camilla and made the ultimate antagonist. She then took the real Camilla and turned her into a perfect, submissive out-of-the-movies friend and used Rita Hayworth as inspiration. She also paints the hit as a very clumsy and incompetent person to further justify Camilla's survival. Her fantasy world, unfortunately for her, was a search for Diane who eventually made herself dead and died by taking a series of memories of reality. The first reminder was Club Silencio who sang that "there is no band" and the instruments you hear aren't really there; it is a metaphor for the fantasy. She started shaking with violence because it shook her perception of her environment. The other memory is the blue box. Actually, the blue box is not the memory itself (more of a Pandora box, really), but the blue key that opens the box. The blue key reminds her of Camilla's actual death, because that was what the hit said would pop up when it was done. Along with love, this whole creation of her is an escape from reality by living in the idealized Hollywood she was planning to be part of his arrival. <br /> <br /> This is a story showing the psychology of a very upset woman who has lost a dream. It is not a series of randomly designed things that are disturbed, and it is not a cryptic philosophical message. It is an unfortunate part of the human condition that is beautifully presented. <br /> <br /> But that's all my opinion. I can be gone. Or it may not be meant to mean one thing. There are many who do not agree with me. Great! After all, why should it mean anything? Why can't it just be a statement in itself? What happens if coherent, sensible narratives are artistic expression? For example, Peter Greenaway spent many words supporting such statements, such as: "I would argue that if you want to write stories, be a writer, be a novelist, don't be a filmmaker. Because I believe film making is so much more exciting in areas that are not primarily related to narrative. "And where is the written rule that everything should be understandable right away with just one possible interpretation? There is no such rule because the clarity of the film is not related to its art. "I didn't understand it!" So ...? "Mulholland Dr," story or not, affect the viewers, make them troublesome, drag them, wake them up, fix them. The way it lends to interpretation is wonderful. It never gets old. It never loses its shine. The visuals are always effective and beautiful. It's cinematic perfection, no matter what. Enjoy.
