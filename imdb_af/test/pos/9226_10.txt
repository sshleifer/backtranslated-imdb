Here's what to remember about this movie .... THIS IS A CHILDREN'S FILM !!!!! I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm an 80 year old child. I was obsessed with Rainbow Brite. So of course I love this movie. But if you watch the other Rainbow Brite movies, this one is by far the best. But, as I said, this is a children's movie. You should judge it as a children's movie. It doesn't matter to children if the acting, animation or writing is fantastic or even good. All they care about is what happens to the characters. If the good guy (or girl) wins then it's a good movie. If not, then it is bad. You all know what I mean. You were kids once.
