"Saratoga Trunk" is a 1945 movie featuring Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper. It is based on a 1941 book by the great Edna Ferber. Unconsciously, she could have been on the brain with the wind; parts of the story reminded me of GWTW. <br /> <br /> In the 1890s, Clio Dulaine is an illegitimate child returning from New Orleans, France, with a mulatto servant (Flora Robson) and a dwarf servant, Cupidon Jerry Austin. She gave her a Countess title and claimed she was a widow. Her mother accidentally killed her father, and his family avoided her. Clio takes over the old place, with the idea that she is ashamed of her sister and her father's wife, giving her a lot of attention. Her plan is to marry someone who is very wealthy who can give her safety and respect for her. Then she sees Clint Maroon (Cooper), a Texas gambler, and falls to him. The two have a brief relationship - and he doesn't have money, so she can't marry him - so he leaves for Saratoga Springs. Eventually the Dulaine family had enough, and their lawyer gave her $ 10,000 to get out of town. She does. She goes to Saratoga Springs and goes to the owner of the railway, Bart von Steed. But Clint is always around. <br /> <br /> Bergman is beautiful in dark hair and wearing the costumes, and Cooper is deadly, wonderful with the incredible 300-watt smile of his. How she can resist him is beyond me. And the love stories - who, what chemistry! The supporting role is excellent, Robson and Cupidon create interesting characters, and Florence Bates gives an excellent performance as a socially prominent woman who takes Clio under her wing, knowing she's a big fake. <br /> <br /> The movie is a bit long, and some of the plays can look old today, but it's an absorbing story filled with atmosphere and vibrant performances. The end will not come as a surprise. It's a fun trip though.
