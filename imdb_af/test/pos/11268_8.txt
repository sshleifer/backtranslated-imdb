It must be one of the most beautiful morbid movies I've ever seen. Merhige created a living painting that unfolds with terrible violence, sex and a minimalist revival of the life of Jesus Christ. The high contrast and thick layer of grain makes you wonder what you sometimes see, but the use of texture combined with the extreme contrast creates an incredible viewing experience. This movie is not for everyone. I think you should keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this movie for content, but if it is extremely rough, but make a fairly important statement about creation, god and humanity. Whether this film is a work of art or shock value trash is open for discussion.
