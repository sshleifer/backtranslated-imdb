A German first-class man, Stefan hitch pausing to Paris during the summer, falls to a mysterious young woman he meets in the Paris freak scene. He follows her in the famous island of Ibiza. The hippie joint meets Wolf, a man who throws Hitler-Jugend knives, owns bars and hotels and holds Estelle under his thumb. The couple are trying to escape Wolf, Stefan is relaxed by baptism and jealousy for Estelle, who is groovy and a free spirit. Great photography and music, plot is very normal for the period, but it is not an exploitation type of movie, cold and dramatic. The morale is pretty strong (he was looking for the sun ...), but I don't want to say it's a drug against drugs, even if it's uncomfortable with drug use.
