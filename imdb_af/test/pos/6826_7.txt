I do not understand the need to jump backwards and forwards to the play and stick out the plot. To show that someone has a skill before using it, I believe, is our intelligence offended. It's starting to get a little confronted, and as if they're being so vague for the first three series. A little disappointing for this episode. <br /> <br /> With the help of the past, like Locke's ability to know when a storm ends, it's frankly insulting ... we must ooh and arr, or laugh softer side of Locke < br /> <br /> This episode was everywhere in the place.
