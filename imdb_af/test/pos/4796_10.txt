I like the absurdity and biting humor of Buñuel's surreal films (such as "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie" and "The Exterminating Angel" to name two). Other earlier works (such as "The Forgotten Ones", about juvenile criminals of a marginal neighborhood in Mexico) are more serious and offer a strong social message. <br /> <br /> However, I believe it is "Nazarin" which is the most successful shooter for the heart of the viewer. While it is true that it is full of irony, it reveals an aspect of Buñuel that appears to be intrigued by the beauty and solemnity of the spiritual quest. Here, while the director throws (fairly typical) countless jabs at the Catholic Church, it also appears surprisingly a sense of admiration for true Christian thinking and the practice of selfless love. <br /> <br /> "What did Luis Buñuel prize a Jesus-like figure? I always thought of him as a completely cynical artist without a trace of faith in human virtues. That is until I looked at Nazarin. My appreciation is that he exposing satirical problems to follow Christ's example in a society infected with meanness, ignorance and sin, but he also presents the hero, Father Nazario, as the beacon of light amidst a sea ​​of ​​darkness, without a doubt, by the end of the movie I watched him and not on him! <br /> <br /> Some would argue that Father Nazario's uncertainty about his faith indicates the loss of his holy values. (Oh, if he can't do well in this world, who can?) But I would say that this "mistake", his frustration, his character makes more heroic, because it shows how man he is and how challenging his struggle inside, and who says the priest could not finally get out of that "dark night" and regain his confidence Perhaps we were only offered a difficult part of his spiritual journey. The elegant open end (accepting the fruits offered by a female stranger) enables us to imagine the final outcome of the story. <br /> <br /> I recognize in Buñuel the aggressive, self-assured atheist with brilliant white and social consciousness; but after looking at Nazarin, I also felt a certain warmth, a depth and maturity that is not so clear in his other work. <br /> <br /> For the sake of the contrast, I strongly recommend looking at his short film "Simon of the Desert" (also in Mexico, a few years later). It's about a similar subject - leaving the ego in the face of temptation - just doing it hysterically funny and completely relentless.
