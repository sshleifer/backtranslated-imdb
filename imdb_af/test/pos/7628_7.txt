Stupidly beautiful. This movie gives an impression of the 'so bad it's good' genre of movies. <br /> <br /> The only two talents in it are Richard Boone and Joan van Ark, and only Boone is any good. It is a bit sad that the man who has become known to Paladin has to wind up celluloid in this ugly heap. While creating a fantastic performance, I couldn't help but felt that he had classified all of his fellow actors in this play. He didn't even have to be there. <br /> <br /> The effects in this movie are laughable, but fun. The idea that a dinosaur is buried in the wall of a cave and suddenly comes to life is B-movie gold. When the triceratops are killed, watch it fall. Clearly, the stunt exporter knows the best timing in front of the costume. He falls to the ground, before the back of the dinosaur follows the suit. <br /> <br /> Speaking of 'suits', there's nothing good to say about the purple tirannosaur in this movie. It seems like it's a bit stealth technology, as Bunta (who is allegedly the best tracker in the world) twice fails to notice it until it's within the bytes of it. I don't know how all the prints are, but in the version I own, Tyranno's roar contains Godzilla's bellow brand. <br /> <br /> Watching bad movies is great fun. I love them, and especially bad monster movies, so I consider it the jewel of my collection. If bad movies are your thing, this one definitely gets.
