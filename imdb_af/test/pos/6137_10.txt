I agree with so many other reviewers here. It was a good movie and an even better novel by Robert Fish. Unfortunately, I believe the author died before he could see this movie. The performances are all top-notch, with the three principles (John Glover, Ben Cross, and Veronica Hamel) seemingly for their roles. The exteriors, both in Europe and Israel, look very ugly, and the 4-hour miniseries were just right to tell this story. Luckily I filmed it when it was on television and I already enjoyed it. I can say carelessly that it remains to this day. I gave it a score of 10. If you haven't read the book, you really should get a copy. It will be a great movie to show on DVD with extras that can easily include movie interviews.
