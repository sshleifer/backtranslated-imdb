My friends and I saw it at the San Diego Black Film Festival. It was wonderful. Stormy is a strong black woman and Nana reminds me of my grandmother. <br /> <br /> René is fine !!! To see him picking up his clothes, was definitely the price of admission. Can anyone send me my contact information? <br /> <br /> My friend thinks Flex is the finer of the two. She's been a Flex fan for years, but she might be a bit biased. The cousins ​​were funny and just as small as Nana described them. LOL. <br /> <br /> I look forward to seeing this movie again when it comes to theaters.
