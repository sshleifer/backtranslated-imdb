I just returned from the GLBT Film Festival at AMC Loews 34 in NY. A friend told me about this movie. Public response was very positive! Very good solid laugh as well as some quiet moments of realization. In addition, in every area. A movie that makes you think, and then makes you realize how happy we all will be if our time can turn back and live without shame or guilt. I think it will come close, if not win, the audience favorite award! What was most surprising was the fact that the movie appears as a satire and then slowly weaves into a sincere comment on the group's negative and sometimes violent reactions that begin to saturate. There is no common sense of humor at the expense of one group, just a slow realization that we would all be better if we just returned to the soft innocence we all started with.
