Liv Tayler in her sexy movie! <br /> <br /> She plays the role of the Femme Fatale in an astonishing way while at the same time being a super sexy woman while the "lovely girl" is standing and not being remnant like others similar movies (eg "Femme Fatale" with Rebecca Romijn) <br /> <br /> To this movie, Lord of the Rings was the only movie I ever saw her. > Point: Through LoTR I formed an opinion that the role of the pure sweet woman was the only role that could be interpreted by Liv Tayler, but when I saw "One Night at Mc Cool", I totally changed my mind. She's the sexiest woman ever! <br /> <br /> So, as a movie, a mediocre ordinary comedy with a "confusing" plot
