Kar Wai Wong's amazingly impressive romance is perfect for me. Set in the 1960s Hong Kong. As we are shown, it is in a turbulent time. Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung play Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan. A man and a woman who meet in a flat in Hong Kong, where they both move in. Chow Mo-wan works for a newspaper company. Su Li-zhen Chan is a secretary. Two very different people. Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan create a special bond after finding out both of their spouses. Out-of-court prostitutes are constantly committed. With each other. <br /> <br /> The characters of Chow Mo-wan and Su Li-zhen Chan are nothing short of wonderful. Both Leung and Cheung succeed in striking such a wonderful chemistry, which is better than any Hollywood romance that is being challenged today. Combined. The film is about the focus of the two leaders and their feelings towards the unfaithfulness of their partners. Kar Wai Wong manages such a strong character development between these two characters, you really start to feel for them. Leung and Cheung are both fantastic, better than any Hollywood couple appearing on the screen today. Combined. <br /> <br /> There is nothing else to describe Fa yeung nin wa as a beautiful, energetic romance that also features a moody atmospheric piece with beautiful cinematography. So many elements of this movie help to be flawless. As well as Kar Wai Wong and the play, the cinematography of both Christopher Doyle and Pin Bing Lee is haunting. Beautifully understated. The shots of Kar Wai Wong help make your mind a world of its own. A world that creates these characters. Original, melancholic and nostalgic. This movie is incredibly memorable. <br /> <br /> The costumes created by Kar Wai Wong regular William Chang are absolutely beautiful. Cheung, who wears an elegant, single-deep, beautifully-formed dress in every scene. She is a playmaker. Her costumes say a lot about her character and an emotion is fitted in all her dresses. Colors used bright and smart. Very original. Chang, also the production designer creates a brilliant environment for the movie moody piece. Especially with the help of the wonderful music used in scenes and masterful movie editing, again by Chang. William Chang seems to be incredibly versatile and is an uncanny hero for this movie. <br /> Overall, this movie is one of the best in this millennium. Incredibly compelling and filled with nostalgia. The shots are enchanting and haunting. Kar Wai Wong proves a master at the top of his game. The acting; music; cinematography; editing; production; costume and direction all help create ONE small, small perfect movie. A masterpiece in romance film-making. Visually spectacular. Overall, a masterpiece to make film. A movie that reminds me of old classic Hollywood was the one that never was. Never forget, ye ye nin wa. I know I won't.
