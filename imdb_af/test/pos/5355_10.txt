I really refused to see this movie. I refused to go to school and refused to go with my parents. Just by looking at the trailer, it got stupid anyway. One of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices, "The Dukes Of Hazzard" or "Wallace And Gromit: The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit". It took me 17 minutes to decide. Time runs out. I had to choose. It appeared on the "Few" screen as in a few tickets left. By the time we had to arrange and get our ticket, just one of us could go in. I wanted to enter Nicholas desperately to see it. But he forced me. I crossed my arms and was very moody and disappointed that I was going to see this childhood. I came in, sat in the only seat that was available and prepared for the movie! must say I was very surprised that I was sitting by that MASTERPIECE! It was awesome. I don't know what I complained about. The Clay Animation was by far the best I have ever seen in my life. The story was brilliant. About a rabbit who has disrupted a carnival planned for more than 500 years. Basically, anti-pest control protects the people competing in the vegetable competition. Anti Pesto known as Wallace And Gromit (who is in charge of this business) is trying to keep all the rabbits away from the Vegetable Carnival. I will no longer say. It's just too good to tell. I will admit that the whole idea of ​​a Were-Rabbit is incredible and childish, but Nick Park adds dust to it that makes everyone love it. I mean, there is not a 10 foot rabbit on the loose and there will certainly not be 8 foot werewolves as said in Dog Soldiers. Then again, Wax-Rabbits and Werewolves are not real creatures. But either worked it out very well. <br /> <br /> The jokes were also raised. The kids won't get the jokes. It goes a lot above their heads. It had many British jokes there. If you like British humor, it's the movie for you. <br /> <br /> I also loved the cast and the voices. Everything about the movie is so incredibly well done. The direction and pacing was absolutely ... FANTASIES! I recommend it to fans of the old Wallace and Gromit shorts (and no, I haven't seen it yet), and I recommend it to fans who have kept "Shrek" and "Shrek 2", and above all, I recommend it to the people. who loves Clay Animation. Cracking good movie! 10/10
