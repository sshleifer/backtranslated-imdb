This review is based on Producer's Cut: <br /> <br /> 'Halloween 5' was a huge disappointment at the box's way back in '89. Personally, I've always loved it and I'm proud to have it in my collection. But because of the failure and also due to real issues, it would be 6 years before we would see another installment. The film had the ability to be one of the best, if not the best in the series. A hardcore fan writing the script, the return of not just Donald Pleasence like Dr. Loomis and George Wilbur like Michael Myers, but also the return of Tommy Doyle's character from the first film, a large studio that supports the project and a fall loose all loaded the film like a hit in the making. So what went wrong? I'll give you two good reasons: Re-shoots and poor editing. Due to a bad touch screen and also the unfortunate passing of Donald Pleasence, the film has changed, not for the better. The film, like parts III and 5, thought of the box office and deserved negative reviews from both critics and most adherents. But then, thanks to the magic of booting, the original track leaked and many fans, including myself, were very happy. I will end this part of my review by saying this: This movie has so far been my favorite 'Halloween' movie and I'm not afraid to admit it. <br /> <br /> Front: The score is simply spell binding. Have some of the best writing and dialogue series. "Halloween 4" has mulled the original because it was more about tension and mood instead of blood and gut, and 6 is the same. Great performances, especially of late and much missed Donald Pleasence. Move at a breathtaking pace An interesting explanation for Michael's anger and why he won't die. Some brutally kill. Some nice cold moments, my favorite is the one that involves Kim Darby's character. Very really cool nod to the previous movies. Some good surprises. Like the previous two successors, this one has a wonderful stone hanger. <br /> <br /> Disadvantages: Although the explanation for Michael's anger is fascinating, it makes him a little less scary. Since then has Michael been able to move from place to place so quickly? <br /> <br /> Final thoughts: This was the first "Halloween" I saw in the theater. I was so excited because I really thought 5 would be the last and then I heard it happen. I enjoyed it at the time, but over time I saw it for what it really was: A big movie trapped in an OK one with a terrible end. Why did the filmmakers have to listen to the tests on the people? If they released this superior version, it may have done much better and the series may not be in the mess. It's just like that. <br /> <br /> My rating: 5/5
