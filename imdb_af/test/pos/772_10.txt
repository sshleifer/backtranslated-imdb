A beautiful movie. One who made me think of God but didn't feel guilty or overwhelmed. Have me think of death, but not afraid, think of life, but do not be hidden from it. A movie that has both love for everything I stand for and at the same time condemns it to the deepest wells of hell. A movie that made me think of love and everything I lost, but no sadness relieved my eyes for a strange reason. A child of two worlds, god and theater. And a good little wine and irony! I highly recommend ***** <br /> <br /> "When the S *** hits The Fan, get a tent" Oh and we all have to camp. Every day.
