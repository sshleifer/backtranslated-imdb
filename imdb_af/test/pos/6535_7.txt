Aaron Carter plays the pop star (J.D. McQueen) in this movie (surprise surprise). It is a typical movie where the leading lady (Jane) has a great luck on JD McQueen, the pop star (as well as many other girls), but she is the lucky one who spends the days with JD and forms a relationship with him. is more like a fantasy. J.D. must go to a public school to stop his math to do his summer tour. Problem is J.D. is not good in math. He finds the smartest person in the school (Jane) to lead him. Jane tutors and in love with J.D. J.D. in exchange, too, but J.D. screw up and fix everything to win the girl and make the summer tour. The movie is definitely worth watching. Aaron will be a BIG actor !!!
