While this movie is not the most entertaining in the world, I think it is better than most above all. I mean it has a little laugh and just a good feeling. It's not too often that we see two old geese, just to have fun with their age and to be honest with the jokes. Walter and Jack had such a great chemistry together with friends / brothers cleaners. Just watching them romance these women was fun and you rooted the whole root because we have to admit it or not, because they still had game! : D I just loved the whole plot to go further and have fun no matter how old you are. I would recommend this movie for a nice laugh if you want one. <br /> <br /> 7/10
