Although this film has devastated director and screenwriter Michael Cimino's career and made American artists bankrupt, it is still one of the best films of all time. There are many reasons to release this movie for the time being. Among them: its length, its technical problems, its colossal abuse of animals on the set - the list goes on and on. And yet, for all these things, it remains a movie that captures something. This is a classic example of naturalistic storytelling, similar to Strindberg - his moments remain as long as they really can't be left for good movie-like timing. It really feels in his moments of anger, love and war (and hopelessness). This film should be seen by any person who appreciates film and storytelling.
