Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Liv Tyler. Yes, it's hard to remember this thought beauty (which gives a brilliant picture-perfect performance), as it has simple languages. 'One Night at McCool's' is a deadly, striking black comedy with old-fashioned tones tied to his well-known but clever and chaotic story that three men behind and see for one woman. When you see Tyler, don't wonder why they are indignant and do something? It's something to see her "happy and living" dreams. Just like Tyler, there's something drunk about this feature, as we like Matt Dillon, John Goodman, Paul Reiser (who's big) and especially Michael Douglas (who plays the hired assassin with cool, but a dubious hairstyle) really a good time with their roles. The obscure plot opens with the main three characters (Dillon, Goodman and Reiser) telling their story of how they came to experience this divine presence and the ultimate consequences they have on them, leading to a bad climax. There is an unpredictable chain of events (ranging from fruity to sensual), where everything will be virtually connected to a certain ironic (snowball) tournament for the characters (who see leaving their reserved convenience zone to satisfy this girl) . Howard Black's direction is colorful zippy balancing the script's quick fire gags and frenetically fun, if complicated situations. One of the best under-radar comedies in the past decade, which will have you under Tyler's thumb.
