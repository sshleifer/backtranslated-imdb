I watch this movie without great expectations, I think everyone should do. It's a good TV show and of course we couldn't compare it with Gone With the Wind, but it's still nice to watch. It's also weird to see another Scarlett. Joanne Whalley does not play Scarlett with passion and fire like Vivien Leigh, but I believe Scarlett changed when she got older. Don't expect much of this to look, but don't look like: I think it would be terrible.
