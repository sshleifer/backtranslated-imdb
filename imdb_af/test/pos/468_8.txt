I watched the movie at the Brooklyn International Film Festival (World Premiere). <br /> <br /> A ghostly, intimate portrait of loneliness, and the effects of growing it and making it darker. <br /> <br /> The actions of the two leaders (Jessica Bohl & Richard Brundage) are excellent and make one wish you met these characters before they got so damaged. <br /> <br /> Remind me of the theme of Atom's works The Soundtrack (Tywanna Jo Baskette, Crooked Fingers) is excellent and strengthens moments in the film without paying attention to itself. <Br! Br! Br! Br! Br! Br! Br! Br! Br! Br! Br! Br /> <br /> Recommend the Film and the Soundtrack.
