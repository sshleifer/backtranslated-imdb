I think it's incredibly difficult to write any kind of full-scale review to Giorgino, simply because it is one of those viewer-dependent, complex, poetic and philosophical movies that carry carriers, if you see it, you try to enjoy it and watch it simultaneously to their core, yet there are a few things that surely and without a doubt are for any artwork (which I hope I am). The first thing: it is a certain masterpiece, even of that kind of art that lasts for a long time; The second: it is one of those rare "dark" movies in which darkness is poetic, even romantic, attractive and much more sad than depressed, such as the art of Pieter Brueghel or Caspar David Friedrich. Regarding the core of the movie, someone called it Kafkian, although I disagree, because it's actually beyond Kafka's misanthropic logic, and much more like Edgar Poe's parables: dark and scary, but most beautiful strings of our souls. Actually, on the poetic side (which is much more important than the story), Giorgino is a story of eternal peace and love that can only be achieved by the eternal childhood of soul. Those who have such souls are usually colored by our society as crazy, but from a different point of view, they all lose the virtue of all others when they are "grown": the virtues of God's love. Indeed, Giorgino is a very Christian film, "be like children" (Matt. 18: 3). It is a truly hidden tag line, though the film never deals with any kind of morale and focuses on Christian philosophy. , true God is beyond any human moral. Yet I believe that Boutonnat is too strong to portray "grown" people, as some demons who try to steal childhood have survived rare souls, but that is his point of view and he has the right to think so . While watching Giorgino not try to search for some hidden symbols (though there are some), look better at thoughts expressed by characters and their behavior, and learn from them. I also can't mention that the movie looks stunning through excellent photography, especially through the use of color filters rationally, incredibly appropriate editing, wonderful acting of all the role-players and, of course, due to the atmospheric beauty of the winter mountains reminding me of the Brueghel s "Hunters in the snow". Also interesting enough, the scene of death in the form of an old woman with sunken black rings driving a car, immediately reminded me of Pesta (Plague) of the series of sketches by Norwegian painter Theodor Kittelsen, which depicts how " a black pest is wiping out the population of a small village in the mountain valley. Is it coincidence?
