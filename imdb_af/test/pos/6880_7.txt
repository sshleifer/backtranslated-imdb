Anthony Wong plays Lok, a man whose wife is seriously ill. Poor Lok - because of her illness he has long been without sex. That is why he is being harassed by a series of scary nightmares with nurses and schoolgirls. "Erotic Nightmare" is a fun Cat III movie loaded with sleaze and voyeurism. There is also a bit of gore as the first part of the movie shows nasty murders committed by Wong character under the influence of the monk's mystical powers. The dream series are pretty erotic Of course, those who expect horrible Cat III horror will be expected in the tradition of "Diary of a Serial Killer" or "Red to Kill", but it will be disappointing, but fans of a thin exploitation competition must give this one. a tin.7 out of 10.
