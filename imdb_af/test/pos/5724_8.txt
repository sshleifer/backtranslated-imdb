Tempo Di Uccidere by Guiliano Montaldo is a bit of a strange movie, but it's good in its own way. <br /> <br /> I won't save a plot summary. Most of what I read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote it don't really understand the movie. And you should understand it at some level, even if you can't describe to yourself what it's actually about. This movie is strange in an "Once Upon a Time in America" ​​shorter way. <br /> <br /> Many Hollywood stars (whatever ...) played in lesser-known Italian productions. It is known that many actors who overtake or rise slowly first do so. Cage was not yet a real star when it was made. I'm not a fan of him. He is very good at some roles (Raising Arizona, bringing out the dead) and weak when he plays the hero. I don't really know what to think of him in this one, but he certainly doesn't give out the typical hero's main character. This film could have done without him, but the fact that he was playing could be the only reason he ever made it on DVD. <br /> <br /> The supporting role is good. None of them look fake and they act like they're really there. Solid support. <br /> <br /> I saw 3 movies by Montaldo (Marco Polo, Sacco & Vanzetti and this one) and I think he is one of the greatest directors of this time. Unfortunately no one knows him. This movie was his last in a long time (a break of 19 years). I think this movie might have failed at the office, but the way it was done, I think it was a personal project for Montaldo that he really liked. <br /> <br /> Production is great. That's always enough. The dusty army camps, the claustophobic cities and the beautiful landscape all play a major role. Everything feels really real. In some scenes you can almost feel the heat. The sound itself is nothing special, but the music by Ennio Morricone is very good. It is not a piece you will whistle when you are in the shower, but it works well. <br /> <br /> So, this movie looks, feels and sounds just right. It does not serve the lessons learned from a gold plate, but it can be the biggest difference between Hollywood and euro theater. It might be strange to give it an 8 and not recommend it to people, but that's what I do. If you are looking for action; Avoid this one! If you are looking for a well-made Apocalypse Now in a different time and setting, but with a similar journey to a state of mind (sorry if it sounds, but I don't know what to call it even more) can only enjoy this one very much.
