Identity ?? . . . . I am part of my environment and I have divorced from them and it can be clear that we have an identity and we have an identity and what is within our identity is all that ever happened to us "(Ntozake Shange qtd in "Fire in the Mirror". <br /> <br /> Pieces like Decalogue V use to intimidate me, I felt like I accepted them, as I would do. not really worth going in. I understand what Naturalism is trying to say, I experienced a tangible catharsis, and one that was in pieces, and one still alive, to which I still have to It still works in me. <br /> <br /> The film was not sympathetic, it doesn't have to say that the death penalty is an evil thing, there are certainly bad people, whether they should die , for another movie, what Decalogue shows is that there are good and beautiful people who kill others when their society and primary insist. The "science" of naturalism is what helped me appreciate Decalogue V. It's not worth going into the writing room, why I wouldn't let myself go before, but now I'm worth making art. like this to make people or to make people do. <br /> <br /> There is a method for Lazar's compromise on his. . . light. Much of that meaning only makes sense in retrospect. It shouldn't be too strange for an idea. How much respectful science is not meaningful in retrospect. I falter as I say, but Naturalism seems so much more productive and so much less nihilistic when I have the power to say to myself, 'This ruin, this process, this natural process, make me buy the system.' <br /> <br /> I don't think Naturalism paints a doomsday portrait of mankind, and tells us to give up our powder-colored wigs and go to the forest. Instead, I think it's catalogs of proofs and experiments, that we are, of course, free to ignore. We can ignore everything we want if we want to give the Naturalists more bodies to bury. <br /> <br /> For sure, despite their aesthetics, designed specifically without sympathy for their characters' probable and catastrophic fate, they are hurt by passive inactivity and authoritative snobbery. I see the great risk in the hope that the audience will understand what needs to be done with what they see. As mentioned above, there is danger in the hopeless, as their fate in the stone is immortal. There is danger in the hopeful deviation of the natural because it does not match their worldview. <br /> <br /> And I don't think the 'hopeful' need should be rich or happy. I didn't see it, but it seems that the film American Beauty proves the inadequacy of circumstances as a provider of vision or comfort. There are ascetics as well as gluttons and beggars who wonder where in themselves they are humanity, grieving because they can't find anything that separates them from their landscape. <br /> <br /> Landscapes can be portrayed powerfully and beautifully, but in reality landscapes are not accepted. They change, surely and dramatically, but only through a large set of natural law that no one really has power. But it can't change itself.
