Flatliners have all the ingredients of a good Joel Schumacher movie - intelligent, youthful characters, beautiful cinematography, a gripping story and excellent performances. It's incredibly fun, but it's done very well and resonates with a positive spiritual message despite the unpleasant prescriptions. <br /> <br /> Schumacher has a talent for mocking talented young actors and all the main five went here. things (see the cast list). Their credible performances help raise this movie well above average. Kiefer Sutherland shines in his selfish fellow student role. <br /> <br /> The cinematography really stimulates the right side of the brain, which I love Schumacher; its use of light and place creates images that stick. A disturbing nightmare atmosphere is created that makes you uneasy while watching the movie and chasing you when you go to bed. Remind me of The Lost Boys. <br /> <br /> This is a movie that takes a wonderful presentation - curious students want to find out what is after death, and follow it successfully in a terrible, gripping story of redemption. One of Schumacher's best; highly recommended.
