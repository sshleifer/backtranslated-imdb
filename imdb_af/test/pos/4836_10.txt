I only saw the movie three years ago. I was shocked at how stupid the FBI should not have been such a tragedy. It could easily have been prevented. This movie was just incredible. <br /> <br /> Now that I see it after September 11, I'm awful and can say that it was easier for most people to know. <br /> <br /> This movie is 100% where <br /> <br /> In the final scene of the movie, when the mastermind of the 1st attack by helicopter is captured and flies over the towers, he makes a spine cooling brand, It was laughing when he said it. "Next time we bring them * BOTH * down." It was actually said by Ramzi Yousef after his arrest. <br /> <br /> This movie reveals the shocking truth about how the first attacks were carried out under the FBI and NYPD. It shows how the 1st and 4th amendments are partly guilty of the attacks. <br /> <br /> I now look at this movie and know that both attacks could be prevented.
