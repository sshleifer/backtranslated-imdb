Apart from the discotheque scenes depicting the sixties (especially with everyone dancing to instrumental versions of Monkees hits), I am amazed at how well this lightweight father holds 37 years later, but it is indeed due to the turbulent performance of his Deception-based plot and the sharp interaction of the three leads. This 1969 comedy is redirected by the redoubtable stage artist Gene Saks. It's about Julian Winston, a successful Manhattan dentist and a confirmed bachelor, who pretends to be married to avoid long-term association with his young friend of a year, Toni. In response to Toni's half-hearted suicide attempt, Julian agrees to marry her, but Toni insists on meeting his wife to relieve her conscience. Fill Julian's devoted nurse Stephanie to play the woman, and the inevitable complications occur with white lies growing in large whistles leading to suspected links and disconnections. <br /> <br /> If Julian plays a relaxed Walter Matthau the deceptive dentist in his typical sardonic manner, he leaves his two female co-stars with the photo. In her big-screen debut, a pixyish 24-year-old Goldie Hawn retains her giggly "Laugh-In" persona but offers unexpected skill and depth like Toni. She and Matthau have great, unmatched chemistry in their scenes. Screen legend Ingrid Bergman, who is still seventy-five on 54, obviously has a ball that Stephanie plays, initially starchy and fast, but blooms in a liberated spirit as the story develops. I especially like how comfortable his body is to her overnight skirt. There is good supporting work by Rick Lenz as Toni's bohemian neighbor, Igor and Jack Weston, as Julian's cute actor friend Harvey. Billy Wilder's long-standing colleague, I.A.L. Diamond, offers the sparkling script and opens the story beyond its stage-based origins for Saks, which is not the most film of directors. Besides some trailers, there are no significant extras with the DVD.
