Chan-wook Park, you have to hand it over to the man. In my eyes, he is not only a brilliant director, but a brilliant director who can turn his hand to any genre and often offer something refreshing, yet ultimately satisfying. <br /> <br /> Thirst is essentially a vampire story, but one It plays fast and resolves with some of the "rules" of the subgenre. Kang-ho Song plays Father Sang-hyeon, a man who selflessly surrenders himself to a research program and then unselfish kind catches the disease they are trying to heal, die and return. Thanks to the blood he was carrying. To be the only one out of five to survive, he becomes the familiar person who knows him and all he wants is to return normally. Normally, however, this involves shooting large distances without injury, drinking blood, and severely touching the collar when sun rays come on its skin. It's not long before he lives with a fairly dysfunctional family unit that knows him in his childhood and while hiding his new strange lifestyle, he finds himself in a complex love triangle and becomes more acceptable from dark thoughts and slips. smooth slope which can lead him from man to animal to monster. <br /> <br /> Many of the genres felt Park's movie very fresh and more original to me than the right one (to use a recent example) and really impressed me with his approach to materials that was easy could feel as well behaved and rearranged as any other vampire movies we've seen over the years. It is a mixture of horror, melodrama and comedy while also including ideas such as strength of strength, power of life and death, the disadvantage of immortality, etc. Reflect. <br /> <br /> Some people complained that this genre's dazzling approach weakened the movie, but I personally found it to be a lively, entertaining and always enjoyable movie, aided by a great central performance of Song as the tortured priest and fantastic turns of a supporting cast without weak links. Many characters move through a variety of emotions and everyone does it with skill and credibility, especially the young woman (played by OK-vin Kim) who becomes the object of the priest's love, lust and love. <br /> <br /> Fans of Asian theater (and especially Park) and also fans of Poe's "The Tell-Heart Heart" (watch and learn) should upload it, it's another classic movie of a man everything in his struggle always seems to drive nothing but solid entertainment. <br /> <br /> See it if you like: Cronos, Near Dark, Dellamorte Dellamore AKA Cemetery Man.
