While the camera work was definitely "funky" - perhaps one Dutch role short of "stoned" - the performance of the movie was fantastic. It really took a sly satirical (in the true tradition of Hal Hartley), looking at God, Jesus and Devil. The interaction of Jesus and Satan offers some hilarious scenes. Even the monologues of Jesus were wonderful - it was by far the best Jesus I ever saw. So relaxed, Zen-like, Son-of-God-ish, but still such a good guy. On one level, this is a very common view of the paradoxes of Christianity, yet there is another personal level where you can speak to Jesus Christ without having a God Complex (asx to Martin Donovan and Hal Hartley). have.
