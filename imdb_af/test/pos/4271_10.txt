I saw this movie on a small screen. Although it had a low budget, the creative direction and intelligence of the film helped to make it a small jewel of a movie. It is April 8, 1994, each of the characters in their middle 20's and striving for a kind of artistic ambition (acting, music, film, writing) when learning about the suicide of Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain. They quickly get inspiration to travel from San Francisco to Seattle and attend the Cobain Watch. It's where the movie really picks up and serves a series of funny and emotional scenes. Highlights include: a visit to Jimi Hendirx's tomb, Kurt Cobain's original orphanage and a campfire. An honest original work piece.
