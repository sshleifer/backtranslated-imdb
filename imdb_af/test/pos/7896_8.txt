Rich businessman Bill Compton (played by Dennis Patrick) kills his daughter's hippie boyfriend by accident. Panic-stricken, he goes back to a bar, and meets Joe Curran (played by Peter Boyle): a loud mouth, angry, rogue who is bitter about how his beloved land has become. Incessantly, Bill allowed Joe to find out he had just killed a hippie. And that's just the beginning. "Joe" is a classic movie of an unlikely friendship. A tie between two men, one of a white-collar background, the other of a blue-haired background. Bill & Joe have one thing in common, they are ashamed of how crazy the world has become. Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle both gave very realistic portrayals of their characters. Director John G. Avidsen with this "pre-rocky" effort, leads this low-budget jewel with the same finesse as a $ 100 million budget movie. The writing is loaded with excellent character development and a very funny, realistic dialogue. Despite its strengths, this film has its weaknesses. The writing goes about 3/4 of the way, but it wakes up just in time for the shrinking climax. This film also features a very early and uninspiring performance by a 24-year-old Susan Sarandon, as Bill's daughter Melissa, along with her hippie friend Frank, is highly praised by Patrick Mc Dermott. One can only be grateful that he was killed early in the film. Despite its few flaws, it is one of the forgotten movies of the 70's that shouldn't be. Although "Joe" is very dated to today's standards, the chemistry between Dennis Patrick and Peter Boyle is quite relevant today, and that's the glue that holds the whole movie together.
