After just coming from my third show of The Curse Of The Were-Rabbit, I decided to jump on IMDb and see what others thought. I noticed that many Brits loved it, while those in America just didn't get it. It doesn't really come as a shock, as America doesn't get "English". <br /> <br /> Wallace and Gromit are very English. Middle class English, in fact, with a hint of eccentricity throws in for a good measure. The film is much like our two heroes; simple and modest. It has a nice and soft plot so that the children are not lost, but there is enough beef there to make the adults too tired. There is a light innuendo (which seems to have offended the gospel - oh no, drama!), But there's nothing more rude than a bottom for a short moment. If people are offended by a plastic anus, you know the world's mess ... <br /> <br /> One quick note to those (all Americans so far I've seen) that think Chicken Run is " A Better Film: Chicken Run was made to darken your sense of humor, and I think it suffered as a result. The curse of the Were King is greasy, English and intelligent. Thomas The Tank Engine's film was ruined because it was made to please the Americans and I'm glad Nick Park didn't make it happen to another British British institution. <br /> <br /> Summary: You can keep your Chicken Runs, your Shreks, your Madagascas - that kind of rough, scratchy, slapstick comedy doesn't compare with the white and grace that Wallace and Gromit in the curse of the Were-Rabbit is not. English in the core, and long ago Wallace and Gromit can stay so.
