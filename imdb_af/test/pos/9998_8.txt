I was extremely impressed with this movie. This is one of the best sports movies I've ever seen. The footage in this movie is outstanding. I like the rows in which the camera watches the ball as it flies through the air or in the cup. The film moves well and offers both excitement and drama. The cinematography was fantastic. <br /> <br /> The appearances are wonderful. I was surprised by young Shia LaBeouf. He plays well in this role. Stephen Dillane is also good as Harry Vardon. Peter Firth, Justin Ashforth, and Elias Koteas support. The movie is tempting and entertaining and for the first time in my life I have chosen a golf tournament.
