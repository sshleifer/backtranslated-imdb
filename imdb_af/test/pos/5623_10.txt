Let's see it, many of the bad movies are made throughout. For those working in film, you probably have spent a lot of time and effort in many of this plot. Sometimes, and this is my opinion, it is the act of merely making the film that is important to us. To tell a story (no matter how simple and unrealistic it is). The joint process is also one of the most important features unique to film and theater. Creating a production of any caliber requires the talents of a varying amount of people, depending on the scale, to bring its story to life. However, the most intriguing part of the American film is not the film being filmed. It is the filmmaker himself, as a character of his own life, who demands our attention. None of them serve as models of the filmmakers we know and have worked on. But, I would argue, these are archetypes of small parts of us that try to be part of this cult activity of independent films. (Alright a very small part of us). These are the people who have been stabbed under their own lives and are likewise bound by the romance of the theater. This leads me to my next argument. American Movie captures the raw spirit of independent film-making. Bad stories tell (today) digital movie with messy effects and horrible actions - because it's the best they can do with a few thousand dollars of budget, rather than a studio budget of a few million dollars a day. This is the difference between low low LOW end productions and studio productions. The independent movie maker just wants to create a linear or even non-linear story to shoot as well as he can with the money he invests in himself and the resources to see him a final product on his TV. Robust individualism materializes in every art form. I find this movie a brilliant document of truth for many filmmakers. And no, I'm not full of myself. Man, these people are hilarious. Their problems seem hilarious, their features are hilarious. Best line of the movie: "It's good! ... That's good! ... There's something to live! ... Jesus told me!" Say a million times through a funny old man. Hat is down to Tom Beach. Chicago Rules.
