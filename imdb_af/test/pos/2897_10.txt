This DVD will be treated indifferently by mllions of classic rock musicians around the world because Rush just isn't cool. It is a pity that Rush had to overcome most of the North American and British music journalists over the 30-year history of North American and British music journalists, given many people the opportunity to get into a real bond. Each of the past four decades is well represented here and what a catalog of songs it is! We played the original "2112", the magical "The Trees" and the lyrical "Tom Sawyer" with the high-energy genre-challenging pieces from their latest album "Vapor Trails." The musical play is almost flawless, the stage show is spectacular and the Brazilian fans are just crazy (at one point they sing along with an instrumental instrument!) Every band member plays on a level that is convinced of true workers performing art . If you doubt it tries the instrumental "La Villa Strangiato" or "The Rhythm Method" for size - and yes the last is a tromsolo (which should be seen as believed) <br /> <br /> Sound and vision production Values ​​are very high like the Rush experience, and you also get a documentary and polygonal set to start. <br /> <br /> It is an amazing show and tribute to Canadian rockers and all serious classic rock fans must own a copy.
