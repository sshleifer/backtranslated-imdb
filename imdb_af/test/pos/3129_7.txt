Although I like these Westerns, I have to say that this is not one of my favorite John Ford Westerns. For me, it's just a certain thing that most of its other movies (the one I have ever seen) owns. Nothing sure what it is. It's not something tangible. The essence of the story is about a Mormon wagon train used by a group of outsiders as a refuge from a sequel. Ford used many of his tribal money here. There are some interesting characters, beautiful scenery, some action, and excitement. All this adds to a viewable experience. It's certainly not boring. Just not quite the usual John Ford standard. For me, Wagon Master is a 7/10
