It's a pity that this movie is PG 13. It's really suitable for anyone. Although young children may not be able to follow it properly. <br /> <br /> It belongs to that wonderful genre of serio-comic ghost / angel stories that should include everything from Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life" to Wenders's "Wings of Desire." <br /> <br /> Photography is amazing, the acting first rate, and - wonder of wonders - the tone is exciting. <br /> <br /> My only criticism is that there is not much ambiguity in the film. The two interwoven stories look intriguingly mysterious; but they leave themselves a little too beautiful for my taste. As the director points out in his commentary on the DVD, all the ingredients of Irwin's story are on his bedside table. The symbolism is just a little thing for me. <br /> <br /> But what a lion! My favorite scene should be when the resettlement team tries to get breakfast at dinner. It is virtually theatrical in its magic - a tour of the power of witty acting - subtle, playful and positive rhythmic - coupled with striking cinematography and a keen eye for grotesque. <br /> <br /> "Northfork" is funny, touching, beautiful to look at, magic (with the above discussions) and doesn't have a single car hunt. <br /> <br /> An easy nine star.
