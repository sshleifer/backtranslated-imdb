Ben (a good Charles Bateman), his young daughter K.T. (a cute Geri Reischl), and his new friend Nicky (the extremely handsome Ahna Capri) is heading for a birthday party for K.T. They are unexpectedly touching in a remote southern town where no one can leave, and with the exception of Ben, K.T. and Nicky, no one can come in either. In addition, children and adults disappear at a worrying pace. Ben helps some of the locals - Sheriff Pete (LQ Jones), Tobey (Alvy Moore) and Jack (Charles Robinson), the local priest - try to solve the puzzle. <br /> <br /> This early 70's devil-themed horror movie actually predicts the "Exorcist", combining a "Bad Day at Black Rock" type plot of a rural village with a large skeleton in its closet with horror elements for interesting results. It actually sent some cold fever on my spine, as it moved relentlessly along its ominous path. The moody and solemn atmosphere is quickly established and lasting for the duration; the ever-growing sense of panic gives it a real kick. Some memorable pieces include the bizarre opening of a real-life toy tank and an airplane, and Nickys's drained nightmare, which is realized by director Bernard McEveety and crew. The music of Jaime Mendoza-Navas is subtly sinister and gives it the extra sense of honesty. <br /> <br /> The steadfast and professional role player does fine work, especially the eternal English dr. Duncan and the manufacturers. / Actors LQ Jones and Alvy Moore. <br /> <br /> Just the fact that the whole plot is right under the noses of our heroes makes it much more frightening. Jack the priest starts leading them in the right direction, but will they be on time to stop things? It's a pleasant little visit worth visiting again; Just talking to myself, I could appreciate it much more after giving it a second chance. I can now say that yes, it is indeed underestimated, telling a good story in an interesting, unconventional and effective way. <br /> <br /> 8/10
