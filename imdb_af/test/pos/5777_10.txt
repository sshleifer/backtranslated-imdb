This film broke a lot of ground and generally has a lot less credit than it owes. It touches on a topic that is always present in our daily lives, but is seen as a phenomenon so common that it does not deserve any discussion. This phenomenon is that of caregivers (or their doctors or, as in "Broken Promise", a senior social worker) who abuses their position to damage those they have been protected. <br /> <br /> Broken Promise, Patty Clawson and her family leave their parents; but will soon be picked up by local law enforcement. Faced with foster care, Patty asks a young social worker to hold her and her brothers and sisters together. This social worker approaches a senior member of another department, but his request is refused. <br /> <br /> The children are divorced to separate homes, consequently follow the prevailing views of the day and ensure a "clean break". But this is the event, the "broken promise" that gives the film its name, which causes the dramatic tension that will continue throughout the film. Designated by the young social worker's apparent betrayal, Patty Clawson walks away from the foster home she was sent to. <br /> <br /> Faced with the frightening task of finding her family in a climate where the ideal is seen as a complete separation of the past; she does the only thing she can to determine where they live, and breaks into the Senior Social Worker's office to steal the case study. <br /> <br /> Shortly after being found, she made a dangerous enemy. Outraged by the embarrassment this little girl has caused him and his department, the Senior Social Worker decides to use his power and authority to destroy her; something legally he is quite capable of doing. <br /> <br /> --------------- <br /> <br /> This topic, from the care of caregivers to clients, is relatively taboo. It's been touched on very little in movies, as few directors want to enter the path that would cause caregivers to cause harm. <br /> <br /> I think this movie plays a very important role to make the public more aware of this kind of thing. The idea being portrayed is not only likely, but has probably happened many times before to many other children around the world. This film is critical to changing public opinion in order to protect the laws that protect harmful people such as the Senior Social Worker in "Broken Promise". <br /> <br /> I strongly recommend Broken Promise. It is especially suitable for pupils to see social workers, psychiatrists, psychologists, doctors and other careers. This is a lesson in avoidance that must be taken to heart. <br /> <br /> ----------- <br /> <br /> In terms of the play in "Broken Promise." Melissa Michaelsen plays a beautiful part like Patty Clawson. Especially in movies like this credibility is critical. If the viewer does not identify with the character of Patty, the whole message of the movie will be in danger. It is a pity that Melissa does not yet play in movies today, as her performance in "Broken Promise" shows that he had exceptional talent.
