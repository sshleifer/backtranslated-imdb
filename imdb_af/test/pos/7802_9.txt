It will soon be 10 years since this movie was released .... still make me laugh. If you enjoy this movie, try the new Hera Pheri .... t'is hilarious. And my favorite piece of the movie should be when Salman realizes that he has no dots in his gun, while he has the upper hand and everyone has the point. And he says it out loud !!! You just want to bash him ... but you know you can only do that if you stop laughing! Fantastic movie .... 10/10
