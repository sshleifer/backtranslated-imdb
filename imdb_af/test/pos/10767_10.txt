At the 2006 Woodstock Film Festival I attended a show of "Fierce People". I hesitate to call it a "premiere" of any kind, as it was shot in the spring of 2004 and in 2005 had its world premiere at Tribeca. It played several festivals that year. Release appeared imminent, and it disappeared. Flash. Disappeared. Or so it appeared to the film. Rumors of a theater or DVD edition have jumped from time to time, but everyone was found to be unfounded. Then this show was announced. Maybe one could call it a "re-premiere"? It certainly felt like I was witnessing a buried treasure. And what a treasure it was. <br /> <br /> I suppose one can characterize "Fiery People" as a drama. But it also has elements of comedy and tragedy, as well as mystery. And threw a bit of the farce. In short, real life. This makes it difficult to pigeonhole, which puts it more into the category of an indie instead of a Hollywood movie. But its high production values, big budget feelings, and star caliber cast seem to contradict the indie label. So let's call it a hybrid. And maybe that's why it's "lost." This denies categorization. <br /> <br /> Meet Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin), 15, whose father is absent. In fact, Finn never knew him. But he saw him and heard him through the collection of home movies sent from South America. Dad is a well-known anthropologist and has made a name for himself by establishing a shop with the Yanomani, the tribe of "Fiery People", which lives to kill and continue well. All their activities are built around the two "tasks", and Finn is captivated by it. Mom Liz (Diane Lane) is also somewhat absent. Although physically present, she is lost in a world of cocaine and alcohol. That's how Finn becomes an adult in his small world with his films. <br /> <br /> One summer, Ma decides to go with her in the New Jersey wildlife. A massage therapist, mum provided a wealthy client, Ogden C. Osborne (Donald Sutherland, in a tour performance). He invited her for an extensive house call in his beautiful estate. Osborne's "tribe" includes a variety of eccentric rich children, servants and village idiots among whom Finn finds himself in his own anthropological study. Will his experience with Dad's movies help him survive as a visitor to this tribe? Will he be accepted? Or will he be seen as an outsider, struggling simultaneously with his own identity as an adolescent? It's the fairy tale, and I think it would be if it wasn't for the dark bubble, which injected director Griffin Dunne and author Dirk Wittenborn into this wonderful story. <br /> <br /> With Anton Yelchin's voice over, Finn must learn to go back to the teenager he never really had a chance to be, to stop being the parent for his mother , let new-fashioned mom be his parent and learn responsibility on the road to maturity as it has long been. Yet, he must make this transformation into a dangerous, dark world where fire plays, foolishness for this broken family. <br /> <br /> It's first and foremost a story-driven movie and Griffin Dunne put so much emphasis on the intro for the movie. He bought the rights to Wittenborn's novel, even as it was written, and Wittenborn's own screenplay comes to life in the hands of the masterly Dunne in a way that is a miracle. <br /> <br /> It's also mostly a character-driven movie, and Sutherland has never been better. His star turns as Osborne around me and will be astonished. Diane Lane's character ultimately shows so many personalities that it is difficult to think that another actor has subtracted it so well. She is awesome. But more than anything, "Fierce People" is Anton Yelchin's movie. He has long resumed as a child actor, but precious little like a teenager. Besides the well-known House of D (also a gem), he is best known as Byrd on the TV's "Huff." In January he will be seen in "Alpha Dog" (also on the shelf since 2004, a movie I saw at Sundance this year and in which he is the "heart and soul"). His performance here goes far beyond what is expected of someone so young, and it is nothing short of spectacular. <br /> <br /> This complex, impressive film has been long enough. "Firemen" is a treasure filled with light and shadow, comedy and tragedy, joy and pathos, but mostly wonder.
