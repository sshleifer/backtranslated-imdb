Although some unrealistic things are coming to an end (that is, a cop who shoots a gun in a busy, cheerful round where any innocent could be killed), it was another intense, enjoyable thriller, one of Alfred Hitchcock's better films. Robert Walker is excellent as the cold nutshell, really convincing and gives a fascinating display that is sometimes almost creepy. His fellow star, Farley Granger, is good, but is not a game for Walker, either in acting or in the characters they play. This is the typical Hitchcock movie with some strange camera angles, immoral themes, innocent man in trouble, etc. Unlike many of his other films, I thought it was a quick story with a few dull spots. I was a former tennis player and enjoyed his footage from some great old online games that had some good events. Hitchcock's real daughter, Patricia, has an interesting and unique little character role here. She didn't just get the job because of her father; she can act. Also note: the DVD has both British and American versions and there were some differences in the story. It's a classic movie still referred to in modern movies, even comedies like "Gooi Momma Off The Train."
