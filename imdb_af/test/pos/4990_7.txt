"Comanche Moon" has gone all over it. For starters, Simon Wincer's back, a man whose name is synonymous with high quality TV westerns. Unfortunately, the problems with the "Moon" are something, even the most talented director can't solve: A weak script based on a thin novel. <br /> <br /> Forget about historical accuracy - as any novice reader can tell you, the biggest transvest in Moon, is that it doesn't even match the original "Lonesome Dove" masterpiece. So many wonderful, rich moments in the miniseries and, to a greater extent, the book, are completely lacking in the "Moon". Since most "Moon" viewers are likely to come with at least one "Dove" background, the lack of character-driven and emotional backgrounds is not painful. <br /> <br /> It is said, "Moon" is one case where the customized version could and should have been modified to make it more suitable for the screen. For example, the novel "Moon" focuses mainly on the Comanches themselves. In spite of this, the miniseries try to serve the Comanches, but in the end it only gives them enough that the viewer only gets meaning, they miss an important part of the story. Similarly, Val Kilmer's Scull also lost here - the role had to be either expanded so that Kilmer (and Rachel Griffiths, for the case) actually had something to do, or the roles just had to be reduced to smaller supporting parts. Instead, Kilmer gets the best bill for a character who just scrapes you to his appearance in the completely bizarre final act. <br /> <br /> There are strange moments throughout the film that just don't make sense to those who haven't read the book (a killer parrot? what?) - further, there's not a single scene we don't see that call and McCrae is anything near the amazing Texas rangers they claim to be. None of their expeditions in the Moon (or "Dead Man's Walk") are successful, and Call and McCrae just make their way through an infinite mission to another. <br /> <br /> Honestly, Larry McMurtry never had to get the job done to write the script, and just did it because of that other cowboy movie, Brokeback Mountain. McMurtry can write good novels (although there is some disagreement over the consistency of that statement), but he never wrote him as a writer. This production would have benefited not only to bring director Wincer back, but the original screenwriter Bill Wittcliff to adapt the novel. Witcliff does not have exactly a mountain load of material for his writing writing credit, but no one can deny that he did a fantastic job of hitting the original "Lonesome Dove". All this said, "Comanche Moon" is almost a brilliant production, backed by a tremendous role that unfortunately is not enough to do. Steve Zahn's portrayal of Gus McCrae - or rather his portrayal of Robert Duvall as Gus McCrae - is dead. And while some have criticized Karl Urban as Woodrow Call and said that his performance does not mimic the silent, stoic Woodrow of the original movie, all I can say is McMurtry, because McMurtry is one in both "Moon" novel and now the miniseries - Woodrow has a socially unclear, uncomfortable but natural leader, in an emotional character whose lines are just boring and whose character motivation is only evident when you have seen them, much better portrayed in the future. "<br /> <br /> However, it is the role that shines in the" Moon ", to the extent that I left the miniseries with the same feeling of melancholy, I felt like watching the original" Lonesome Dove " - This time because I realized it was probably the last time we saw these characters on the screen for a long, long time to come - and frankly, this site could have done so well in a well-groomed, full-featured network TV Series <br /> <br /> Overall, apart from wasted opportunities with the cast, the bi-disturbed travesty is that the original Lonesome Dove novel contains so much rich background for the characters that would be fascinating, quite fascinating, to seen on the screen, unfortunately, everything set aside in favor of McMurtry's boring, inconsistent and ultimately irrelevant prequel.
