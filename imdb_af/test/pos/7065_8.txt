I can hardly call it a wonderful movie, but it is entertaining. In my case I was when the movie was released, the same age as some of the junior campers in the movie. Looking at me this movie brings back the memories of my campers. While some of the pranks taking place in this movie, such as carrying out the camp director in his bed and leaving him on a road, in the trees or on a lake, are a little over the other pranks is not. When I camped the campers and advisers took similar stunts, such as flagpole lingerie, canoeing and boys catching the girls' cabin. When I got older, I realized that these nightmares for the girls cabin I participated in were carefully orchestrated by the counselors so we couldn't find the girls embarrassing, but at the time I thought it was real and it was fun . This is what MIRROR (MB) is. <br /> <br /> MB not only captures the scenic beauty of camp environment, but the beauty of young and careless. MB gives a good example of pre-teens, teens and young adults who live their summer without having to worry about other guys who join girls and girls with guys and cottages that have as much fun as they can before returning to school then go to junior high & high school and college. The opening song that goes "Are you ready for summer? ... no more homework no longer books, no more teachers look dirty ..." describes exactly how summer school kids are seen. <br /> <br /> I personally enjoyed the two campers Spaz and Fink. Which boy, nerd or jock, didn't spend the whole camp trying to make a beautiful girl camper? Which guy didn't want to be accepted by the other campers and counselors? While these two characters are a bit at the top, I testify to everyone who sees the movie, can't keep these two guys. These two characters are a mix of Charlie Brown of PEANUTS and Jack Tripper & Larry Dallas of THREE'S COMPANY. I would bet that most viewers even encourage Spaz in the egg-bearing competition and Fink as he tries to "knock" the stomach in the hot-kiss dining competition. <br /> <br /> Lastly, this movie had regular children and counselors. No supermodels for counselors or campers wearing trendy clothes. It is nice to just kick back and watch this movie and remember when life was as nice as this movie.
