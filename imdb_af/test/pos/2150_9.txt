This tricky picture played at the Mods & Rockers 2007 festival. It's a wonderful and loving look at Harry Nilsson, with many well-known faces for interviews, rarely seen TV shows and behind the scenes of Nilsson at work. There are even a few shots of "Son Of Dracula". This movie is the final and bestowed tribute to one of the best voices, the smartest songwriter and the funniest man in popular music. It is a crime that this man's name is not as well known as some of the songs he wrote and / or performed. His friends tell incredibly funny stories about this talented hunk with a subconscious wish for self-destruction. As a bonus you even get Eric Idle performing the song, with Nilsson's final album written during the final credits. It's funny, it's sad. It is not in general release. If this photo plays everywhere you live, see it!
