One of master director Alfred Hitchcock's finer films, this is the story of an American and his family (James Stewart, Doris Day, and their young son) who are vacationing in North Africa. Stewart is a doctor and Day is a world-renowned singer. They meet a Frenchman who speaks the mother tongue and helps them out on an incident on a local bus. Later, the Frenchman whispered something in Stewart's ear after being attacked and killed. The rest of the movie is a puzzle because Stewart tries to save them and solve the puzzle. The film is secretly and strangely from the exotic country to the strange events. You never really know what happens in this movie, why people appear to the end and even then you are not sure. The final scene takes place in Albert Hall and is one of the best-known in 12-minute films without dialogue. Hitchcock originally made this film in 1934.
