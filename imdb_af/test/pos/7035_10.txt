This timeless summer love story is a classic and will never be dated. I can't even count how many times I've seen Dirty Dancing. It's a movie that I can probably see and still love every few weeks. <br /> <br /> There is something timeless about this movie. I loved other lovers of love story movies like Pretty Woman and then met Harry Sally. I think they are there, but there's something about Dirty Dancing that just makes it perfect. The characters, the chemistry between Swaze and Gray, the film's direction, the INCREDIBLE dance, the hot summer atmosphere, everything about dirty dance is absolutely perfect. It's an instant classic and I've never seen a movie like it before or since. <br /> <br /> I don't think there is one particular element that makes this movie so loved, but many things, many of which are mentioned by many reviewers. Dirty Dancing has a nostalgic, clumsy, summery mood, realistic characters, a trustworthy honest message, along with incredible music and dance, and one of the best dance series movies we've ever given. <br /> <br /> This movie is always on TV and I will continue to watch it as long as they show it. But I will mention that I have no interest in seeing "Havana Nights", this one had left them alone.
