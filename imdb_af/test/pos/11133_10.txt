'Fame' (1980) is brilliant. It has all these features that made the late 70's movies so great. It prides itself on its directness and is not ashamed to be over the top. <br /> <br /> What is really important here is the trip, not the destination. Unwanted soap operative idiots will never realize that 'Fame' deals with the struggle, anxiety and triumph of these young people, not their careers. Ironically, none of the talented actors of 'Fame' made it in Hollywood. 'Fame' marked the end of an era. End of artistic freedom and experimentation and the beginning of commercialization and political correctness. This is the last statement of a generation who had their own voice. <br /> <br /> 10/10
