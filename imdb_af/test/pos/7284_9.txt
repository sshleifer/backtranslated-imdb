Sometimes, if you're looking for a movie, nothing but a good thriller will go. Dead Line definitely fits the bill. <br /> <br /> A little warning though: if you're going to watch this movie, you're better off not knowing too much detail about the plot. <br /> <br /> The plot thickens when the movie passes. A very remarkably well-constructed tension mounts. <br /> <br /> It's deep and terrible. It goes all the way to the darkest places in human mind. <br /> <br /> The plot also has very surprising shifts. <br /> <br /> Just wait until the evening, turn off the light and watch this movie.
