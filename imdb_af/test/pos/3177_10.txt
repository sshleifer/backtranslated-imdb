"The Honkers" is probably Slim Pickens' best performance of all time. When we shot, everyone related to the production went out that Slim was the Oscar award material. Unfortunately, United Artists at the same time had a James Bond photo released and didn't pay much attention to "The Honkers". Personally, I feel that this film is among the most critics. Sam Peckinpaw's "Junior Bonner" was at the same time and impressed the critics more than our movie. Also, Cliff Robertson had a rodeo movie a few months before our release and it can also hurt us. The picture is worth watching, if only for the rodeo recordings - the best ever shot by James Crabbe. The director and my co-author, Steve Ianat, died a few weeks after the release of the photos, cut a promising career and behind his lovely wife, Sally, his daughter, Gaby, and the newborn son, Stefan. Please give this movie a shot. I bet you will say it was worth it. I thank everyone who took the time to read it. Stephen Lodge
