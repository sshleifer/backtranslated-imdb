It's the hardest movie I've ever seen ... the emotional content is terrible, but unforgettable. A woman accused of being a political activist is being questioned. The whole movie revolves around her questioning. Alan Rickman and Madeline Stowe have intense and powerful roles for which they deserve Oscars for their performances.
