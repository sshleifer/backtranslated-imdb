People watch a variety of different reasons for movies. This movie does not have the big budget, there are no special effects, no motor yachts and no explosions. Actually, reality doesn't have much of it either. At least not in my life. <br /> <br /> It's a very real movie about many real people. None of them is perfect in any way, but together they are put in a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and which in turn makes order from chaos. I am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology, as I am not an expert or the full extent of my own brain. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie for the characters. It's full of a whole company of wonderful, impressive people. <br /> <br /> Within the first three minutes, Kiefer Sutherland determines the detective Michael Hayden's life wonderfully and develops the character throughout the film. Excellent acting, very credible. <br /> <br /> Henry Czerny couldn't be thrown better and the report between his "Harvey" and Kiefer's "Mickey" increased the inconsistency of their characters. <br /> <br /> I thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady. , Mrs Ramsay, I'm sure she and my mother-in-law are good friends! <br /> <br /> There is a host more of these wonderful characters, but space is limited here, so watch the movie and enjoy it.
