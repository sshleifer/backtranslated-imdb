This movie is probably the best new French movie I've seen so far in this century. There are some wonderful ones, including Noe's Irreversible, Green's Le Pont des Arts and Hadzihalilovic's Innocence, but none of them come close to the timeless glory of Les Amants Reguliers. <br /> <br /> The movie is a description of the events of May 68. and that followed in the wake of it and further it is and update of, and a tribute to, the Nouvelle Vague movies of those days. Regarding the portrayal of the riots in Paris, the film is meticulously accurate (I'm just 19 and I wasn't there myself, but you know what I mean) and the almost real-time and very long caller numbers make the stage perfect for the aftermath of the events in the streets of Paris. The riots are not glorified or beautifully photographed such as those in Bertolucci's The Dreamers (where the film is in many ways comparable) instead they are filmed in grim black and white shots courtesy of the excellent William Lubtchansky. The love story that is the film's biggest concern after the riots in 68 is filmed in beautiful and much less faded shots and manages the true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically worried and seemingly cold environment. <Br /> <br /> This film is a beautiful love story and it shines through the director's desire to portray his own experiences of the mythical late-60s that make the movie compelling. But the film is also a tribute to the entire Nouvelle Vague canon. Much of the dialogue calls for early Truffaut, and the length and non-action and plot remind less structure of Eustache or Rivette. There are even Godard-like verfremdung effects with those who look directly into the camera and even address Bernardo Bertolucci directly. This film is undoubtedly a reply song for Bertolucci's The Dreamers and it is also a Nouvelle Vague tribute, but it still stands out as a beautiful and radiant love story. Bottom line: This movie is incredible and if you love the French cinema, don't sleep there. It could be the best French movie ever since Eustache's La Mamain et la Putain.
