As many reviews have seen, there is a strong dark line to this movie. The director who reminds me the most is John Landis (yes, continue and cry about how a farmer I am). Arcand has the gift of exploring impeccable things in a dark, gray way and then exploring the horrors of life with a sad touch. <br /> <br /> The role-play is, without exception, above average. Thomas Gibson, like David, is outstanding as the moody and self-deceiving center around who turns the rest of the characters. He speaks a good nihilist, but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to admit. Gibson was already a strong and subtle actor in 1993. It was hard to look at him and see Greg Montgomery, let alone Agent Hotchner or Criminal Minds. Perhaps not the best scene, but the one I enjoy Most, my "rewind scene", is the part where Candy expects a visitor, and one uninvited person after another appears at the door. As Candy's interpersonal environment swings further and more out of control, David only grows bouncier, perkier and more enthusiastic, like a good-looking Gen-X "Tigger."
