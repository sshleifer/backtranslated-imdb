When this movie is noticed, the discussion usually begins with the wonderful collection of cars and towing tones. This is often overlooked as the eclectic characters populating the film around the three central characters. <br /> <br /> One character It's striking that Rebel is played by the great veteran, Australian actor Max Cullen. Rebel is a blind sleeper who runs the heroes and his group almost in the middle of the night because he doesn't use headlights. <br /> <br /> In the back story, we discover that Rebel master builder of street racing cars, and he and his wife look closed in a 1950's time release. Rebel continues to play a small but key role in teaching Mike, played by Terry Serio, the almost spiritual truth about street forces. It's not speed, reaction times that make a good racer. This is the one that makes the car feel the best. <br /> <br /> This is the best example if Rebel explains to Mike after a test drive. "You already have the grief, just miss the style." <Br /> <br /> Graham Bond is another well-credited actor who lends his talents to a keen police officer looking for some of the financial action generated by the street racing. The confrontation between Bond and Fox played by Richard Moir adds tension to the story. Bond not only expects results but also Fox to make a race. <br /> <br /> For most of the movies, Fox shows a truly manipulative and malicious side, but in the climax he offers a word of honor that has been in an extremely tense and memorable end for the last few minutes. It is almost as if the film is again focusing on its true intention to show us the culture of street races rather than the daily activities of people. <br /> <br /> One of the main complaints about the movie is the writing. Although it's not exciting, I believe the complete lack of chemistry between Mikes's friend, played by Deborah Conway and his mechanic Vangelis Mourikis, has more to do with the problem. Any scene in which these two interacted had to be cut. <br /> <br /> Finally, according to the actors, a truly striking performance is provided by Kristoffer Greaves, who plays a deaf and cripple member of Fox's inner circle. His back story is never explored, is he injured in a race so born, what is Fox's worth to keep him? <br /> <br /> The reality of the movie is simple, it's about street racing, and the culture behind it. When the cars fly and action ranges are in motion, it's the only time director John Clark and his writer Barry Tomblin feel very comfortable with what they do. <br /> <br /> So if you are looking for a deep exploration of human relationships, moments of life that define drama, then this movie is not for you. If your pulse races throw away at the thought of a 57 Chev or the iconic GTO Phase 3 on the streets of Sydney, you won't find much better than this movie.
