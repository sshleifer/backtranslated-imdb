I did a lot of international travel, both on business and as a tourist. For both types I assure you the best advice is also the oldest: Always drink the wine of the country. In this movie, Archangel Michael comes to Earth on business, folds it up quickly and decides to hang around for a little tour. Boy! Can he drink the wine of the country? <br /> <br /> One can always be drunk with drink, love and fighting. <br /> <br /> He'll love the morning and love the nights. <br /> <br /> These are things you can't do in Heaven so he enjoys them while he's here! Of course, it seems that he has had some other jobs to tackle and if he is less direct about them than he was first, he is just as successful. The final scene is a bit schmaltzy, but it's also wonderful. Jean Stapleton gets to dance with John Travolta.
