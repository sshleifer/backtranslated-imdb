A milestone in film history, 'Bronenosets Potyomkin', is one of the handful of great movies out there that deserves a classic name. This was the picture that Sergei M. Eisenstein made at the time a copy of films. And today it is still remembered as the wonderful piece of cinema it has always been. <br /> <br /> 'Potjoekoek' is a movie that is needed to be seen as one entity, which should not be selected. Don't just watch the clip show where they just offer the 'Odessa Steps' sequence and then go to 'Citizen Kane' or 'The Godfather', see it all in its glorious 75-minute run to really understand it And enjoy. . Don't expect every infinitesimal detail to be perfect. I think the play of the '20s quiet era' 'Scooby Doo' looks like a master of underestimated realism, some plot points may seem illogical and some of the battle sequence looks dated, but it's still a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> The most memorable moments in the film are the mutiny on the battleship, Vakulinchuk's body falling off the ship, the sailor under the tent at the end of the pier, the mother who killed her keep the baby cars on the Odessa steps and the lion shaking, while further bloodshed. For every new pair of eyes watching, the Battleship Potemkin comes alive again.
