It's the biggest movie I've ever seen. Davey / Mr. Slaves are simultaneous: <br /> <br /> 1) Torture over his talents (eg "I can control it, I can! I don't have to do it!). Fairyeeeeeeel's good!"; <br /> <br /> 2) Desperate to make friends, e.g. <br /> <br /> "How's the soup? <br /> <br />" The soup is very good. "<br />" Would you like to have crackers with your soup? "<br /> <br />" I'd like more crackers. "<br /> <br />" How are you? "<br /> <br />" Yes, the soup is very good. "<br /> <br /> 3) Pride of its achievements (eg" Pretty neat trick, huh? ") <br /> < 4) A ladies man (eg "You are so beautiful. Why don't you like me?"); and <br /> <br /> 5) Sometimes, very, very angry (eg "You can't get away! ") <br /> <br /> Connors had to receive an academic award for the best actor for this movie. I mean, who was possibly better?! Tanya Roberts went to the stratosphere following This show in TT is a wonder not all, the stars of this masterpiece did not have a brilliant career, I strongly recommend it to film! It is available on amazon.com and everyone should own it. a night of it and keep a bowl of soup while you watch.
