I only saw the movie in the 40's in the theater when I was a child and always remember the end. There is nothing like the first impression, but some movies are always a treat every time they are watched. Something just resonates with them. This is one of those movies and I agree with another reviewer who said that Fritz Lang had to go more Western. To add to this, I always loved Randolph Scott and Robert Young. In fact, Robert Young in what I consider my favorite movie to be just one is not an easy thing to do. That movie is Northwest Passage. This led me to the wonderful historical novels of Kenneth Roberts. Western Union also led me to read Zane Gray's novel, which in this case was one of those rare cases where I liked the movie better than the novel. Not that Gray's novel is a bad one; I just love the movie story better. The film doesn't look like the novel in any way. It's a very different story, one of the biggest deviations from a book I've seen. <br /> <br /> I can't add much to the other reviews, except to say I agree with many of them. I also wish it would be released on DVD. "What happened to Randolph Scott happened to me the best."
