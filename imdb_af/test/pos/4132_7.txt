Since it's basically low budget, it's a surprisingly good movie about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey starred as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for almost all his music. With his cricket, Holly had a lot of hits and before his death in a plane crash with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper he became a bona fide star. The film follows its rise to stars, marriage to its beloved and ultimate death. I like this movie and believe you will. Charles Martin Smith also does a good job in this movie.
