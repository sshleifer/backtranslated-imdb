Jack, Sawyer and Sayid swim to the boat and find a completely wasted Desmond. His traumatic past experience before going to the island is revealed by flashbacks. Sayid is planning a plan with Jack to surprise the others if Michael doubles the group. John Locke convinces Desmond to overtake the hatch. Eco is protected, and does not press the button of the computer to see what will happen. <br /> <br /> This episode is one of the best of the second season. Unfortunately, our lovers of "Lost" can see the lack of respect that the manufacturers of this beautiful series have with the fans. In the US, the airline date of this episode was May 24, 2006. Therefore, fans in the third season should be in a very exciting situation, with Jack and his group surrounded by "The Others" and the truth about Michael. and the death of Ana Lucia and Libby; John locks inside the hatch without pushing the button and Mr. Echo in despair outside the hatch. I hope the fate of "Lost" is better than "Angel" and its very disappointing conclusion (or lack of conclusion) after five seasons. My voice is ten. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): Not available
