This movie is really sick and funny. I have my friends cringe describing it to them. I saw it about 8 months ago and I still have the song 'Will we gather at the river', echoing through my head. <br /> <br /> So basically, it's a Tromatized Romeo and Juliet, but that's what you'd expect. Let's just say incest, references to child molestation, of course, but unfortunately it has some kind of happy ending ... kind of ... it's stranger than happy. Cappy Capulet was brilliant! He has this kind of intellectual snobbish tone, he is insulting but civilized. He picks up more Shakespeare than anyone else in the movie ... even as he involves his sadistic role as a man and dad. <br /> <br /> The carpenter was also beautiful. He was Juliet's fiance, deeply engaged in her, and soon saddened by Tromeo. And Tromeo, a true romantic. He is an attractive, very sweet man, desperate to find true love. "She'll make torches to burn brightly!" Unfortunately, Troma just had to retreat to that terribly fake green vomit and their other antics. Sometimes they are carried away with those things. But hey, this movie made me a big impression. How often do I refer to it in real life situations ... wow it is pathetic. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enjoy!
