The creator of Donnie Darko brings you a twilight zone theme story of the weirdest fashion. The film focuses on a middle-aged young couple living wage bill to pay in 1976. One day a mysterious box with a red button appears. Later that day, a ghostly man appeared and told them that they had the option of pressing the button and receiving a million dollars, but someone they didn't know would die. This is a disturbing and challenging question that is suddenly set out in the trailer and TV spots. But let it be known that you just don't know what you're coming into until you see it. At times pretentious and a little melodramatic, the film is ultimately effective because it is good performances and intrigue. It would be unfair to destroy any of the plot screens for you, but we can only say that the film will deliver on the aspects you expect and not completely fulfill what it begins to describe. There is a very clear symbolism and subtext in the film that is interesting and annoying, as it was not so clear in his other superior movie Donnie Darko. There's not too much to say without destroying the movie for you. It is meant to inspire many homes afterwards. However, I also want to say: It's well shot and has an appropriate age appearance and it's worth a watch. Look at that.
