Well, it must be said that Monster Man is a big junk of a movie, but somehow several different genres and a cliché plot come together to make one of the most beautiful modern horror movies I've ever seen have to make! The two biggest styles that blend the movie are a Road Trip style teenage comedy and a Texas Chainsaw Massacre style redneck horror vibe, and while one often gets in the way of the other; director Michael Davis manages to move things, due to the fact that the constant shift in tone means we're never quite sure where the movie will be next. Things start to be extremely worrying because we are introduced to two characters, both of which are irritating in different ways. Adam is a naughty virgin, while Harley is a thick, thick-headed "A-hole". They both drive across the desert to attend the wedding of some chicks who both love high school. After some strange events, they pick up a hitch-hiker and find out by a mania in a monster truck haunted by reasons unknown. <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​someone driven by someone else in a bigger vehicle is almost original, but the way the monster truck is used here is one of the biggest assets of the movie. The truck itself looks flu because it is so haggard and rusty, and the fact that it is jumping around the screen makes the unfolding action exciting and exciting. After a while you get used to the characters and as soon as Aimee Brooks gets in the way, things start to look up. The teenage comedy side of the movie actually works well, as Justin Ulrich is always going to make some entertaining rules of dialogue and the screens between the brave virgin and the hot female hitch hiker are interesting enough. Just when you think the movie might no longer be knife, things make a turn for the stranger in the last third. Without spoiling one has to say that Monster Man has the kind of end that can't possibly be seen, and with the twist is a big surprise. Some people may feel ripped off by the sudden turn at the end - but I actually thought it worked pretty well, as it suits the movie, as nothing really fits in here. Overall it's not a big movie. - But if you're looking for some entertainment, Monster Man has to hit the spot!
