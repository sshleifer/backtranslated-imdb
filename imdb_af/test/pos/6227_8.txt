I must thank this movie, I'm scared of mannequins. hahaha. <br /> <br /> But yes, first of the acting in this movie, at least according to my standard, is pretty swelling. Most of the actors are pretty decent in their roles. The writing also looks pretty good, certainly some cute stuff there, but also a decent written character and some terrible scary scenes. I still get scared of that one scene with the man and the mannequins. brrr. <br /> <br /> Yes, I'll tell you to watch this movie, it's pretty good, and very entertaining. a good watch. 8/10
