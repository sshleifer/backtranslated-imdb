A great B feature. A virtual two-handed and over the course of a day (you can see it is the origin of the stage and even how it should be worked as a radio game), and although only 77 minutes played in sequences related to something like the right time. Robert Ryan is the psychopath Ida Lupino held in her own home. Both are excellent, especially the underprivileged Lupino whose initial independence and restraint will soon crumble before Ryan's unpaved intruder. Today, of course, it would all be that, but the restraint shown by director Harry Horner is much more known as an art director. He just adds to the tension that is sometimes worthy of Hitchcock.
