This is my favorite Looney Tunes cartoon. It's a common plot: Daffy Duck tries to convince Elmer Fudd that it's really rabbit season and Bugs are shooting. But you can never exchange that rabbit! In addition to the usual cartoon comedy, this cartoon is supported by a great word game that will roll you on the floor.
