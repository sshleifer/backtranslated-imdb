Lloyd Hamilton was one of the most imaginative (and among the funniest) of all the movie comedians. Why is he completely forgotten? Unfortunately, the original negatives lost a large percentage of his films when the Fox warehouse burned early in the 1930s. Hamilton was not attractive or graceful like Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd; He was also not brave like Raymond Griffith. And unlike Harry Langdon and (again) Chaplin, Hamilton didn't try to have public sympathy. <br /> <br /> But his films were extremely popular at the time of their original release, and they remain hilaries today. Oscar Levant once claimed that he had asked Chaplin if there was any other comedian he ever envied and Chaplin immediately called Lloyd Hamilton. The character Hamilton portrayed on the screen - a shabby naff, with stubborn gestures and a similar walk, was later adapted by vaudeville comedian Eddie Garr (Teri Garr's father) and further adapted by Jackie Gleason as his 1950s TV character 'The Poor Soul'. <br /> <br /> 'The Movies', directed by Roscoe Arbuckle, is one of Hamilton's most innovative shorts, and it's hilarious. We first see him as a country boy, with his family outside the house of his house, traveling to the big city. Then he walks away from the house, and we see that it is in the big city, with a traffic around him! <br /> <br /> Eventually our hero ends at a restaurant (unreasonable, but it is the Montmartre cafe in downtown LA) where all the movie actors take between. There is an amusing gut when Hamilton's bumpkin character meets three actors in costume and makeup as presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt: this gag would have been harder if the fraudsters looked more like the original. Eventually our son sat at a table and hoped to meet a celebrity. Sure enough, entering the restaurant and sitting at the next table is a great movie star ... no one but Lloyd Hamilton! There is a very well made double exposure shot - the entry is almost invisible - when Lloyd Hamilton greets himself as Lloyd Hamilton as the country boy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Hamilton's peak period of creativity was very short. He started his film career in rough slapstick movies as half a double act (Ham and Bud, opposite Bud Duncan) and had short and short periods of star-gazing in shorts during silent silence. Sound movies were not good for Hamilton, and he was quickly slammed into the swap list in some rough early talks. Then he died young. Fortunately, The Movies is quite funny and a great introduction to this unique comedians' style. I'll rate it 7 out of 10.
