So many of us who are devoted to the art of the movie will ignore or forget that movies are also businesses. Most of the time, they are too expensive to produce to be something else. In view of this, it often seems to me a miracle that really big people are made every now and then. The filmmakers are going to go so far over the budget to make a film that will financially hurt the businessmen responsible for funding the business, and that will, of course, be very angry. I would like to know exactly how it often happens that both the big studios and some great critics "award" for the photo when it is finally released. Strange expectations are generated and often people expect to see clouds they see. <br /> <br /> You can see this phenomenon at work in the imperfect, but beautiful '62 re-make the Bounty, and you can definitely see it in the response to "Heaven's Gate". gone and United Artists took too much money to make this picture, the company was injured by its exorbitances and was undoubtedly powerful people to destroy its reputation forever when this strange, mammoth epic was finally released. moviegoers who do not like long, weighty pictures The storytelling in this movie is not achieved with a big economy or a quick pace.As Stanley Kubrick, Cimino often does not choose the specific statement he makes with a given scene On the contrary, he draws it so that the viewer feels that they are living in the moment, and gives time for his own imagination to participate deeply in what is offered. Many people do not respond to everything that is favorable to this. approach, they want it The story must move quickly and clearly and become easily impatient and confused by this kind of film. These factors undoubtedly contributed to the checkout failure of "Heaven's Gate". <br /> <br /> Of course, a movie editor, I am deeply frustrated by two issues with this movie. Here and there, a scene is clearly too long and it could easily be cut without compromising its efficiency. Then we come to the end of the picture to the massive, protracted tones. In this respect, the clarity of the storytelling is indeed damaged. If you liked the movie to the point where it appears, your understanding of what is supposed to happen is likely to become unclear and it is indeed a frustration. If I didn't see all the rough footage, I can't tell if re-shoots were actually needed, or some critical plot elements might be made clearer by meticulous re-delivery of a few moments. Given the time and money thrown in this picture, more attention had to be given to this problem. <br /> <br /> There are other problems, sometimes poor behavior, a dialogue that is not true. , but it's really minor concerns. The reason I am so worried about the problems mentioned above is that, like so many of these days, I also feel that in all the "Hemelsek" is so beautiful to see and so wonderful about important historical, political and sociological issues that are just short of a masterpiece. Despite its shortcomings, it is so dramatic and visually powerful that it stands out above most other Hollywood movies I've ever seen. I would like to mix a lot of the sound. I would like to redirect and re-instill the scene where Ella is murdered, but the magnitude of this picture is such that these considerations really become trivial compared to the value of total production. I must add that it should always be seen on a huge screen to achieve the glorious effect it is capable of delivering.
