It's the best movie I've ever seen and I love it, it's so sad and loving that I can watch this movie over and over again. When I first saw it on Disney Channel, I was like to watch this movie. I would love to watch this movie every day and I recommend it to anyone. It's really a good movie. For anyone who has not seen this movie and is thinking about it, they are getting better and seeing it, because it is really good. I love the part when the boy found out about the girl and from then on I was just all in this movie. if i could watch two movies every day, it would be this one and loved ones, these are my two favorite movies, i really love them
