At the first glance of this movie, camera angles let you instantly think that it is a low budget film that will carry you to tears or hit the stop button. Surprisingly, the storyline comes forward and is played through the screen in a way that I feel the most. I got this movie at 7, but like most would like it to be a 10. You will understand if you see it, because it is a rare thing for a movie to be in touch with a person's feelings and how to live through a TV. set. Most movies try to surprise you with their special effects, twists and turns, etc. This film showed a real hand. A good movie backed by a story of the Alabama style that would feel the most was a good waste of a few hours. Wish I put the popcorn maker on it!
