Billy Hughes is a naughty young lady working for makeup on a cheap horror photograph filmed by a US director in Moscow. Billy is locked in the film studio one night. Later in the evening she heard that someone could be in the building and watched it. This is when she stumbles upon a woman who is brutally murdered while being filmed. After the killers' clutches, Billy tells the authorities just to be reddish when the men show that it is an act. Billy knows what she has seen and soon her life is again in turmoil from underground figures who believe she has something of interest. <br /> <br /> I don't know how this heartbreaking sleeper passed me, but I thought it was a much older movie. However, there is one thing, it must be one of the most critical and intense spectators I've seen for some time. It's just a wonderful builder and mostly clicks into place! The first half of the function is surprisingly grabbing with tough ranges that have your heart in your throats and clouds with an atmospheric preventive environment of alienation. It's a humorous evil black stripe. Errors appear in the story because it loses the furious grip it kept so early and goofy humor (or better comic relief) between Fay Ripley and Evan Richard's characters is a hit by being too violent. In the long run, this has probably been done without potential. Despite a few moments, this aspect did not hamper my enjoyment. For me, the soft end they decided to go with just didn't feel right. <br /> <br /> The intriguingly mysterious premises were ominous towards the leg and packed some disturbing goods. So multi-faceted was the context and its excitement, there was something fresh about how it all played, and the nervous push and unbearable tension were woven into a variety of sudden plots and twists. Really, they made excellent use of the new idea of ​​this disability and harming the situation by placing it in a strange place where not too much English was spoken and therefore we are also caught up in the confusion. Delicate Marina Zudina gives a sad portrayal of American dumb girl Billy. The way she could show the erratic emotions through her eyes and actions gave it abomination and credibility. Director Anthony Waller shoots the movie in a pretty handsome, well-timed and experienced way, without losing the grim look coming from his sturdy environment and a powerful, up-to-date music performance. The only real name to make a look was small, became part of Alec Guinness. The performances by the cast were all good, especially the nail bites by Oleg Yankovsky and Igor Volkov as Russian killers. <br /> <br /> This sounding feature, mostly made up of strangers, is better than your average dark thriller. Highly recommended.
