Plunkett & Macleane fall into my favorite movie genre (historical action adventure with comedy), probably why I rate it so high. <br /> <br /> The action is around a highway man (Plunkett) and a loophole 'gentleman' who gets along with him and his schemes (Macleane). This leads to all kinds of escapades and adventures that are all harmed by comedy. Of course there is also a love interest. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie consists of a number of live, larger than life characters that add to the atmosphere of the movie and the excess the rich at this time. <br /> <br /> It's a pleasant movie with a fairly simple yet valuable plot that offers lots of entertainment.
