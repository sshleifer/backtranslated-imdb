Probably hardly underestimated by anyone who has never experienced hell under the communist regime. Although it seems hard to believe, it all happened, in fact the reality was even worse than the movie. It looks like Orwellian fiction, but it's not fiction. John Hurt is excellent as always. Yes, the script is not full of action, but life is not. Plot is awesome. Yes, people were shot, yes, thousands of them. Their 'crime' was that they wanted to leave the communist 'paradise' without the government's authority. Sometimes the movie drives tears in your eyes. We need more movies like this to really appreciate what America offers us. Excellent movie, recommend! God bless our country, USA!
