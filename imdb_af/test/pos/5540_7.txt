Michelle Pfeiffer is ideally cast as the frustrated mob widow in this colorful black comedy. Matthew Modine plays a clumsy FBI agent who made a fancy for her. Dean Stockwell steals the show as Pfeiffer's big shot; Mercedes Ruehl is dynamic as his jealous wife. It's been many eighties, but it just adds to the fun. A fun little movie, but not for every taste.
