The Gimnast (2006) was written and directed by Ned Farr. Dreya Weber portrays Jane Hawkins, a former world-class gymnast who has been seriously injured and earns her as a certified massage therapist. <br /> <br /> The promotional material leads you to believe that the plot hinges on Jane's casual reunion with a former teammate. Although this encounter takes place, the plot line is secondary to the main plot, which involves Jane, her husband and a professional dancer named Serena (Addie Yungmee). The two women develop an act of the kind performed by Cirque de Soleil. The two complement each other - Jane is more experienced with heights and has tremendous upper body power. Serena is more elegant and artistic, although of course it is also capable of doing incredible physical facts. <br /> <br /> The film works because we can understand how Jane will go to Addie, who is caring and compassionate, while Jane's husband has <br /> <br /> Both women are incredibly fit and athletic , and Dreya has the lean body and well-defined muscles that are typical of gymnasts. They are clearly doing their best, and the results are so great that we can believe they will be a success in Las Vegas or where they have traveled. <br /> <br /> The sexual tension between women is obvious, and the situation becomes even more complex when the act requires them to kiss while suspended in the air. A woman with a negligent husband and an attractive female partner creates an explosive situation, which is not neatly and neatly resolved. <br /> <br /> Of the six films we saw at the Rochester NY Lesbian and Gay Film and Video Festival, we thought this one was the best. It will work on DVD, and is definitely worth searching on big or small screens. NOTE: Stay For The Credits!
