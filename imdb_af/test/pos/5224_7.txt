Looking at three movies with a similar topic, made in 1930, the 1930's The Covered Wagon and Wagon Master made in 1950 the distance between The Big Trail and The Covered Wagon is only 7 years, while the distance between 'The Big Trail' and 'Wagon Master' is 20 years. It's amazing because it shows how many movies evolved in those 7 years and how the changes will come slowly over the next 20 years. 'The Big Trail is technically close to' Wagon Master 'but outdated except' The Covered Wagon '. The story is about the pioneers going from Missouri to the west in Oregon. Tyrone Power Sr. is the man who leads the caravan, he is a rough and average man. John Wayne is the good guy and the film makes too much of a point of his good looks, and doesn't give him the chance to be the Wayne we are used to. Marguerite Churchill is such a proud lady you wonder why Wayne just didn't forget her. Raoul Walsh was a master at displaying caravans and cattle moving west. He directed 'The Tall Men' in 1955, which has much in common with 'The Big Trail'.
