Chokher Bali was shown at the (Washington) DC Film Festival on April 15, 2005. The director, Rituparno Ghosh, was there to give a brief introduction and then answer questions. <br /> <br /> As always, I think Aishwarya has a fantastic job. I understand those who think she should be more aggressive or more bitchy, but would it really be realistic in 1904? Possibly, maybe; realistically, I'm not so sure. I think her interpretation was valid, but there might be other ways to do it. <br /> <br /> I hate to use the word, but it was the most inaccessible of the Indian movies I've seen so far. . I know a good amount of Indian history, Hindu religion, etc. But the level of detail here was far above me. Obviously you would have a much better understanding of the movie if you were intimately familiar with Hinduism and its customs, especially. as they were c. 1904. I missed a lot of things - one of them is the fact that the mother-in-law Binodini wants home as a counterweight to her daughter-in-law Ashalata. <br /> * spoilers * Ghosh has several things to say that better explain the movie to me. First, the original Bengal version was 20+ minutes longer. So what's left out? Apparently three main things: a starting segment where Binodini (Aishwarya) leaves E. Bengal for Calcutta. According to the director, various characters speak W. Bengali vs E. Bengali - who later draft a few political comments. Of course, it's all lost in the Hindi version, and certainly for a non-Indian like me, it wouldn't matter anyway - but a Bengali situation would definitely have. Next was a segment where Binodini wrote a poem - a sign of her independence, etc. Finally, even more about jewelry. So, although some people think it's too long, I think the original, longer version would have been clear. <br /> <br /> The women's hair was apparently another sign (Ghosh again) - the mother-in-law had short hair (short hair for Hindu widows), her sister - also a widow - had longer hair ( more modern!), and of course Binodini / Aishwarya has extremely long hair (rejection of widowhood status). <br /> <br /> The end really threw me. Binodini, who had never had a political thought, suddenly wrote a political manifesto? Whoa! Ghosh explained that he was in Locarno, during a film festival, when the captions were done. The captions use the word "land" by Binodini's letter. Gosh said a more appropriate word would have been (I forgot his exact word) such as "self" or "independence" - she spoke of her own liberation and "finding of herself" - not of Bengal, India and the British no. . So why does Binodini disappear the day just after Behari was found again? Apparently because she realized during her stay at the Ganges that she didn't need a man - someone - to define / complete her. She can only be herself. So she rejected Behari, who did she throw in just a few months (?) And just left. Of course I don't know how to buy her next meal, but that's another question. <br /> <br /> The red scarf (Ghosh again) she buys represents "revolution" as well as "passion." I'm not 100% sure why she puts the scarf on the dying woman, but maybe rejects his passion / revolution? The binoculars, which Binodini uses throughout the movie (Mahendra and Ashalata, the boat on the Ganges, etc.). She is a voyeur to see a life she longs for, but cannot have. At the end (I missed it!) She left the binoculars on the table with the letter and showed that she no longer needed it - she was going to lead her own life. <br /> <br /> Finally, the Tagore quotation at the beginning to say how he apologized for the end ... Apparently, Tagore wrote it as a series, which its readers with the sexy widowed bits spheres. But in the end, he sold out to conservatism and knelt Binodini at the feet of Mahendra and Behari and asked for their forgiveness. One of his students (?) Wrote to Tagore and ended up selling for sale. And Tagore replied with his apology for the end. In the movie, Ghosh goes in the other direction.
