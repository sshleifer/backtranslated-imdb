I love this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More classic sci / fie / horror movies have to be made at this comedy level, which in my opinion is the best of the line. A no drinking movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all about yourself. Can we expect more? Let's hope so. I would like to make a lot of movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films. He made some very strong contributions. A picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope a producer or director can come up with the idea and bring new comedy to our screens. We need a good emergence of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before. A Good Comedy FIX.
