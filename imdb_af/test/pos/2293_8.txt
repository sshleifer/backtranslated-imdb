You must have been in Japan for a while to enjoy the beauty of this movie! I've been living in Okinawa for over 2 years, and the northern Honshu for 4. Believe it or not, what you see, paint a very good and accurate picture of contrasting eastern / western mentality, both from a sports and personal relationship perspective. A funny, funny and heart-warming movie that deserves better than the Americans who see it can ever judge. 8 + out of 10!
