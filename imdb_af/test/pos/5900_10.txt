In 2004, I wrote the following statements on an IMDb message board when a user wondered if the best years of our lives were a forgotten movie: <br /> <br /> ***** movie, like opening a time capsule. I think in many ways, "The best years of our lives" are probably one of the more fascinating character studies, and it is very much a glimpse into US life in the mid-1940s after World War II. I believe that "Coming Home" and "The Deer Hunter", both released in 1978, were the most recent films closest to capturing the many issues of military men who have returned from the war in the "best years" of our life "was educated. . <br /> <br /> What really impressed me was the movie as a whole while I was in college in the mid-1980s and closed many, or not all, college students at the end of the film no. <br /> <br /> This movie packs another wallet and I am delighted to read in other posts that other users feel of a movie that will definitely be the test of time. ***** <br /> <br /> I'm delighted to see the movie near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI. Also, although it was in competition with what ultimately became a Christmas classic, it is a wonderful life, probably, the best years of our lives' Oscar victory, including the best picture, was well deserved. <br /> <br /> I saw the movie again in 2005 and after about 60 years, the best years of our lives are yet another powerful, beautiful and well-crafted movie.
