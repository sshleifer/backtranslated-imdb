First, I must admit that I had doubts about the director. He did some movies (with Jarkovsky) about recent "Czech = East" history or more specifically about families (individuals) how they survived some historical moments. But it was always like the cookies sour-sweet. This movie was completely different. It was pure, it shows the bones of life, it shows the variations of human nature. This film is an excellent piece of art (story, play, picture, music), but it shows you life in much brighter light that we don't want to see. By the way, I've seen it on a DVD (with English subtitles), but I'm afraid I won't get it in the US.
