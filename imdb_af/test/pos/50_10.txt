Fantastic written, performed and produced! Like to see this shiny, talented role - each one of them - giving such a good performance. This movie made the hearts of my heart warm! Great storytelling! <br /> <br /> This is a great movie for the Black History month. Full of accurate depiction of recent history and many real characters who have endured incredible pain - with dignity and a belief in a better future. It is so easy to see how these diverse adults all touched this child and contributed to the fertile imagination that would eventually burn the talent of his adult age. The next time you are in the company of a listening and acting child, remember; show if he can be a writer-in-the-make!
