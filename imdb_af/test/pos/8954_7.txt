Watch this movie on Saturday afternoon cable. Man, dragged it. I have the metaphors, symbolism and all those things. No, I didn't care about the sexuality of the characters. But the rhythm of the story and the mini-dissertation almost slept me. <br /> <br /> That's ..... until Ruth Marshall got naked. If you are a breast cancer who is not homophobic, you can rent it. Ruth has a completely lesbian sex scene, and then a heterosexual scene that is higher than most standard movies. Her jiggly D-cups made the movie worthwhile. <br /> <br /> - The Mighty Avatar
