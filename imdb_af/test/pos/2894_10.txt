Since then I have become a "big" rush fan since 'moving photos' and this concert is simple and exemplary for anyone who is a fan of why Rush is so popular. They have already allowed to play their biggest concert, and despite the rain in a soccer arena, they can still deliver an excellent performance from start to finish. A true example of this is during "yyz", starting the whole crowd in a true classic way in perfect zinc. They really play everyone's favorite songs with a real powerful "lust" that rarely happens. You get the best seat in the house for one of their best concerts. The second DVD is a fascinating documentary of the band while in Brazil and shows you a lot of the background stuff and it allows you not only to see a musician but as real people in their everyday life life. This DVD gift set is a must have for any Rush of young and old and is definitely a custodian for your DVD collection. They are even a CD of the concert for those who just want to listen to the music. This DVD is worth it!
