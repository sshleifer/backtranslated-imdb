Well, the movie was much better than I expected. It is not boring and it is not original. It's not really a stupid romantic comedy. The situations that the characters bring themselves are very unusual. Of course we are still talking about a movie, but the main characters are probably plausible. Of course, Donald is an exaggeration, but he's just a pawn in the movie, a way to prove something. The end is not one of those ridiculously happy, always the same, moral pieces of shit that you can usually see in movies of the genre. I really liked it and I am hard to please if it comes to this particular genre of movies. It's worth a watch. In addition, it is better targeted than other movies, the story line always stands up, the characters themselves stand up. And they do not experience this miraculous change and love is not revealed to them, like a holy god who gave artefact, yada, yada. At the end of it you actually see yourself, the movie makes you feel something, you can even learn a thing or two. It's not the usual hope-producing, tissue-moisturizing idiot. It's a good movie, not a praise for gay women around the world.
