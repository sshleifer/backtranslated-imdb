I was five when the show made its debut in 1958 and at a later stage it was a regular viewer. I remember really enjoying the show, along with 'My Beer', 'My Three Boys', 'Ozzie and Harriet', 'Dick Van Dyke', revival of 'I Love Lucy', 'The Real McCoys' etc. I now enjoy the first season of Donna Reed on DVD and watch the first two episodes. Donna Stone is shown to be an intelligent, well-mannered, problem-solving, quiet, stay-at-home, similar to June Cleaver and unlike Lucy Ricardo. In episode 2, I especially like that. Reed is a surrogate father, who deals in her dress for sweat and boxing gloves, while teaching her son how to physically protect him from a much bigger bully. While none of the moms in the area I grew up in included, I have exactly the idealistic standards set by me. Reed depicted, refreshing to see good manners and at the end of the day, intelligent decision making is prevalent. to today's accepted standards of vulgarity, egoism and indifference among one of its neighbors. I can't imagine Jeff and Mary Stone being told by their parents that the offense of their neighbors in the age group is good, and that a dog barks outside all day, is acceptable or they have their mother in a supermarket must shut up for everyone.
