Well, the movie is basically over the last days of a specific Russian regiment stationed in Afghanistan, before the main explosion in 1985. The film shows the grim realities of the Russian army that made it infamous: "dedovshina" (officers and NCOs) physical harassment, beat and humiliating younger recruits, mixed character of war (one day you can deal with your enemy and kill him the next), the lives of women in front, documentary footage of helicopter attacks and coffins being soldered and sent home in heave C-130 Hercules class Russian cargo aircraft with tracker for jam Stinger rockets, fatigue, boredom, anti-war sentiment, emotional side, simply put. There are some action scenes, but they are poorly done, and are often illogical, such as Major Bandura's suicide walk, and the return to the 10-year-old child armed with AK-47 whose father he just killed. Also, the fact that heavy grenade launcher appears from the nowhere in the middle of the fire brigade (and any half-bright person knows that it is almost impossible to take 40-50 l in the launch). But at the same time, films show that war is a dirty affair, where murder is sometimes condoned, because destruction of entire villages, because little or no reason is normal. Indifferent killing of civilians is overlooked as collateral damage that is inevitable during the war. Some are for the thought of the Afghan war being lost. Not made the best war movie, but deep and intelligent enough to be worth watching.
