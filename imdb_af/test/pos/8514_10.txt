Like most people out there who watched James Bond 007 movies. Most people never knew that Thunderball was originally the first 007 movie, but Ian Fleming wrote the story with Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham. The other two authors took Ian Fleming in court and received WON THE CASE to prove that Ian Fleming has the SPECTER (Specialist CounterIntelligence Terrorism Revenge Extortion) concept. So rather than making Thunderball, they (Fleming, Broccoli, Saltzman) made Dr NO NO. <br /> <br /> This movie had the best of the best. pay more than 5,000,000 for NSNA. Irvin Kershner and Sean Connery had problems on the set, so much is true. But overall this movie was where I think with (Thunderball, License To Kill, Dr No) this is my favorite of the band series. David Dryer was hired for special photographic effects, and he was on Bladerunner at that time, before never again. The 100 million dollar hunt makes the disco volante, resembling a canoe. This movie has the best Villian in a band movie just behind dr no. Klaus Maria Brandeau kept this neurotic business in a calm way, with a little white to his authority over the mortgage. Barbara Carrera was excellent as fatima blush. <br /> <br /> The music was better than any score John Barry didn't include in most bandage movies. Michel Legrand is not big in the United States compared to Europe in Europe, he has played with Miles Davis and many other GREAT Jazz musicians over the past few years. It's sometimes a bit, but the 007 theme about 3 or 4 times in the movie never says so beautifully, I love the original. <br /> <br /> 007 is back One More Time <br /> <br /> Timothy Dalton explained it well, I thought, you can't have a SUPERMAN or SUPERHERO, he or she must be human and feelings. He was by far the BEST SERIOUS WHERE TO COMPLETE FEMALE VERSION OF FUND. But Sean Connery proves that he can still play the role that he and others could follow. I bet at 75, now he can still draw a villian role in a MCCLORY 007 movie if someone is ever on the road. <br /> <br />
