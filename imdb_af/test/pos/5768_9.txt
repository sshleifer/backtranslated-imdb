I saw it when it came out for the first time and found it to be a work of some genius; but I must confess that I was in the minority at the time. <br /> <br /> For me, the progressive ambience of Guest House Paradiso's owners is getting better and better throughout the film, with one of the hilarious climaxes to a movie ever. <br /> <br /> But I wouldn't recommend it to Mother. <br /> <br /> Lovers of brutal comic book style humor will appreciate this movie; There are subtle jokes hidden, but they are usually flattened quickly by a comedy pan. Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson are wonderful, and the dodpan, unsuspecting guests are also excellent.
