I have been a fan of Heaven's Gate since the first issue. I saw it at least half a dozen times and thought about it for a long time as a masterpiece. So it was with excitement and a sense of anticipation that I had taken myself to see the restoration of the restored director. <br /> <br /> To my surprise, I was disappointed to see it again and have my estimate of the movie. Hemelekh is gaining ground in parts, but generally the thematic and narrative consistency and the passionate urgency of a really good film are lacking. <br /> <br /> First, two technical issues: The sound quality diffused through the film. , sometimes unpleasant. Some of these may be intentional - a way to imitate the chaos and confusion of history, as it unfolds. But at key points one cannot register what the characters say. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is equally diffuse. The images do not have sharpness and detail. The result is some grain and lack of sharpness that fades the foreground and background. <br /> <br /> Structurally, the story throughout the story, as if Cimino can't think well, is the effect he's been following. He certainly wanted an email. But a pastoral or dramatic epic? The film is restless and unconvincing between styles, and perhaps even genres. Sometimes it reminds me of Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven' or even 'Elvira Madigan' in his tranquil pace and elegant play. At other times it threatens to become a robust 'western' that is more akin to 'The Wild Bunch'. In fact, the last film provides an instructional reference point for an 'Heaven's Gate' assessment, as it indicates the same period and uses a similar tone of ambivalent nostalgia for a darker and more heroic America. <br /> <br /> This structural and thematic uncertainty is not helped by the poor quality, often forced, and cross-referencing script. The result is an awkward sense of period speech. <br /> <br /> The nearness of the Heaven Gate is in its pieces. The roller skating series is particularly surprisingly beautiful, one of the most sought after scenes ever made to film. <br /> <br /> Another piece that works very well in terms of unifying theme, mood and setting occurs when Kristofferson and Huppert ride in the new rig to the lake and she flushes her while he is in the shade. The tranquil pacing, voice-oriented music and monumental scenery combine in this scene to convincingly depict the love story that is just in the heart of the film - and which could be the saving grace if it is persuasively pursued. <br /> <br /> Some critics complained about the length of the movie. It doesn't stop me. A good movie can't be long enough. The restored minutes are critical to displaying the motivation and characterization of the cut version, and they are full of pictures. <br /> <br /> Maybe the main glory of the Heaven Gate is in the painful voice-oriented soundtrack. The repeated rolling motif and its various scores throughout (full band, guitar, solo violin, etc.) give a ghostly quality to the foreground action and set a thematic consistency that is lacking in the narrative itself. <br /> <br /> Despite the obvious flaws, especially the absence of a compelling story, there is a sense of grandeur about the film. One leaves the theater with a rough sense of missed greatness and a wish that Cimino can repeat the movie - with the wisdom of time and after, to rectify what is so bad.
