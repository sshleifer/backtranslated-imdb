This movie talked about Fangoria where I heard about this. It was interesting to me, mostly because it was live on video and I recognized two of the stars on the cover, James Marsden or Disturbing Behavior and Christine Taylor of The Craft. And to my surprise on Valentine's Day when I was through the horror to find it on the shelf! I had to grab it immediately. My brothers and our friends and I watched it and to my surprise it was pretty good, the stories were interesting and for once they were SCARY, unlike many other horror movies recently made. Some of the plot I don't understand, but once I see it again, I know I'll get it. And even more surprising were other stars I recognized, including one of the TV show My So-Called Life and Jacinda from The Real World. I'm not sure why this movie was just for video, With a little advertising, this movie can at least be made up for how much money was spent on it. The only problem I have is that since it's not released in theaters, I never think I can see it in widescreen. You should definitely take a chance and rent this one. <br /> <br />
