Perhaps many viewers who have become frustrated by this movie live without ever thinking deeply about life. What I want to show here is that "far" is not just an art house film, but one of the best art house films. From all the art house movies I've seen, 'far' is the one that really sticks out like a glittering piece of gold. It is even fair to say that the film's cinematography and depiction of human emotion outperformed Tarkovsky's Nostalgia. One commentator managed it, and the sex, a bald, general feature of foreign films, surprisingly surprised in 'far' and in a good way. What is noteworthy about the "distant" is that it is the details of life that we normally ignore and the rich essence of our being often buried under the dune, and the visual excess of our commercialized world. Fortunately, "far" doesn't have much to save the audiences and what we see on the screen is a mere portrait of people.
