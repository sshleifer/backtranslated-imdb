I saw this movie yesterday. I have to admit - I love it! It's like Tarantino asked, but better. Actually a must, but ... don't show this movie to anyone under the age of 18. It's full of blood and sex (rape scene is wonderful :)). Now I'm just waiting for other movies from this director and a DVD release.
