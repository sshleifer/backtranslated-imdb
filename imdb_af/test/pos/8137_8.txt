What are the movies? I mean .. what are movies made for? Shootings? Murders? NO. They are made for life stories and that is what this movie does. It offers how life has changed between two ages. The father and a son, the father is in need of work and asks the boy for help. <br /> <br /> Although there is another generation, there are some features that the family includes for the family. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the major is the love of the boy for the father and vice versa. <br /> <br /> The movie consists of only one dialogue, but the dialogue is more than I could ever have wanted. This movie is a pure art! Once again, after "Marfa si Banii", Cristi Puiu delivers another beautiful film. Well done !
