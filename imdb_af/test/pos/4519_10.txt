I just watched this movie for an advanced show. I didn't read the book, and didn't know the story, but went because the book "Book of the Year" was voted by two local colleges. So I can't compare the book to the movie as others did. <br /> <br /> In short, I thought it was an incredibly moving story. The acting was credible, and the insight into Afghan culture and political history was interesting and shocking. My eldest friend is Iran-American, so I felt an affinity for certain Middle Eastern values ​​and traditions portrayed in the movie, reminding me of the times I spent with his family. <br /> <br /> The themes of friendship, family, human values ​​and courage under fire are universal and well developed in the film. I will not list the plot details as it can be obtained elsewhere. But based on the technical aspects of the film, the acting, and above all its heartbreaking story, I definitely recommend this movie.
