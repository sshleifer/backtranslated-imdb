My wife and I saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much. We wanted to see it again. It was so moving that I called it a teardrop. The secret that Billings sent to report is not a secret at all. Corners !! He seems to have turned around, something that happened to him, all right, and I believe George got a little, since he didn't realize what he was coming from. It just shows that even the cold heart can change with the right attitude. If we could all just treat the same, the world would be a better place. To date, we just bought it for a copy of it, now I finally have a connection to it, once I can get a copy to buy, I'll grab it.
