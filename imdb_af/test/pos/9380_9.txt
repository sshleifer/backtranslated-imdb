The words "hidden jewel" were never so accurate. Bad movie lovers can look for the next hidden darkness everywhere, sometimes it comes short of things like Weasels, my flesh jerking, but other times happiness will prevail and you may end up with something like Doodbed, and hopefully realize it's not bad . It's just a bad title, and not even a bad title, but a humorous one that can throw you, but somehow, Death Bed still fits in the bad category. Death Bed is a true masterpiece of low-budget horror, which only appreciates those fortunate enough to appreciate such a dark shadow. Dood Bed involves an incoherent, yet intriguing relationship between a devil in bed and the sympathetic ghost caught in the portrait. He just wished he could save someone from the terrible fate of being consumed by the yellow mucus. Although it's not as scary as it's about a murderer bed, Death Bed has the features that make for successful horror. A dark, ferocious atmosphere, confusion, ominous, subtle count and the dream quality that sparkles this masterpiece. Such a quality, or vibe, usually seems unintentional. Not only is it intentional, but from what I've read, Death Bed is based on a real dream, director George Barry has successfully transferred dream to film. Only a genius could accomplish such a task. <br /> <br /> Old homes make for a good quality horror, like portraits, not sure what to make of the killer bed with its killer yellow liquid, quite a bizarre dream, indeed. Also, this is not quite the mark of B-horror I was expecting, taking into account the title and everyone. Before I watched this Gothic jewel, I expected something more like a Mass Reunion Mass, now it's a bad movie, if you've seen it, you know what I'm saying. After considering all of the above, I feel that Death Bed only earns eight stars, but as it remains so unclear, we will say the bed that eats deserves nine.
