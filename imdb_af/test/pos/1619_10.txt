This is a low budget stop motion monster movie by Brett (a Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell) Piper ... and it just delivers what I expect from such a production: light (though cheesy) dialogue, some cute actresses and many stopping movements. That's why I gave the movie 10 out of 10 because it delivers what I expected to deliver ... and a little more: Brett is not a penny pinch when it comes to putting his lobster on the screen not. He casts many mistakes on his role for the final. And anyway, I like stop-motion samples that, compared to CGI insects in larger budgeted movies, just look like it's fun to watch.
