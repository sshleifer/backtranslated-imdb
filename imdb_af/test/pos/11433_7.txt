The suspicious star, who participated in the 2006 Golden Lion Lion Film Festival, is a film that, if you think, is the first adjectives in your mind to be: intense. Intense look, intense rows, the intensity of this movie captures the seer since the first screens at the steelworks, in Italy (I could not recognize the city, perhaps Genoa or even Naples), although the pace is fairly slow. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Buonavolont√†, the male chief, and with him, all the audience, sees a completely different China as a normal Western image: a terribly tall building with about 8 hundred flat owners inside, skyscrapers , desert, dung, scrapers and taps everywhere, but also the beauty of the Yangtze Kiang River, which will soon become a great lake because of the controversial poet who erases many villages. China is a country under construction, but among all these colossal public works there is still poverty, backlog and unfair laws. <br /> <br /> We can relate more easily to this story because Gianni Amelio, the knowledgeable director, has chosen two phenomenal leaders: Sergio Castellitto, a well-known actor in Italy and the Chinese surprise Tai Ling, a total unknown girl giving a so intense interpretation as Castellitto. <br /> <br /> The movie is not perfect, there are a few mistakes here and there, but that doesn't mean it's a mediocre movie. Try to see it.
