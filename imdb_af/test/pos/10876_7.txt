I was actually happy when I played this game. The graphics were something new. The missions were fantastic. But I felt I wanted to play more of this game. For a James Bond game, it's pretty good, but not as good as its other games. . It would be great if they could make a 360Remake for it. It would be much better. It may just be cuz. I'm in games like Resident evil, Dead rising and the kind of games. So, it could be better, but it was OK to play. One thing I absolutely hated about this game was Natalya! She was annoying all the time and couldn't run either. I recommend this game to those who love more than FPS games.
