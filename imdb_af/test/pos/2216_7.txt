This movie was a great surprise to me as I watched it at Cinequest in the great California theater in San Jose. It's a musical, which I usually don't like, but I have to say this one was different. Robert Peters, who directed and directed the film, did such a wonderful job. During his Q&A he told the audience that he had only two other people for his crew! Most of the film was at stake and he actually made the movie while attending another film festival in Germany! I can't say enough good things about this movie. The only bad thing is that you really see the camera's work and it shakes a little. If you come across this movie, watch it!
