This movie is similar to what I expected. Of course it is juicy, it is of course predictable. We all know the fairy tale. But to know when to look, it's nice to look. It was funny and sweet. I found it annoying that they showed geeks as children who didn't have hair or kids who loved maths and joined maths clubs and wore math t-shirts. I was wiped out at high school and I didn't do these things. It's much deeper than that. To do with many things, some of which are how much money your family has, how much you are willing to hide your uniqueness and that means you are willing to be for other children. Anyway, I won't succeed. I disagree with other opinions that Drew does not convince as a neck. With socks, no make-up and casual hair, I don't think too many people will move about her. And even when she goes back to high school and throws those things. She still wears the "wrong" clothes, "wrong" hair and has the "wrong" attitude to be considered cool. And her other "geek" friend may be beautiful, but it doesn't matter where I come from, you can still be an outcast and beautiful. (inside and outside)
