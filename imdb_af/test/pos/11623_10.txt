Recently released in DVD (11/11/08), Severo Peres's film ... and Earth didn't swallow him (1994) based on one of the most highly regarded and discussed novels in the Chicano literature. Tom√°s Rivera's ... you are not a tragio la tierra ... and the Earth did not devour him (1972) is still widely recognized by many critics and serious readers as the classic Chicano novel. Originally written in the Spanish characteristic of South Texas and also translated into English, Rivera's novel remains an indispensable presence in the Chicano literary landscape. <br /> <br /> Originally a highly-rated American Playhouse PBS production, Perez film took time to be released in DVD. One can only wonder about this matter, because its high quality is not a problem. The movie, and now DVD, however, as far as I know, remains the only film-like adaptation of any Chicano novel and is clearly a tribute to the incredible accommodation of Earth. This movie version also captures an extraordinarily deep-rooted nerve that I maintain, especially ethnically, but also generally universal. Doubts on Earth may have arisen because it is too ethnic, alienated from a basic American mainstream, too much to "restrict" a "foreign" art in economic resources. Yet, in his works of art, Perez thinks very effectively, artistically, and creates a sharp etching depiction of a Chicano migratory collectivity that focuses on daily family life. In terms of production with relatively limited economic resources, its beautiful cinematographic work and ghost music go far beyond the available funding. To just watch the movie, this film's (or DVD) artistic value is known. <br /> <br /> In short, the Earth did not swallow. He portrays the fate, the suffering, and the despair of Chicano-migrating workers in a neo-naturalistic manner as they follow the crops northward from South Texas to Minnesota in 1952. The local priests bless the devastated, crowded vehicles of these Chicano workers who can no longer find work in the area, and must drag the laborers' agricultural routes northwards. This Chicano collectivity, like the Depression era of Jews in Steinbeck's The Grapes of Revenge, forms an epic tide, driven by economic need, a survival instinct, and anxiety hopes, and ultimately a scarcely flickering faith. A tribute to these people of the earth, a collective hero, is centered on a focus family, and especially the emblem is a young protagonist in the family, a boy, maybe twelve or so. This work also functions as an image novel. Eventually, the viewer's identification sense is generated by the experiences, subjectivity and the struggle of the protagonist. Poverty, alienation, child labor, illness (sunstroke and maternity mortality), discrimination, school absenteeism (the escape of the son of the crooks of discrimination is spent in a lovely, peaceful cemetery). , also symbolic. Worse still, the problematic conflict between the younger and his mother goes beyond socio-economics and political conflict in deeper areas of psychology and metaphysics. In a desperate but artistically successful struggle, the youth fight with his mother, an archetypal Mexican-American tradional, a representative of God's will, with prayer, resignation, comfort and acceptance. The rebellious youth cannot believe in a god that allows such evil and suffering to be visited on them. How can God be so cruel, he asks, since his little sister is definitely innocent, to deal with serious illnesses in the field? At this point, the boy must touch barriers even more than poverty and discrimination. The issues now include death, doubt and despair, and lack of meaning. And he has little resources available to him. Good luck in character, his own willpower, his intelligence and a powerful survival instinct. In this desperate, yet artistic, struggle, the unnamed youth, the central figure, feels the necessity of his enduring, meaningful sense of meaning, and the viewer hope, a renewed and strengthened Life Force as an inspiration to Chicanos and others. <br /> <br /> This sharp struggle uses a plot device that is only touched by the original work to tie the episodic work together: missing migrant workers from Mexico who leave no traces of their death, although this DVD not dealing with Mexican but Mexican American migrant workers. A high-sex work: anxiety and despair; a quest; a focus on a project; and redemption? Everything under the banner of free will, despite the deterministic socio-economic and religious circumstances. <br /> <br /> Perez has a long list of credits basically as a documentary filmmaker. His many awards are affirmative. Producer Paul Espinosa is also known and is also honored for his work. Indeed, the 1994 film has won and earned a number of awards: first place, audience favorite at the Santa Barbara Film Festival in 1995; first place at the Cairo Film Festival; and a number of other well-deserved awards. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this movie and DVD, Earth, by Perez is the best Chicano movie made.
