An introspective look at the relationship between Hawking and the space / time contingent. This film explores the Gaulian and Newtonian laws and thus relates to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity. <br /> <br /> The film is methodically directed, detailing the details of the man (Hawking) as well as his work (Black Holes). Interviewing his family is a bit too long, so unfortunately there are fewer theories and ideas. <br /> <br /> A Philip Glass soundtrack complements the film perfectly. Just another man can compile such haunting custom melodies (Jean Michel Jarre). <br /> Overall, I would highly recommend this movie based on Hawking's nuggets of wisdom and its adequate explanation of an Event Horizon!
