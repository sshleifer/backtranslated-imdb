I remember seeing this movie in my late teens or early twenties on TV - probably HBO. I watched it with my parents, a brother and a few friends. Since 30 years ago, I don't remember much about the story. I remember the whole group watching us being the funniest movie we ever saw. When it was over, we hurt bellies from so much laughter. My dad worked at a hospital, so it made everything better. <br /> <br /> Every time I see the party in the TV list, I see if this one is there too. To my horror it is never. Although I loved the Party, I feel this one is funny. Peter Sellers was wonderful as a keen hospital administrator. Why it's never been released on video is a mystery to me. It's a classic, but no one under 35 or 40 seems to be allowed to see it. I'll buy it in a second if they ever release it on DVD.
