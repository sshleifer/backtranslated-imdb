First, the entire script is mostly improved, adding to the fantastic illusion that what we look for is a real documentary. Secondly, the actors hired by Watkins have been purposefully chosen to represent their true political alliances and backgrounds. The hippies portrayed are real hippies, the government officials (although not necessarily in the government itself) are actually warm conservatives within the system, and several policemen are real policemen. The interactions of these actors, given the textual freedoms granted by Watkins, ultimately come to a violent head where even Watkins himself is convinced that a role player has actually been shot. (We hear him screaming "Cut! Cut!" In the background.) <br /> <br /> An AMAZING movie, although American critics were quite loud in their reviews, actually reported it as the "most offensive" film is what she has ever seen. It is not quite unexpected as the unveiling of this oppressive communist similar mentality of America during this era will surely rattle some lofts. This pseudo-documentary definitely requires an open mind, but if you are seriously looking for an intensely accurate representation of 60-year-old culture, it will be the movie to watch.
