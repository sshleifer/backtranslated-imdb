Some people are born with raw souls, singing with their song until they meet another soul as tortured and / or bitterly sweet beautiful as their own and an unusual magic happens. YOU ARE ALONE is a brutally honest look at two tortured souls who are only bound for a moment of understanding and unity to be torn apart by the differences in unity between their pain. Death is figuratively and literally examined. This is what happens when the soul is dead or too lively, too alert to reality. This is NOT the life you have imagined behind passers-by. This film explores the pain in all of us, the frown under the cheerful facade, the pain below. The ugly instinctual animalistic thoughts and deeds become honest and factual and then Bechard sprinkles a drop of unexpected innocence and beauty into the mix, knowing that they both reside in us all. Bechard, the author, is an expert observer of the human condition and because of his non-judgmental attitude, life in a light often gives us our eyes, but desires to see and understand. He, as director, focuses on the nuances of the actors' minds shining through the character they play to the actors, their own personal familiarity with the emotions used by each situation. This is the most accurate written and directed character depiction of a man and woman's experience I have ever experienced, though the two characters meet, probably not the "normal" encounter. <br /> <br /> Encapsulating the soundtrack In every song lyrics that will flush the characters' hearts if possible and strong enough. It is every character's true voice sung by the beauty, pain, talent and emotional intelligence of emerging Indian artists ready to explode on the alternative music market. The perfect soundtrack for those of us with issues - those of us who admit we have problems and those of us who hide it. <br /> <br /> I always enjoy exploring the dark sides of life with Mr. Bechard's fascinating creative and realistic view of life and the characters in it.
