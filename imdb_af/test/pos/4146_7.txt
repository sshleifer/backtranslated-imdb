Where do I start Saying how big the cinematography is. Praise some scenes that show the directors' creativity. Tell me how realistic the scenes are on Ellis Island. I must mention that for a change we do not have the cliché scene to view the Statue of Liberty. (By now, immigrants who see the image of the shipping lane are a cliché). Now it's not nice, two important things, one is a modern song and not even a good one. <Br /> <br /> Second and almost deadly, the film is boring, it moves so slowly, that the look of paint drying will be an improvement. <br /> <br /> The 118 minute duration is too long and yet the movie seems unfinished. We see no scenes of this family in the US. Our hero mentioned that he wanted to find his twin brother, I would have had screens of his useless or perhaps happy search, instead of other stretched scenes. <br /> <br /> The movie is nearby. <br /> <br /> Ratings *** (out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
