Hong Kong, the 1920s. A young poor man starts dreaming to be a hero and spends most of his time learning and learning about kung fu and bodybuilding, much against his father's will. He helps a maid's girl to escape from a relentless businessman, whose governor then comes behind them and terrorizes the young man's uncle's noodle restaurant. The uncle seems to be an old, reformed Triad killer, now helping the young man to become martial arts skill. It's all out of Karate Kid style with "was the wok" instead of "was up, was off". The kungfu villain is the relentless businessman's son, who has a branded scorpion style that looks cool, but it's quite stupid and certainly totally unrealistic. <br /> <br /> But the story, which evolves over time, has an epic feel. , good characterization, big kung fu and is generally very entertaining. The young hero is very sympathetic and offers a good protagonist to root. However, the romantic dimension remains undeveloped, which is a bit disappointing. Otherwise, a good movie. <br /> <br /> My rating: 8 out of 10.
