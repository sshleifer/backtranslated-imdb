It was a while since I saw Cold Mountain, but I knew I enjoyed it so much. Although this is happening during the last days of the American civil war, it's not really a war movie. It's more of a romance / drama. . And it mostly works because of the performances. Usually I don't like Nicole Kidman, but I liked it here. I thought she was very convincing in her role. I also like Rene Zelwegger, who am I usually not a fan of.Jude Law is good as usual. The supporting cast.there are some great supporting performances her, too much to mention. There is also some breathtaking scenery in the film. And there are also some very nice music pieces. The story is sad and harassed with a tragedy, but it is beautifully done telling story. For me, Cold Mountain is an 8/10
