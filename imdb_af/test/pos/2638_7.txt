_The Wild Life_ has a clear agreement with _Fast Times at Ridgemont High_, and _The Wild Life_ comes short. <br /> <br /> ------------ <br /> <br /> Other posts have written the above comments. Of course the Wild Life is not Ridgemont. Ridgemont is the distinctive 80's movie. Wildlife is, however, enjoyable if you are not smart about mindless movies that are incessant movies (especially if you know it's supposed to be a sensible movie in the first place). The little Latino of Scarface is in this movie and he is justly disrespectful ("I have Visa ... Masterrrrr Charrrrge !!") The Colonel also makes an appearance ("Attorney ..."). RIP The colonel 1931-1997. <br /> <br /> This movie is no worse than a 6 compared to other genres, VAT. It's not worse than a 7 in terms of other 80's against comedies on that. It has a lot of the feel of a Cameron Crowe movie. Only stanels gave it a 5.
