Vanaja (2006), written and directed by Rajnesh Domalpalli, is an extraordinary film from South India. Mamatha Bhukya plays 15-year-old Vanaja, who lives in a rural setting with her loving but alcoholic father. If she is to succeed in life, she must overcome the burdens of low caste and poverty. <br /> <br /> I went to the movie and expect the depiction of a miserable girl broken by society. This is not what "Vanaja" shows us. The young woman is attractive, intelligent and ambitious. She will not accept her fate with tears or simple resignation. She wants to succeed, and it is never clear that she will not succeed, despite the chance. <br /> <br /> The acting that Mr. Domalpalli, from his amateur movie, is wonderful. Mamatha Bhukya is outstanding in the title role, and Urmila Dammannagari does an exceptional job as a wife. Rama Devi, the rich landowner who is a former well-known classic dancer. <br /> <br /> In the film, Vanaja teaches South Indian classical dance, as she did in real life. I couldn't tell how good Vanaja's dance was by Indian standards, but the many danstone were spell binding. (Don't think Bollywood - it's classical dance. It's also very different from ballet, because in ballet the dancer shifts her heels off the floor. In Sound Indian dance, the heel is the primary point of contact.) <Br /> < br /> This is a movie that should not be missed. It will work on DVD, but will be better on a theater screen, as the dance will be better shown. However, if DVD is your only option then see it. Just be sure to see it.
