I watched this movie at the Seattle International Film Festival in a full house of keen film buffs and Indian ex-pats. The movie is incredibly beautiful and smooth for a first movie. The direction is self-assured, especially with locals recruited on the plane for extras and bits. While the plot and story line is elementary to non-existent, the lack of pleasure to look at the performances and scenery is offset. The soundtrack of this movie is a great attraction for world music lovers. If you want to see what can be done within 45 days, with a different place every day, check out Hari Om for inspiration. It has not been announced in the Q&A, but I think Hollywood can take a lesson in film budget by teaching this director.
