My wife and I saw it when we were 17. The only good thing my dad ever did (come in). This is "our movie" and the music is "our songs". Michelle's song is "our" song. Yes, these days, it's a crime to show naked children on the screen, but we're scorching at 16, why not these kids? The film is rich young man, which increases poor girlfriends, and then the rich father falls to the end of her way after she has poor birth. She was left alone with the child. It's a love story and a "growing" story. The music is fantastic, and the story is one that someone can link to. Maybe it will be available on DVD someday.
