It is well known that Irene Dunne can sing a little more than a little. And I think her talent as a comedian can only really be understood once you've hit and succeeded by a sonata by Haydn or a song by Debussy. Her instrument is her voice and her handling of it is pure musicality. She can tackle any part. The only thing she couldn't do was not make it successful. This movie is a perfect example. In this, she can be Rut Gordon (because the play is the thing), is feminine, charming, deliberate and self-sufficient, generous, protective and versatile, but never pretentious. She succeeds in staying so credible as Alexander Knox is in another difficult role he assumes with aplomb. The viewer must believe in what he sees and cares about. It is refreshing to watch a film that is both entertaining and intellectually challenging while pushing all the right patriotic buttons. I sincerely hope that the entire Dunne oeuvre will make it one day on DVD because it is really difficult to keep such a secret under just a few initiatives.
