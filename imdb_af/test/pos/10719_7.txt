I saw this movie on 3 different occasions. At the first opportunity I was bowled through this movie. It saw me as a very good movie. I hated this movie as a sentimental rubbish on my second show. But my third look. reaffirm my belief that this is a good movie. There is a lot of emotional power in this movie, especially scenes of emotional confrontation between Mr Kramer and Mrs Kramer. There are some scenes in which Meryl Streep looks like a cruel person, despite the fact that she is a beauty in real life. Dustin Hoffman looks like a lost hero who is unable to struggle with the recent task of his child's oversight. There was even a controversy over the sets of this movie. According to master cameraman Nestor Almendros, there was a shot in which he just escaped as the character of Mr. Kramer, to show the intensity of his anger, decides to break a glass. Just nothing happened to Nestor. Kramer versus Kramer shows the destruction of a family structure. It also tells how fa Mily should be maintained if children are involved.
