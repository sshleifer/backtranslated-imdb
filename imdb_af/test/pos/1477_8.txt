From the beginning you love Sam Elliott's character (Falon): a trusted policeman who is especially faithful to his partner. But too loyal and too revengeful when he saw his mate dead in a lane, he then killed what he thought to be the attacker before giving him the chance to explain. Falon is an alcoholic, and it tends to stop him from being self-controlled, although he manages to draw his attention to finding who is really behind his partner. He is joining a newcomer as his new partner (who is often seen in movies), but Esai Morales does well with Sam Elliot, although confusing pieces start to fit where Morales begins a self-approved investigation into Falon. he wants to find the answers mainly, since Fallon does not let him come across the story and does not like what he finds. There is no last minute to point out who the bad detectives are, what is right; and they can't swing Falon to join them, leading to a dramatic end. Fine acting completely, with a touch of humor from Paul Sorvino who is the captain of detectives. It's a good movie that will show you several times to see it; so it qualifies as a sleeveless watch, and a great addition to a movie collection! (Filmed in San Francisco)
