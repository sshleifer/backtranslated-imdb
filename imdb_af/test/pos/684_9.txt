"Shivering Shakespeare" can be considered the first classic of the "Our Gang" talkie era. By now, Hal Roach Studios has begun to make their pace to make pictures, and "Shakespeare" is the lucky result. <br /> <br /> The gang appears in a version of Quo Vadis manufactured by Kennedy, Cop's wife. The children do not find the play very fun to be in and are distracted by people in the theater and cannot remember their lines. Among the funniest bits is Kennedy the Cop as the giant, pulling off his makeup to fight a war man in a bull costume. and the dreadful dance girl (played by director Bob McGowan's daughter.) <br /> <br /> Several movie cartoons mention that "Shakespeare" has the first pistolherd in a talkie. This can be true, as they tried different speeds with the movie during the battle. Buster Keaton's brother Harry is at the receiving end of one of the pies. Very funny and early Gang talkie classic. 9 out of 10.
