I was totally surprised at how well this movie is, because when I first saw it, I was just amused. However, I have to say that I'm still very disappointed that Donald O'Connor didn't give a bigger and better role! He was a great talent. <br /> <br /> There is a good chemistry among all the main guests and Matthau has never been harder. <br /> <br /> I'm delighted that this photo was made because we saw Lemmon and Matthau team for the very last time. in a vehicle that puts their talent to great use. Brent Spiner proves that "Star Trek's" Data "is not the only good character he can play next. <br /> <br /> The storyline is really simple, but the comedy and characters work really well and I laughed heartily through this movie and I highly recommend it.
