Classe Tous Risques (The Big Risk) is a French gangster movie that doesn't try for style. That's why it has style. Because the movie is so underplayed and so matter, it is becoming increasingly involved. And since Abel Davos is played by Lino Ventura, we are emotionally invested in this taciturn, tough killer who loves his wife and children. He met with the customs agencies in the neighborhood near Nice, which we also didn't expect and who proves just as willing to shoot a policeman or a traitor with so little emotion as to put some ribbon out store. We first met Davos in Italy with his wife and their two little boys, one of about 9 and one 4. <br /> <br /> "This man was Abel Davos, condemned to death," we are told. "He's been looking at his resources for years, even if his anxiety kept him going. With the Italian police closing in every day, France was again his best bet. Maybe he's forgotten." <br /> <br /> Davos was a best gangster in Paris who cared for his friends. It was a few years ago. A whore to give him money to return to France is going very wrong. Now he goes away with his two children. He called his friends in Paris to help him. He and his children have to come from Nice to Paris, but the police are looking for him and they have set up roadblocks. For Davos's two best friends, the time passed and they continued. They don't want to put themselves at risk, and for what? Obligation may give warning. They hire a young thief, Eric Stark (Jean-Paul Belmondo), to pick up Davos and the kids in an ambulance, then drive to Paris to Paris and hide the kids. We are on a journey where Davos's options are increasingly limited, where he has to find ways to care for his children, where he realizes there are no ties of friendship where betrayal is likely to occur and, where possible, left his only friend. is Eric Stark. <br /> <br /> This somewhat cynical movie works so well because it does its job without thinking about it. There are no trench coats with drawn collars, no toying with the melodrama of the gangster code so many French directors loved. Classe tous Risques gives us Abel Davos, a man who has ever been someone, who is now down to no one and who reacts with violence and resignation. <br /> <br /> Lino Ventura dominates the movie, but if he joins Jean-Paul Belmondo, a curious chemistry takes place. Ventura as Davos is grim and worried about caring for his sons. He is humiliated by his situation. He is a difficult man who sees someone kill if it is only needed as part of the business he is involved in. Belmondo as the young thief who was initially sent to be a best driver and a friend is to count on, offers the brightness that keeps the movie from being lifted once again. Belmondo was 27 and looks younger. His unlikely strength as a main actor - broken nose, under-folded jaw - shines to the right of the screen. He makes Erik a game for Ventura when they share a scene. And Belmondo's plays with Liliane (Sandra Milo), the young woman who becomes his girlfriend, radiates charm and a good sexual appeal. The end is bittersweet fate, and without a silent stance. We hear Davos say, "Abel is gone. There's nothing left." It would be worth looking at Classe tous Risques to learn what he meant. <br /> <br /> There are many good French gangster movies. I want to place one there right at Touchez Pas au Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur. To see one of Lino Ventura's top performances, see Army of Shadows.
