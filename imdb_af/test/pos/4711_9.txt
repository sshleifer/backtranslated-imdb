I'm afraid I should add my name to the long list of people staying flabbergasted that this movie hasn't been released (Sept 2007) on DVD. This is one of the mysteries that make the mind fall, especially if you have the amount of DVDs available today that contain material years ago. Yet I have an excellent digital VHS copy in English with subtitles and Nicam Stereo, so my qualm is one of the principles as a frustration not to see the movie. Regarding the film itself, it is an excellent all-round with good image quality, more than satisfactory soundtrack, vibrant plot that includes tension, emotion, sadness, frustration, good and exotic environment (for a European). How the movie fits reality in Burma, I have no idea, and it's less important. The essential thing is that entertaining, it's a success. One is soon attached to each main character and I admit that I have my heart during the final cross-river-scene in my mouth. It is a pity that we hear so little about countries like Burma and this film gives at least some insight into the country. Has the situation changed since 1995? The events that occur later this month seem to be answering a resounding no and the regime seems to be as cruel as ever, not even saving the lives of monks, let alone women or children!
