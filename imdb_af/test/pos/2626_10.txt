I remember seeing this movie 34 years ago and it was full of tension and twist. It grabs you at the beginning and keeps you guessing throughout the movie. Over the past few years I have been thinking of this movie and watching video stores to see if it is available, but it could never be found or anyone who even heard it. I think this type of movie is timeless, and I know it will be enjoyed by a whole new generation of movie viewers. I hope it will be on video soon as it will be fun to see if it has the same impact on me as it did in the early 70's. <br /> <br /> It is very rare that a TV movie can make that impression so much, but it has been done and still does so many years.
