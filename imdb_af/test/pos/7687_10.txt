I remember seeing this movie as a child in the 60's. It took my breath away when I was young. I was glued to my seat in front of the black and white TV. The throw was one of the best I saw in my life. The musical was one of the greatest ever written. Please keep the Gershwin and Goldwyn families please on video or DVD so that the generations can come to know what I have done so many of us when we saw this wonderful artwork. Not this great man's work has gone unnoticed for years. I, I pray and hope that the hearts of these families will become soft and the world will see this awesome movie again.
