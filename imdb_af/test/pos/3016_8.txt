I don't want to criticize the movie I think - for a big budget movie - very exceptional and daring. <br /> <br /> I just wanted to point out that I love the studios very much the policies and laws of different states that treat their viewers like children. In the database, we find at least 4 different versions of the movie on time. But of course it is likely that there are many more cuts. <br /> <br /> The result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie (unless you live in Argentina where the movie runs 115 minutes that sounds quite like it). <br /> <br /> Later on DVD and Video we try to rob us further by selling a suspected director's cut. There is already such a version in Germany, running about 110 minutes). <br /> <br /> It will be nice if the studios will not only think of the cash they make with their movies, but also think of their products as artwork, even at the risk of an unfavorable rating, so that as a viewer I should not be deceived and taken seriously, not just as a resource of money.
