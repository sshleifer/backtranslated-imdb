I was a fan of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmednson since I can remember the children or the bottom. and I just have to say I've never laughed so much in my life !!! Guest house paradiso is bloody brilliant! I know it won't be everybody's cup of tea (with vomiting, slapstick comedy, violence and foul language), but just don't see if it's not yours. It's not like no one knows what sick and distorted things Rik and Ade come up with when they work with each other !! I think it's unfair that this movie got such a slap from critics because, and I don't think I'm the only one to think about it, this movie is 10 out of 10! :)
