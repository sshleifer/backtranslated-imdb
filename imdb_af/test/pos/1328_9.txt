Ocean's twelve are probably better than Ocean's eleven. I know most people will disagree, but I really liked it. After three years it was good to see the gang back. The reason behind the heist is a little more inspired the second time. I see why they stole in Benedict (Andy Garcia) in the last movie. This film has a little more motivation for the second time. Ocean's twelve are more entertaining, and cooler than Ocean's students. With a funny cameo by Topher Grace saying, "I just walked into the new Dennis Quaid movie" and other things. I think Ocean's Twelve is probably the best in the series. <br /> <br /> The plot: A year or so after Ocean's Twelve, Terry Benedict (the man who robbed them in the last movie) returned and said that Ocean's eleven didn't pay him the money they stole No, he's gonna call the police. So Danny Ocean and the gang go to Europe, where Rusty meets his old cop girlfriend Isabelle. After meeting him again, she began to follow them. Also, the gang teaches that they have an enemy who is also a thief who is a little better than they are. <br /> <br /> With lots of funny scenes like when Tess (Julia Roberts) goes to Europe and pretends to be Julia Roberts, Ocean's Twelve is a nice clever movie. It's cooler, harder, and more entertaining than Ocean's students.
