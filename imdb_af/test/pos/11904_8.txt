This movie is the Latino Godfather. An unlikely gangster bridges the gap for some unlikely alliances and forms an empire. I enjoyed the action and gunfighting with the brash-acting and colorful characters. This movie is not an Oscar winner, but definitely entertaining. Hey, who needs an Oscar? <br /> <br /> Chapa has a few balls to direct and act (I think he made it too?) This movie. Remind me of another movie maker who likes to do it all, Robert Rodrigez. Keep it up, is there a persecution in the works? There are a lot of strings to be tied up. Boy coming back and leaving father's death?
