RENDITION is a movie that should not be missed with fixed writing by Kelley Sane and with the direction of Gavin Hood, which takes us on a story that is a ride through a man's journey through hell. Once again, Meryl Streep in a convincing role of the CIA today and great performances of a film by superlative actors in Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhall and Alan Arkin, along with Middle Eastern descent actors, the reality of the story add. /> <br /> In RENDITIE you see how "terrorism can provoke terrorism" and as the film progresses to link the story to what is playing in the Middle East, reality is brought on the screen. The external shots add to the intensity of the story and Peter Sarsgaard does a brilliant job of playing an assistant in the "ass kissing" way of American politics. There is no bigger audience for this film, and RENDITION plays with the THE VALLEY OF ELAH and LIONS FOR LAMBS an important role to show an audience how the fight for and protection of democracy can seriously deceive.
