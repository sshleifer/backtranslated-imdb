I recently read the story to see how these two match, and if you can believe it, this role improves on Balzac. The story is surrounded, I think, to dispel the idea that Colonel Chabert is a man who has suffered a lot and yet he comes home, not a hero, but as an outcast. <br /> <br /> As someone mentioned, I was initially confused when Chabert was related to The Return of Martin Guerre. No. It is firmly established by Balzac that Chabert is the real deal. What is interesting, however, is not he is, but how his wife and society treat him. <br /> <br /> I think it's a timeless story of men who are going to fight for their country and when they get home, they have left the time. Chabert is a tragic figure that has been increasingly named by the incredible Gerard Depardieu. I don't mind being in 1 million movies, he's fascinating. <br /> <br /> Fanny Ardant has a terrible character to play. Once a prostitute, Rose used her female will to climb the social ladder. Are her emotions true for Compte Ferraud? I think they are and perhaps with her social status at that time, and you start to feel empathy for her. <br /> <br /> Fabrice Lucini is slowly worming in my heart. He is exceptional here as Derville. <br /> <br /> If you can get your hands on this jewel of a movie, you won't be sorry. French cinema at its best.
