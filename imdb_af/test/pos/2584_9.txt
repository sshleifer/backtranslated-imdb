I watched this movie at the first show available in my area, and it was clear that most people didn't get the movie. Even if you don't, it's a good movie with some interesting character development. It is a thorough human story about some very imperfect people in a southern village of the backwood, and really speaks to the root of the blues. If you don't know what the "Black Snake Moon" is by the time you leave the theater, you haven't found it. And no. It's not just a song. Christina Ricci does a good job and is very convincing in her role, such as Samuel L Jackson. I think it's been his best performance since his role in Pulp Fiction, and probably his best, including because of the magnitude of his character in BSM. The rest of the film is solid, with some clean appearances here and there, especially John Cothran Jr. as Reverend RL. I am a very selective movie keeper, and this film honestly honors my favorites because of his open-minded view of race, sex, religion and neurosis in a rural southern town, along with his movie-like genius, in my opinion.
