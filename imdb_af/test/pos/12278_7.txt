Cult filmmaker Corbucci's scarcity of his thirteen spaghetti westerns (of which I was just left with WHAT I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE REVOLUTION [1972]) is one that I recently only via Marco Giusti's "Stracult" guide; It is an atypical dark genre jewel in the style of the director's own masterpiece, THE GREAT SILENCE (1968). It is filled with desert-like snowscapes. <br /> <br /> Johnny Hallyday, the French Elvis Presley, whom I first saw in Jean -Luc Godard's DETECTIVE (1985) is a peculiar but highly effective choice to play the lonely dermis Hud (what, such as Clint Eastwood's The Man With No Names of Sergio Leone's celebrated "Dollars Trilogy", equipped with a steel plate armor for protection); By the way, I met Hallyday's beautiful daughter, Laura Smet, at the 2004 Venice Film Festival, but was deduced by the presence of her esteemed director, Claude Chabrol! Gastone Moschin is another curious addition to the fold (which pretty much serves the same function as Frank Wolff did in the BIG SILENCE), but satisfies himself well and is amusingly clumsy in the presence of a bath Francoise Fabian; The latter then plays a greedy nymphomania of a banker's widow who deceives everyone and others in pursuit of her goals. Sylvie Fennec has the other great female role as a farm girl who looks after Hallyday and is fed at one point in the Free Love by 'hippie' Apache Gabriella Tavernese (with this mind, it is noteworthy that the movie features surprising but welcome from nudity from both Fabian and Tavernese)! By the way, the anachronistic addition of a lot of long-haired youths (who are also involved in smokers and revolutionary talks) is a somewhat half-baked effort against contemporary relevance ?? But it all adds up to the fun (moreover, even the black barmaid sports an Afro hairstyle!). <br /> <br /> Also, Mario Adorf enjoys himself immensely with the small-scale role of a larger-than-the-life Mexican bandit with the nickname "El Diablo" ?? that keeps a youthful biographer on its side (an element that influenced Clint Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN [1992] and challenged one captive Moschin at one point at a time! After mentioning it, the movie also contains a lot of unusual "weapon of death"? as Hallyday has an opponent by kicking the cash register of the salon in his face! As always, the enjoyable false fist fights are accompanied by excessive sound effects; equally typical of the genre, however, is the erratic Angelo Francesco Lavagnino's score is an important asset, and in fact the ambiguous end is in line with the movie's general gloomy tone - after Fabian's arrival in the hands of locals, the hippies (who previously diagnosed Hud) suddenly wounded him when the city was wounded and terrorized (all forced on the street and undecided) ?? but the indisputable armed man succeeds in raising himself to meet their challenge (they say cry away with the prospect of meeting him!) and then drive out of town and leave Fennec behind. <br /> <br /> Finally, I got it through a good widescreen print in Italian, though with French credits and occasionally decaying? about one minute screen time in everyone? In the French language (where the original soundtrack was apparently not available).
