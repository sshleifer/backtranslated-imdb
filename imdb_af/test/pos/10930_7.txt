The mere presence of Sam Waterston as an Indian is enough to place this movie in the must-see category. He is both beautiful and very subtle, with no lines whatsoever. He is angry with his kidnapper, and yet we can see that he is one of the most proud of all young Indian men. Martin Sheen is just a dumb vault that decides to challenge Waterston (White Bull) for a beautiful white horse. Other subplots are really unnecessary. I don't understand the role Caroline Langrishe played, as the poor girl kidnapped by White Bull ... I don't know how to keep her hands off this beautiful Indian man! However, it is very fun; especially if you are a Waterston fan. Man, he looks good in this one !!! Harvey Keitel's role is not even worth mentioning, to tell the truth! But, rent it and enjoy! Actually, I believe that if the music score was better, it would have been a more dramatic movie ... the music is so bad it is distracting. Yet - there is Mr. Waterston!
