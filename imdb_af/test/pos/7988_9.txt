When I first rented Batman Returns, I immediately thought it would be less than exceptional. I mean, Jack Nicholson was undoubtedly the best part of the first, so without him, how can a good movie be? Simply, throw in Danny DeVito. <br /> <br /> Batman Returns is a probably more dark movie than Batman. There are more villains here, less real dark comedy in many aspects, and more nervous issues. However, the music is similar to the first if it is not darker. The landscape is definitely more depressed than the first, every detail until the time of the year. This movie follows the same comic-style format that we loved in the first Batman. <br /> <br /> Now for the performances. Michael Keaton gratefully returns as Batman / Bruce Wayne. He was big in the first movie, and just as much in this sequel. There was not enough screen time in the world for Keaton as Batman, needed MORE! Danny DeVito delivered an award-winning performance as The Penguin, the most cruel, disgusting, loving, angry, angry, sad, pathetic villain ever to enjoy a superhero movie. You hate him so much, but feel so bad to him at the same time. And it also explains him in the smallest detail, and makes it all the more conflict. Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as Catwoman / Selina Kyle. Two completely different personalities in one. She actually got a good amount of stories. Christopher Walken did not disappoint as Max Shreck, the greedy, judgmental, self-employed CEO of the power company. Michael Gough is also grateful to return as the lovely Alfred, and he was as good here. Pat Hingle also comes back as Gordon, although I feel he was never in the spotlight. <br /> <br /> With very large twists and sub-graphs, Batman Returns is surely any fan of the original. /> <br /> 9/10
