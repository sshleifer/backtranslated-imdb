I've lost count of the times I've seen this movie, but I love it and find it very funny every time I see it. The facial expressions, slapstick humor and the timing on the jokes make it wonderful. The characters, especially "Nitro", "Sonar" and "Stepanik" are hilarious. I thought Kelsey Grammar, Rip Torn and Bruce Dern did a good job. In fact, I think this movie was thrown perfectly. I think it should be released in DVD before carrying out my VHS version.
