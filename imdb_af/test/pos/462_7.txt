Good performance, really good acting, and the director lets us swim in an interesting and unpredictable way through his story, especially as it is essentially two people in a room. It does not run like many modern movies, but it does not. Bohl is flippant enough to believe her in the "now" of her character, who is still involved and does not go back to her career choices. That's why it's credible without her deep, self-examination of her soul ... Brundage has the delicate balance of weight, innocence, meekness and class to make Buddy very good. A little grainy on film quality, but it fits the tone of the story. Can use a little polish on the hair and make-up end of things, but definitely worth watching.
