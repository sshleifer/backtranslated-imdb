I saw some movies in my time, but this one is exceptional. You should see it more than once to truly appreciate it, it is emotionally complex, it explores love and passion at the most extreme, and that's cinematography is just breathtaking. The character of the spade is intensely passionate and tragic without having to lift his voice or indeed leave his bed, the movie is perfectly thrown and perfectly perfected. The film has some sort of mathematical accuracy and perfection that is rare. It combines action, love, tragedy, drama and politics into one. This movie is unacceptable, all the hype around it and all the awards can't begin to do it right. Hats off to Michael Ondaatje for writing the incredible book on which it is based.
