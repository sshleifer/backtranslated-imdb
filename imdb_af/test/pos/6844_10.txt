Sure, there are things here that the Coens and Elmore Leonard have done before, but what? If you want entertaining, fun and smart - "Judas Kiss" is near perfect. Prudes that are insulted by the tongue in cheek pore do not get it. (Talk about how to get your sex and violence out of the way - keep your investors happy. This is independent filmmaking 101). As the British make a bundle, I doubt it a lot. This movie is obviously a labor of love and the budget is probably not half of Mr. Tarantino's salary. Perhaps guys don't like as much as women. I thought it shook. Go Coco!
