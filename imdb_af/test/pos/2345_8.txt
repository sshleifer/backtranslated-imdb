One Life Stand is a perfect movie production that doesn't receive the credit it deserves. The 1.7 IMDB score doesn't make it fair and is perhaps due to the few ratings it had rather than the quality of the movie itself. Shot on digital in black and white, the film is geared towards production values ​​that believe its harmful budget. The performances are excellent, especially those of Gary Lewis that get better with each role. My only criticism is that it is a bit long-lasting and can do more humor with the darker moments. Overall, however, this is a good job.
