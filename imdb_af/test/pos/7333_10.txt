It's one of a lot of movies with fantastic acting, wonderful story line and worth watching. It's about life changes. It's about how happiness can be found if one is faithful to yourself. It's about accepting yourself and others. It's about life challenges. It's about the coming term with reality. It's about courage. It's about love. Both actresses are very loyal to their role. The actresses had very good chemistry in the movie. This is the key to the movie that made the movie. It is rare to see an independent film like this one. One can tell the hard work the movie staff had while producing this movie. I wish to see more movie from this producer / writer. See the movie, you will love it.
