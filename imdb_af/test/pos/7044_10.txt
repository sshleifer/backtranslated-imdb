Meatballs work in conversations, like no other movie. Especially during the summer. Whether it's the song about the CITs (Training In Training) or the cut-off or the inspirational Rudy the Rabbit or It's just not matter ... it appears! Poor Mickey / Morty, who knows where he would wake up next!?! Such a great picture of the seventies and a cultural icon for my generation of those who understand that non-PC is really funny, no matter who you are! Wiele and Spaz are favorites, just like the hot dog eating match with the well-known line "what ..? No mustard?" Oh, how many times did I repeat that line and the only one laugh! Thanks to the authors, actors and directors! Applause, applause!
