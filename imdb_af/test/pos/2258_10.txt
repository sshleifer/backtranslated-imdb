This movie was one if it wasn't the best movie I've seen in the past year, I highly recommend it, it starts out as a very funny movie, but as the film progresses into so much more. Do yourself a favor and see this movie. I've seen a show of this movie, but I'm not just buying it for myself, but for some real movie friends I have the unfortunate feeling that this great movie will be widely unrecognizable like that with so many other non-commercial movies is a comic but heartbreaking movie, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you think and yes, you will think about it when it's over and that's not what a good movie is not!
