It may be the television series with the greatest potential of any series around. The production values ​​are in a class of their own. The characters are rounded and interesting. It's fun at its best. Some of the strangers are quite grotesque, but there is an underlying humor that makes it impossible. I hope this series will last for many years and will have many spin-offs. Science fiction had its bad press, some are justified, but it's really a flagship science fiction series and I thank Henson for it. Top Points.
