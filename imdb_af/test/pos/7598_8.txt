After I watched this movie, I realized Drew Barrymore was a great actress. This movie could not be seen without Drew. The fact that someone is as attractive as Drew can actually cut me off, and she did when she was Josie Grossie. Her attempts to "transition" as the cool girls call it, were hilarious, especially her trying to dance at the nightclub. <br /> <br /> We also had SNL favorite, Molly Shannon, who plays a big role as Anita, Josie's best friend. One of the funniest scenes in the movie was Anita to teach class sex ed. It was one of Mollys' finest performances and the best. <br /> <br /> Leelee Sobieski also played a big role and I really felt her knowing people like her who were so tortured. <br /> <br /> This movie is a must for Drew Barrymore fans, because Drew is making the movie.
