Bedrooms and Hallways was one of the funniest films of the 1999 Melbourne Film Festival. From the UK it's about a young crowd of roommates and their different relationship dilemmas. Much of the humor is centered around a new-year-old men's self-help group where they are passed through various implements such as rock of truth. They also go on a "hunter-gathering" weekend with hilarious results. Believe me, you will let go of your teeth.
