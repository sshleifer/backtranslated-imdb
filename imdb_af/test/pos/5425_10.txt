Richard Condie is a Canadian wonder, and one that needs to be shared with the world. Whether it's about early work, like 'At the beginning' and the Oscar-nominated 'Track' by 'The Apprentice' and the digitally made La Salla, Condie is a valuable local hero. But no single work puts a mark on his career like 'The Big Snit'. And did I mention that it was nominated for an Oscar? Darn tootin '. <br /> <br /> "The Big Track", although it was clearly a dated message carrier from the 1980s (the short twists around the Cold War investigation nuclear destruction, but don't worry, it's hilaries like hell), It has greater significance, just like most of Condie's work in an underestimated way. While the planet shouts for the cover of Armageddon, a few bikers over each other's boring habits (in true Condie fashion, he picks up the furniture while she really shakes her eyes). And don't forget to watch it again and again, 'cuz, there's always something to look at. Condie uploads this fella with numerous visual gags and unforgettable catch phrases. <br /> <br /> I encourage this incredible piece of animation, being tracked. In Canada, it is usually seen in a National Film Board video that includes other star trousers (including fellow Winnipegger Cordell Barker's equally funny "The Cat Came Back"). Americans will only have to dig a little deeper, but stick to it? The reward is worth it.
