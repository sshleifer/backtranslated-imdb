Epic early film directed by D.W. Griffith. Mae Marsh, her little sister, and their dogs were left - they had to live with an uncle. On board their coach is the young couple Lillian Gish and Robert Harron, who celebrate the birth of their first child. The coach arrives in Elderbush Gluch. Marsh's uncle tells her she can't keep the dogs and they are poured out. There are Indians near Native Americans; And, Indians love dog food (not joking?). These Indians are hungry! Lionel Barrymore is sympathetic to Mrs. Marsh, and wants to help her recover the runaway dogs. While the puppies are being rescued, an Indian is shot causing a Cowboys confrontation with Indians. <br /> <br /> This Saga of the American West is definitely an important film; However, the reputable Griffith artists begin to persuade their hands, and the story is cut. Many of the Griffith elements are in place - some good, and some bad. "The Battle of Elderbush Gluch" obscures the later epic, "Birth of a Nation". <br /> <br /> ******* The Battle of Elderbush Gulch (3/28/14) D.W. Griffith ~ Mae Marsh, Robert Harron, Lillian Gish
