I will admit that the first time I got Sci-Fi's "Sci-Fi Prime" last week, but despite the fact that I was a great Sliders fan coming into the experience, Farscape is now easily my favorite of the four shows. <br /> <br /> Unlike most modern Sci-Fi programs (including unfortunately the two new Star Trek ranges), this display retains fun without going over for MST3K feeds.
