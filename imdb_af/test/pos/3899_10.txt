William H. Macy is awesome in this Alfred Hitchcock-esque movie. Macy stars as a film critic who accidentally kills one of his girlfriends. The characters that are followed are hilarious. James Cromwell gives a tremendous performance as an extortionist private detective. As always, Macy is incredibly funny and gives a phenomenal performance. See this movie when and watch your video stores because it's one you don't want to miss.
