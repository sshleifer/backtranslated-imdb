Watch this movie at a local festival, the Silver Sprocket International Film Festival Florida. What a lovely movie. A simple, uncomplicated morality story about a young care free young man who should take responsibility for his actions. It wasn't pretentious or flashy, my two teenage girls loved it and for a change I was not ashamed of any of the movie content or language. A real family movie and the best British comedy movie I've seen since Billy Elliot. The filming did not surprisingly win the top festival awards from Best Film and Best Director. Ten out of ten.
