At the same time, John Russell played the owner of the farm Nathan Burdette and is trying to release his good brother Claude Akins from Sheriff John Wayne in Rio Bravo. He was on the other side of the law on television. These years were probably the highlight of Russell's career, his most famous screen role and his most famous television roles, Marshal Dan Troop of Laramie in Lawman. <br /> <br /> Russell holds law and order in Laramie the same way James Arness did it in Dodge City at Gunsmoke. Unlike Gunsmoke, Laramie never developed all the little characters that gave you the feel of Dodge City at the time. Instead, he concentrated on Russell to run business and teach the lawsuits to his eager young deputy Peter Brown. Brown played deputy Johnny McKay, who was a respectable young man, who constantly referred to his boss as Mr. Troop. He was pretty handy with a shooting stroke, but tended to be impulsive. The good thing was Marshal Troop. <br /> <br /> The other series regularly was the Kitty Russell of Laramie, Lily played by Peggie Castle. This is where Lawman looks most like Gunsmoke. There was an unspoken understanding between Russell and Castle that even the smallest children could not have missed. And I wasn't the smallest child when Lawman was in the first run. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Peggie Castle developed drug abuse problems after Lawman's run ended. I remember a small letter of death that overtook her in the first half of the seventies. She was one beautiful woman. <br /> <br /> Lawman was a good, nonsense western of that golden age of adult television western. It was one of the best.
