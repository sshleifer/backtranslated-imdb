I recommend this movie to everyone. My son and I first read the book and saw the movie. While the book was better (in my opinion) the movie was still big. My son and I agree that while we like the best of the book version, we keep the end of the movie better than the book ending. The scenery is just great and the soundtrack is a must. The fact that Jimmy Buffett plays a small role and offers music is an added bonus. Luke Wilson does a decent job in his role as officer Delinko and is almost what I thought Ms. Delinko would look like when I read the book. I'm surprised it didn't do better in the theaters, and I'll wait for the DVD to come out.
