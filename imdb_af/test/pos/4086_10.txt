TVs are honing true crime films annually. You can survive every Saturday on 3 or 4 every Saturday, and the Court TV can be trusted in a few days every weekend. So I started looking at The Morrison Murders. I knew very well what to expect: a more or less competent reselling of a real family murder. What I got was a subtle, beautiful play that captivated me from beginning to end. <br /> <br /> Both brothers were completely convincing and Jonathan Scarfe was perfect in the challenging role of Luke. The look and feel of Georgia was in virtually every framework. If I had any complaint, it was Gordon Clapp as the sheriff. He doesn't look or look like a small town southern lawyer named Byron Calhoun. He looks and looks like Medavoy, and Medavoy is not right for this part. <br /> <br /> But it's a small problem: The Morrison Murders are worth watching, not just on a rainy Saturday afternoon. If you go out, paste it. You won't regret it.
