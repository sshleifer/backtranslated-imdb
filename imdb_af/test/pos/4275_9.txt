As a local artist, I thought that "Grease" showed what Broadway producers are looking for and that it highlights a small portion of the acting population. Although my favorites did not win (but came second), I enjoyed comparing and seeing what I liked and where I could improve as an artist. <br /> <br /> They brought in Olivia Newton-John because she is the clear link between the Broadway production and television groups. <br /> <br /> They sang songs from the movie (Hopelessly Devoted, et al), because these songs will be included in the new production. <br /> <br /> I agree with the previous comment that the B'Way role looks so much older, but keep in mind that it's people who were on Broadway and worked their tails to be there. If the entire strip was green and fresh, then I believe it would have compromised the decision making process, allowing producers to choose their talent.
