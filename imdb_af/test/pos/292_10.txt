It is an apocalyptic vision of the hell of our present-day world. The social criticism of our levels of commercially oriented values ​​is what makes this film an exceptional vision of the "war is hell" cliché, underlined by a mystical journey to Cambodia by a special forces captain whose mission is to eliminate (with extreme prejudice) a villain colonel, who has left behind the army's concepts of justice to create his own world. When I saw the Apocalypse in 1980, I thought it was a deeply flawed masterpiece. In particular, I found the final segment of the journey with Brando, enclosing Conrad's Heart of Darkness, rather to be boring. I finally came around to see Apocalypse Now Redux and the bugs were taken care of. Redux makes the movie an absolute masterpiece, certainly among the top 100 movies ever made. Brando's performance is now full and complete, perhaps less secretive, but much more profound. Martin Sheen is brilliant at the heart of one of the best acting games ever. It's great to have a young Harrison Ford, Scott Glenn, and so on. Seeing in early screenings indicating which fine actors will eventually be recognized. The work of Robert Duvall, Fred Forrest, Lawrence Fishburne and Sam Bottoms is greatly enhanced by the additional footage. If you've never seen this movie, hit the original head and head straight to Redux. I wish we could get a New York Redux gang from Scorese to fill in all the gaps in the deeply defective potential masterpiece.
