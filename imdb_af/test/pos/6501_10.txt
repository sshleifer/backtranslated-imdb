just saw this movie and flown again. I've never been a big fan of scratching, but this movie has taken me from the getgo. It's listed as a documentary, but never really felt like one. (can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a documentary). It has a style and energy that is refreshing, informative and never too precious. The production values ​​were also there. (shot at movie with cool tracks and an incredible soundtrack). Overall a clever, entertaining and enlightening piece.
