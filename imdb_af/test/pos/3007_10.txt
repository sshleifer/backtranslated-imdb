I just started to watch The Show around July. I got it by accident, I was surfing the channel during a holiday. It's a good show, I just wish it wasn't that late at night. This is at 12:30. As a working person it makes it difficult to always look. <br /> <br /> I read a few comments. I did not agree with the late one on how not to grow up in the 60's and not to believe that these things could happen. <br /> <br /> I grew up in the 60's. I am Hispanic and I had a "White" boyfriend, plus we had black friends in high school. I believe people get together because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with a certain race or color. <br /> <br /> I can't wait for the show to go on DVD so I can buy it. So I see it from the beginning.
