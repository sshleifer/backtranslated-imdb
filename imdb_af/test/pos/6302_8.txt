The opening shot of the Consequences of Love perfects this intriguing and absorbing film. A traveler slowly carries a single focus figure to the camera and carries a large suitcase behind him. Like the central character in the film, we know nothing about him and our first interpretation of him, his profession, the contents of the bag can be off the mark. <br /> <br /> Consequences of Love are that kind of movie. From the title you might expect a Bergmanesq dissection of a relationship. What we have earlier is a main character, Titta, the life of the emotional exile, which apparently prefers to cut itself off from those around him. If the movie can be classified in any way, I call it a mystery as we are working out who Titta is and what he is about. What we know from the beginning is that he is 50s, cool, composed and expensive. He has lived in a soft Swiss hotel for the past eight years, always paying his roommate on time, but seldom has any interest in staff or other guests. <br /> <br /> His only real companions are some that he plays occasionally card games together. The couple, it turns out, owned the hotel, but have now chased everything away and just have the room they stay in left. Their love for money, antiques and each other was undone and Titta seems to identify with their destiny. He once had everything but now lives as a virtual prisoner in the hotel. His brother, a long haired surf instructor, falls in to see him occasionally, but he sees his visits as more of an intrusion than a pleasure. They talk about the person Titta sees as his best friend, although he hasn't seen him for 25 years. This long lost friend is now a telephone engineer, restoring the communication network that brings so much together. Tittas' phone calls to his wife and children end quickly when they refuse to talk to him. <br /> <br /> In the middle of the film, Titta makes an uncharacteristic move and opens to a young barmaid of the hotel. With his sentiment stunned by emotion, he sets himself on a career of actions that will eventually seal his fate for good. <br /> <br /> The slow deployment of Tittas is out of grace and is beautifully written, shot and recorded. The sounding techno soundtrack makes the tension stronger, as more and more secrets are revealed, the last half hour being a learned excitement. Titta slips his mask and has to face the consequences of his actions. The end, with a visual nod to Felini, is dramatic, but ambiguous and again raises the question of the audience. <br /> <br /> Patrick Bliss, 06/06/06
