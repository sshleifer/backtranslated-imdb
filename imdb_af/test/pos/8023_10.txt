Picture the scene: A bored student with an empty day before, a video store with a special offer of 5 videos for a week's rent. This ex-student usually grabbed a stack of videos of dubious quality for the most arbitrary reasons (The Turning Anybody?). Sometimes the strange undiscovered gem makes it into his video recorder. This is the case with this movie. Everything about the movie is good, but much more than that, the parts are all to scarce something - a good movie. Why it never has a British movie release is beyond me, especially if we are considering the shit we are having on the plywood week. Although I would be happy to accept it, it is not an Oscar material (but did not cost Titanic-schemaltzy cgi-tinged bollocks). It's a very enjoyable movie. I tried to think of a way to describe how well this movie should be appreciated / accepted. The perfect movie to watch while watching your father, after a holiday home, after a great Sunday afternoon.
