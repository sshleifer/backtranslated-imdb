First of all, I must say I really enjoy watching this movie. The way we follow the different people at the same time works perfectly, and that is one of those movies that really makes you think. <br /> <br /> Spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> The fact that the girls who kill themselves are the ones you don't see. That fact made me wonder because that's why she committed suicide in the movie. The director impressed me with that and made a movie suggesting the plot. heard and also delivered the message that not many people saw it. Some people may start talking about why no one did anything to stop it before she did it, but no one noticed her, just like no one who watched the movie, didn't ... know you, but I didn't guess it would be her who committed suicide. Have you? <br /> <br /> Greetings Jan
