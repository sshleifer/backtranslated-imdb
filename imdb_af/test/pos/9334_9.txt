For those who remember this video's initial impact, it will never be forgotten, and a sight of Thriller is all that is needed to feel twelve years old again. But while it's a good video, it's not perfect, although it looked right at the time. When this video came out for the first time, no one ever saw anything like it before. Now the music video medium has grown, and a fresh look from Thriller will reveal his mistakes. Why was it necessary to deconstruct the song? When Michael Jackson walks past the girl after they leave the kiosk, he sings all the verses of the song and beats the fever. After becoming a zombie, when it was time to sing him again, his zombie makeup is inexplicably disappearing, and he sings the chorus again, and again, and again, as if making up his previous absence. It may have been the first time a song has ever been discovered to fit the footage into a music video, but it certainly wasn't the last time. It remains a problem in the age of MTV. The best videos, such as Jackson's Billie Jean and Beat It, used visual instruments to serve the music, not the other way around. Yet, Thriller is fun, and an absolute must on Halloween.
