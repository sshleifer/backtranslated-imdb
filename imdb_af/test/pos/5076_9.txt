The film highlights the now and now abomination of "version" with a multi-cast trans-global account of everyone involved. No one is going lightly because we see the blindness of the players as they step out their own cut of the global game and work out hatred and misery on their "enemies" and themselves. <br /> <br /> The interaction between the sympathetic Senator's Aide (played in the brilliant style of Peter Sarsgaard) and the true Washington powermakers is electrifying. Meanwhile, in the field, the new CIA man (Jake Gyllenhaal) is going to torture through a sea shift in his attitude towards the US's newfound enjoyment. Suddenly, though his rejection of what he initially quietly condoned, one should ask why on earth will anyone who calls him or her stand and see if anyone is humiliated and abused in this way? The movie has few heroes. Perhaps Gyllenhaal's flawed and burgeoning CIA man is the exception and an indispensable concession to give the film some hope. <br /> <br /> Of course, the sad fact is that this movie doesn't fiction at all, but a wake-up call to those with a bunch of decency left over in them. The terrible truth is that in the UK and the US we have lost the moral plot and this film shows how low we are willing to go. All this in the name of freedom! There is a wonderful line in writing that torture is a safe way to swell the numbers of our enemies. It's already happening in real life and we have to listen to the message that this movie is using and our power and money are much more intelligent! The message seems to be that any of us claiming extradition, torture and the abuse of basic human rights are needed to protect our way of life is as unfair and stuttering as the jihadists and suicide bombings. <br /> All praise for the sensitivity of a talented South African director for the gross inequality of how power is exercised, and a film of mainstream actors from the US and beyond. Oh, and by the way, the film has a sting in its tail, with the end of a clever and thought-surprising surprise (which I won't throw away). <br /> <br /> I watched the movie in an early London preview so it hasn't been widely written yet, but I'm happy to say that the tide of less than glowing reviews seems to be. The BBC review was very supportive and they (and I) suspect that many of the negative comments come from those who see the world through the simple species of Hollywood - where the good guys and the bad guys are cardboard cuttings. Hence the reason that many of the really big films of the year are increasingly indie and / or non-american pix.
