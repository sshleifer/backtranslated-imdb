It is quite revealing to see it today and appreciate how far we've taken in what we expect from movies, and at the same time appreciate how many basic concepts have been set. <br /> <br /> Here's a full-featured narrative movie - the sound and footage are pushed to their times. The framework is limited to approximately belt-high and higher - no face close-ups. <br /> <br /> The compositions are remarkable; there is an early over-the-shoulder cross cutting scene to show the dialogue; there is a treacherous descent in a canyon with some disturbing perspective angles; a sun-bleached skeleton lies in the dust as the wheels and legs act in the upper part of the frame; the tension in the performance between the hero and the bad man is visually captured by filming above the long axis of a large tree lying between them; and over and over - early visual treatments are abundant. <br /> <br /> Today, it is disturbing to see how young Wayne carries a film, undecided by ego or manners. <br /> <br /> I wonder if Walsh acknowledged the self-referral: the subject is the journey of a diverse group of pilgrims; Those appearing on the screen are a diverse group of actors, vaudeville comedians, actors and, probably, meager barkers and ten-in-one veterans. They all travel to blow a route for how movies will be made. <br /> <br /> It is worth at least once to appreciate the source of so many visual ideas borrowed in later movies.
