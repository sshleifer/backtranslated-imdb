USA The movie is as follows: You take a lunch on a long hot Sunday afternoon. It feels good to close your eyes and let your worries drift away. Soon you will be lost in one of those intense, sweet dreams where you know you dream, but you still can't wake up - not what you want. You're going with the flow, and soon you'll be in a strange Alice in Wonderland story, complete with characters you didn't think you could dream of. They tell you all kinds of crazy things about war and peace while traveling through the past and even the future. <br /> <br /> The dream is getting heavier and you feel like it's going to be a path you can't control. Maybe you want to wake up, so you try to open your eyes, but you can't. Now there is destruction and sadness and confusion and scary voices telling you what the truth can be or lies. You see images that flash and change and then become clear, but do you even want to see what your brain creates for you? <br /> <br /> Eventually you are lost in a myth and you realize the end has come. The end of the world and the end of the dream. It's over. What do you wake up to? What are you doing next? <br /> <br /> Perhaps you'll write down that dream because you know that dreams don't happen too often - and when they do better, pay attention. <br /> <br /> Or maybe you break a beer and forget about the whole thing. Bad idea. Don't forget.
