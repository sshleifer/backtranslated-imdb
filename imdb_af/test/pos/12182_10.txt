Personally, I loved TRIS MOVIE! My best friend told me about it so I rented it out and watched it. It's great! The music, the play, the story leads the emotion, everything ... well, except for a small fact. Absolutely no loyalty to the books. I saw this movie before the interview with the Vampire and before I even knew that the books existed, I was shocked to find out how many people the movie really hated. I quickly noticed that the book fans weren't happy with the infidelity, but didn't want to be hypocritical (I hate the Harry Potter movies due to a lack of book loyalty). I stayed silent. Eventually I picked up "The Vampire Lestat" and immediately understood why everyone hated it. It's completely different (the film queen of the condemned is a combination of "The Vampire Lestat" and "The Queen of the Damned"). But I still loved the movie when I saw it before reading any of the books. So if you haven't seen this movie or read the book, first watch the movie or hate it. If you have read the book, you have every right to hate this movie.
