'The Big Snit' accidentally ended in my life and left an indelible point on my soul. A scar of love, destruction and futility that will be a part of my life forever. This is a story of beautiful futility. We are helpless without each other. We are helpless at government elections. We are helpless about the choices we all make when we fall in love. Deaf after the muttering and acts of a world outside the window. Blind to an inevitable apocalypse. Mute the hatred and greedy views of an excessive society. It is a story of personal commitment and triumphant love that defeats the ideologies of war. Their young are a sublime observation of human nature and of how love comes with his pain and darkness. Everyone has some annoying aspects to their personality, and it is perceived by the makers in the most simplistic and fantastic way. We travel only a short distance with the two main characters, but continue to complete our own travels with some of their simple, loving, honest philosophy. I am so glad I am in this 'our time'. Another 20 years on both sides of my birthday, and I wouldn't have seen and felt .... The big cut. William White. Sheffield.
