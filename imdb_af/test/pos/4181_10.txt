This movie begins when it ends and ends as it begins. What is in the middle is a collection of comedy, philosophy, music, observations, commentaries, mini-stories, color and more. It looks at the world and our lives and tells the Monkees story from the view of the group members themselves. It also watches television and film and makes a visual comment. It also shocks, with scenes of war and how we are just pawns in a big game. It says it all and more, but if you don't look objectively, you won't see much more than scenes combined to join the music. It's the kind of movie that can never be boring, because it's done so smartly.
