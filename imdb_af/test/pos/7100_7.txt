This film marked the end of the "Serious" Universal Monsters era (Abbott and Costello meet the monsters later in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankentstein"). It was a somewhat desperate but fun attempt to revive the classic monsters of the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's monster and Dracula once. <br /> <br /> I say desperately, because in the previous movie, "House of Frankenstein," both Dracula and the Wolf Man are killed according to the vampire and werewolf legend saying they should be (Dracula at sunlight and the wolf man by a silver bullet). Yet they returned to Dracula's house without any explanation. This movie could have played as a House of Frankenstein as a kind of prequel if the Frankenstein monster area were not to continue chronologically in House of Dracula of House of Frankenstein, and if the wolfman could not be cured. Then there are no plot holes. But as this is not the case, the plots of Dracula and the Wolf Man make no sense. <br /> <br /> But, to ignore these plot holes, House of Dracula is a classic atmospheric horror movie that's fun to watch. It has very high points. Especially the wolf sees how he is healed. I know I just said it shouldn't have been included, but it was nice to actually see that he was cured after all this time. And the scene with the lady playing "Moonlight Senada" on the piano, then suddenly played a ghostly melody under Dracula's game. Dr. Edleman's transformation in the type of Dr. Jekyl / Mr. Hyde-type character is also very well done. <br /> <br /> It is wonderful to see Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man together, one "last" time. <br /> <br /> *** from ****
