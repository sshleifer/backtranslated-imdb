The thing should be one of the best movies. Of course, this was a special impact on the time of release that impressed me so much. In 1982, I just thought, I have never seen anything like this! Although the effects themselves made the movie more horrible, it was the story itself, the music party, the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic, as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that made it a classic. <br /> <br /> Movies don't get better than this! In the opening scene with the chopper pursuing this rascal, you just assume it was a few bored scientists from a station that let some steam out. Yet, if you see them, they go to the US base, then you think the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme pressure from cabin fever. Yet it is offset by the impending opening stamp that sets the pace! You just know something is not right! At this point it is a mystery until 'the thing' reveals. <br /> <br /> However, the secret comes back because it becomes a kind of Agatha Christie "who dunnit" (ie ten small Indian movies) sci-fi style, as members do not know which one of them team really is not. a stranger. Suspect continues to go back and get ahead between them all as one by one, they are eventually knocked off or revealed as the stranger. The mistrust between the station staff absorbs as the film progresses to the final jump. <br /> <br /> After 20 years of advancement in computer graphics and filmmaking, the special effects in "The Thing" do not carry the same weight as it did in 1982, but besides, it does well around, with a some good performances by the cast.
