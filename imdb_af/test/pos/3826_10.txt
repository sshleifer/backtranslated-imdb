I watched the original Outer Limits in real time when they first broadcasted, and watched the entire original series time after time in re-runs and completed on DVD. I find the New Outer Limits MORE than just a repetition of old reprogrammed episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested. <br /> <br /> With seven (7) year programs compared to only the two (2) years of the original series, producers and writers have certainly added significant new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer and much well-made (cable) TV series. Plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future. <br /> <br /> While most Hollywood producers and directors unknowingly see Sci-Fi as being unwritten from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the origins of Science Fiction in the logical, moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies. their possible terrible short-term statements. This series does very well and remains unique in avoiding the shoot-em-up video game mentality of many of the current generation. It has brain, history, a message and good entertainment. It is a mature series without unbearable teen-know-it-all fantasies. Hurray! <br /> <br /> Now, if we can only get MGM to post the entire New Outer Limits series on DVD instead of just the six weak teasers and the 1st season now available.
