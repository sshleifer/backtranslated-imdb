For all losers who rated it negatively, it's because you've probably slaughtered once in 2 years, or you've been in LTR with one girl for years. And guess what? She is going to cheat on you when a player approaches her like that on that show. In fact, any man who is not as good as these guys hates them and hates the show. And the one who thinks this show is meant to mock those guys. It's actually how to show one how to pick up a woman. What these guys do is better than most people do - not at all. For anyone with open mindedness, I recommend reading the book "The Game" by neil strauss. It's about similar theme to this show
