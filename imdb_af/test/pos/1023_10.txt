Although I don't want cricket at all and I watched this movie 13 years ago, I still think it's one of the best movies. I remember the day I returned to my school and sat down after eating my lunch, I saw the opening titles of that movie and then .... I was so immersed in feeling I was there, it made me personally affected. I still remember how I felt when I first saw it. I felt the poor boy was my friend, through the same adolescent experience we had in those days. What I really like about that movie is the main theme of a "shy" boy who makes fantasy to "kiss" his dream girl, no offense, but if it's an American movie, you'll definitely see - on " some point, mainly climax "shy" boy "make love" for his girlfriend and i can't understand these conflicting concepts so far ... i have a simple request, if anyone knows how to put this movie on to get a DVD by mail, please let me know because I need a shot of memories. Thank you
