With the exception of the main character, the play did not convince me, but the story was pretty good. It's about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young Mormon missionary. As you can imagine, such a relationship is very problematic. The movie is very American and as such has some metaphysical undertones to reflect its criticism of religious intolerance. But some story lines are hilarious: one of the main characters asks his gay colleague: "Do you believe in God?" And he said, "You mean, except Madonna?" All in all, the movie is not one of my all-time favorites, but the writing is really good and I really liked it: it is entertaining and stands on (religious) bias and intolerance. I think this is an important message in our time. Since I rated films I loved less than 9, it's clearly a 10 for me. Some people find it exaggerated, but I think this movie deserves it.
