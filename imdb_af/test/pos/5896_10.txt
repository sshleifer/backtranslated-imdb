One of the wonderful things about the best years of our lives, though dating itself quite firmly in the ages of World War II, are the issues that it is talking about, as today as they were on VE or VJ day 1945. The problem of how to return war veterans is as old as the written history of our planet. <br /> <br /> And while we're not often learning from history, we can be grateful that the United States once did learn from what happened to its veterans after World War II. The GI Bill of Rights is called in passing. The best years of our lives may have been the greatest social legislation of the last century. So many veterans benefited, like veterans like Fredric March, Dana Andrews and Harold Russell, who you see here. <br /> <br /> All three actors played archetypal veterans, characters that can identify every corner of the US with. They all meet on a lower airplane that travels to their hometown, Boone City, Iowa. <br /> <br /> War is a great level of class and distinction. Bank employee March, Andrews cool drink, and high school football star Russell will probably never meet in real life, even in a small town like Boone City. But they meet each other and the war melts imperishable bonds that can never be broken. <br /> <br /> March is the oldest, a man with two children and Hollywood's perfect wife, Myrna Loy. He settles first and foremost. He has some wonderful scenes, he gets drunk on his return and later with some liquor in him, the bank officials say in no uncertainty. <br /> <br /> I also love his scene where another returning veteran, a shareholder, wants a loan for his own land. Look at Mars's expressions as he listens to the man's pitch for money. You can feel that he is reading the man's soul. That's how he made his second best actor Oscar for this movie. <br /> <br /> Harold Russell was a true veteran who both lost his hands during service in the Pacific. He has a special recognition Oscar for his performance. As a result, it was probably unfair to nominate him in the Supporting Actor category, which he also won. His performance, especially his plays with Cathy O'Donnell as his darling who loves him with or without his hands, is above all that can be described as acting. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is the only officer of the three, a bomber in the Army Air Corps. He might have had some of the group of them. He also comes from the group's poorest background and he was an officer and a man in that uniform. That uniform and the monthly awards are what Virginia Mayo is interested in marrying him. The problem is that he is much less in her eyes than a citizen. <br /> <br /> While Mayo deceives Steve Cochran, Andrews has the great fortune that March's daughter, Teresa Wright, has an interest in him. They are the main story of the movie, Andrew's adaptation to civilian life, and fit the fact that he married the wrong woman. Not all veteran's problems were solved with GI Bill. <br /> <br /> Myrna Loy is getting little recognition for the best years of our lives. My guess is that because her role as a woman was too much like the stereotypical female roles she patented at MGM. As a wife for March and her mother for Wright, she really is the glue that holds that family together. <br /> <br /> The best years of our lives for Best Picture for Sam Goldwyn, Best Director for William Wyler and some other than the two acting Oscars, got it. It was a critical and popular success, possibly the best film Sam Goldwyn ever produced. It remains an engaging and enduring classic to this day and will be so for centuries. It is almost three hours long, but never once will your interest lapse. <br /> <br /> The best tribute this film received comes from Frank Capra who had a film of his own in the Oscar games that year. In his memoirs he said he was disappointed to be at the Oscars that year, but his friend and colleague William Wyler created such a masterpiece, he earned every award he could get for it. <br /> <br /> By the way the movie Capra hoped, It was a wonderful life. The Beat Years of Our Lives can't get better praise than that.
