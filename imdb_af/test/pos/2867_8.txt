I liked it very much. <br /> <br /> Camera angles are cool, not everyone is jumping like a Blair witch. And I thought they did a good job with the sound when we saw things from Kane's point of view. Great fun. Many people shouted on the screen! <br /> <br /> Kane did a good job with his various psycho-emotions. He is much less one-dimensional than most horror heroes. <br /> <br /> Cane is much less and more credible than most movie psychos. It was not clear to me how he would react to different situations. There aren't many twists here, but it's smart and original in its own way. Good, creepy, B-movie slasher fare.
