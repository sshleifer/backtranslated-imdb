I just saw a movie that had to be by all rights for a second course, MOW on Lifetime ... but trust the Irish that it is nothing but saccharine. Setting up everything but SCREAMS "Here's a message about what's very important in life", but the performance was over in the "Let's just see what we can get away from here." <br /> <br /> It helps have two fantastic actors in the lead - James McAvoy (like Rory) and Stephen Robertson (as Michael). While Rory is being offered as the nearby man - never mind the language and attitude, he is the "force of life" in this piece and he could easily be in his ultimate "caring" attitude. McAvoy keeps him sharp enough to keep him from getting too sweet. But the revelation is Stephen Robertson as Michael. Not since Leonardo Di Caprio in "... Gilbert Grape" did anyone catch such a perfect person with a tribulation I began to believe he really was an actor with cerebral palsy. And his eyes ... my God, he can rip you apart. <br /> <br /> This movie is to paraphrase Rory, f **** n 'amazing. Go see it. Take a box of Kleenex and enjoy every well-deserved tear ... and laugh.
