OK. So this can be done! We have the perfect vampire movie here. Gothic, beautiful. With all the ingredients. A realistic vampire. A wonderful story. Note: I'm from Transylvania and I assure you, this movie respects the vampire lore! That's exactly the stories I've heard in my childhood. For a Transylvanian, it's pretty ... credible. You should see it if you are inspired by true vampires, as they are portrayed in medieval chronicles and not how they are done in recent Hollywood movies. (As I can guess, the Hollywood problem is that they mix vampires with the incubator - which Vampires are never nice or attractive, they can only inspire abomination and repulsion. The incubator - phoned in my country. The Night Flier is the one beautiful devil killing his victims by loving them.) I strongly recommend it to any Gothic person out there! See also the sequel, they are all 4 very good! And of course don't miss the DArk shadow! Something similar is Nosferatu In Venice with Klaus Kinski. I recommend the one.
