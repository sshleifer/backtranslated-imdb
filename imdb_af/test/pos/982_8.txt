This movie is really an entertaining, fun-filled fun for the kids. Kaley (played by Nickelodeon's talented Amanda) is the sidekick for a rambunious boy who has the hard time telling the truth. He eventually works it in a stolen movie. I won't drill you with the details. If you have children and would like to see an entertaining, not exciting children's movie, I recommend this one.
