Visconti's death in Venice qualifies as one of the most beautiful films ever made. As we look, we admit that we are in the hands of a visionary genius. Endless cute death in Venice is certainly; but in other important ways it is an unsatisfactory movie. Thomas Mann writes with contempt and away from von Aschenbach's literary career and output; from its imperative way, its low-on-low, programmed, self-conscious behavior. When Tadzio appeared and became obsessed, it is clear that Aschenbach did not have the slightest idea of ​​who he was among his Gilded-Age steps and took life with care. In fact, when Tadzio is seen, the "Solitaire", as Mann sometimes calls him, divides into two. Aschenbach Nr. 1 absorbs the face of a beautiful 14-year-old boy, and attempts to intellectually process cowardice in blood pressure, as he is a work of art - a "divine" work of art. But Aschenbach No. 2 appears as a stalker who controls, then replaces the rational Aschenbach no. 1. Like the original Aschenbach, his sexual doppler is destroyed to make human contact with the object of his obsession - and so Tadzio remains a distant ideal. Thomas Mann has no mercy for this game. Every piece of self-knowledge comes too strong and too late; The excitement of sexual coil is too big to resist. The fact that Venice is being seized by illness means nothing to Aschenbach - except that his play has a higher interest. When he finally whispered under his breath, "I love you," he knows that everything is lost and the abyss awaits. Is any of these movieable? Perhaps, and Visconti creates a visual festival that is impossible to look away. But there are mistakes: He and Dirk Bogarde create Aschenbach as sympathetic; Mann, again, didn't. Aschenbach's POV dominates the film and we are expected to identify. But nowhere on the screen is a man torn from within. Bogarde easily switches between the sublime controlled and the ridiculous temperament - but what's underneath it? Bogard's reactive performance has no defeat. Mann writes a character who, in his imagination, does the Dance of the Seven Snails, all too aware of the consequences that such freedom invites, but unable to, are not prepared to resist. Also, Visconti's script created a character not in the original - Aschenbach's friend Alfred - to dramatize Mann's discussion of art and artists. These scenes are badly written disasters, and the actor portraying Alfred is hard to watch. Also, Visconti's Aschenbach is a Gilded-Age-Teutonic composer, who I think works for the film; and the Mahler symphonies substitute for Aschenbach's novels. Mahler's good music was unfortunately recorded badly and played very badly. So death in Venice, as Visconti gives it to us, is not the full success it could have been, but as a pure visual experience its power cannot be denied. All students of the film, especially cinematography, would love to watch.
