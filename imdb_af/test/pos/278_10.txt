It's a very moving movie that takes a new twist: we have a relationship that will end. Kristen Thomson's performance as Tessa, who desperately tries to stay one day with her relationship with Bobby, is extremely convincing and moves and takes you right into the story. Who did not confront the end of a relationship and at least called out tears: "Another night!" When he gives her another night, the journey these two people share will cause you to break and think about how precious every real relationship can be, and how each one, whether permanent or not, should be treated with respect rather than merely discarded.
