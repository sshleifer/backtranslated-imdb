I love many others have seen it as a child and I loved it and it scared me into adulthood. I tried to find this movie and even wanted to play it again on TV one day, as it originally played on US networks. Does anyone know how to buy this movie, or does anyone have it and do I want to make a copy for me? Does anyone know if there is a chance that it will be played on TV again? Maybe all of us fans should write a station in the hope that they will air it again. I don't think they've done a good job of promoting this movie in the past, because nobody really knows, people just know about Stepford women and Stepford man movies. No one is aware of the fact that there was a children's version. Maybe they should do it again, as it looks very much like many of my favorite old thriller / horror flicks. Well, if anyone has any input, please write me with information. Thanks Taira tcampo23@aol.com
