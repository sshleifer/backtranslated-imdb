The Seven-Ups is a good and surprising movie. It is full of credible performances by Scheider, LaBianco and an effective and sly performance by Richard Lynch. Although most characters are tickets, it's hard to watch. Character development does not develop on the screen at all. The only thing we know is the good guys, the good guys and the bad guys are bad. Regardless of the crime story standard, the seven-u Separator and crew in the middle of a building's plot can throw in a unique script. At the New York City sites and the excellent choreographed car chase, the film highlights. The only drawback to the movie is the slightly confusing plot line in the beginning. They give the viewer little evidence that the men were kidnapped, mob-related (until later in the film). If someone blindly watches the movie, it can be slightly confused. Otherwise, The Seven-Ups is a greasy, testosterone-enjoyable time.
