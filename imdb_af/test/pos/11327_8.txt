I thought it was a beautiful movie. It's not my favorite of his films - Chungking Express holds that place - this one is very different from anything else I've seen of her. It's slow (but not annoying) - it takes its time and thinks the characters. There is minimal movement in the frame. The camera work is wonderful. the acting is wonderful. The film feels like a long, warm, comforting drink.
