Nowadays, you rarely come through a children's show that doesn't. 1) A preteen / teen star so amusing to dry paint. 2) Have a plot about finding the perfect date with another guy / girl every time 3) Turn around impeccably shouting and incomprehensible humor. About 95% of performances on Disney, Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network match those criteria. To put it in simpler terms, they all lack good acting, originality and good storytelling. It is as if producers and writers think children are not smart enough to understand character development and plot details. They could no longer be unaware. Sour children enjoy a good laugh and erratic behavior (if done at a conservative level and done right), but because they also want to enjoy a story, see drama and challenge people. They don't want to see people living in a flawless world where they get everything they want. They know this world is not fun and games, they know it's not perfect. Everyone has problems, and we all have to learn to work. This show turns around that kind of stuff. Alex Mack is an average teenage girl who looks everything to her brilliant sister, Annie. Her mother works at some office, but is sometimes a home stay parent. Her father, George, is a top scientist at the Plant, a chemical corporation who lives most of the town in which they live in the Paradise Valley. Alex is unpopular and is approached by most of her peers. Her only friend is Ray (but she gets more friends than the series goes). On her first day of Jr High, Alex goes home, not too happy about the school, but a truck delivering chemicals from the plant dumps into a fire hydrant to avoid getting a strange chemical known stand as GC-161, to dip. chemical mixtures with the water, which Alex covers. Shortly thereafter, she began to develop strange forces, such as shooting in a puddle, shaking lasers from her hand and moving things with her mind. She also believes constantly when it is nervous (although we never see it later). Apart from her sister Annie and friend Ray, Alex decides to keep these powers a secret from everyone, even her parents, for fear of the kidnapping by the Plant, whose corrupt owner, Danielle Atron, her head of Safety, Vince, looking for the mysterious GC161 child. Every episode then deals with Alex trying to live a normal life as a child, at the same time living with her strange powers. The series may look like a girl's show, but it's not. As a boy, I liked watching this show because of its wonderful effects and drama. The producers successfully add certain elements of science fiction to the elements of teenage drama. In fact, some episodes were silent and violent. The ungrounded plant manager Atron and Vince are good antagonists for the series, because the writers really threaten them and give you that awful feeling every time they come on the screen. Also, smart move David, driver of the truck, who played the GC-161, as Vince's bumbling assistant in the hunt for comic effect, but also you love him to the end of it. little Alex tries to live as an ordinary child, but struggles to perfect her powers. Sometimes you forget that it's kids who run a huge Adult Institute because you're in the story. The show does a good job of relating to children by showing Alex that she has powers, but she is still a child and must be careful. Even an episode you will find is uncomfortable with Alex's disasters. My favorite episode where Alex wants her never been born really demonstrates most of these elements. As I said, the producers never hesitated to add in some laughs whether they came from Ray's one liner or George's strange habits or David were trying to be a good guy. Of course, you come across choppy moments and a whole episode that really has nothing to do with the series' plot, but what good series doesn't it? All in all a great show. 9/10
