Easy one of the best Indian movies ever. Granted, it doesn't say much (I made this conclusion after a whole 15 minute look). But I can really say Fire is also one of the most beautiful and brilliant movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> Beautiful because of its images. The best example I can give is the parallelism between the 2 female leads (Radha and Sita) and the characters of the same name in Hindu mythology. Sita, for example, is the wife of the reverend Lord Ram. As the legend goes, Ram causes his wife to run through a fire to prove her "purity." Sita, in response, cries and leaves him, reunited with her mother (the Earth). This story has all the crazy links to the stories of the 2 Indian women (Nandita Das and Shabana Azmi). The word "Fire" suddenly has many meanings - marriage, tradition, religion, motherhood, and probably some others I don't catch. <br /> <br /> Brilliant because of the social overtones. Many who have been insulted to the forefront of this movie should actually be first to see Fire (eg, my mother, who actually loved it). Why? For although Fire is an attack on tradition, it is also an attack on tradition. In other words, it's his power, NOT his weakness. Traditional conservative social mores (or Indians or Canadian or American or whatever) are useless if they add to you. Gender roles and self-denial can do both. <br /> <br /> These are the things I took with me after I saw Fire. Beware of Deepa Mehta?
