I know a lot of people have said, don't wrestle with this movie because it's not a good fight and hard with the captions. It's a very lazy way to think of a movie. If you want to focus on that part of the movie, you need to find something else, and also learn to respect cinema as art form, this is a masterpiece. If you want to see it, it's not really about fighting. There are sometimes good fight scenes that are well filmed with good camera work, but the story itself is what keeps the story together and the important part is. It's not the basic Kung-fu movie. The story is actually the central focus and not the battles, and the combination of the two makes a great movie worth watching, and is even better in the original language with subtitles.
