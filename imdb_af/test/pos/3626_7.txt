1930's comedy mystery on "The Crooked Circle", a band of hairdressers who committed the murder on someone they swore. Enjoyable but really unimaginable movie, the film just works because the movie led by Zazu Pitts and James Gleason (both later co-starred in some Hildegarde Withers movies after Edna Mae Oliver dropped out of the series) and supported by a big actors and actresses you know, but may not know the name (so I do not mention the lack of naming). A bree hour long skirt, the movie doesn't make much sense with wrong identity, secret passages, ghostly music and people who aren't what they look like. It's the perfect thing for a dark and stormy night or a late night look when one is nostalgic for the late late show.
