It's another of the rare movies that one is grateful to announce instead of the regular Hollywood tournament. It's really a rollercoaster ride, as we follow the effects of a fake 500 Euro note on a multitude of people. One asks 'what if' all the time, but it is definitely a butterfly effect captured on film. It will laugh you, cry and bite your lip. I loved it every minute! And thanks SBS Australia for displaying movies that are really entertaining, even worth reading the captions. The only downside in my mind is that I won't be discussing a holiday at the Frozen Land - they all seem too depressed - all that cold weather should be. Anyway, watch it - it's worth every second.
