In the era of the Farrelly Brothers and the Jackass series, to make a movie made and executed by the Americans, it comes out and it is well-filled and full of charm and hilarity is almost marvelous. This ensemble is behind other efforts, most recently "A Mighty Wind" which was so subtle, it seems to be a real documentary without the transfer of entertainment, but "Best In Show" hits on all cylinders. It was beautifully thrown with some of the best American actors, Parker Posey, who dried up energy, even when standing still, Eugene Levy as a tolerant allman who has no one's doormat, even though he or she looks'). The brilliant styling of Fred Willard, the underlined performances of so many others, is a feature that is not normally associated with Americans or American actors. One of the few humorous movies I can watch again.
