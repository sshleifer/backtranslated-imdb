I absolutely love this movie! Evil Dead has nothing on this movie! Night of the Demons 2 and 3 is a total drill, but this one is a classic. It's super cheesy and the acting is good, but what else can you get from an 80-year-old horror movie? Stooge has one of the best one-liners to ever hit the screen in this one. (He's my favorite character). Many people talk about the lipstick scene in this movie, but my personal favorite is the end. Unfortunately, enough has nothing to do with the main characters, when the old man pecks his Halloween apples, and his throat is torn from the inside. The soundtrack is wonderful. The scene with Angela dance is completely stupid, especially after the strobe light comes on, and you can see her jump from one part of the floor to the next with every sound of a camera shutter on the song playing. The makeup effects in this movie are pretty sweet; Angela gave me nightmares as a child. If you are the kind of person who demands perfection from your filming experience, you might want to pass this one. But if you are like me and you really work the whole Halloween, haunted house with the demons clich√©, then this one is definitely a must possess.
