"Eagle's Wing" is a pleasant surprise from a movie, and is interested in the viewer. I didn't know it would be made by the British before I read the other viewer's comments. I can understand why it won a cinematography award because it was brilliantly presented and had to look great on a big theater screen. <br /> <br /> It was very realistic than most westerners, portraying how the West was more truly won. As well as the complexity of the characters it offers. The Indian-Sam Waterson character is particularly interesting. He appears to be brutal in the cruel environment in which he is conditioned, but shows remarkable respect for the malevolence he witnesses in the white men and women he meets. He is not friendly or sensitive to these invaders in his country, but he has a limitation on his sense of revenge, even a compassion when he is in a position of power and the shining white man bent on revenge, as well as the girl observes he kidnapped after he captured a stage coach. As such, his character seems complex, but with the hard land he lived on and threatened by these intruders, he is not sad in his dealings with. <br /> <br /> The beautiful horse he drives is a critical link & It's interesting to see how this Indian manages it, compared to the Martin Sheen character who owns and strengthens it. have some time. "Eagle's Wing" is an unusual Western, a genre I didn't pay attention to, but I appreciated this excellent offer.
