With a movie featuring the Twins, Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen, no one should expect a masterpiece from the theater. However, what you get is a fun movie that is easy on the eye and brain. There are many Hollywood-style vampires (no hopping Chinese leeches here), cute girls, attractive heroes and the occasional very funny moment. And Jackie Chan. <br /> <br /> Sure, the kung-fu relies heavily on wire and CGI. Sure, the script reminds you of Blade. And sure, the whole thing is immediately forgotten. <br /> <br /> But for a really nice piece of movie, you'll be hard pressed to find better.
