John Wayne is one of the few players in the film history that failed during his first big break and then succeeded the second time. Of course everyone knows the second time was the classic Stagecoach with John Ford directing. <br /> <br /> But we're here to talk about The Big Trail. John Ford's co-director, Raoul Walsh, saw this long-standing kid on one of Ford's films and thought he had potential. He wanted him the lead in a big budget westwards that Fox was planning to do. The film as planned is a tribute to the famous classic Silent Western The Covered Wagon. <br /> <br /> Looking at the Big Trail, I was struck by how similar Wayne's Breck Coleman's character is to the Ringo Kid in Stagecoach. Both characters were nice young bulls, but both were also on a mission of revenge. And of course both films are done in place and show the cost of making them. No studio product here with a ruglot western set. <br /> <br /> I also don't think it was an accident that Wayne had this break at the start of the audio era. Raoul Walsh, I recommend watching Hollywood and probably didn't think a whole lot of cowboys might stay in the sound. That's something else Walsh saw in Wayne. According to what I read, The Big Trail ran because he spent all the money making the film in an early, wide-screen process, a genius at Fox realized their theaters were not equipped with the wide screen to do so. do not show. And when the Great Depression hit, there would be no money to widen the screens at Fox movie houses. So the big route got a limited release, even in what we would call a formatted version, and lost money big for Fox movies. <br /> <br /> Marguerite Churchill is fine as the chin oil hero Duke wins, loses and wins again from Ian Keith. Keith, Charles Stevens and F. Tyrone Power are the trio of the villains Wayne handles. <br /> <br /> F. Tyrone Power is the father of the famous film legend Tyrone Power. He was a great burly man with a great background in classic scrolls on the screen and on stage. I wouldn't be surprised if his son, who was 15 at the time, didn't hang around the set. <br /> <br /> See also Ward Bond, although you may be having trouble with a big bush beard. <br /> <br /> Watching the Big Trail now is interesting to speculate where John Wayne's career would have been possible if The Big Trail was a big hit.
