When I watched this movie when I was a kid, I didn't understand the point of departure of Hitchcock movies and dark comedy. Now I'm in my mid 20's, it makes a lot more sense. <br /> <br /> I think the reason I like this movie is that Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito's comedy duo make an interesting comedy. <br /> <br /> The story revolves around Larry Donner (Crystal), a struggling writer who stole his masterpiece. by his wife Margaret (played by a surprisingly radiant Kate Mulgrew, also known as Capt. Janeway of Star Trek: Voyager). <br /> <br /> As he moves between authoring block and learning the creative writing class, he meets with student Owen Lifts (DeVito), an aspiring writer and overgrown mum's son who unfortunately still acts like a child. He has toy tracks, should I say more? Think of the failure to start, but Matt McConaughey is short, fat and naked. <br /> <br /> Owen is stuck in his own life, with a demanding evil mother (Anne Ramsey) he can't stand. He looks for Larry's advice on how to get there and when he says he is going to see a Hitchcock movie, Owen gets the wrong idea that he will kill Larry's wife, and he will bring the favor back and kill his mother. . Hilarity occurs while the two try to deal with each other's problems. Owen goes to the extreme to kill Margaret, while Larry, who refuses to agree to do his "part of the plan," is driven by Owen's mother. <br /> <br /> In the course of the film, Larry and Owen are slowly but surely forming a bond of friendship that is hardly ever in the dark comedy. One part of the movie I really loved was where Owen Larry shows his coin collection, and we can only say it's more of a sentimental collection than anything. <br /> <br /> The two main stars aside, the late Anne Ramsey are hilarious as Mama, and deadly with that reed of her. She is much more comical and physically opposed to her role as Mama Fratelli of The Goonies. So she curses like a sailor and insults her son every turn, but that's what makes her character so bright. She makes her character the kind of person you like to hate. <br /> <br /> Another surprise in this movie is the music of jazz-great Brandford Marsalis, which plays Larry's neighbor and friend Lester. There is a wonderful moment in the movie where he plays Larry jazz, who is depressed and needs some good songs to relieve the pain. Jazz can do this. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, I wish Billy Crystal and Danny DeVito would do another good movie together, but their kind is getting too old for the game I'm sad to say. It is one of those rare films where both stars shine in their own subtle ways. DeVito's childish comedy and Crystal's sharp white made this movie for me. 5 star comedy.
