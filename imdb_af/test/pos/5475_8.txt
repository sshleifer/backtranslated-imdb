Wolfgang Peterson directs this thriller with Clint Eastwood who plays security service agent Frank Horrigan who plays with a smart psycho (John Malkovich) in a cat-and-mouse game for the protection of the president. Mitch Leary (Malkovich) contacts Horrigan to plague the agent with discouraging remarks about his abilities as well as the secret service's protection of past presidents. Agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo) tries to keep Horrigan grounded; but he is strong enough to stop Ley from carrying out his threats of murder. Very good FX and fast pace maintain the plot. Eastwood and Malkovich are excellent. Russo has a way to get your attention. Completion of this strong cast is: Dylan McDermott, Fred Dalton Thompson, John Mahoney and Gary Cole.
