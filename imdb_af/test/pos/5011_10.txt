I saw the movie at the Nashville Film Festival on May 1, 2003! It was awesome! All the things I read about Stuey are incredibly well portrayed by Tony Vidmer (writer, director, producer, editor), Michael Imperioli (incredible work as Stuey) and all the others involved. I'm glad he (Vidmer) didn't leave the routine of Las Vegas with Stuey's bad habits, but put us in his life, family and gift. The whole story of the motel room where he died was a big vehicle and showed his screenplay skills. A great "thumbs up" on this one!
