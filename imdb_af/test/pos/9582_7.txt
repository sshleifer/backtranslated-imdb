Long before Terri Schiavo addressed the issue of life as a "vegetable" to the public view, "A Day In The Death of Joe Egg". Alan Bates plays Bri, a teacher whose daughter is almost completely burned. He and his wife, Sheila (Janet Suzman), try all sorts of dark humor to continue their lives, but they can't escape the facts. At one point they even consider euthanasia. The question that surrounds them and their friends is: what will ever become of this trouble? <br /> <br /> With this movie Alan Bates continued his streak really good movies, preceded by "Zorba the Greek", "The King of Hearts" and "The Fixer". We can safely say that he will be missed unfortunately.
