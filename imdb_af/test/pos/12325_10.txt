I watched thousands of movies in my life and I believe this movie is the most perfect movie ever made. By perfect I mean the storytelling, the plot, the acting, the play, the camera work, etc. (It's a lie, I have no background in film production.) Many movies have perfect scenes, as the barman submits a report to the police in the film Fargo. (Indeed, that scene can play well as a short one.) In the dead, every scene is done perfectly, making the whole movie perfect. Perhaps John Huston sold his soul to the devil to make such a movie. Hopefully Daniel Webster got him out of the contract!
