Claudine is a movie that is representative of the American system at its worst. The welfare system was initially set as a stepping stone for those families who needed that extra hand to get back on their feet. The film has an accurate representation of how the welfare system has broken down the family unit. In other words, if the father or any male figure is in the lives of the women and children, their financial support of the system will be compromised if it is not terminated. The struggle of the poor can be seen everywhere in the world. I would like to see a reproduction of this movie back in the shops, for everyone to rent or buy for their library collection.
