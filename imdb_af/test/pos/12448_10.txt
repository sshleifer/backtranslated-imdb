Slipknot is a hardcore rock band from Des Moines, Iowa. Nine band members who have all chosen, and personal, homemade masks (eg # 6's clown mask, # 0's different gas masks, # 8's tattered + torn scratch pad dummy mask with dreadlocks). The music itself seems to run the fine lines between sensible and otherwise, but is so brilliant and psychotic. <br /> <br /> "Welcome to our environment" sounds rather than a generic title, but the footage itself is something else. Interviews with the band, soundbites of their latest, selftitled album, 2 live performances, and one Banned-by-MTV music video (a brilliant tribute to the classic Kubrick movie "The Shining"), an hour, but definitely worth it. It's perfect for launching any metal / hardcore fan on Slipknot.
