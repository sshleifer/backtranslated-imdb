My top 2 actors are in this movie - Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. <br /> <br /> Ryan can play anything from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller and play it great. In this movie he begins with his speech "... people with names like Samuels and others with names that are hard to say". It's a pity to see him. <br /> <br /> Robert Young plays the policeman he called to investigate the murder of Samuels (Sam Levine), a citizen talking to several soldiers in a bar. Mitchell is the soldier associated with it - his wallet is found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a gentle soldier who just misses his wife. <br /> <br /> The story is told from different perspectives. Mitchell and Samuels set up a friendship and return to Samuels apartment. Samuels seems to know the loneliness that Mitchell feels. "For years you've been concentrating on one peanut and now it's gone, you don't know what to feel," he says about the war. <br /> <br /> Ryan is wonderful like Monty, the psychotic racist. <Br /> <br /> Robert Young (along with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career jumped through film noir. "Crossfire", "They won't believe me" and "The Other Woman" are good examples. <br /> <br /> Robert Mitchum is his usual laid back self as the philosophical Keeley. <br /> <br /> Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as the "strange couple" are also excellent in their short, but roles. <br /> <br /> This is probably the best film about racism ever made.
