Feisty Dianna Jackson (an exquisite performance by beautiful former Playboy playmate Jeanne Bell) goes to Hong Kong to take out the evil heroin ring murdered by her brother. Dianna is assisted by friendly karate master Joe (amiable Chiquito). He is opposition of shelter drug agent Elaine (beautiful, blonde babe Pat Anderson) and romance, rogue, relentless ambitious Charlie (set up with a highly arrogant aplomb by Stan Shaw) while planning her revenge against deadly drug Kingpin Sid (a effective slim Ken Metcalfe). Director Cirio H. Santiago, working from a fast-paced trashy script composed by none other than Dick Miller (!), Stomping the vibrant and advanced 72-minute running time with an abundance of free neck color and numerous bad play camp fighters (Bell is clearly doubled by a solid man wearing a huge Afro wig!). The definite sloppy highlight is when a topless Bell beats a bunch of thugs in her hotel room. Felipe Sacdalan's raw, grainy, scratched cinematography, the awkward use of tough slow motion, the funky groovin score, the legally fearless battle of choreography and the surprisingly horrifying conclusion add a lot to the overall spectacular fun of this delicious cheese-like gravel house exploitation. hoot.
