Begotten is one of the most unique movies I've ever seen. It's more of a study of sound, light and darkness, and movement as a true story. The kind of thing you see as a video instillation at the modern art museum as a movie enjoyed at the local theater. I'm not going to try to interpret the images of mother nature, the animals in mantles, the twisted and tortured body of her "child". Some things just interpret.
