> This show is the biggest thing to come from America since the> Simpsons. Not only do they have thousands of new ideas, but they are actually controversial (see Jewish joke, Season 1, Episode 1) and are not afraid to mark people. However, the big thoughts at Fox canceled it, along with Greg the Bunny and Futurama. So make sure you buy the Season 1 box while you can still. It will be the best money you ever spend. It's definitely a performance that gets better, the more you see it, because the> constant flashbacks can initially become a bit annoying and don't always look like the story is correct. But after a few episodes, you realize how brilliant it is and how well it compares to any other airborne performance at the moment.
