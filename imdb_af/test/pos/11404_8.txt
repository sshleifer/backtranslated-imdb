I was skeptical before going here because of the terribly compound trailer that made it look as scary. I was surprised how much I didn't waste my money. I believe the movies' success comes from how creepy it really is and how the environment is. Small things like sensor lights create a really uncomfortable feeling. The shadows and ominous cold feel of the house make it easy to tell that no matter how much you know horror movies, anything can happen in the movie. The acting is not perfect at all, nor bad. The main character is convincing even though the annoying teenage dramas surround her. In the end, I was impressed with the movie in most respects. <br /> <br /> It's definitely a movie I recommend.
