It was a riveting movie, one that really attracted me. I'm a big fan of William H. Macy, and he puts on a great show. His great fun, along with the way his character breaks the fourth wall, really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions. I waited patiently for the whole house of cards to fall around him (and as an extension itself, as his trusted and silent witness). It took me a few minutes to relax as soon as the film was over. I was so complicated. <br /> <br /> Good performances anywhere, not just with Macy. Arkin was pretty good, just like Cromwell (he was surprisingly fiery). In short, I recommend this movie to any fans of Macy and / or the murder mystery. But you might want to prepare to feel a little guilty.
