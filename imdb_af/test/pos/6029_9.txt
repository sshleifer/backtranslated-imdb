This movie is a bit slow in the beginning, for about the first 10 minutes or so. But once it kicks, you can't turn it off. Adam Beach and Rose McGowan play the best parts and are wonderful in their acting work. You will never be able to guess who the killer is. I gave this movie a 9 because in some places Adam Beach should talk a little so you can hear what he says. 9/10
