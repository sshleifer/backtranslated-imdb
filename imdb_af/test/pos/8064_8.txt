The Anne Frank diary is the second best-selling non-fiction book in the world, and for good reason. However, by putting this documentary on her life, which contains a few details that left the diary, I thought, "Just another documentary about Anne Frank." I found it competent, but not extraordinary. It was my smug attitude because I was already aware of Anne Frank's story; Most of what the documentary had to tell me was not news to me. <br /> <br /> Everything changed when I came to the end of the documentary version - when I saw Anne's movie movie Frank. The emotional impact of the view of these footage, just a second or so, has made everything that has been a thousand times more realistic - but not just everything in the documentary; Everything I knew before from Anne Frank suddenly became more real to me, more personal. I always moved through her story, but when I saw those footage, it was what I felt stronger and deeper and deeper than any other movie experience of my life. (I knew beforehand that this documentary contains live footage from Anne Frank, and I even saw the footage in a movie review on television, but in the context of the documentary document it was a completely different experience. my mention it will spoil it for everyone.) <br /> <br /> Now I realize that many people do not yet know the story of Anne Frank; It is sometimes daunting to witness this kind of ignorance. I think to myself, "How can anyone NOT know the story of Anne Frank?" This is the case, ANNE FRANK: REMEMBER, while reading her diary, is the best place to start. This is a story everyone needs to know.
