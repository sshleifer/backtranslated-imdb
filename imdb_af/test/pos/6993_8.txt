It was probably a "sleeper" !! Much better than I thought! Never realized it was a horror flick ..... and who was this beautiful, baritoned pronounced hunger, named Vin Diesel. Adding spices and intrigues to this otherwise unfettered movie ??? The monsters in this movie were rather unusual, not the same ol-run of the mill-grab types! The end was great too, for a change, not all the bad guys are bad !!! I give it 2 inches up !!!
