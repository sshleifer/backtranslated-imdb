Leonard Maltin gave this film a dreaded BOMB rating in his 1995 movie and video guide. What movie did he watch? Kid Vengeance or God's Gun are bombs. This movie is a pleasure. It's great. This is literate. It is well mounted. It is beautifully photographed, making a brilliant use of colors. From the opening scene, the film draws your attention and shows you that this movie is a well-done satire of the entire Spaghetti Western genre. The film is played from beginning to end with tribute to Douglas Fairbanks, 77 Sunset Strip, and the well-known showdown in the Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Edd Byrnes, George Hilton, and Gilbert Roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. It's too bad. Mr. Maltin has this film as bad as it is undeserved. One can only guess about his reason. I suspect he has completely missed the tip of the movie and expects something more serious than this movie is meant to have. Kudos belongs to everyone involved in this project. This movie is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire.
