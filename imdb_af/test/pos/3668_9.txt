UNCONDITIONAL LOVE is surprisingly entertaining. While the plot may be running too many directions, it makes for a long film, it never fails to be charmed and grabbed. The various plotlines, one that is entirely reminiscent of SHIRLEY VALENTINE, offer ample smiles, laughter, wisdom and gentleness. All this shouldn't work, and sometimes it bumps together, but forgive its contradictions, sit back and enjoy a good time. It's a charm!
