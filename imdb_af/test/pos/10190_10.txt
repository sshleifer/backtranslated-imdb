This program was for a short while when I was a kid, I remember eating while eating fish and chips. <br /> <br /> Driving on the back of the Tron hype this series was very much in the style of streethawk, manimal and so on, except more computerized. There was a geeky kid, whose computer somehow created this man - outoman. He was going to try to solve crimes and fate. <br /> <br /> All I really remembered was his fancy car and the little flashing thing the car pulled out and helped him in general. <br /> <br /> If I mention it to someone, they can remember very little. Was it really or perhaps a dream?
