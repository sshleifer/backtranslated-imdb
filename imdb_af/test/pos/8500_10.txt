This kind of show isn't supposed to happen on television. This is the kind of edginess usually reserved for independent movies. That's what HBO is supposed to do. The fact is, Denis Leary has managed to enter one of the best television shows ever, easily joining the ranks of THE SOPRANOS, OZ, ED, etc. Kudos gang at ABC to show that NYPD Blue was not a curse, and to Mr. Leary and his gang for creating a unique view. My only complaint is that the performance is not long enough. An hour will make it better, but I can't wait for the next episode!
