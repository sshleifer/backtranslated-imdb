I think it was Fran√ßois Truffaut who said the best movies also included the joy of making movies, or the sadness of making movies. This movie is definitely the first type. Tromeo and Juliet are a pleasure to watch from start to finish. The zealous zeal that this Shakespeare Shenanigan burns is contagious. I don't think I laughed so hard since I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail. It's so good!
