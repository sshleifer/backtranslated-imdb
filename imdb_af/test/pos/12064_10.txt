I'm not from the US I'm from Central Europe and I think the performance is incredibly good. It can easily be compared to married to .children. My title says it's not being displayed for conservative public. I mean I'm not so liberal, but it can be a slight difference between European conservatism and our disadvantages. Anyway, starting is very popular in our area and it is very bad that it only contains two seasons. Last episode opens up many continuous and funny moments. Anyway, many and I will be happy if it continues to play. The last thing I am excited about is some moral education, packed in humorous scenes. I mean, I saw many comedies that have more than two and even more minutes of sadness in tragic scenes that don't fit in comedy. War does not contain such a thing and is made to laugh. It's like The Simpsons and married, who also has no sad or even unknown moments. I apologize for my terrible knowledge of English, but I still hope that you will understand what I meant.
