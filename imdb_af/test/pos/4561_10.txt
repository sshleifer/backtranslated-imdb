The banter and humorous rescue scene help make this one of my favorites from the 14-film movie. Great play, great role. And this movie features one of the few well-known facts about Sean Bean's career. The part where he and Alice Krige fell from the horse into the water was not written, but remained because they both went right to acting. <br /> <br /> This is a good follow-up to the intense end of Sharpe's enemy.
