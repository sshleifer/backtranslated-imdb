NOROI follows a documentary filmmaker, Masafumi Kobayashi, while slowly discovering something mysterious and angry that leaves a trace of dead bodies in his wake. After an interview with a woman claiming that the loudspeaker's crying from the house next door (where there is no baby), Kobayashi goes to talk to the neighbor. He is greeted with hostility by the inept woman (Maria Takagi) who answers the door (and quickly hits it in his face) and gets a look at her 6-year-old son through a window. Strangely enough, the woman and her son disappear just days after his visit (behind a bunch of dead pigeons on their backyard) and the woman who complained both to her and her daughter were both killed in a mysterious one. accident not long afterwards. This interest Kobayashi's interest and he is looking to find out what's going on. He soon realized that those with psychic abilities and extrinsic perceptions in something sinister, inexplicably and possibly even apocalyptic. Well-known 10-year-old clairvoyant, and TV celebrity, Kana (Rio Kanno), seems to us all to be doomed, but mysteriously disappears before she helps. Another female psychic / actress (Marika Matsumoto) gets involved, just like Mr. Nori, a spiritually unstable cook / psychic wearing a hat and jacket of aluminum foil, thinks that people are being eaten by what he refers to "ectoplasmic worms". Clues eventually lead back to the place of a small village now covered by a lake, and the legend of an old devil known as Kagutaba ... <br /> <br /> Unlike many other horns depend just as much on the plot as it makes reactionary first person frightens. Fortunately, there is something of a storyline here, a very interesting and complicated one about it, and it doesn't even make a spectacle of horrific things through spastic camera work every time to keep your interest. The way Masafumi travels, looking for the truth - with well-placed oblique roadside - reminds me of THE OMEN in his pacing. The film also does not consist entirely of footage shot by the documentary, but weaves into news reports and television showings as if we were watching an already completed documentary version. It helps break up some of the monotony usually associated with movies shot in this particular style. The performances are good enough not to harm any of the realism of the 'real' footage. Overall, this is a well-made horror movie, with many plot shifts, some tensions and quite a few really creepy moments, it's worth checking out. My only real grip is that it could use a little pruning here and there and apparently go too long. Otherwise, pretty good things.
