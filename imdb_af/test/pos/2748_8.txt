William Wellmann, who managed one of the most exciting quietest movies ever made, 'Wings' (1927), comes back to the clouds with another ripe-roaring story of devil-devil flyers. Wellmann was an airlift in World War I and no one knew biplane as he did. Here they are, stunt planes, collapse, exploding in the air and everything you can think of, as well as a fascinating look at commercial air operations in 1932. And there's a good strong story, played perfectly by the somber Richard Barthelmess (the silent star who made several films with DW Griffith), Sally Eilers and Tom Brown. Eggs is a true sizzler. Such a relief to see a real woman with real fire and character instead of one of those photofit botoxed dummies playing in movies in today's Hollywood and everyone looks identical. The story is a sad one, played with real pathos and well directed. By the end of the film, there are some extraordinary exciting scenes of danger and salvation, and what should be the most ingenious blind landing in thick fog ever thought. I dare not throw away the ingenious aspects of the particular episode. The character played by Barthelmess is much like Wellmann himself, a really wild hell raiser in the air. Anyone who likes early aviation will love this movie, and it is very rewarding for anyone who enjoys good solid entertainment, love, tears and non-stop action, all combined in a kind Wellmann omelette.
