Although this little movie has gone astray in the aftermath of On The Waterfront, Edge Of The City can certainly keep its own with the starring classic. It's another story about the docks and the code of silence that regulates it. <br /> <br /> In addition to the corrupt union that Lee J. Cobb ran in The Waterfront, Jack Warden is really little time corruption. But he's really enough as the gang boss on one of the harbors that intimidate the other workers by being handy with his fists and the hook and he gets the rest to give back some of their hard-earned money. And that's all hard-earned money in that job. <br /> <br /> One old Warden can't intimidate, Sidney Poitier is another gang boss and when he tries to intimidate the newcomer John Cassavetes, Poitier takes him under his wing. The two develop quite the friendship and Poitier and his wife, Ruby Dee, even repair Cassavetes with Kathleen Maguire. <br /> <br /> Warden is truly an ominous creature and it is sad that he is presenting almost everyone else with his power of personality and physical skill. In that sense, he is louder than Lee J. Cobb, who had to rely on a goons impression collection to enforce his will at On The Waterfront. <br /> <br /> Edge Of The City marked Martin's big-screen director debut Ritt, who did a good job with good role players from New York-based players and place-on-place cinematography. The film's low budget doesn't show, but you're so impressed with the ensemble role you don't really care about. <br /> <br /> Cassavetes as lonely with a past and hip and difficult Poitier are both good, but My personal favorite in this movie is Ruby Dee. She had to receive an award for her performance, her last scene with Cassavetes being excellent. <br /> <br /> Capture this one as ever. I wish it was on DVD or VHS.
