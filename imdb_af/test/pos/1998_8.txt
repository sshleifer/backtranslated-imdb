Okul is the first of its kind in Turkish theater, and it's better than I expected. The people who say it's not terrible or funny have a point, it's not that good. But it should be borne in mind that everyone involved in the movie is rather amateur, so it's basically a first trip. And it compares with Sinan Çetin's other films like the 1st class garbage propaganda. This movie is pretty damn good. One thing to say: It's about the life of high school students in Turkey VERY realistic! That's exactly how it goes! The scenes meant to be scared are somewhat cheap, and Hollywood's. Most of them, even if not all. But that scene of religious reading made me laugh, and Emre Kýnay does the best play of this movie as a religious teacher. <br /> <br /> It's not a waste of your time, look! You will find it quite amusing, especially if you know Turkey enough to relate to Turkish youth's school life.
