I'm a next generation person ... I've never seen the original doctor, but I've heard of the series that has in the past caused a big fan base and still makes its mark in the 21st century. the new doctor who started in 2005, but for those living here in the states like me, we see it pretty much as new episodes on the sci-fi channel or in BBC America; From season one we are introduced to a new player Rose Tyler (Billie piper) and a beautiful new new doctor played by Christopher Eccelson. these two go on some very amazing and very dangerous missions to save the world ... every now and then they have companions of Rose's ex-boyfriend microphone to the now-present Jack Harkness (which can now be seen on the turnoff "Torchwood Street"). From season one to season two, the ride is just about right. The stories may be strangely driven to the most advanced pace by strangers, but also one scrolling grid from the start of the very catchy song. <br /> In the second season, he will be different and change and now the new doctor (David Tennant) is going to battle to save the world and some may say some of the season was out . so good but I disagree and it was sad to see dandruff and the doctor shared ways, but it left the opening "companion" to Martha (played by the very sexy Freema Agyeman) who helped to keep the fight to save humanity ... season three is now more on the action / adventure level and sometimes on the emotional but not as much as the first two seasons; here is the relationship between the doctor and Martha appropriate, but the appeal can sometimes be hooked and the obviousness comes into play that she did not rise Tyler because you experienced her company in the first two seasons and not in the third season it may not be. a little uncomfortable, it was for me because you use to roses and her ways and now to see someone who sometimes does not question the doctor at an emotional level, but all this makes it very exciting for viewers who keep you up the edge of your seat. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a thrill of a television program, I'll give it more, but there are also flaws in this show, and I can't call it because it's sometimes difficult to just count one who is the doctor and Martha's relationship is rushed and not leveled on the basis to get to know you; I've seen great programs on British TV, but it's by far one of the coolest sci-fi adventures for the old and new generation to experience, but you don't have to take my world for it ... step in the tardis and joins the adventure.
