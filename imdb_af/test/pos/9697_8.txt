This movie was Hilarious! It has sometimes gone too far, but isn't that what we expect from them? The theater roared with laughter and oooooood at all the incredible crazy points. It's rude, rough and sometimes frightening. The whole gang is back and even more out of their minds, which in turn allows for good entertainment. I do not want to give anything away, but the small pieces of cuts that go around the net are nothing compared to what comes next. <br /> <br /> Watching friends is a good movie. Try to see it with a large crowd. You won't be disappointed. Just don't go with someone who can't take it (see above). It won't go well, you can be sure of it. But it is quite obvious in the first place. If you enjoy the first one, you will be releasing this one.
