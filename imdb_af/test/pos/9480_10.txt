The first time I saw this DVD, I was not only happy because it was the first time in decades that the band didn't publish anything, but also because the DVD itself was very hard. Of course Jimmy Page can't live with quiet music, I think. I have to say that during the concert at Royal Albert Hall, they 'too many times' and 'Moby Dick' extended too long. Other than that, it was beautiful. My favorite song of all time is now on the DVD. Tramped Underfoot. It's either that one or "in my time to die." In that song Jimmy really plays that thing. Ever seen Randy play Rhoads? Well, Jimmy plays just like him, except his guitar is lower.
