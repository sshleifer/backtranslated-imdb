This 1931 comedy gets better with every look because of the comic talents of Marion Davies and a tremendous performance by C. Aubrey Smith. Smith plays an abominable old man who collects his grown children (of his younger days as a rake) in his declining years. One is American (Davies), an English (Ray Milland who is about 18 years old), and an Italian (Nina Quartero). There are a few surprises, as the plot, along with Ralph Forbes (who has no appeal) falls to Davies. <br /> <br /> Davies and Smith are just wonderful together and very pleasant. Davies also gets some dances and makes a few "big" entrances. And of course Davies is just beautiful. <br /> <br /> Halliwell Hobbes, Doris Lloyd, Elizabeth Murray, Guinn Williams, Edgar Norton and David Torrence's co-star. If they were awarded Oscar awards in 1931, Smith might be well-nominated. He is just excellent in this gem.
