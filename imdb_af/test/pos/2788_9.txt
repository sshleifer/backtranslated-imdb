As a former Erasmus student I enjoyed this movie very much. It was so realistic and funny. It really picked up the spirit that exists among Erasmus students. I hope that many other students will also follow this experience. However, I wonder if this movie is all interesting to look for people with no international experience. But at least one of my friends who had never gone to Erasmus also enjoyed it very much. I give it 9 out of 10.
