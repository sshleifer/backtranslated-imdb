I love the TV game. Hate to see it end. There are so many talented participants. It is a pity that only 2 will be selected. I also like to watch the judges. Sometimes they are as entertaining as the participants. I was faithfully on show every Sunday evening. Wouldn't miss the world. It is the best reality show ever on television. Good luck to all participants, although I have already chosen the two that I want to play Danny and Sandy on Broadway. I'm anxious to see if my decisions are correct. I don't know how long the game will last until a Danny and Sandy are chosen, but I will keep looking until the end.
