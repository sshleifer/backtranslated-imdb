For those who still prefer films that focus on human relationships, 51 Birch Street is a must see. <br /> <br /> By educating the spotlight on its own family, Block includes the site that is limited to most filmmakers. He examines a common but often unspoken family dynamic and does so without using hyperbola or sensation. In fact, the movie is deceptively low key at the beginning. <br /> <br /> In addition to providing an investigation into one family - and, by extension, each family - Block has also written a very specific period in recent history. I do not know if it is intentional but inevitable because of archive content. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
