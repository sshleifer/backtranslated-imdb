Here is a much less well-known 50's sci-fi with a bit of other twist. A son of an atomic researcher is kidnapped and held for a ransom of the Father's atomic secrets. <br /> <br /> It's a solid atomic sci-fi thriller with great production values ​​and above-average acting, even of the child. The Atomic City actually has a movie for it, unlike many other 50's sci-fi of this time, which fell more than an episode of a TV show. <br /> <br /> The Atomic City was also nominated for an Oscar Award for Best Scripts - how many other 50's sci-fi can award an Oscar nomination? <br /> <br /> Great pacing, tight direction and a great place to film in the 'real' Atomic City or Los Alamos, New Mexico makes this one worth hunting. The collectors push in circulation is an above average transfer and makes a great dual feature at the Atomic Man !! <br /> <br /> Recommended.
