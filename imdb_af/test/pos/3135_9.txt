One of my favorite westerns and one of John Ford's best in my opinion. No big stars, but Ben Johnson shines in most of what he looks like, and here he gets a rare lead as the title character. To meet him, Ward Bond is the brave Mormon parent who leads his people west. John Ford's character character appearance, including Harry Carey, Jr., Jane Darwell, Russell Simpson and Hank Worden, offers great support, and also James Arness, a member of the Clegg clan joining the wagon train. The Mormon Route in Utah was one of the most difficult and demanding businesses ever undertaken. We can't really get it, but we see trials that have to be overcome by pioneers on the road west. river crossings, long regions of dry, waterless desert, encounters with Indians and the like, all set by the Boys of the Pioneers to delight in songs. The Mormons actually dug parts of the trail with lint and kicks, as depicted in the movie. My biggest regret is that it is not in color, but I believe there is a colored version. Incidentally, the crazy rocks that occur in various scenes are known as the Fisher Towers, near Moab. Highly recommended look.
