Hey, what do you expect, form a very low budget movie!?!? Although I didn't see 'Dahmer' (2002) I can say that the next thing the media has set out about Jeff is a fairly accurate representation. I studied the Jeffrey Dahmer case and learned everything I can learn about this man. This is a low budget movie, but it shows the mentality of a serial killer. If you can come by and see what the underlying story is of a sick spirit. I loved this movie! Just be yourself for a low budget and no blood. This is a story as seen through the eyes of a murderer and his childhood actions and thoughts through his arrest. My favorite line is: "If they bothered in the back seat, it could have saved a lot of lives." Enjoy!
