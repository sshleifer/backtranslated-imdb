For anyone interested, I got it on Ebay's DVD (I haven't received it yet - any day now). <br /> <br /> I was desperate to get it even though it's a VHS quality on a DVD I don't care about. So, for anyone interested, get in touch with me and maybe I can help you. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it is ridiculous to wait nearly 7 years to see it again, but boy will be worth it. it. <br /> <br /> All my teammates at work are desperate to see it too. <br /> <br /> Anyway, I'll post about quality later. <br /> <br /> Just do a search on Ebay if you want guys. it is there to buy
