Is this a good movie? No, definitely not. But for Jolie lovers this is a must-have. Her non-polished acting and semi-nudity scene will please her fans for the coming days. However, the current rating (3.2) is too low. The movie may not be missing a good story, and it is not a good sf movie, but the acting is good enough (and as mentioned before, Jolie's play is pretty and raw), the movie gets very direct shot, with very close ups. The scenery is bizarre. And last but not least, the departure of Van Damme was a very good choice. Presumably, not of the Jolie lovers would like her to have sex with him. This movie has all the potential to become a cult film.
