I'm afraid I don't have to agree with Mr. Radcliffe, because although he's correct to say it's not a comedy, it has many other merits. The plot is a bit upset on parts, but I believe it fits in well with everything, and creates a satisfying, enjoyable movie. The last scene was rather uncomfortable compared to the rest of the movie, but the real end of the plot was a few scenes that were previously very interesting. It just shows what someone will do under stressful circumstances. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie to fans of thrillers and action movies, but if you're a fan of gangster movies, you should enjoy it so much if you don't expect something as deep as Goodfellas expects no.
