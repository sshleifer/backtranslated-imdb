I tested it on Turner Classic just because it was pre-code and sounded interesting. Looking around, I noticed that the "criticism" gave it one and a half stars on a four-star scale. I started to look at tension - even old movies could be bad movies - but I quickly became involved in the story and Mary Astor's performance as the business brain behind a simple salesman's rise to success. Not a great movie - too predictable - but definitely better than advertised. And I would have liked to see more of Ricardo Cortez as the man whom Maria appreciates, but will not stop his rich wife. I would recommend giving it a look to appreciate Astor and how long have we come, baby.
