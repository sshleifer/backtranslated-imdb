Chris Morris's Brass Eye TV series has always generated a large number of complaints, both from the public and from the people who participated. But nothing he did was able to achieve more controversy than that. The 2001 Eyepiece Special. Before arriving at the highly-overrated Jerry Springer Opera, the Brass Eye Special kept the record for most complaints received about any ever broadcast TV program. <br /> <br /> The huge number of complaints the general public made to the Brass Eye Special were incredible! Many complaints have been made by people who have never watched the program! The subject matter of the program has turned a lot of headlines, but the message has been widely misinterpreted. The message was even lost on some who enjoyed the program. It wasn't a show that mocked the subject of pedophilia. The show was pure on the media and it is the presentation of the subject. Morris is and will always be a media satirist. The idea that the program "makes fun" of pedophiles and abused children is completely laughable! Morris never tried this. He only draws our attention to the overwhelming and often stupid media hype surrounding the subject. <br /> <br /> With many of his established 'Brass Eye' characters, like Ted Maul and others, Morris shows just how The Media overshadows every thing about a topic that they created and built themselves, and the result is so funny, if not more funny than Morris has done before. Using his proven formula, Morris manages several gullible celebrities to believe they are working on a serious documentary work. In fact, they are made to look exactly what they are. Retards. <br /> <br /> All in all, the Brass Eye Special needs to be seen to be believed. And with one opening line, Morris succeeds in summarizing the entire media situation in 2001: "Welcome to Paedo-Gedden!"
