You must love the spaghetti western universe. The vision of a west where good guys are shot shows without warning, cartoon-like villains are utterly close, and the anti-hero eventually walks away from the girl. Many people call Corbucci's films "depressed". I find it a bit dodgy as far as descriptions go. I think pale and unforgiving is more likely, mostly because 'depression' represents a level of sentimentality, almost every Eurowestern director is ignored in favor of broad-based painting. <br /> <br /> GLI SPECIALISTI must be seen in all its widescreen glory. before it can take its place in the Sergio Corbucci canon. It's a beautiful movie. And it is logical that Corbucci wanted to blow off some steam with COMPANEROS after the incessant one punch of the BIGNESS and that (though he would later return to his usual tricks with foulmouthed SONNY AND JED). There is still a certain amount of caricature that detracts from the overall fury of the movie, as it hurts more than any good to have an unnecessary inclusion of three children dressed as hippies looking around the village gold and trouble. And it hurts that Mario Adorf plays the Mexican one-handed bandit El Diablo than over the top, as he always plays his characters. <br /> <br /> There are more than enough handles to wet the palate of the spaghetti lovers. Shooters in general, the entire village population naked in the dirt, the typical iconic bad attitude of laconic antihero (played by Johnny Halliday), the moral bankruptcy of virtually every character in the movie. Corbucci can never receive the praise of the most famous Sergio or the American patriarchs of the genre, but you and I know this is a great injustice for a very talented director. His dynamic shot selection, in depth with objects clinging close to the camera and falling into the background, his fast pace flair and feverish energy in moving a story not always so long, depicting open spaces in his I am sure that if Corbucci was American and emerged with Mann and Hawks 15 years later, the Cahiers du Cinema critics would have earned him as a serious critical viewer.
