share a wicca girl! <br /> <br /> Many parts of this movie were the killer and the feeling you get from this movie while you see it and are just enough to sit alone, but some things really bothered me about this movie I not really light my finger. <br /> <br /> I definitely think this movie is one that any art student or photographer student should see b / c of the camera-style and grain I've never seen, but that's just the same. It seems like an art student made it and the plot if there is someone is so sparkling that you really have to have a lot of drugs just to get what goes on
