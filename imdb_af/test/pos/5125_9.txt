The story is incredible. It starts with a new child in the city of Roy, while at school at school he encounters a child without shoes and on the same day he breaks the big bulls nose trying to fight him. Roy soon discovers that the child is a runaway, and he and his step sister are trying to make a construction vision that can kill all the beautiful owls living there. Roy decides to help them fight him, they can win this battle before the smart, but lazy cop Dave Delinko (Luke Wilson) bumps into them. An enjoyable movie, funny and adventurous. I admire Luke Wilson for this role. I don't think his brother Owen will even take this role.
