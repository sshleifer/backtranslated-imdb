Rajkumar Santoshi tries his hands on comedy and pass. One of the few good films that Salman Khan entails. A very funny movie from start to finish. All the characters add to the movie and believe me, there are a lot of them. Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, Raveena Tandon, Karishma Kapoor, Paresh Rawal, Viju Khote, Jagdip, Deven Verma, Shakti Kapoor, Harish Patel, Tiku Talsania and more. The direction, editing, sound is not at stake, but it doesn't matter, because the actors are no longer part of it.
