Because of the show I cut early, I never knew why I recently read the story behind the series. I felt that this show never received his awards as one of the greatest performances. This show is iconic in nature and deserves the movie it was always meant to have if it wasn't with the original A team that was at least thrown with the role included in the story line. come a long time, perhaps at the end, commemorating it at the end of the spot. Hanibal Smith (Preppard). This throw has given us so much luck to wake up, they deserve one last hope, the fact that the series has ended openly because they cut the series is reason enough. This crew and role made us realize that children are the essence of being one of the good guys, especially to see how the world is locked. I think a lighter version like the original should be implemented. I've read all the previews and I know it. It's not the plans, but if it is straightforward on DVD movies, I'll surely buy it. I really don't get how crappy shows get series, but this big show that is still running regularly and probably seen more than some of the current rubbish shows today, we will not always remember the Incredible Hulk series, Knight Rider, Airwolf no. , and the A team because those kind of performances run through time, I'm almost positive. This knowledge you see about detectives will not even be remembered in 10 years, so why not bring something back and show the people who are apparently going about and how these old performances are really about.
