Relentless evil warrior Samanosuke (played terribly after the hateful hatred of Yutaro Gomi) cruelly abused the peaceful inhabitants of a small town. The huge Majin stone image eventually comes to life to destroy Samanosuke and his wicked followers. Director Kimiyoshi Yasudo and screenwriter Tetsuro Yoshida give the compelling story all the power and simplicity of an ancient centuries-old legendary folk tale: there is a very strong sense of an ancient time and distant place (this is specifically in feudal Japan) , the good guys are noble and attractive, while the villains are really nasty and horrible, the alternate sword fights are performed with considerable skill and gusto. The special effects are fine and impressive. The serious tone and steady pace never falls for a moment, and Majin's last line-of-rampage of anger destruction is extremely lively, exciting, and more than a little scary. In addition, the fantastic elements of the story are given considerable credibility by being firmly grounded in a continually credible dark, hard and eager world. This movie earns bonus points for Majin's portrayal as more of a brutal and frightening force of evil revenge rather than a pure spirit of absolute good. Veteran composer Akira Ifukube provides a typical rich, robust and exciting score. Fujio Morita's sharp, naughty cinematography also finds the bull's eye. The capable role-players all give wonderful sounds and sincere performances, with especially laudable work by Jun Fujimaki as the brave, protective Kogenta and Tatsuo Endo as Gunjuro's average glove. Highly recommended.
