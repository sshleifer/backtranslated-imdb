It's a fantastic movie. Hána is a very old guy with a very young heart. He knows how to live his life completely every day by making with his friend just about everything, even his own death. While his wife can't handle his "irresponsible" behavior, she also knows it's exactly why she loves her husband for almost half a century. I'd love to hang out with this old guy, because he knows how to enjoy live and never fear death. He is joyful, spiritual, naughty and never boring. Vlastimil Brodský played Hána for 79 years. Every appearance of his eyes and every movement of his aging muscles gives so much about the character to the audience. It's a movie that leaves a big smile on my face afterwards, and it makes me look a little closer to my life. Tomorrow I will buy and enjoy a house for myself. If Hána can, I can. But I think I'll overshadow the smoking area.
