I saw this movie with a live performance by the Buffalo Philharmonic, and the music was one of two things that definitely made the experience for me; especially, the song after the fight where the woman is looking for her husband, was just devastating. The other thing that came to me is the battle on the ice itself. A bit of strategy was thoroughly cut through the makers of _King Arthur_ in 2004. Also, the battle goes on forever (half an hour?) - painfully long. I can't think of another propaganda movie that makes the war less glamorous or rewarding. I'm surprised Stalin likes this movie so well; I do not want to go out and fight after watching it.
