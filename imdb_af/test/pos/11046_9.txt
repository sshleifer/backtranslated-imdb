Greta Garbo stars in 'Anna Christie', a very early 1930 MGM 'talkie', the first time 'Garbo Talks'. 'Anna Christie' is a powerful movie, but not for everyone. The film is filmed like a play, short on sets and cinematography, long on dialogue and dramatic characterization. Eugene O'Neil, who wrote the play 'Anna Christie', is known for his dark work and Garbo's character. Anna Christie is a dark figure with a tortured past. <br /> <br /> The sound quality on the DVD was mediocre. Not helping is that George F. Marion, who plays Anna's estranged father, Chris Christofferson, is verbally difficult to understand. Marion gives a good performance as the old drunken seafarers who are engaged in madness with his fiction of the evil 'devil'. But his dialogue was written with a very heavy Swedish accent, this applies to O'Neils' original game. Marie Dressler's dialogue as Marthy Owens is equally difficult to understand. In fact, Dressler promises a broken old drunk women, a 'crate gear'. Her dialogue is also true to O'Neils' original play, like Charles Bickford as Irish sailors, Matt Burke, pursuing Anna in a troubled relationship. Garbo is actually the easiest to understand. <br /> <br /> The film's strong point is Greta Garbo. She delivers a gut performance as a victim of neglect and abuse, leading to a life of prostitution. Garbo was a great star at the time and considered one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. Here her appearance is not glossy, it is tortured. Her body posture is almost doubled. She scorched her face to become a pathetic creature on the screen. Garbo brings these terrified feelings to the viewer to convince us of her misery. <br /> <br /> It's dark subject and Garbo brings it to life. It's not light food, not fun, not for everyone. 'Anna Christie' is a strong emotion that is unearthed for depth, a great ride.
