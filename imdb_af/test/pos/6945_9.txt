Kennedy-Miller could hardly have done a better job of tackling a very challenging exercise: dry political events work as a human drama, and offer a handy representation of explosive contentious issues. <br /> <br /> The key to his success on the first score is brilliant acting, although I was less impressed by Max Phipps' actions as Gough Whitlam and other commentators here. The clear views for my money were John Stanton as Malcolm Fraser and Bill Hunter as Rex Connor. The latter had to be one of the easiest deciding choices in history - Hunter could not have been perfect for the role anymore. With the second score, the series avoids the "myth of objectivity" fall through a narrator who articulates the sympathy of the director (Phillip Noyce, who more recently demonstrated his left-hand evidence in Rabbit Proof Fence). and sympathetic to his dramatic portrayal of all parties. The adherence to the Lady Kerr / Lady Macbeth theme that was popular with working partners might have been a bit partial but not so ruined. In particular, credit is due to the sympathy shown to Kerr and the extraordinarily difficult position to which he has been placed, whatever his actions. <br /> <br /> However, there is one sour cream for which the producers were. perhaps not quite to blame - the portrayal of the Jim Cairns / June Morosi case. Those coming to the series, with no backdrop to these events, will get the impression that Cairns and Morosi were the innocent victims of a smear campaign through a sharp print. The manufacturers can be limited by Australia's tedious defamation laws, and the recently demonstrated willingness of Cairns and Morosi to use them against those who proposed their relationship was sexual (which Cairns would eventually admit to a year before his death) ). But more could have been the bizarre way Morosi Cairns managed the office as Treasurer. <br /> <br /> If there is slander, there are some sobering opportunities where dialogue is obscured by insults being abducted. principals - by a squeaky noise at one occasion, and a very loud phone ring on another. Another Curiosity: The DVD release separates a line from the comic relief scene where a customs officer (played by then-Paul Chubb) served Tirath Khemlani on his arrival at Sydney Airport. Next in the queue is a hidden hippie, who just receives a disapproving look from Chubb when presenting his paperwork. In the original version, Chubb has something like: "drug bust in Bali, eh?" Said. Clearly, this line is no longer true in the aftermath of the Schapelle Corby case, which has dramatically illustrated that those who went to Bali in Bali can expect much worse than deportation.
