"One True Thing" is the kind of movie where the audience is inspired, which is strongly inspired. I do not necessarily mention that the film is elevated because it is not. In fact, the film is right depressed. I try to say that it takes a lot of money for a movie to generate emotional tears from an additional crowd. <br /> <br /> I cried in "One True Thing", enough to decide that it was one of the most emotionally powerful films of 1998. The characters were perfectly cast. The performances are all guaranteed by Oscar Nominees, especially Meryl Streep, who portrays the dying Kate extremely well. Her actions alone were enough to excel at the point of recommendation and give you a new standpoint. I also thought Renée Zellweger portrayed a realistic single-free woman who had to look after her own mother. The other role players, including William Hurt and Tom Everett Scott, were also excellent. The script of this movie was really fantastic. It's a little funny how the film's concept deals with the controversial events in my local environment. You see, I live near Lansing, Michigan, and now there's a big problem with assistant suicide doctor Jack Kavorkian's (excuse my mispelling if so) ways are just banned. The public will vote on this according to their beliefs in November. Having looked at "One True Thing", it has changed my perspective on this topic, although I have always believed in it. Without revealing the end of the movie, I will just say that suicide is a distant theme in this movie and I think it fits in with the beautiful story. Overall, this movie does have more emotional impact than "Titanic", "Save Private Ryan" or any other tearjerker released in recent years. I think this is because the main idea of ​​this movie is that this kind of thing happened every day, so it is better related to an audience. And indeed, this can happen to you.
