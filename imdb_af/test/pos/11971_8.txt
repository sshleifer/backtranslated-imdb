Carry about as much similarity to Dean Koontz's novel as Jessica Simpson does to a rocket scientist. When you read the book, I suggest you lose sight of it as far as possible before watching the movie. <br /> <br /> Watchers is your typical "Boy Meet Dog, but super-intelligent government lab experiment, dog and boy seems to be pursued by a super-intelligent and emotionally disturbed monster created by the same lab, and, Oh yes, did I mention the shady government agents chasing the monster chasing the dog? "movie. <br /> <br /> Corey Haim is the boy, Barbara Williams is his mother, Michael Ironside is one of the evil government, and Sandy the dog is, the dog (here called Furface here; Einstein in the book). <br /> <br /> The monster effects are ridiculously cheesy, much of the dialogue is laughing, the writing rarely makes sense or is credible - a good example is Haim's character's indisputable acceptance of the dog's intelligence, as if every Fido from the street can type messages on a computer board or bark once or twice! Hmm, that must be the puppy, right? Haim's performance is enthusiastic, but shaky, as he does the stupid dialogue with the least skill. Ironside is the highlight of many a bad movie, and it is no exception. He easily gives the best performance of the movie, although I am obliged to add that the dog (which is a good actor himself!) Comes in a close second. <br /> <br /> All in all, a horrible silly movie, and yet. . . And yet I watched it three times within a week. And yet I can't help it. Hey, what can I say, I have a taste for junk - and Michael Ironside (not that I actually tasted Michael Ironside - I'm sure there are laws against that). But a movie that makes me laugh so much (yes, even unintentionally) can't be bad. Criticize it for a guilty pleasure, a "yes, I know it's offensive stupid, but I like it anyway" movie. <br /> <br /> It's hard for me to judge. On a normal scale, I am forced to give it a D-, but on my own personal cheese scale it becomes an A-ram. <br /> <br /> Yes, I know. I'm so weird.
