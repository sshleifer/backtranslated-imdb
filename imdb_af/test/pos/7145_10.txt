This version didn't move me as deeply as the later Hollywood version with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While beautifully filmed and performed excellently, the BBC version was packed with dialogue that provided information that I found fascinating. This gave me a detailed overview of the intellectual, theological, and moral considerations motivated by C. S. Lewis. So it was more interesting and stimulating than the Hollywood version, but not nearly as visually stunning or viscerally influenced. However, while I didn't have a hilarious Kleenex in the theater, I used one and at regular intervals. I enjoyed this movie every time as much as the Hollywood version, and was grateful for the greater understanding I gained.
