I want to see that many people have never seen this movie, and those who usually discharge it as rubbish ... it's really bad. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie, I was almost one of those people ... thank you, I'm patient, otherwise I would never have found such a classic. <br /> <br /> As goofy as this movie, it's also a must have for anyone who is either a fan of 80's movies or just a sense of humor. <br /> <br /> I know there are many people out there who will tell you that this movie is a derivative of Better Off Dead ... as it is? They were both excellent movies! <br /> <br /> I can honestly say that Savage Steve Holland is a genius! 10/10
