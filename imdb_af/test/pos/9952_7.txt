William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice depicts Venice's 16th century. All Pacino plays Shylock, a Jewish loan shark who denies revenge on a Catholic who looked down at him. The movie is in the beginning a slow moving plot that builds up during the two plus hours. The film gives a very good and faithful appearance to his characters, especially Pacino. If you hear that Pacino is playing a Jewish player, you may think it won't work to watch Pacino's previous movie movie role. Yet it works very well, credit must be given to the costume designer and director of the film. The appearance of all the characters fits well with the duration of the play. The costumes resemble the Renaissance look that one can see. <br /> <br /> The film depicts a very antisemitic atmosphere. From the first minute to the last, it is shown how the Catholics are trying to take advantage of the Jews in every possible way, even to the point of keeping them in "ghettos" and not having them work regularly. Compared to the passion of the Christ, another recent movie that people believed was very antisemitic, Venice's trader, Passion looked like a Jewish holiday. The film shows how the Jews, or at least Shylock, wanted to take revenge for the abuse the Jews received. The location shots also look very timely and the scenery is sometimes very pretty or very ugly, depending on the scene of the movie, which makes it so much more realistic. To portray the beautiful and ugly, can also be seen as anti-semitic, because the ugly is usually shown around the Jews and the beautiful around the Catholics. <br /> <br /> Although the film tries to have a serious aura of certain parts add a bit of humor to the act. The oh-so-serious trial between Shylock and Antonio (Irons) added a little humor when Portia (Collins) and Nerissa (Goldenhersh) came to the trial and decided who would be the victor and victory. It may not be funny in itself, but to see that it was women who were disguised as men would be almost amusing. The all-embracing scene, which was so compelling, could probably have been even more memorable, makeup artist and director Michael Radford noted that the two women still look like women and can easily be identified. The director could also have seen that the women speak through their regular voices, rather than sounding like men, who are part of the scene, but do not completely kill them. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie gets a 7 out of 10
