First, this movie has no story. It is clear that during the production, many have been reconstructed - sometimes characters refer to a timeline that is impossible, and this is probably because the timeline of the whole story was never known to anyone on the set. <br /> <br /> It said the movie is a bit brilliant. Pfeiffer is wonderful - and I mean amazing, like Catwoman; its nails the character's inherent sexy darkness and good / bad tendencies. Walken is Walken - but even more nasty than usual. Devito is not true to the cartoon when it comes to Penguin, but he is good and memorable. <br /> <br /> Keaton is underestimated as Batman. <br /> <br /> And the music and style are pure cinema excitement. True, the 3rd law does not work. But the last 2 scenes are knockouts, and it is clear Pfeiffer and Keaton were meant to be in a trilogy that came down through the kinky darkness of this movie. It's too bad, because Pfieffer and Keaton had classic chemistry, and they performed in a third installment. Joel knows you might not have gotten the chance to destroy Batman for a whole generation of movie fans.
