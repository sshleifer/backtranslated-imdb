This is a good adaptation of Dan Brown's breathtaking book. I can't say it is novel or very good, but they made a movie you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better. The movie is pretty long, but in the end I felt some missing. Sound effects and soundtracks were very good. Acting was well done, but the character development phase was very poor. For people who haven't read the book, things can look too fast. From my point of view, instead of trying as much as things from the book, they could try to do the important scenes more properly. What made the book very good was the whole puzzle as the story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see nothing in the movie. Too much speed and the use of time not in a good way, these are the main problems of the movie. So it is worth looking at, but could be done better.
