I agree with the messages here that the book is not like the movie. I read the book as a high school in Sumter SC. I immediately fell in love with the book and eagerly waited for the release of the mini-series. As much as I liked the movie and thought it was done very well, I was disappointed that the movie didn't follow the book. I was glad the Orry was not killed as in Love and War or N&S II. <br /> <br /> Having grown up in SC and graduating from the University of SC, I fell in love with southern history because of this mini series and book. I had the honor of meeting John Jakes at a symposium in 1988 at USC. I stayed there and mr. Meet Jakes. Unfortunately I didn't ask him a question. But to meet him was honor enough. I was a major in accounting but have my minor in South Studies. In addition, I have patented many of my ways to Orry Main. Orry and myself are very similar. I feel I'm born 150 years too late. I am a southern man and very proud of this. <br /> <br /> Well, I fell in love with 2 women in the movie .... Genie Francis and Wendy Kilbourne. Man, do I have the hots for Wendy !!!! I could never find a real version of her. I hope someday !!!
