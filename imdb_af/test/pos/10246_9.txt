A gem from Japan where so many of the world's best films are made today. Stylistically, this is not all that is special. It's just a simple drama (with a few comics) about recognizable people going over their lives. Yuko Tanaka, famous for showing the character Lady Eboshi in Princess Mononoke, plays a 50-year-old spinster. She prides herself on her health, spending every morning in a powerful workout, delivering milk up and down in the steep hills of Nagasaki. After finishing this part-time job, she regularly works as a clerk at a grocery store (called S-Mart, which giggled this army of darkness). Along her milk trail, a 50-year-old man, whose wife dies. It is evident from the dairy woman and the man, a child service worker, dated at high school, and each one still has something of a loved one on the other. The movie actually has some big story problems. When the scriptwriter actually wants to unite the two untouched lovers, he uses a particularly incredible deus ex machina technique. The climbs are also really forced. But most of the film is beautifully small and striking of the two main characters, as well as many character characters. The film also has several subplots that seem to eventually weigh the film but never end. I think the best thing about the movie is Tanaka's heartbreaking performance as the lonely milk woman, who thanked her for being alone for the rest of her life. Whatever the problems, the movie usually exceeds them.
