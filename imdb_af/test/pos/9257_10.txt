For everyone who likes the series, this movie will be something to watch. However, it also leaves you more. I had the way that every character (detective) made an appearance. At least with the end of who's the fourth chair because they leave a reason for another movie. My guess is of course Bayless. The series was a very good set of scenes. This is a series of which I wish to have lived. Thanks to the cast for a great TV.
