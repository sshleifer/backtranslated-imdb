After searching for 6 months, I finally found this DVD. All I can say is it's over, the wait is waiting! "Rush in Rio" may well be the biggest rock DVD. I'm not joking. It's incredible! All the fuss about the crappy sound is true, but it doesn't make the concert uncompromising. I find it makes you feel you are actually in Rio and watching the concert of the audience. This is one of the reasons I love this DVD. It makes you feel like you're actually there. Also, Geddy, Alex and Neil have never been in better shape! Geddy's chorus is flawless, Alex's guitar play is still incredible, and Neil - absolutely no words to say. The camera work on this concert was very good, I have to say. They gave us a good look at everything on stage and in the audience. Kudos to the cameraman! Anyways, enough of me to shine! Check out "Rush in Rio" for yourself. You will be surprised. I guarantee it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
