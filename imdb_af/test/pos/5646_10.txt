My first Ichikawa in many years, and the first of his war films I saw, was going on from the beginning. In the very first scene, the nominal hero Tamura is told he cannot continue with his unit, after which he returned from the hospital. He believes TB? but he is not sick enough for the hospital to give him the amount of war wounds they have. But his old unit will not take him back either; His CO gives him a grenade and tells him that if he really feels hopeless to inflate himself, it's the honorable thing to do. <br /> <br /> The Philippines, 1945, and the situation looks really hopeless, for PFC Tamura and everyone else. Nobi is an odyssey by hell, or rather heroes ?? dewormed forests, dead rocky plains and death and dying Japanese soldiers hoping for an end only, by peace or death. Ichikawa's film is photographed in a beautiful B&W range that highlights both the desert feel of Tamura and those he meets on his journey to his punishment, and shows how really small and naked they are in the midst of the greatness of the mountains and forests are. ? This little relationship of people will end soon, the earth seems to say, but I will survive and barely notice. <brura> <br /> Tamura returns to hospital, but is not surprisingly rejected, and spends the rest of the film trying to stay alive, to stay alive and out of danger. He does not succeed in doing very well on any account, slowly starving and eventually a little apostate. Eventually he coincides with two other desperate men who have lost their units or survived their units and applied cannibalism and found in his weakened state to other armed men that the only way to live is to break with everything he believes in . <br /> <br /> Ichikawa's movie is so brutal, uncompromising and intense as any war movie I've seen. There are moments of humor and tenderness, but they are fleeting and do not keep in memory like the scene with the man on the mountain top that Tamura practically begs to eat his flesh? The repetitive black-comedic bit with Tamura who's worn-out shoes for learning a fallen comrade. The breakdowns that people will endure to survive. The truth is that it is a war, all wars, all humanity, as long as we remain so. A masterpiece that I probably won't look at for a long, long time again. Viewed through the beautiful Criterion Collection DVD.
