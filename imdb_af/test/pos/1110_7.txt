This movie has used its sites well with some incredible shots, dark and disturbing, moving the movie very slowly, but keeping you constantly watching. Modern Love worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year, offering audiences a glimpse of an Australian movie that is usually neglected. Most importantly, it is refreshing to see that Australian theater does not record the click-Aussie characters and story lines we killed in the course of the year. This film will compliment and debate any festival after its performances. The performances and characters are well developed, and cinematography is fantastic. An interesting exploration of family relationships and environments.
