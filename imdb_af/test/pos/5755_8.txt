It's a movie of a movie, Slapstick violence a-plenty, Simon Pegg and Green Spew. <br /> <br /> A suspicious power station and an uncontrollable motorcycle add to this stunker. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it, maybe not quite as well as below but not far. <br /> <br /> If you've never seen a guy walking through the nose on two hooks, then you're waiting for this movie to buy. <br /> <br /> I didn't even see the twist when it appeared that Ritchie and Eddie were both ghosts. <br /> <br /> Feeb - 1 cooked egg.
