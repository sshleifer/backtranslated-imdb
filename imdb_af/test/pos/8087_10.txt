I only saw this movie at the Berlin Film Festival's Children's Program and it just killed me (and almost everyone else in the audience)! And make no mistake about it, this movie belongs to the all-time 250! Let me tell you that I am not in any way associated with the creators of this movie, if that is what you believe in reading it. No, but this is actually IT! Never mention the label "children's film" on it, "Klatretösen" is a classic on almost every account! The story is about 12-year-old Ida (magnetic: Julie Zangenberg), who is devastated to learn about her father's terminal illness. Special surgery in the US would cost 1.5 million and of course no one can afford it. So do Ida and her friends, Jonas and Sebastian, what every good child would - and break into a bank! Sounds corny? Don't forget: it's not America, and "Klatretösen" is not the tear-jerk Robin-Williams plywood-du-jour. Director Fabian Wullenweber made a big-budget action comedy for kids and, son, he succeeded! Let me put it this way: This movie rocks like no child movie and few others have done before. And there's a lot more to it than just the "action". After about 20 minutes of by-the-numbers outline (well-awarded), it accelerates to a monster that: <br /> <br /> - effortlessly sets "mission impossible" to be ashamed (the numerous action rows become masterfully performed and looks really expensive - take it, mummy!) <br /> <br /> - dwarfs almost every other movie mode (not easy - they're just child murders here) <br /> <br /> - easy laces a dense story with enough laughter to make your carrey look for career alternatives <br /> <br /> - nodding to both Damon Runyon and Karate Kid within the same seconds <br /> <br /> - come up with so much divine humor that side of the computer that i can hear the american grading board, have crushed their pants from here. <br /> <br /> - actually driving soft and serious and sexy at the same time (ohmygod, what do I say? they're kids! they're kids! - never look at the last scene!) <br /> < Star Stafan Pagels Anderson, who has been "Miracle" everyone's favorite child actor since last year. <br /> <br /> What a drive!
