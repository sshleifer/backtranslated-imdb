<br /> <br /> When released, I released as lightweight popnons. It was a mistake. <br /> <br /> After repeated views and the view of a documentary of making DIRTY DANCING, the depth of this film certainly discovers its appeal. <br /> <br /> DIRTY DANCING is a film about change. The evolving nature of relationships within the family, the changes in the world view during their coming, etc. The story takes place during August 1963, the last weeks of the last summer of innocence for the American people. The many personal changes experienced by the characters reflect the many changes in the American society that will be marked by the Kennedy assassinations and Vietnam. <br /> <br /> Female filmmakers worshiped this film and made repeated trips to the movie houses this is the world's most successful dance movie. As a male, I find the romantic mating of ultimate stud Patrick Swayze with very simple Jennifer Gray very difficult to accept. It will be deadly for most romantic plays, and it can also cause the intense aversion of most male judges. <br /> <br /> The movie's soundtrack found the # 1 status before the release of the movie. To date, it is almost impossible to attend a wedding reception without hearing a DIRTY DANCING song. <br /> <br /> Within the center of the movie, Baby's mother wakes up and asks Baby's father, "Is there anything wrong?" /> <br /> Baby's father, the anti-change family member, tries to keep everything that happens secretly. He tells his wife to go back to bed. But resist as one can, change is unstoppable. DIRTY DANCING is the story of one person waking up only at the last moments of our country's last sleep in innocence.
