I watch the movie at the beginning of each summer, and it never stops me from entertaining me. Here's the jokes packed in every dialogue, giving you more than the average Simpsons episode. Some of the jokes fall flat or will only provoke a slight chuckle, but others will roll you and then there are those who cling to your brain ... "The audience is deaf now." <br /> <br /> The video knows it's a video, and doesn't pretend to be anything else. It is easy to sit back and start bombing humor. A good mix of slapstick, pop culture, and a tongue-in-cheek comedy ensures there's something for everyone. I was in the sixth grade when I first saw this video, and I have to admit I still find it hilarious, now I started college. <br /> <br /> It is a good movie to watch over the summer, much in the way you might see a wonderful life during Christmas or 'Ten Commandments' during Easter / Easter. More than that, it's just funny like hell.
