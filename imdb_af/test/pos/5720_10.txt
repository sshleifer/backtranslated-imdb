After seeing this routine by John Leguizamo, I finally realize why he is such a talent. I enjoy good stage work, and it works at its best. I can't call it a stand-up routine, because Leguizamo is so intense when you play the different characters. The only time he breaks character is when it is necessary to complete his part so cool, that you can't help but appreciate his talents. I wasn't really sure how I felt about him as an actor, but Freak appreciated him. For those outside who didn't have the opportunity to see this show, I feel for you. Definitely rule it out. This is one of the nest routines I've ever seen. Arrange with Eddie Murphy, Bill Cosby and Chris Rock. Four stars and more.
