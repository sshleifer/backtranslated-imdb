Rififi earns a lot of merit for the well-known hoist scene, and indeed the scene earns all the credit it gets. It is a masterful tension, character interaction and photography. But Rififi is not just this one scene - every scene in the film is so masterfully composed, and as a whole the film is not only taught with excitement, plot and character, but a sad story tells the scene for film fly for the coming year. <br /> <br /> Combined and technically, the heist sequence can be the most impressive scene of the movie, but to me it is the ultimate scene that holds the most power - Tony Hallofinis's hallucinogenic drive to salvation.
