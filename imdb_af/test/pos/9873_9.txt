This movie is pretty good as it is, but the indefinite producer's cut is my favorite movie in the series to the original. Jamie's story is handled differently, the dead scenes are 10 times better, there are more images of ritual-type things that give more story about Micheal, Jamie and her baby. There is also an alternative end which is also better. Why they didn't release this version, I have no damn idea. If you can find this version, see it.
