The hospital is a movie made before its time. This film, produced by screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, who gave us the Oscar-winning film "Network", deals with overworking staff, incompetence and bureaucratic corruption at a large conglomerate hospital in Manhattan. George C. Scott, in a stunning show as main clinic, is driven by alcoholism and a deadly desire while trying to recover from a divorce, throwing his son out of the house and worst of all, a medical facility where corruption and incompetence take precedence over the care and healing of the sick and injured. <br /> <br /> Mr. Scott makes the movie his own, and viewers will be shocked at what they see at this medical service. You can feel the "pain" (word intended) of what this hospital has done to him. The vibrant images of this hospital's incompetence are so vivid and dramatic that you can laugh and be disturbed from scene to scene. <br /> <br /> If the movie remained in the documentary style as it begins, this photo will be brilliant. Unfortunately, there is a subplot of Scott who falls to the daughter of a senile patient. The patient is killing people at the hospital. This is where the credibility of the picture is strained. The romantic dialogue screens don't add anything to the picture, and the mental patient, who pretends to be a doctor, was incredibly incredible. A simple security call and record should prevent the senile patient from doing the murders. It almost takes the whole movie, before security people are brought into the film to get the patient out of hospital. I couldn't see one person doing so much damage, just as corrupt as this hospital. <br /> <br /> Also, George C Scott's character is "overworked" (another word intended) because the writing has too many things happening. suddenly. For example, within 20 minutes you can accuse and deny as many as 20 different doctors what they did or did not. With the nurses and Aids, it's the same story. Someone's card was read incorrectly, someone gave the wrong medication and died. The doctor worked on the wrong patient. If a doctor does the same, a third nurse who was not on call blames the second nurse to be admitted The patient was on her coffee break. There is also a lot of subtle, dark humor with the same messages of incompetence and corruption that the viewer feels. <br /> <br /> This repetition of medical inability is memorable. However, the murder subplot is a distraction more than a tool for this movie. When the focus of this movie is on the incompetence of staff and Scott's responses to it, you are glued to the screen. But the conversations between Scott and the crazy patient's daughter force the movie into a riddle "Who Done It?" scenario that seriously harms the quality of the film. When the rewarding patient reveals how he did the murder, I wondered: Why do the producers need the "male patient subplot" to find the killer? I think the only point of Scott's character who has a relationship with the senile patient's daughter is to give him whom he should communicate with. The hospital had to maintain its grueling charge of the medical profession by removing the love interests and malicious patient scenes. It had to focus more often on the incompetent BS within its walls. In an era where this movie could be phenomenal, the sub-plot stories make the movie very good instead of the great masterpiece it could have been.
