Although the video technology may be dated, this classic musical play, now on DVD, is the best version of Sondheim's most important and polished work on Broadway. If you've never seen SWEENEY TODD, then you should buy this DVD. I saw this production at the Kennedy Center in Washington in November 1980, and fell in love with a pre-Murder She Wrote, Angela Lansbury. Then I tried to find any and all of her work, including: MOVIES: "The Harvey Girls," "The Picture of Dorian Gray," "Manchurian Candidate"; CDs: "Mame," "Dear World" and "Gypsy"; and many more. The rest of the cast is also flawless. All in all, this wonderful DVD gives us the definitive version of Sondheim's opera!
