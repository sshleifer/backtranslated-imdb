Up and Coming was a very positive sitcom, which brought an instrument / and channel that opened the young minds of the Black Culture. The focus and prospects were a message of positivity for our people and hope for change. I advise this choice for every American household to experience the struggle and the reward. The show was never given the chance to bloom in the idea that middle-class blacks themselves became business owners. The problem was so compatible with the real life situation that influenced the lives of so many. I sincerely hope that the whole volume can be restored and enjoyed on DVD for Americans with their families. <br /> <br /> Thank you.
