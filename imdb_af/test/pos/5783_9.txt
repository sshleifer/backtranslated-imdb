The end of the Suburbia, as it calls upon general citizens and mass consumers, is likely to become cultural reform status. The film uses super-cynical analysis by authors, policymakers, and social philosophers about the paradox created by the Suburban-Style life - mainly in the post-war era. <br /> <br /> What we created in America is a place with "none of the amenities of the country living, and none of the amenities of the urban city living." This is the prescription laid out for suburbs, and the film focus is on the simple idea of ​​"Oil". Basically, the most common sense is that the world is approaching or at the height of oil production, and when we fully realize it, important lifestyle changes will come into effect, whether it be our best interest or violent to be forced upon us by a quality of Even the slum dwellers of Calcutta could not describe us. <br /> <br /> If nothing more, the end of Suburbia will flush the viewer into their stomach, creating a sick feeling. This will happen. It is a dark outlook on our inherent way of life. The ambivalence is critical in every viewer, critically analyzing the film. I provide many unprepared viewers who obstruct the film as a liberal propaganda - such as a Michale Moore movie. What they do not consider is that a reaction like this is normal when such a message becomes so incredibly difficult for the lifestyles of the vast majority of the masses. <br /> <br /> This is the truth, and as a student studying city planning, I can tell you that we are now better prepared because the clever chance we have of the quality of life in this thirsty cesspool of tampered resources , is faster than a variety of people affected by the black pest.
