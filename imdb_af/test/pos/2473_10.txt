I can't believe I missed this one. Made in 1970 with a budget that probably allows you to make one careless episode of a TV soap, it is kept 90 minutes, sharply like a knife film. You will find the outline, plot etc elsewhere on this site. Although the whole thing was shot with a single hand, 16mm camera ... all the dialogue was improvised ... none of the "actors" appeared. in front of a camera ... It sounds like a recipe for a disaster. Instead of what we get, hippies are in the California desert who develop into a 'not fair'. I'm on that person's scenario. The only problem is that the director still makes you move your wedding and at the end of 90 minutes we are not yet sure who has one. Brilliant ... Very brilliant.
