Much of the previous commentary is right on the money, but some, though, not so much. <br /> <br /> It's hardly a B movie ... it's well produced, the live flying rows are really great, and the model series is first rate. It's not a cheap one. <br /> <br /> Ricard Barthelmess is pretty good at this, and it makes a good company for "Only Angels Have Wings". <br /> <br /> If you want to mock John Wayne, mock J. Carrol Naish, they end up together. <br /> <br /> Tom Browne is young enough (and somewhat dull), but when he saddles with the most pathetic pencil speed in the Hollywood history, it makes his character even less credible. Sally Eilers is much more so. <br /> <br /> Later, Wellman is in the early Airliner-in-Distress zone ... the opening order of this movie, with the Airline Operations man at the "Grand Central Airport" fit well with "The High and the Mighty" ... just think Regis Toomey ... and a 1955 Buick.
