It is a thoughtful film that carries the inequalities of the so-called higher class and those who work for them, the haves and the haunts. Robert Shaw does a deserving job in his role as compulsory, real driver, Steven Ledbetter, who initially helps her mental depression to help Lady Franklin (Sarah Miles). However, Steven has many mixed feelings about this lady of the upper class. He inevitably falls in love with her, which, of course, goes beyond the boundaries of society. <br /> <br /> I didn't read anything before and just judged the movie as I saw it. I consider it a very honest story about the realities of daily life and the conflict of what we expect or expect from life and what we get. It's a fine drama worth seeing again.
