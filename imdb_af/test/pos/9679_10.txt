If Family Guy insults you or you don't get the humor, unfortunately, this show makes you fun and the masses of excessive religious, dull and politically correct people in America. So set aside your morale and enjoy it with this show. FG is a hilarious mind opener to the reality of today's society. Whoever said this show is very wrong for a young immature audience. With all the references to old movies and politics 10-80 years ago, I couldn't imagine a young immature child finding this funny. Family Guy is definitely a mature frank audience who is not afraid to criticize American society. Beware of Seth and the whole crew who could make this show happen.
