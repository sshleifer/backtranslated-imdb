One has to be careful who you tell you to watch movies for 12 hours. It can be easy for people to assume that this is a kind of regular appearance. Even in the world of 'arthouse' theater, such rampant times are extremely rare, for obvious reasons. It's one thing Hollywood and art cinema have in common: the generally accepted 90-120 minute running time, with a minority of movies daring to approach, but the three-hour point is rarely exceeded. <br /> <br /> For this reason, a movie like Out 1 (runtime: 729 minutes) is a challenge for even the hardest cinephile. And it goes some way or another to explain why it was exhibited only a few times and is still extremely difficult to display. to find. <br /> <br /> Originally designed as a TV series by Mr. Nouvelle Vague director Jacques Rivette raised little interest from French networks and during the year a short theater career (Peter Watkins forced to do much the same with his brilliant nuclear war pseudo-documentary The War Game, though more about state censorship than running time problems). In 1971 several times appeared several times. Out of one, a handful of Rivette retrospectives have appeared over the past two decades, and many who have seen it, including valued American critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, have made it one of the greatest films of all time. <br /> <br /> Is it? Well, yes, if you like Rivette. This alone is a great 'if', as Jacques Rivette has never been a commercially successful director. Only two of his films were hits (Celine and Julie Go Boating (1974) and La Belle Noiseuse (1991), both fantastic), and many find hard to find on DVD (Out of 1 only recently became available over the internet) a rare video tape was uploaded). Nevertheless, he is highly respected in the film community and with good reason - his playful surreal stories, sense of pacing and use of improvisation, has singled out as one of the most unique and satisfying cinema people in the theater. <br /> <br /> From 1 deals with a theme that occurs through Rivette's work: the nature of acting, especially in the context of theater and improvisation. His fascination with acting makes Rivette's films a much more collaborative process than many of his contemporaries, as the improvisation aspects can give the actors a much more active role in determining how the film comes together. Out of 1, roughly divided into four main stories, which gradually interweave and fade as the film develops: two consisting of acting troops, each trying to devise the modern scene adaptations of Aeschylus plays; the other two separate little ones (played by Nouvelle Vague icons Jean-Pierre Leud and Juliet Berto) following eccentric methods of making money; and an overarching plot involving a mysterious Balzac-inspired conspiracy around an organization known as 'the thirteen'. <br /> <br /> As with any Rivette movie containing a conspiracy story, the secrets and secret organizations are a little more than a red herring. As the characters slowly explore and reveal and break down their plans and interpersonal connections, the film is becoming increasingly symbolic of post-1968 and the decline of the ideals of that era. For a film made in 1971, it was remarkably prescient themes; Another French director in Jean Eustache will tackle this topic equally satisfactorily in his 1973 masterpiece, The Mother and the Whore. But this is not the limit of Out 1's scope. <br /> <br /> Consists of eight episodes of about 90 minutes each (the beginning of each episode has a brief, abstract black-and-white silent montage of previous chapter events). Out 1 is no less visible than any quality TV series, and can even be experienced even on a one-episode-to-time basis. It is not to say that it does not remain challenging even when viewed in segments. Like most Rivette movies, it uses the first few hours to simply draw the characters before they start on the plot, and some of the early scenes (especially the sequences depicting the actress's heavy-abstract exercises) seem unnecessarily long. However, these scenes are important, not only as an exploration of the improvisation-working methods that play a literal as well as a metaphorical role in the film, but as a method to adapt the viewer to the somewhat thin pace of the movie. Paradoxically, long performances make long films very tolerant to an audience. This understanding of the pacing led Rivette, along with more modern directors such as Michael Haneke and Béla Tarr, to create less commercially run films, which nevertheless retain the ability to make viewers staggering. <br /> <br /> In a movie that deals in many ways about acting, the play is fantastic. Many well-known Nouvelle Vague faces appear, including former Léaud and Berto, the outstanding Michel Lonsdale and Rivette regular Bulls Ogier. Even another legendary director in Eric Rohmer has come a great deal as a Balzac professor who appears in a central scene. The people and architecture of Paris c. 1971, however, seems to play an equally important role - the urban provinces, crowds and interested prospects freeze Out 1 in time, a document from a place at a point in history. <br /> <br /> After a little over 720 minutes, the movie ends on an impossible short, enigmatic note; Yet, the exhausting journey that the viewer has used is so full of possibilities, complexity and spontaneity, that you would be forgiven to start from the beginning or see the next twelve hours in the lives of these characters. For those who have watched many types of theater and think they have seen everything the art form offers, Out 1 is a reminder that the cinema has the potential to be so much more and so much more direct than the current conventions allow . For filmmakers, film critics and artists of all disciplines, it is something to be cherished.
