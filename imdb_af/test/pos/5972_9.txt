Fantastic Russian WWII movie. Like most Russian WWII movies, the Ascent is incredibly harrowing. It is also dense in its symbolism. The story follows two parties, Sotnikov and Rybak (Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin), looking for a mission to find food. On their journey, they were traced by German soldiers, who wounded Sotnikov. Sotnikov, in turn, kills one of the Germans, leading to problems for both parties and anyone who later invades them. The biggest success of the movie is its lively sense of place. Russia is frozen and snow, and it is difficult not to feel cold, go straight to your own legs. Shepitko holds her lap close to the characters and examines every power of their faces. This was probably not the choice, but the movie is ranked 1.33: 1, which gives the film a sense of claustrophobia. While the whole movie is quite an achievement, I felt the first half was stronger than the second. My main complaint about the movie is that it develops into a very unbreakable Christian allegory through its climax. I just don't think the symbolism adds much to the proceedings, especially if I have already been affected by the debate between the two parties. It is not quite fair. I have weighed the pros and cons of their argument. I started to lean to a certain character's point of view, and then the director appeared and told me he was Judas! Despite the hardship, it is still a must-see.
