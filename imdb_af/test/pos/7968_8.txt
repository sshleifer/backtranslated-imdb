As soon as you sit down to watch this movie as a canon for Cordoba, you get the feeling that it will be good. The reason? The film starts with an exciting score by listed composer Elmer Bernstein who gave us such memorable themes such as The Great Escape and the Magnificent Seven. Indeed, if you read the opening credits, the cast is no more than George Peppard as Capt. Rod Douglas, you know it's going to have action and a lot of it. If you see actor John Russel playing General John J. Pershing, you know you're in for a heroic saga. The story is taken from the annals of the Mexican Revolution and engages the US in a border dispute with the Mexican bandits who cross the Rio Grande in the early 1900s. Among the best of the rebel leaders is General Cordova (Raf Vallone). With his army of the Mexican revolutionary, he attacked Pershing, killing his men and stealing valuable artillery pieces. As the US Army cannot legally enter Mexico, Capt. Douglas sent to what is sent a suicide mission, without orders and without the help of Pershing. His mission is to recover the guns, destroy a rebel fortress and bring Cordova back to life. Douglas arrives in Mexico and chooses the toughest, most difficult, most experienced, surely the most rude men. He enters the almost impassable fortress. Dramatic action follows, just like many explosive excitement. If anyone asks for criticism, I would like to say the choice of hardship. Vallone and John Larch are not very threatening. Not so with the men who join Peppard. Pete Duel and Don Gordon (Who is wonderful.) Nevertheless, this movie is recommended as a good show. ****
