Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman play Adele and Ann August, a single mother who is the working definition of the word "dreamer" and her solemn pragmatic daughter. Adele, who wants to make a new start in a big city, moves them from Wisconsin to California. <br /> <br /> Thoroughly, if not exceptional or particularly memorable, with some serious and sad moments. It pushes some emotional buttons, that's for sure. The best thing it offers is a solid throw, and Sarandon and Portman are pretty good at the lead - though their characters are sometimes one-dimensional. <br /> <br /> Could be better, could be worse. <Br /> <br /> I gave this one out of ten.
