This movie is excellent! Angel is beautiful and Scamp is treasure! His little yelps when he is scared, and the funniest parts are when: Scampie is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp sings "I never had this feeling." this movie is totally recommended. It is on a special edition on June 20th. The cover has a rubbish bin on a rubbish bin and Angel under the lid. <br /> <br /> I can't declare this movie more than romantic, charming, hilarious. , and adorable.The junkyard scenes are funny, all the junkyard dogs have something special. To be funny, I laughed, kids will love it. Buy it when it comes out, it has new features!
