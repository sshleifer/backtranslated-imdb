I remember when skateboarding had it in the 70's. I asked my parents for money through a friend's second-hand skateboard. It was a piece of litter, complete with clay birds and everything. I also remember reading the Skateboarder Magazine and both were totally impressed and totally scared of the Dogtown team. Skating has never become a way of life for me, but in some ways it has always been part of my life, whether it's a transport advice or just a lot of friends who have skate. <br /> <br /> This film is a brilliant documentary of the actual birth of modern skating. To watch this crowd, turn off the flat boring hobby, it was in the vertical lifestyle it became, if I slept for 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that enough material from this period still exists to create this movie, and thank you for that. The visuals are brilliant. It made me feel like watching an old Buster Keaton movie: I've seen some of the tricks. Keaton has repeatedly repeated in other films, but if you go back and see the first person to perform that trick, it's amazing that, not only were they the first person to try it successfully, but that they were through it lived and it seemed to be effortless. It's the feeling this movie gave me. Yes, I've seen people skate pools before, but to see the FIRST people's skate pools and design the tricks that eventually became the basics of modern skating is to watch the facade of the house fall to Keaton, so he is safely in the frame. from a window. It is absolutely brilliant to see something that has never been tried before, but since then almost everyone has tried. <br /> <br /> This movie is beautiful to watch and incredible to listen to. The soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard in a movie. It's a movie that people will see if they want skating or not. I talked to some of my friends who made their girls through the movie after heavy protest. They all said their girls were nailed at the end of the movie and loved as much as they did. <br /> <br /> As for the previous comment on this board complaining that the film itself is congratulating, I think it's an unfair departure. I liked seeing these guys get excited about their past. They created something that influenced their sport and changed it forever. They have the right to complain. They were stars to do what they loved to do. Most of these guys never got the striking success of Tony Hawk, but that kind of success wasn't available to skaters. Certainly, they had a little success, but more importantly, they could do a life they love to do, and as we finally see, treasure and almost all still surf, skate or work in the surf / skate industry. How many of us can say that we could live our lives and succeed by breaking all the rules and doing what we like to do? They can. My hat is down to the Dogtown and Z-Boys to be themselves and change the world of skateboarding forever.
