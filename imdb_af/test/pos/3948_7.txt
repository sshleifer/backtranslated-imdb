One of the intriguing aspects of this historical drama is the way in which the "Tories" or British American loyalists are portrayed, and given the kind of glory to their fierce support for King George III. In many ways, the American Revolution was definitely a family relationship, in that some of the richer colonial families were divorced. If there is a strong criticism of this movie, it may be that people in this story are made to be a little more beautiful than they were in real life. <br /> <br /> In some ways, the act of the character of Major Boulton, played by Cornel Wilde, makes him the least slightest member of the cast and the error in the storyline. He seems to vary from a stinging kind of patriot to some sort of 'thing for the case', partly. This film focuses heavily on the ideas of personal honor and personal prestige that were an important social norm in that day and age. <br /> <br /> In its subtext, the fact that about 25% of the colonial population was definitely pro-Britain was also skipped. But the strength of the Tory element is apparently not malignant, although the good doctor character is about twenty-five percent higher in class (stealing a fine phrase from Monty Python's Flying Circus). Anne Francis does a lot with a rather thin section of the script, and it comes out. She was a good choice for the woman of divided loyalty, a 'gal' who was rather modern than the social conventions of that day would have been possible - if there was no life and death struggle. <br /> <br /> One good aspect of the movie is the way in which the contradictions of American revolutionary leaders have been in absolute jealousy, and how these personal conflicts have sabotaged the entire revolutionary effort. All in all, the leading characters are very well drawn, the minor characters are not only human "props", and the scenes are credible enough to carry the dramatic action. <br /> <br /> It's a great spy roller. It's not a big historical drama, but it does do well. It counts seven a lot because Cornel Wilde is so deeply immersed in his role and does so well, and because Anne Francis uses most of her supportive efforts. <br /> <br /> The color print used on Turner Classic Movies. was also very clear, and so it was a pleasing representation in that important connection. <br /> <br /> Hope it will be back soon.
