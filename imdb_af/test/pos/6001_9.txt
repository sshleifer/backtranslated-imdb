Lemuel Gulliver (Ted Danson) is a sea-missing doctor and leaves pregnant Mary (Mary Steenburgen) behind. Eight years later he becomes excited and seemingly angry - about his adventures in the countries of the Little Liliputians, the giant Brobdingnags, the waving island of the intellectual Laputa, and the Houyhnhnms, a race of intelligent, talking horses that deal with the Yahoos - a breed of bestials - under many other adventures. The not-so-good dr. Assets (James Fox), who has designs on Lemuel's wife, took up Gulliver in a spiritual setting. Lemuel, Mary and Thomas Thomas (Tom Sturridge) must find a way to prove his common sense. <br /> <br /> A beautiful adaptation of Jonathan Swift's satirical novel, this film is a wonderful adaptation to so many levels: the story, the satire, the characters, the footage, the brilliant cast. It's just a surprise to watch, and it's almost amazing, as it's a TV for the TV. <br /> <br /> The film does a brilliant job of capturing Swift's evil satire, which, like a hotbed by the British cut society, is resonating today. The wise Brobdingnags and the Houyhnhnms are almost perfect individuals who find it virtually impossible to understand why Gulliver speaks with so much pride in the malice and corruption of his society. The screens where Gulliver struggles to prove himself different from the Yahoos are perhaps the best, with biting satire in describing how they choose their leaders ("they seem to be the worst among them ... who governs until they get worse) ", go to war (" We're just going for a very good reason after the war - as they are weaker than we, whether we want their country "), etc. The screens in which Laputa is involved are also done effectively - the intellectuals are so wrapped up in their specialized fields that they have no time for anything else and have virtually no common sense. And adding the asylum plot greatly enlarges the story. Dr Bates is really nasty in character, and if he gives a speech to the investigation about Gulliver's alleged defamation, it is clear that he describes his own mistakes. <br /> <br /> The film uses beautiful and fairly convincing CGI effects that depict the many diverse settings of the novel with great effect. The contrast of sizes is done in a very experienced way, and all the worlds portrayed in the story are convincing in their own way. The cinematography (especially asylum) and the costumes are done brilliantly. Editing the present with Lemuel's memories is a device that can be uncomfortable, but works very well. <br /> <br /> The role play is truly wonderful; a real one who's got British and American talent. Ted Danson gives an excellent, multi-layered performance as Gulliver, effectively showing his transformation of a person confused by his strange environment, to the disturbing state he has again, to his rational, intellectual personality at the end . Danson is best known for his work at sit-com, and shows that he is more than just Sam Malone with this great serio comic show. Mary Steenburgen is effective as his wife, and James Fox is absolutely repulsive as Bates. The rest of the film is made up of cameos, with Peter O'Toole, Omar Sharif, Warwick Davis, Kristin Scott Thomas, Geraldine Chaplin, Alfre Woodward, Edward Fox and Sir John Gielgud being the most memorable - but even the smallest parts played a lot. <br /> <br /> While not 100% true to the book, "Gulliver's Travels" is a triumph of story and images. It should not be missed. <br /> <br /> 9/10
