"Pixote: Doing a Guide Mais Fraco" deals with what may be the biggest of all Brazilian themes: poverty. And along with poverty are the other unnatural feelings and actions that bring it; prostitution, violence, crime, rape and murder. <br /> <br /> Brazil is the country of paradox and its social problems are everywhere. The difference between the rich and the poor; the beautiful and the ugly; happiness and the most profound human decline. <br /> <br /> "Pixote" is one of the movies that dares to touch and open these painful wounds, without the slightest glory of hope, in an honest portrayal of a country that , like Pixote itself, is already lost.
