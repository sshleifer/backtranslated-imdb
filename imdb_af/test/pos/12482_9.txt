First, the obvious? As a cop drama crossed with a funny melodrama, QUAY ?? is disturbing, completely independent and a threat to banality. Jouvet's aplomb is well used in a tough police performance that is immediately evident by its power and exuberant power; his Antoine is not so much a man of mind, but a man of great life experience and earthly instinct. QUAY ?? is not subversive in the sense that today's (and yesterday's) philistines use the word. It's Clouzot's most playful hour. He tended to adjust Steeman's books into a satirical note. (It is said that Clouzot was a great reader of detective stories.) As a director, Clouzot's solid hand is successful. <br /> <br /> It's not a secret or an excitement, but a satirical look at a Parisian couple and at the police's proceedings. Those who are accustomed to the masterpiece of Clouzot, LES DIABOLIQUES, can surprise the variety of things, styles, elements in QUAY. Here, Clouzot talks about many things, about a few and a hidden love story (Simone Renant's for Blier), about the entertainment world and about old spiders, about police techniques and an old bitter policeman with a boy to collect , etc. There is a sign of exuberance? Not only in Jouvet's performance, but also in the film's concept. <br /> <br /> Quay is a realistic crime drama made as a satire. It offers an excellent performance by Jouvet as a tough police inspector. Antoine is an old policeman with an adventurous past (he fought in Africa, but did not climb the ranks of his ranks due to his independent behavior); he lives with his son, a schoolboy; At work, Antoine is tough and ruthless, a competent inspector, bitter, intelligent and hard. It's an important movie, very picturesque. Jouvet compiled his character with several defining features: his clothes, his expression, his funny accent, his brutality, and the mocking air. Antoine is not made to look smarter than likely; When he quizzed, Antoine made mistakes, and his talent was presented as the talent we meet in real life, mixed with flaws and gaps and defects. Antoine's talent is one that also comes from experience, from daily observation. It is not the almost supernatural genius of almost all the famous detectives. <br /> <br /> QUAY ?? is multicolored ?? it is a realistic crime drama, and also a satire and a melodrama. One can see it as one of the first film films in the legendary toughness of the French police. Long ago, Eastwood and Wayne's hard police, there was Antoine. <br /> <br /> The title is interesting, indicating that it is a movie about the police, not a matter or a mystery. <br /> <br /> As craftsmanship, Clouzot was perhaps the best and sharpest in France (like Welles was). QUAY ?? is true for Clouzot's nature? a sardonic comic, sharp observations, a lot of psychology, sharp, unparalleled irony. The man was the first class when he filmed something? He knew what to shoot, what to choose? See the introductory scenes of this movie, featuring Jenny Lamour's grand stage success. Every scene is memorable, eg. Shot. Clouzot's technical, stylish layout was wonderful. His style is ingenious, satirical, sharp, extremely slim, ingenious. <br /> <br /> Jouvet's style was lavish, powerful and fierce. (Some just marveled at these features. He was a great stage actor, and his movie style was too theater, etc.). His Antoine is a good example of what is meant by a compositional composition. <br /> <br /> Your fat had a very peculiar physiology, like a threatening raptor? Something like Van Cleef? Even more subtle, nobler and more intelligent and distinguished. Jouvet had this deceptive, turbulent air, and it's handy here, as he is carrying out an old, difficult cop. One of QUAY ?? Its sides are that it's a Jouvet considered. He is immediately recognizable, identifiable by the quality of his play (I see that many people see this movie, don't know it is a Jouvet movie, which in itself is an amazing quality). <br /> <br /> Fresnay and Jouvet are the two French actors I admire most; The first one was made known to me by a Renoir drama (the famous), while Jouvet by a Carn√© comedy. I was delighted to see that Clouzot both gave them two main roles. <br /> <br /> To end, a word about Steeman; he wrote the novel by Clouzot (who previously adapted another Steeman novel as a Fresnay comedy). Steeman was an old writer-writer, in the Wallace vein. He quickly became obsolete with the new hard-boiled fashions. When I was 11, I read one of his exciters and liked it very much.
