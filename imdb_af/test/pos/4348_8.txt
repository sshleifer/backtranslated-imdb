<br /> <br /> O my word !! I have never seen a movie missing in any kind of moral judgment or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum! Michael Winner here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gung-ho troth world of deep and damaged performance. He not only gives us the spoon he feeds us, and says: "Look what you are looking at yourself and ask the question: Do you enjoy it?" And even if you tell yourself it can't !!!! You will know that deep inside you will know ... this is a masterpiece
