I watched this movie at the Sundance Film Festival and I was also surprised that it didn't generate any more notices, as it wasn't just powerful and beautifully crafted but very original. The audience was completely engaged and the bulk of watching a movie like a festival is the opportunity to talk to the director and then enter the Q&A session. They literally had to throw us out of the room for the next movie - we could go on for much longer. The film is at the same time thoughtful and hilarious. It will be a pity if this movie is not picked up for wider distribution - I hope it will be available on DVD at least because I want to see it again and share it with everyone I know.
