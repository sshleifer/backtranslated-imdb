Dolemite is a blowing film about, well, Dolemite and his army of Kung Fu killers, led by Queen Bee. He fights to get his club, The Total Experience, back from Willie Green using their kung fu abilities and dedication to him. I like this movie because of the witty dialogue and also the use of Rudy Ray Moore's ability to preach his brothers in rhyme.
