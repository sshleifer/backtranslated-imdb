I read a few jokes about court cases. These people betray their ignorance. This production only had wonderful lengths to recreate all aspects of the period in which the story took place. Courteous ways are something few people ever see outside the court. While the play may look highly stylized, it's actually as nearly as possible of the behavior of individuals in their particular stations that the director can create. The actors' facial expressions are a wonder, especially the double Marquis Changxin and the King's mother. Of course, there is reflection of both Greek and Shakespeare tragedies in the relationship between the king, his parents, and his love. The composition of the king that changes from good to bad and the assassin from bad to good, gives much to think about the evolution of an individual's nature. This movie will be widely considered in a college course on the humanities. <br /> <br /> At the same time, it rinses almost, even in the slowest scenes on its way to a relentless denial. One suspects the involvement of much of the troop movements, which was pretty great. This makes the Lord of the rings compare light scenes. Few directors have the ability to literally enter thousands of people in the field for the sake of art. I remember one scene in which at least 30,000 troops can be seen across a large plain. The logistics for such a shot would have been staggering. <br /> <br /> I can go on ... but simply I can't recommend this movie highly enough.
