I thought this movie was wonderful, not just because of its story, but because it was portrayed by the excellent role. I read that Drew Barrymore was not exceptional like Josie Geller because she was beautiful. Yes, she might be, but in the movie she played outside herself, looking for a mere girl looking for who she is in the world. The story is sweet and definitely for the hopeless romantics out there, I'm sure. David Arquette is crazy like her brother Rob, and Michael Vartan is wonderful like Sam Coulson. Leelee Sobieski did an excellent job as her partner Aldys, someone who wasn't afraid to be herself. I think this movie should get more credit than being branded as a "teen boppy" flick
