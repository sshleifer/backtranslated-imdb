Chris Smith's American film is an insightful investigation into the American dream. The film focuses on Mark Borchardt, an independent film maker from Wisconsin. Mark dreamed of becoming a great writer and director since he was a teenager and had an out-of-focus hi8 camera. The film follows Mark through his attempt to make his dream movie, Northwestern. There are a number of hilarious scenes in the film as Mark goes through North West pre-production and later his short film Coven (pronounced fellow friend, the correct pronunciation, Mark says "sounds too much like oven") he plans to use raise money to complete North West. This film's insight and humor is on the same scale as Roger and Me, Michael Moore's great film. I first saw it on a chaotic screen of the Sundance Film Festival, which took out the spirit of the movie. A huge air duct fell from the ceiling at the beginning of the movie, hit seven people and caused a twenty-five minute delay. Halfway through the movie the sound began to flutter and the projector had to be stopped to fix it. In the last twenty minutes, the projector stopped and burned the film. Despite the delays, the audience remained in the movie and gave it a standing ovation. American Movie also won the Grand Jury documentary award at the end of the festival. I recommend this fine film, it is worth sitting through a clear screen.
