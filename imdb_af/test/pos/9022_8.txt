I love this movie. I saw it about 10 hours ago for the first time and had to rewind it so my sister could see it. This movie is so funny. There are two times I laughed so hard, hurt my sides. I didn't expect to watch a movie so funny; I really just wanted to see it because Laura Fraser is in it. I first saw her in Titus, which is also a fantastic movie. <br /> <br /> As other reviewers have said, too many people expect a deep moving movie. You're not gonna get it. What you will get is humor, candy and the chance to ask yourself exactly how your perfect mate would look if you could create it. You can also wonder how it will be to hold on to the body of the opposite sex. <br /> <br /> A hilarious sequence means that Justine first sees her as a naked man. I broke. <br /> <br /> I swear, this movie is the most imaginative teenage movie I've ever seen and it's my favorite now. <br /> <br /> Just remember why movies were original. created; if not entertaining philosophy in motion. Remember this and you'll have a good time watching Virtual Sexuality.
