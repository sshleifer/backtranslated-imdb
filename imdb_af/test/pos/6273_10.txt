Expect the second part of the ATOR !! Quickly directed by JOE D'AMATO, specialist in all types of subgenres of exploitation, and again interpreted by MILES O'KEEFFE. the budget of the movie debio is scary or minimal. Despite not being a better movie of his antecesora, he is not entertained, also ATOR 2, it has something, something that makes it. His introduction that you plug in explains ATOR's origins to us with images of the first part. The writing is incredible, like any comic book of the brilliant ROY THOMAS. has such fantastic elements in the world of SWORD and such a fantasy as invisible men, black men, cannibal monkeys ... the role of the villain, this one interpreted brilliantly. The final this battle is very good. There is a lack of violence and blood, but this one is good. It never gets boring. It has everything missing from ATOR 1. Be spoiled with me! 4/5
