The main point of the movie, IMO, is the fact that Joanna's whole life is nothing but a series of facades. The film opens her secretly to kill her gray roots and hide the used kit in an empty tissue box. What is strange is that she hides it from her HUSBAND. If she has to hide worldly things from her beloved, one can bet she hides even bigger things from others who are involved in her life. <br /> <br /> When Joanna accidentally hits Cory, she leaves the scene for police. By the time she returns, the police and ambulance are there, as well as people from her community, who say, "What kind of person does a child hit and just leave her there?" Respected in her community, she made the decision to remain silent about what she had done. But she never realized how difficult it would be to stop her facades. <br /> <br /> Great movie-I've seen it many times!
