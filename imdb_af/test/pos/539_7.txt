It's a movie to watch only on television. I mean it's good, but it's a bit too long and the plot is so familiar, it's not very original, but it's not boring. The best thing about the movie is the performances, Natalie Portman and Susan Sarandon are great actresses and in this movie they did a good job. I give it a 7.
