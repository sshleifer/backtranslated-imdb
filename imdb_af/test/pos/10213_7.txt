I saw it years ago, and it's entertaining, but not deep. The basic story is of a young man dreaming of Midian, though he is not sure where it is or even if it really exists. <br /> <br /> Spoilers Follow: He finally visits it, is transformed into a night-roots by another. Then he has to help the other members of the Nightbreed because they are attacked by the Canadians. (Look for accents, they all work like Good Ol 'Boys. Not much in line with Canadian psyche?) Someone observed for "monsters" or "nightbreed," replacements "Jews" and for Canadians / substitutes, "Nazis", and you need to gain an insight into the battle through the monsters against the people. Well, maybe. <br /> <br /> One major objection I had was that while the underground city was interesting, it was rather ramshackle and honest, dirty. It should be a convention for films with underground settlements. One would think that if the monsters were the good guys, some would have at least a little sense of decor. <br /> <br /> The storyline is a bit thin, but it is to introduce characters. But it's enough to entertain a repeat.
