The Green Butchers or The Green Butchers, as it is called in English, is a very dark comedy about two losers working for a popular butcher. They are aware of their criticism of their bosses and decide to start a business themselves. Their store is expensive and doesn't even have electricity all over the place. And to make things worse, they didn't have clients (as their former boss predicted). When the man visits them in their shop, he challenges them to organize the meat for a dinner he organizes. <br /> <br /> If a tragic accident happens. One of the butchers closes the electrician in the fridge when he closes the store. The man dies and the neurotic one of the butchers decides to cut fillets out of the electrician's thigh and serves it at dinner instead of calling the police. This is an incredible success. All in all, every person in the village wants to taste that amazing "chicken". Overwhelmed by his sudden success, the butcher sees no other option but to kill more people, which he can sell as a chicken. <br /> <br /> I think the subject of cannibalism cannot be enjoyed by everyone, especially because it shows with lots of humor. Personally, I liked it very much. It shows perfectly how far some people would go for some social acceptance and getting out of their isolation. It may be a bit far-fetched, but I'm sure you'll be surprised to see how people in real life sometimes act. <br /> <br /> Besides the original topic, I was also happy with the actors' performances and humor. There is no over-processing, as you might expect in these types of movies, it's all very sober and realistic (I think it's typical for Scandinavians and Scandinavian movies). Same for humor. I'm sure I didn't have that much as I did now if the humor was over, or with a lot of speed, vomiting, ... as you often see in American movies. I loved this movie and I give it an 8/10.
