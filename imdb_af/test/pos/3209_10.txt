Hands off, the best drama / comedy program on television. A cleverly written performance about a young mother and her 16-year-old daughter exploring life and not just finding out about the world but also themselves. Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) struggles to find a way to stay in close contact with her daughter, but sends her in the right direction, which is getting harder and harder by the show. Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) caught up in a world of books and learning only to discover boys and her own rebellion, both of which surprised them. With the help of Luke Danes (Scott Patterson) and Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy) and a wide variety of other hilarious characters, this show remains one of my favorites. What really puts the show on top is the complex, amazing and witty writing, which often uses references from pop culture to the mink dynasty.
