This film is considered controversial today but is still very funny. The racial stereotyping is done with a view to humor and not hate. This film shows off and shows how corrupt politicians were in the early 1930s. This film proves it began before the 1970s and then as it accelerated in the United States. Lloyd is still in his typical genre here, even though his character has been raised in China. <br /> <br /> The meaning of a Cat's Paw in this case is a person running for political office, but is used by the established political machine to promote their agenda. In other words, they think this man (Lloyd) is harmless when walking in the office. When he was elected, he surprised them. <br /> <br /> The same theme is later used in James Stewarts movie. Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Stewarts are more well known and have a stronger message. This movie is smarter and subtle that is Harold Lloyds' brands. <br /> <br /> There is still the heart of the romantic comedy that is hidden in the facade of the movie, but today's mainstream audiences will still appreciate the political humor and the end is absolutely priceless. I wish someone could beat today's political system this way. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed this movie and found myself having more of Harold in the 1930s. <br /> <br /> At least we have this one. I think the person most quoted in the movie is fictional Ling Po. I always thought Confusicus was the wise one, but this one makes me believe the wisdom of China is not limited to him and is a vast area of ​​comedy Lloyd mined in this movie.
