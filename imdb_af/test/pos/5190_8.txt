Naked City: JWAB does a pretty good job of balancing its two A-B stories, although I don't all love multiple plot movies. And Scott Glen and Courtney B. Vance double the screen. However, I'm not sure what kind of message a movie sends when two flat-footed maidens can leave themselves with the murder, theft or theft, and win a free home (in the first class no less - in the least of looking at their clothes anyway). Well, I think the blue wall of silence still thinks! <br /> <br /> Rating: 8
