Subscribed to the imdb to say what a lovely movie Love Love is and is completely confused. Looks like someone was mixing their titles. "Plastic demon baby" what? It was not Love Life. A little luvy dovey for my taste, but a great, funny and original movie. Especially like the end that did not fall into the normal pit of cliche, that all Hollywood romantic movies collapse and burn it. Nine out of ten.
