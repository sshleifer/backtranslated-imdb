This film is one of the classic of the cinema's history. It is not made to please modern audiences, so some people may think it is tight or quiet nowadays. I found it absorbing everywhere. Cherkassov has exactly the right presence to play Alexander Nevskyi, just as he did when he played Ivan Grozny (Ivan the Terrible) several years later. The music was beautiful. <br /> <br /> My one complaint was the poor soundtrack that was rather messy. Although I only know a little Russian, it would have been nice to take out more words rather than relying on almost 100% on the captions. However, I watched it on an old video tape from the library. Perhaps there is currently a DVD version that has improved the sound. I would like to know if the actors used archaic Russian or even Old Slavonics when speaking. The captions were strangely formulated, and it is hard for me to say whether this would reflect an older way of speaking, or whether the captions were just a little poor.
