NORTHFORK is especially a masterpiece of widescreen cinematography. For this alone, the movie is worth your time. The sharp, wide open plains and bad areas of eastern Montana are trapped in the conservation, subdued ground tones of autumn or early spring. The giant gray cement Fort Peckdam is the starring film. The film reacts both subtly and not so subtly about about a dozen issues of Western Landscape. The dialogue can sometimes be tried, but the images and concepts are powerful enough to lift the movie. The 1950s work so well here and done so well. I think the passing years will be so good with this movie.
