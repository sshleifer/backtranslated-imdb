For a long time, I, a fan of The Monkees TV series, refused to watch "Head" because it was not about the hot and wonderful TV show characters. "Head," instead, said it was a cynical, dark film. Eventually curiosity made me move in. Of course, I didn't find a new episode for the TV show, but a fascinating movie dressing in my dark side. <br /> <br /> I've always been fascinated by dreams, and "Head" was much like watching someone else's dream, with incomplete hints of stories and a little detail at the end of one scene that caused The movie comes in a new direction, much in a dream stream of consciousness. The unfinished stories let my imagination pass the time of time again! <br /> <br /> The movie also features very striking, beautiful cinematography, the image of the black-and-white, white-on-black appearance of "Pappa's Song". The music is haunting, especially the sumptuous arrangement of "The Porpoise Song". ("The Porpoise Song" is the favorite song of my dark side, while my bright side prefers Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah.) <br /> <br /> In the end I think the TV series could have used some of "Head "'s drama, plot and intensity. But "Head" could have used some of the TV program's warmth, humor and friendship.
