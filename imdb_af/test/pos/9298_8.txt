Let's see it, Australian TV is for the most part horrible, but it's a real diamond that doesn't look enough people. The Chaser crew doing the satirical newspaper and CNNN are trying to film something new through live comedy, pre-recorded sketching and political satire in one show before a lively audience, sorta like Rove, but funny. They like to cause controversy and this causes some of the scalest moments, especially Chris, to tell his wife to live on breakfast television. Julian gives a novelty check signed by Saddam Heusein at the head of the AWB. It should be one of the funniest Aussie shows since the Micallef program.
