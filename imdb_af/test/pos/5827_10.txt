What a great show! A very underrated dramatic performance. It's great that there are no main characters and each episode is a different character (s). I think the best character on the show is Vern Schillinger. He is a difficult, bad man and an Aryan on top of what makes him a really bad old prisoner. There is much that is known. This show has many murders, I think it's a bit exaggerated for the murder of the show, but I have to admit it's one of the reasons I think the show is so great. I think some characters were killed a bit early, but some still made their mark. You can't compare things like Prison Break with this show, they are completely different. I think some of the actors at the show are also very good and underestimated and need to owe what they owe. A good show, my favorites. A show that has to be considered by the big ones for years.
