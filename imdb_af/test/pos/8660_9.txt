What a good movie it was. Is it heaven? Hell? or something in between? I disagree with many reviews of this movie that say it's a portrayal of hell. It is not even clear if the opening scene starts the movie or is a backstop. Furthermore, it is not clear that the main character goes to hell, but maybe in between. The review I read on IMDb is that it is hell, but I totally disagree. Keep in mind that perhaps good people who commit suicide cannot be condemned to hell. This only religious belief. It is indeed a thinker, and I have / would recommend it to anyone who likes that type of movie. Definitely worth it!
