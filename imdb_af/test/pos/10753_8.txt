This movie surprised me. For years, I have avoided much of Harold Lloyd's soundtracks (as well as those of Keaton) because they generally have deserved reputation because they are uncomfortable compared to silent movies because the basic formula has been lost. But when I saw this movie, I was pleasantly surprised to find I really liked it ... once I accepted it, it wasn't really a Harold Lloyd movie (despite the fact that he was playing in it has). That's because, although it's nothing like the style of its previous films, it's very original and Lloyd isn't bad at playing a completely different character. <br /> <br /> As I mentioned above, the formula of the old movies is almost completely missing. Lloyd doesn't do the old well-known stunt work, the romance is quite different from his early screen romance, and the plot is just strange! Instead of the usual roles, he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time, as he was a little boy. That's why he looks like an American (except for his white suit and discovery helmet), he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is Chinese. In many ways he is very naive about America and is like an innocent among wolves. Early on, he meets a man who seems to be a local party boss. This boss ALWAYS creates a lost candidate for the mayor - because he was bought and paid by the corrupt mayor to produce a "token" candidate who has no chance of winning. Well, the old parent who traditionally manages them for office has just died and decides to run the naive Lloyd - he doesn't have a prayer wish! Well, the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins !!! This and Lloyd's decision to clean the town largely caused the old political machine and they stopped nothing to destroy honest Lloyd. Just when it looks, Lloyd is being thrown to jail on a corruption charge. He creates a scheme that is 100% impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions of the villains. Yet it is incredibly funny and a good ending. So, my advice is, in the end, suspend and disbelieve. <br /> <br /> An important note: This movie is definitely NOT politically correct. The word "Chink" is used repeatedly. I found it offensive, but I ignored it, as you have. However, if you are someone who can't be angry, I suggest you never watch movies - because you have to be insulted again and again.
