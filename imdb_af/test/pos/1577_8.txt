If they receive awards for the most depraved and disturbed movies in the world, the Japanese theater will clear: their exploitation kiosks wipe off the floor with most other contenders. The most extreme examples are absolutely jaw-drop exercises in bad taste, deceptive gore, freakish weirdness, and misogynistic sex. <br /> <br /> Guts of a Beauty is an excellent example of such a frenzy of dirt and offers vivid viewers just over an hour of full-fledged hardship and free violence. very insane J-splatter. <br /> <br /> The film opens with a young woman named Yoshimi, whose search for her missing sister has her in the hands of some nasty yakuza, who will rape her and shoot her full of strong dope Angel Rain. After the gangsters finished their fun with the poor woman, she managed to escape and fly to a nearby hospital where sexy psychologist Hiromi (Megumi Ozawa) tried to help. But the disturbed and confused Yoshimi ends up throwing herself out of the hospital roof, turning into a watermelon when she hits the ground (at least what it seemed to me!). <br /> <br /> Looking for revenge Yoshimi's death, Hiromi lures Higashi, a member of the yakuza, to her office and, as he drives, hypnotizes him to attack his fellow gangsters. After cutting Higashi with a knife into the yakuza HQ, he was severely beaten and stabbed, forced to tell his encounter with Hiromi, and then slipped into a bitter piece. <br /> <br /> The psychologist is caught at the gang, subject to a place of forced buggy (while being forced to give head to a yakuza slut), and injected with Angel Rain ?? after which she eats it immediately. The gangsters then pick her body in the car's bowl, along with the remains of Higashi, ready for disposal. <br /> <br /> Before they can demolish the bodies, the super-baptism has an unexpected effect on Hiromi: she comes back from the dead as a hermaphroditic monster with a toothpick and a furious gauze, and, furiously revenge, about killing the yakuza one by one; This leads to some memorable scenes of outrageous perversion, including a messy headache, a man suffocated by the monster's vagina, and a woman being screwed down by his giants, fnashing-phallus. <br /> <br /> If you can probably tell about the above synopsis, these are a few crazy things you've cut, and probably not the taste of the most healthy people, but for those who are tired a long time ago. for the mainstream theater and already well known in Asian excess, Guts Van A Beauty should seem to be wonderfully varied and deviating fun. <br /> <br /> 7.5 out of 10, rounded to 8 for IMDb.
