Perhaps I'm one of the only eager horror fans who think the recent overload of Asian shockers is so overheated! Movies like "Ringu" or "The Eye" ?? what is being praised all over the world? simply didn't convince me and they looked more boring than scary. Well, this blunt opinion is not for the South Korean jewel "A Tale of Two Sisters". It's a stylish and completely complex psychological terror story that really comes under your skin! The plot, based on a local folklore story, may be a bit too confusing to get this movie among the best genre performances of all time, but the atmosphere and tension building definitely cause great respects. This is one of the few films that is impossible to label: the events in "Two Sisters" qualify as sensible horror as well as intense family drama and a deep psychological portrait. In addition to a surprising story, a story by Two Sisters also has all the great elements that I usually fail in Asian horror movies, such as compelling music, good acting and innovative camera work. The house where the family events take place is brilliantly illustrated, like a truly creepy place where secrets and danger creep behind each door. Several series (such as family dinner or the nocturnal look in the girls room) are almost the best in honesty. They really made me feel uncomfortable and I believe I saw my part of the ghostly horror. "A Two Sisters' Languages" is a great movie adventure and must be a definite must for Asian movie fans. A little warning for people with a short attention span, though: this movie forces you to focus your eyes and ears at all times. It's also a movie that is repeatedly required, though no one really gets it 100%.
