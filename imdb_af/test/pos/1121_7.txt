Another of the endless amount of cookie cutters' Kickboxers Fight to the Death for the Amusement or Rich Scumbags' movies that were so many in the 90's ... You know the one created by the words' Death 'to use. 'Blood' and 'Steel' and the words 'Ring', 'Fight', 'Match' and 'Cage' and in a random generator! Poor, although Death Match is a pretty good entry into the over-exploited genre, thanks to its exciting fights and the surprisingly good acting of his kickboxer cast. <br /> <br /> The story is about two friends - Kickboxing world champion John Larson (played through the Mid-Weight Kickboxing Champ Ian Jacklin, probably previously the best known for his terrible performance as the biggest villain in Ring of Fire 2 ) and Nick Wallace (Nick Hill, a nice man probably best known for the role of street fighter Sergio in Bloodsport 2) who works the LA cabins that load crates on ships. One discovery of a boxing guns and a short fight later, our two heroes are unemployed and open a L.A. bar. Sensible John Larson decides to go north and look for work; chief Nick Wallace has heard of a man who pays good money for fighters to fight in private kickboxing matches. "Why should things change?" John says, "If you need me, I'll be there." Predictably enough, it is not long before Nick has disappeared and his good friend fights in the deadly 'ring of death' to find a head start for his missing friend. <br /> <br /> Sure enough there are no prices for originality here, but as I said earlier, this film is immersed in its action, the movie of the real fighters and the pretty good performances they put into it. Especially Ian Jacklin surprised me. Previously, I only saw him as the bad man in Ring of Fire 2 and in little parts like The Steel Ring, and I was quite amused how bad an actor is (good fighter though!). But in Death Match he is pretty good! Given a decent manuscript and a hairstyle, he proves himself as the charismatic leading man! And his friendship with Nick is well portrayed. Jacklin and Hill have a good chemistry and you really believe that these two characters care about each other. Enough for one of them to lose a job, travel halfway across the country and kill death to save the others. I wish I had such a friend! <br /> <br /> It was also nice to see Matthias Hues as a villain, with a little more depth than we saw from his many "villainous" roles. But don't be foolish to think he's the star, just because he's on the video cover (with his head stuck on Michael Bernardo's Shootfighter's cover page). He's good while he's on the screen, but he's not too much. <br /> <br /> On the downside, the movie is pretty slow when there are no battles, with many unnecessary scenes (which is the passive story of Jimmie Fiorello about his grandfather ??) and the final is disappointingly short, but overall I enjoyed it! Many battles, most of them are good. Isn't this all we really need martial arts? And of course eye-candy, here in the beautiful shape of the very beautiful Renee Ammann. All in all, a beautiful, spectacular movie.
