I don't think this movie deserves the low rating that most will give it. This is one of the best "teen" horror movies I've ever seen; and it says a lot. Nothing is left without an explanation to make it up, the characters and plot break countless horror movie stereotypes, and it has nothing to do with some other horrible pieces we've recently filed. (A clear example is the senseless "Saint Ange".) The first 30-40 minutes may just be boring, except for the start, although some slight errors can easily be detected. After arriving at the village, the horror - another distorted kind of horror. <br /> <br /> The plot and details are goofs small; The characters are the strongest point of this movie, as so many clicks are broken in it. For example, the two main male characters, Nick and Wade, are by no means the idiotic types we are accustomed to; Although Dalton is better suited to this stereotype, he is not the only one to pay for this lack of consciousness. Some scenes are truly satisfyingly horrible, and make for exciting moments spread throughout the film. And in the end, and although everything is well explained, it's easy to see that things won't go as easy for the surviving characters. <br /> <br /> The only mistakes I can see, and which does not imply continuity (IE, Carly doesn't find her own cutter in the unconscious Bo's pockets) is the relief that somehow irritates is during the first, boring 30 minutes. Although, plot and effect, everything is drastically and cruelly twisted with the arrival of the main characters to Ambrosia, that little town in the middle of nothing, so I'll give it. It is widely argued that about 70% of the film is illogical; "How can two people build a whole laundry house?", "Where do they get it?" It wouldn't be rebellious if people paid more attention to the movie. The Sinclair brothers did not build the House of Wax; their mother made real wax figures and they were exhibited at the museum. And the scenario where Paris Hilton's unhappy character meets her untimely death is the answer to the second question. What about all the personal objects (cell phones, cars, clothes) of the dead? Using their third brother as a connection to the outside, it is reasonable that the Sinclair twins should get the money to buy the wax, in a WWII type. <br /> <br /> So, aside, I think the movie earns much more than it gets, and no one should lose the chance to see it. So go see the House of Wax. Right now.
