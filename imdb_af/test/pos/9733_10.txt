First, I hate Sci Fi stuff, and although this movie sometimes has a little Sci Fi, it's right, because it's at least focused on Andre Toulon. In the last 3, André seemed to be called, but the stories never really focused on him, which made me angry. What makes me angry is the amount of 0 it has on the voting card. Give it a Russian. If you've seen this movie and have chosen it, please vote for it. Please. What I loved about this movie is that it has gone back to where it all started. When André first learned the Secret to Life. I would recommend it if you saw and liked a Poppie Master Movie. But don't rent it if it's your first time seeing the PM collection, mainly because you think all the puppet masters are so "dull" like this one.
