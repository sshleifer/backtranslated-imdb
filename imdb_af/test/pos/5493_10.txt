In the line of fire, in my opinion, it is an excellent, exciting and prosperous action / drama / thriller! I thought Agent Horrigan (Clint Eastwood) and Agent Raines (Rene Russo) looked good in the clothes they wore during the presidential dinner. As for Leary (John Malkovich), he was a sick man who loved to play with Frank Frankie. However, he looked closely at the smoke he was wearing near the end of the film. One thing that surprised me was the growing attraction between Agent Horrigan and Agent Raines. Before I upload it, I would like to say that the entire team and crew did an excellent job, I loved the environment and I couldn't get enough of it. Now, finally, to all of your Clint Eastwood fans who haven't seen this excellent, exciting and prosperous action / drama / thriller, I highly recommend it.
