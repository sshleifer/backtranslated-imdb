I agree with what mallicka.b said. The film is portrayed in a way that appears to be a kind of eclipse on the original content. Emotions are not properly transmitted. I think some not-so-good performances also contributed to his mediocrity. In my opinion, Tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of Aishwarya Rai. In some of her plays, she looks a little funny, which is not what the film should be. I also noticed a little overwork in some of her plays. I'm a bitter critic of Aishwarya Rai :) Can't help it; sorry about that. 'Raincoat' was a good movie by Rituparno Ghosh. And I saw Choker Bali after seeing Raincoat; I was not at all impressed.
