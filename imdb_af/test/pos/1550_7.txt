I like this Columbo movie that was his atmosphere, which was actually a thrill and even approached me to film noir, in the movie the first 30 minutes or so. It's really nice and done in a good old fashioned way, with the right camera angles and the use of light. This does not immediately mean that this movie is a brilliant one, but it is enough to consider it a good late-night Columbo movie entry. It's definitely a better movie than the average 'later' Columbo movie entry. 26 years after his previous Columbo show, George George returns to play the leading role against Peter Falk, again like the killer, in a totally different and new role. I kept him in his role and he was a good Columbo villain, who gave the good old Lieutenant good competition. They had some nice rows together. Problems with the 'modern' new Columbo movies were always such that it did not have a well-known actor to Peter Falk. Of course, this film does not suffer from this problem. But I have to say that this movie is not Peter Falk at this best feature. He certainly played the character better and his performance is not quite consistent enough in this movie. This is probably also due to the film by his director Daryl Duke, who also directed the very horrible movie "Tai-Pan" among many other projects. . <br /> <br /> It has a pretty good and pleasant story, but the fact that the same kind of plot to cover the murder was used previously in an earlier Columbo movie, but of course it doesn't. It was previously used in the 1975 movie "Columbo: Playback". Yet, of course, it still has enough 'original' moments of its own with its story, although of course every Columbo movie is more or less the same. But oh well, that's what made the Columbo series so large and consistent. If it's not broken, don't make it right. <br /> <br /> It is also true that in this movie more clues are usually left out for the lieutenant. This does not mean that the film is his killer. more stupid or sloppy, but I see it more than the authors are more enthusiastic than others. It doesn't make the movie or story bad and it even makes it fun to see Columbo hard at work and discover all kinds of small but important clues. Fortunately, the movie is also filled with a pleasant, effective, enlightening Columbo comedy. <br /> <br /> Simply a good late Columbo movie entry. <br /> <br /> 7/10
