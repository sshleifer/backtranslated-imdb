Why all the negative reviews ??? You didn't expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece, did you? What we have is a movie we tried to entertain and it worked for me. Not an oscar contender, just entertainment. You can really see how the movie is outdated, especially with everything the internet offers today. I still remember when it was first released and the net was so new. Crazy and scary thoughts when I first saw it; I was 15 and thought seriously that someone could get your information on a computer and destroy you. But who can say that can't happen? I'm not the kind of person to kill a movie, analyze it until I'm in the blue. It's not my style. Average acting, suspicious and again, very entertaining. Sandra Bullock and Angela Bennett are so cute. This is my favorite movie with her because she likes the computer genius, which I find very attractive. Of all the films released in 1995, this will be my favorite, although I haven't seen it until 1996. My review, 9/10 because it slowed down a bit.
