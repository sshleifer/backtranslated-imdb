I saw the Big Trail in Vienna's Film Museum for the first time. Immediately I was amazed by both the pictures optically high quality and unusual format and by its beautifully detailed story. Who ever saw such a documentary style Western with John Wayne? And there is so much time, you can actually look around the screen, there is so much to see! One is always grateful that the screens are often static, because every single shot is so well constructed and you want to take it. Even the acting is good and fits in well. The long duration of the picture is wonderful, you don't want to miss it for a moment!
