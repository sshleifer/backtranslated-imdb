Based on the best-selling novel The Dismissal, the missing star, the latest film by renowned Italian director Gianni Amelio, is the story of the growing friendship between an older Italian maintenance man and a young interpreter he hires in Shanghai. lead by China. Vincenzo Buonovolonta is the maintenance officer at a steel factory in Italy that was closed and the blast furnace sold to China. When Vincenzo (Sergio Castellitto) discovers that a control unit in the oven is flawed and potentially dangerous, he travels to China to find the steel mill where the part was sold in the hope of preventing a fatal accident. <br /> <br /> Of course, the film is about traveling, not the destination to use a well-known clich√©, and on the journey we are busy with an impressive look at China with all its immense beauty and complexity. via outstanding cinematography by Luca Bigazzi. The film takes us to Shanghai, Wuhan, Chongquing, Baotou, and a trip along the Yangstze River that shows us coastal areas that are expected to be flooded when the Three Gorges Dam is fully operational, a Chinese mega project that is moving to led. of 1.2 million people. The journey left the travelers face-to-face with poverty, crowded housing and children to defend themselves. <br /> <br /> The film revolves around the relationship between Vincenzo and translator Liu Hua (Tai Ling) who meet first in Italy where she gathers impatience with her translations on a dinner so that she loses her job. When he follows her in Shanghai, she works at a library and is resistant to Vincenzo's approach. If he goes to his offer to help him travel in China as little as a well-paid job, she agrees with reluctance to accompany him. However, their relationship grows as they move from city to city, her interpretative skills are in evidence to help distorted Vincenzo who doesn't own a cellphone. <br /> <br /> As they open slowly to each other, they are blushing each other's vulnerability and filming in their past and present life and how they arrive at their current situation. We meet Liu's son (Lin Wang) at her grandmother's home. In China's one-man policy, he is one of the unwanted children who are "hidden" because the son's father left the family. Although the encounter between Vincenzo and the boy is uncomfortable, their relationship becomes central to how the story plays. <br /> <br /> Castellitto is an excellent actor (though one after a younger Enrico Lo Verso desires in this role). However, he is emotionally distant in the film, and his expression rarely changes from a distant hair dog expression. Although Tai Ling brings a great deal of presence to its role, her relationship with the much older Vincenzo never really seemed to me and the end was only in a reality known as the movies. Although Amelio is one of my favorite directors, coming on the heels of the brilliant keys to home, Missing Star is a disappointment.
