Of all the episodes of all series, this one is closest to Roddenberry's original principle. According to the book, THE VOICE OF STAR TREK, in Roddenberry's author's guide to his story writers, he states that any strange creature, no matter how zealously ugly, impossible to believe, benevolent or malicious, needs a bit of humanity holds that watching TV can be public empathy with and / or related to. Devil In The Dark HORTA, which looks more or less like a big blob cow, is a mother who protects her babies. The balloon-shaped silicone buttons still find the miners through the mines and destroy, because they have no idea what they are! It's one of my absolute favorite episodes when it's just for that!
