Oz was a fantastic show, as long as ordinary male celebrities don't turn you off. There WAY was too much frontal male nudity in this show, more than any other show you would see on a porn channel. Minus it was the best show on TV, and a previous commentator said "better than Prime Suspect". Prime Suspect is The Simpsons vs Tom and Jerry. No match. If you have DirecTv, they are now running again from channel 101 again, they are now at Episode # 3. Highly recommended. Creator Tom Fontana also had an incredible murder. But why is all the male nudity? We all know that things are happening in prison, but did they really need to show it so often? It was the only thing that turned me away from the show. If I want to see naked men, guys are raped, I will kill myself and testify firsthand. Otherwise, I can keep my TV programs free of black penis every five minutes.
