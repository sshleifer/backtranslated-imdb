Nurse Betty was definitely one of the most creative movies released recently. It was funny, but it also had many moments. Zellwegger, Freeman, Rock, Kinnear, and the rest of the role that make their incredibly quirky characters look, really look. The story made such turns and turns that made it incredibly enjoyable to watch. If you're sick about the recent formula films, Nurse Betty sees something completely different. Check out this movie in the theater or rent it at least if it comes out!
