This film is a brilliant tale of Shakespeare's classic love story, complete with "kinky sex, body piercing, and dismemberment". It follows the same spirit as all the other Troma movies [except Combat Shock ... The sucker was depressed], but it's not just for Troma fans. Anyone who appreciates low graphic visuals and hilarious text will surely fall in love with this movie. <br /> <br /> Don't expect pretense, artistic-wannabe crap like the version of R&J with Claire Danes and Leo DiCaprio; This one knows she is a silly movie and pulls out his humor. The acting is also surprisingly good, and you can only feel Sammy Capulet's pain if he tries to bring his brain back into his head. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack, which contains many original and high-energy bands like The Wesley, Willis Fiasco, Supernova, and The Meatmen is also four-star. This movie has to be seen by everyone, because it remains true to the original story while still saddened by Troma's trademark gore / sex humor.
