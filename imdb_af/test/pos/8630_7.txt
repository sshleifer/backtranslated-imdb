I wanted to see this movie because I'm a very big Abbott and Costello fan, and when I saw it, I liked it. <br /> <br /> This movie is funny, not hysterical, but funny. I mean, I laughed at many of the funny parts and I simply enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> Although not the best of the Perfect Straight Man and the Perfect Buffoon, you should see it if you really love Abbott and Costello. <br /> <br /> From all the Abbott and Costello movies I've seen, I can't say I've seen one that I hated. It is decent, funny and entertaining. Abbott and Costello have made at least some decent films in their later years. <br /> <br /> All in all, I enjoyed this movie, it's not one of their best, but I liked it. <br /> <br /> 7/10
