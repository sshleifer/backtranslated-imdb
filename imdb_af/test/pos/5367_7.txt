The first time I saw Brotherhood of Satan, I was 12 years old. I saw it in a small town in the central state of Washington. It played for Fairy Tales from the crib, which left us early, for my sisters were already afraid of Satan's Brotherhood. All in all, I thought it was a good movie. The start was good, we just sat down and the tank made a number on the station wagon. <br /> <br /> What struck me about the movie was the landscape around the town in which it was filmed, and it almost looks like the area around Chelan WA where I saw the movie especially when they came to the village of Hillsboro then drove. This is the location of the movie a small town in SW New Mexico. I've always loved LQ Jones and Strother Martin and also get Charles Bateman on another show I want. I gave the movie a 7 and later when I got Tales from the crib. I thought Satan's Brotherhood was better.
