This one of the best and funniest comedy series I've ever seen! All characters are brilliant. <br /> <br /> Mr. Slatt (David Bamber) is a very irritated man, irritated by everything and anyone. <br /> <br /> He wants to do things and handle situations as well as he possibly can, but he never gets it right and gets himself deeper and deeper. Not supported by his wife, Janet, who just tries to get in trouble, he gets himself in (and doesn't need the help at all!). <br /> <br /> All characters are played / brilliantly portrayed. Imagine sending your child / children to school. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that people don't like it (maybe some don't get the many many plays that appear many times at a time). episode). <br /> <br /> It's also incredible that there is still no DVD release. There are only 2 series! <br /> <br /> Please leave it alone, let it go! <br /> <br /> Try it, you might just like it! <br /> <br /> Just a few names and words from the series: Pumpman, Man Helmet, Hot Titch, Mount Suzy, Travis Fellatio, Cockfoster, Arshead (and more).
