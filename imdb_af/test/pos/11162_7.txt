Hey, this Ralf Westhoff seems to know a lot of people! We have nine women and nine men participating in a speed theater event. Each person has five minutes to talk to each other. A good idea to make a movie from these conversations. And even better: it works very well! The dialogue is brilliant, original and authentic. Each person is subtly distinguished, without falling into the cliché trap, which is unusual for German movies. Remember: All these years, our Germans have been tormented by stupid, fiery comedies such as "Workaholic" or "Stadtgespräch". <br /> <br /> But now is the time for young German directors to do their own thing and run the risk of making movies that are entertaining and funny and intelligent and sensitive at the same time. The timing of "Shopping" is also good: Although it is mainly a dialogue, it keeps the tension and interest. After a while, you're actually curious to see how this man and that woman would do. Some of the attendees later meet for a two-person, it's fun to see that they work together in the "real life". Of course, the movie has some disadvantages: it's not much movie (but can be such a movie?), The musical soundtrack could have been better, but it's just marginal. <br /> <br /> The most important thing about this movie: We have some damn good actors here. Imagine: Both are still fairly unknown, even here in Germany (most of them are derived from the Munich or Bavarian theater scene). But I predict that of the 18 main actors, at least 11 will be very fast in the movie and TV scene here. It's great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces. Well done! <br /> <br /> For those who want to read more, here is an overview of all 18 actors: (spoilers!) Sebastian Weber: Stilwater is deep! Memorize his "Flower Garden" monologue. You can win any woman's heart with this one. <br /> <br /> Anna Böger: a hell of a woman! Every time she opens her mouth, you can't help but laugh and feel good. Listen to her 'asshole' and call the pink man a "Bürscherl"! <br /> <br /> Felix Hellmann: The "Bürscherl" from above is nice to watch. The inconvenient truth is that there are too many guys. His body reminded me of Flo Weber of "Sportfreunde Stiller". <br /> <br /> Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love, hope, despair, beauty. Her "Want Children" scene is a classic. A great actress whom we will hear again, no doubt. <br /> <br /> David Baalcke: Now is this man a loser or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in "Sideways". I hope this is NOT a method acting. <br /> <br /> Julia Koschitz: The "beautiful" woman in the circle. Julia plays theater in my hometown, kudos! I think she will appear in many TV series. <br /> <br /> Martin Butzke: The revolutionary man eventually gets the cutest and most conventional woman. Want to share a taxi with this guy? <br /> <br /> Kathrin von Steinburg: She had a beautiful show in Tatort last year. Her trance-like performance in this movie is no less. SEE her beautiful face and HEOR her dirty laugh. The best scene in the movie belongs to her. <br /> <br /> Matthias Bundschuh: I know these "write everything" throws back from school. I don't know if the blonde has her allergic reaction because of him or his cat. Matthias's portrayal of such a chicken is outstanding. <br /> <br /> Mediha Cetin: The son-in-law of my ex-girlfriend was the same speaker as her. The day I met her, I was the only day in my life. I need sedatives, so bad memories here. <br /> <br /> Thomas Limpinsel: The "nice and desperate man" in the circle. Limp'sel has a comic talent that is much better than most so-called "comedians" on TV. <br /> <br /> Lisa Wagner: The victim of Sebastian's flower garden metaphor. Lisa's face is funny and full of melancholy, her story made me feel good and sad, wow! <br /> <br /> Oliver Bürgin: The "beautiful" man in the circle. No wonder he finally caught Julia. These two really fit together. I think he will appear in many TV series. <br /> <br /> Julia Heinze: The "cute, conventional" woman. I hope she won't be underestimated: Julia's face changes from naive to hurt, is great! <br /> <br /> Stephan Zinner: The "natural boy" of Partenkirchen likes cooking, eating? and good sex. Look at the body language between him and the blonde! Zinner usually plays CSU politician Söder on stage! <br /> <br /> Anja Klawun: The "bargain girl" has a few good moments, but don't forgive (like most actors) to play drunk on the screen. br /> <br /> Christian Pfeil: Plays the arrogant and narcissistic man. Could not believe that this actor owns two artist theaters in Munich. <br /> <br /> Tanja Schleiff: Play the girl who sleeps with every man. I'm sure many male visitors will go for her. I heard she could also do dramatic roles, so I'm curious.
