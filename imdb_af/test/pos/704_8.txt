"The Desperadoes" (1943) is a true classic, not for its story (which is reasonably routine), but for its technical production elements. It was a most popular western, the largest ever at the time of its release and increasingly unique because it was a Columbia production - a lightweight studio with a lower nutritional reputation. Just a few years earlier, Fox's "Jesse James" (also starring Randolph Scott) gave a treatment to the genre around this exaggerated one. Although it would be darkened in a few years by "The Searchers" and "High Noon", the Desperado's were a groundbreaking effort and a historic treasure. <br /> <br /> In 1863, the economy in the town of Red Valley, Utah was based on rounding off and selling wild horses to the Union Army. The script is a bit confused here with references to the railroad (which has been in Utah's future for years) and Custer's Last Stand (Custer was in the process of fighting Stuart in Pennsylvania at the time), but these are not important plotting elements. <br /> <br /> Red Valley has an honest sheriff, Steve Upton (Scott), but the banker and several citizens are corrupt; Every time the government pays for a herd of horses, rob their own bank. The town has been visited by Cheyenne Rogers (Glenn Ford), a well-known outside friend who is an old friend of Steve's. He wants to go straight, especially after falling for the handsome, stable owner Alison McLeod (Evelyn Keyes). Cheyenne's partner "Nitro" Rankin (Guinn "Big Boy" Williams) is mainly there for comic relief, such as Uncle Willie McLeod (Edgar Buchanan) and city judge (Raymond Walburn who model his character on Frank Morgan's "Wizard of Oz" crystal ball counterfeiter). <br /> <br /> No chances with their big budget. Columbia packed this thing with tons of action and every western movie element, but Indians and covered wagons. There is the best Wild Horse Stampede ever filmed, a spectacular Barroom Brawl, an explosive climax, romance, and three-strip Technicolor. All these things do not necessarily fit together, but who would have returned in 1943. Unity is a problem, because it tries to be a serious action western and a comedy. <br /> <br /> The cinematography was probably the best ever at the time of his filming. The indoor scenes are solid, but these are the naturalistic outdoor photography that is truly impressive; both the lyrical static shots and the moving camera filming of the action sequences. <br /> <br /> In addition, Scott and Claire Trevor were photographed, but the studio clearly wanted to promote Ford, which would soon be their biggest star. And director Charles Vidor used the film to showcase his new wife, Keyes. The painting by Scarlett's sister in Gone With the Wind has more than any minor role in the history of films related to audience. <br /> <br /> The Ford Keyes dynamics are "The Desperadoes" most unique and important feature. Rather than going for the clich√© "love triangle" with Scott and / or Trevor (which first looks like it), the whole romantic focus is on the two younger actors. It was probably the best role Keyes ever had and she made the most of it. Play a tomboyish but extremely sexy young woman who looks good in both pants and dresses, and who drives and fights like Kiera Knightley's character in "Pirates of the Caribbean". It was revolutionary at that time and coincided with the 1944 formation of the WAAC for military service in World War II. <br /> <br /> "The Desperado's" is a well-groomed movie that looks like it's brand new. Unfortunately, there are no special features on the DVD. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
