Of course, I was a little harmed, but at the time it was the most accurate portrayal of Marines ever seen on the big screen. <br /> <br /> I was at Camp Pendleton who had undergone infantry training when Webb crewed some crews after filming and our company was asked to participate. <br /> <br /> Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and business. <br /> <br /> During the filming of our short scene - which looked like Forever to 18 years old - Webb was very conscientious about getting things done (Marine things) right and he did a good job with one exception - that scene where a yard had sunglasses. I will never have quite a few reasons. <br /> <br /> I have a video of the movie and will carry my grandchildren every time I can stop them for a few seconds, because I show them their papaw when he was a young man. stud and part of the world's greatest fighting power (no boasting, just the fact). <br /> <br /> What then surprised me was how well the real Marines performed their acting. It was before I realized that DI should have some acting genes to get their job done. <br /> <br /> The only movie I've seen since is the equivalent of the DI, the first half of Full Metal Jacket and the part is better because of the dirty language. When the DI was made, curses were not allowed on the screen. <br /> <br /> Despite the lack of wickedness, it's still a good movie to rent. <br /> <br /> Ooooo-rahhhhhh !!!!! <br /> <br /> Semper Fi, Do or Die
