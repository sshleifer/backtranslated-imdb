As an accounting fan, I originally found it annoying that they made a movie about the bills and the loss of four super bullets. But as soon as I started looking, I really had a connection. It was really nice to see the "Bills" win the Superbowl, and I have to say that for a TV movie this was actually done very well. Gil Bellows as the QB, and Jon Voight as the old-school coach did a very good job. 8 out of 10
