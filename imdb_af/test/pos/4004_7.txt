First, I have already read all the time I wrote this comment that kittiwake-1 wrote about this game and was confused. It's a video game and not a real movie. I mean, I would choose a good Deniro movie myself or play a video game any day. But, sir, what are you talking about? Now that I've got it out of the way, let's move on, will we? The video game adaptation of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, as you might guess, based on the movie of the same name. What is alien is that it was released three years after the film was released. Whether it's a slow development time or just laziness, no one really knows. At least, I don't. <br /> <br /> The game allows the player to play as the four main characters of the movie: Jen, Shu Lien, Li-Mu-Bi and Dark Cloud (whose story is a secret bonus unlocked All four of these characters have battle styles based on how they fought in the movie. The right eyecatcher, however, is the evasion movement that allows every character to avoid the attacks of an enemy's attack in the most impossible and gravity that first appears in the movie. <br /> <br /> The story is, of course, based on the story told in the movie. The story in the game is told using CG movies and spoken in a subtitled Mandarin language. (A fun little touch, since I chose the strange language track of the movie about the baptized one.) The story will expand on what happened to the other characters during the film and even (no surprise since pretty much all that video game adjustments of the videos did that which officially happened in the movie to make the game more action. I never thought Jade Fox would go so far as to really get goons. <br /> <br /> The real bonus for the story is the ability to decide how the game ends. What if Jen had all the ingredients to cure Li-Mu-Bi in her possession? What if Jen didn't get her comb back? What if Li-Mu-Bi didn't get the green destination for the second time? Your action will determine the outcome of these scenarios and the fate of the characters in this game. This is really the best feature of the game. <br /> <br /> Yet, for all its strengths, it's also some bugs. The enemies tend to become a nuisance after a while, and the camera angle tends to get stuck in the most unhelpful places. Not even the special features (unlocked after the game is beaten) are good enough to even forgive such hardship that is forced on the player. <br /> <br /> If you loved the movie, enjoy the game. However, this game is the only way you can double in a playable version of such a beautiful and wonderful movie. <br /> <br /> Of course, you can only choose a Deniro movie. .
