We all see the many previews and trailers. If you've enjoyed Knoxville's turning the Bull, you'll have a great carnival pleasure in the opening action. However, I have to warn the masses, but I considered taking my (18-year-old) son, but I'm relieved. This compilation of trivial sketches contains a few that look like hilarious as it is for the adult community, some are not for the immature. These guys have to pay a huge ransom to endure some of the devastating stunts, sometimes at their expense. In particular, Bam Margera and Ehren McGhehey are getting low in the group in some particular stunts. enjoy
