It was an excellent show. It returned to PBS in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (Van EnVogue) playing the teenage daughter. The show covers topics like sex, peer pressure and puberty. It was about a middle-class black family who had a teenager, who was old and daughter and son who moved to a middle class area of ​​Oakland or somewhere (I can't remember). I remember several episodes, but the one I remember most was when their cousin had her first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I could keep up with the program. It was a good performance. I can't remember the name of the guy who played the boy on the show, but I always got confused with Kevin Hooks.
