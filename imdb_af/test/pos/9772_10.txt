I never spent six hours watching a miniseries, but Changi changed it. I'm not going to lie, I know some Aussie movies can be pathetic and boring (actually, I love Aussie myself, but maybe I'm biased), but Changi is on a completely different job. Although not historically accurate, the performance combines superior acting, excellent writing and the addition of humor to give us an entertaining and emotional perception of life in a POW Second World War camp. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind, the show wasn't supposed to be a documentary, so don't let any factual mistakes disappoint you. <br /> <br /> This series shows such a creative writing by John Doyle (also known as Roy Slaves), who is more famous for his comedy than anything else, and an excellent director and actor moves this creativity perfectly. If you want to see how much hard work has gone into this series, visit the official website, it's very interesting and you'll learn a lot about changi real accounts. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Changi yet, make sure you don't do anything for a whole day, because you'll see the series as a whole.
