North and South are a miniseries from the "golden era" of television miniseries in the 1980s, which was a time for long, winding emails with high production values ​​and many astronomy. For the most part it is excellent for what it is, although I personally prefer the lesser soap opera like elements of the story and the general sense of history. <br /> <br /> James Read and Patrick Swayze deliver excellent performances - especially Read, whose George Hazard acts as an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story. The series also includes top-notch work by Kirstie Alley, Wendy Kilbourne, Hal Holbrook, Lewis Smith, Genie Francis, Georg Stanford Brown and others. The costumes, filming, sets and music are also the first time. <br /> <br /> Don't take it as a history lesson, but take it for what it is - a well-made, flaming epic from a bygone era. Book 2, which followed a year later, is also excellent, but I would recommend advisers to hit Book 3, which came 8 years after Book 2 and not as good as the first two. However, books 1 and 2 are classic, even with their soapier elements, and they are worth watching.
