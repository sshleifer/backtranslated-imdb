Perhaps one of the best movies ever made. Orry and Goerge's friendship are deep, and the war puts a strain on their strong friendship. As a Southern, I can honestly say that this epic is as accurate as it gets. Brothers are fighting brothers. Can you imagine how life had to live during those times? The best part of the movie, to me, was when the South African surrendered; General Grant insists that President Lincoln really keep it to the south, he says: "Mr President, many people want the south to bleed over what they did." President Lincoln, turning him and saying in a very tired voice, "South Africa has blossomed enough ... and so have we ..." I burst into tears and took a deep breath. What a President! It's like a father who says his son is punished enough, and despite his anger he realizes that his point has been made. This war was a very dark time for our young country, and it had to be fought. President Lincoln knew it. I appeal to everyone reading it to watch this movie, and add it to your DVD collection. Then, thank God that our country has been preserved. As Jesus said, a "house divided against itself cannot stand."
