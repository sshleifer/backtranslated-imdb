OK, so some of the plot points may be a bit obvious, but already an interesting idea that leads to a stiff end. The play is solid, especially Lachy Hulme, who plays one of the central characters in this ensemble piece. He definitely has a screen presence and he is interesting to watch. It has a low budget feeling that works for the kind of thriller / horror genre Four Jacks belongs to. The film doesn't try to take him seriously, adding the overall charm. The character of Phil (Dave Serrafin) has to be one of the most annoying characters on the screen since Rupert Pupkin / King of Comedy. Worth adding a weekend of DVDs after a weekend.
