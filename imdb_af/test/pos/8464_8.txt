I went to see this movie out of curiosity and to make an argument. The film is now best known from the series of music Sergei Prokofiev, taken from his accidental music to the film. The troika movement is even shown in pop arrangements. The general overview of the plot is known from the mouse buttons on various recordings. A clerk accidentally caused a non-Lieutenant Kizhe to be submitted to the tsar. The tsar is interested in this person, and rather than telling him that he doesn't exist, the courtiers and officers pretend to be real. Kizhe was banned to Siberia, recalled, promoted, married, re-promoted, died, given a state funeral, revealed as an eclipse and posthumously nailed to the ranks. <br /> <br /> I heard conflicting stories about how the clerk invented Kizhe, with ink blots and sneezes, but I heard the movie was lost, so there was no way to find out what was happening. Then the film appeared at the Barbican in London as part of their Prokofiev festival. For the record it turned out that everything that happened was that the clerk confused two words while writing an order and changing Kuzhe into Kizhe. Since the tsar is in a hurry to see the order, there is no time to fix the error. <br /> <br /> After expecting a historical curiosity, I was pleasantly surprised. The film is very funny, and the audience, including itself, laughed constantly. Although most of them are filmed straight, it mostly sets in the palace, there are a few "trick" shots where several images appear on the screen. For example, the tsar's army is represented by a small group repeated over the screen. Four identical guards carry perfect drilling in perfect unity. Two identical servants scrub the floor. <br /> <br /> One slight downside was that it was very difficult to work out who everyone was. There were two women who could have been the tsar's daughters, or a daughter and a servant or something else. And very few people are named. But all in all, a pleasant movie and I am surprised it is not seen regularly anymore.
