The Aristorcats is a hilarious film that has not seen many people. This is clearly not so much because it only received a 6.8. There is nothing at all. This is my favorite of the Disney classics, who have already made tons of great movies. Like Beauty and the Animal, Snow White, and Peter Pan. The reason why the Aristorcats are so high on my list is because of how funny the movie is. I hate to say that, but I don't blame Edgar for what he does. I would probably also have taken care of them. I will be ruined by an old bag with which I have worked for so many years, just decided to give her the will to the cats. I also wanted to kill them. I don't even like cats, so I won't give a dam. I think the aristor cats are so funny and cute. There are many characters that are hilarious, like Edgar. The Aristorcats are my favorite of the Disney classic, and it's final. The cat is out of pocket. <br /> <br /> The Aristor Cats: **** / ****
