While I understand that this show is too strange to please everyone, I don't get where all these bad reviews come from, and I'm very surprised at the bad reviews it received from fans of the movies. I liked it and committed to it since the first episode I watched. However, it is a bit of a mess that Kuzco is in school. And it seems to be high school rather than college. But I think he's just eighteen, right, so it's not as if he's too old to be educated? And didn't the royalty always have the best education for them? So, the "Kuzco must graduate, or he won't be emperor" thing doesn't sound too strange to me. And I think his training was previously neglected, so he must now be educated.
