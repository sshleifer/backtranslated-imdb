Burt Reynolds's riposts to Clint Eastwood, which comes on its redhead comedy grave with its orangutory comedies, was to make his own Dirty Harry in Sharky's Chicago-style Machine. Originally intended for John Boorman, but ultimately directed by the star himself, it is an out-of-out commercial package with Reynolds a clown brought to the Fisheries (literally - they are in the basement) nail a mysterious crime gentleman supporting Earl Holliman as the next governor. You can guess the rest, but while Reynolds sometimes tends the story to stop the story, he has a good eye for individual scenes and he almost gets a show from Rachel Ward as the high-class hooker to which he falls. The romantic subplot is exceptionally well developed, there are some good action scenes and some finer touches, such as having Vittorio Gassman's scary villain a mirror image of the hero or Reynolds and a killer who both witness neighboring apartments in the same building. One of the star's better films from his glory days, it's not classic, but it makes for a more than effective Saturday night special.
