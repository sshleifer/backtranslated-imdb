I think this movie version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is actually pretty good. It's definitely amusing. Well, it's not a masterpiece like PRIDE AND PREJUDICE ('95), but there are many good things in it. Especially the city of Bath area !!! .. The Royal Crescent, the Roman bath, the fascinating Georgian atmosphere. This is excellent. If you're a Bath fan like me, you'll love watching this movie! The performances may be a bit too melodramatic, but I have the impression that this film, like the novel itself, deliberately makes fun of the popular stories of romance and terror and of society of the time. The only downside is probably the female head since I personally have another idea of ​​Catherine Morland's physical appearance. The music is also a bit "unusual". But I find it strange, although it did not portray anything with the historical period. I wonder what old Jane would think ... :)
