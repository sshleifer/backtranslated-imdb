I can't get this movie off my brain. It's definitely quite different from anything out there. I saw a lot of movies over the holidays and while some are good, nothing my world really has the way BlindSpot did. There is just something cool about the actors and the way they bring the movie. It's like there are many scary things mixed with some nice f **** ing hilarious black humor. Franco is good, but the older raw man steals the show in a few scenes, such as when he ejects the child into the grave. I think some politically correctos will not appreciate the appreciation (don't bring your grandmother), but it is absolutely fantastic. The thing that is the best is the kaleidoscope style. There are some very serious things mixed with super interesting footage of the road. The movie makes you very sad and scared in parts, but it also turns your head off with what happens and how it is filmed. WTF is the world? So many critics are raving about all these so-called revolutionary groundbreaking films and when you see them, they are boring and predictable and not all. I don't get it because there are many other better choices. Blind Spot is very good because it gives you excitement and chills and great oncoming strength, but does it in a way that is completely fresh and definitely totally rad.
