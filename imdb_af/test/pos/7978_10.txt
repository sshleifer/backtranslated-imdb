This is a cute little movie that pretty much provides what it promises - some great entertainment. After all, when a movie proclaims that it contains top SASS shooters, you need to determine that it is not a likely candidate for the Oscar. These guys are shooters, not actors. Your next clue is that the movie does not die of Nicholas Cage or Jennifer Aniston, ie you should not expect to see the hottest names of the day. It was meant to be just old entertainment and that is as good as many of the old "oaters" I've seen over the years. <br /> <br /> So, what do you get with "Hell to pay"? You get 100 minutes of good old entertainment. You get the chance to see a few stars of last years, which act pretty much like they did in their prime, but a little older. You get some good SASS shooters in big roles and some SASS hammers in the background. It was great fun for me to see people I shot, visited in their homes and who my good friends are doing something that many people just dreamed of - they are in a real, honest life of gosh film. They do something very wannabe actors and wannabe shooters will never get the chance to do it and I think it alone makes the watch worthwhile. <br /> <br /> Admittedly, not everyone is a SASS member and so I've seen lots of fun and humor that others may miss, but it's still good, old-fashioned entertainment. And frankly, there are a lot of movies in the theater at the moment I won't give a nickel to watch, so save the money to go see "Brokeback Mountain" gets "Hell to pay" and watch Some real cowboys have some fun.
