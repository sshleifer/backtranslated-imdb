Apolitic musicians Eva (Liv Ullmann) and Jan Rosenberg (Max von Sydow) are married for seven years and live in a small farm in a remote island to escape from a civil war in the continent. They supply lingberry to some customers to earn money and buy some supplies. They love each other and Eva is twenty years old and wants to have a baby, but the unwilling Jan, who is a weak and sensitive man, doesn't want children. When the rebels arrive on the island, they become peaceful and calm lives to hell, and they get in the middle of accusations from both sides. When Colonel Jacobi (Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand) Eva bumps, Jan changes his behavior and becomes a cruel man and the love and love they feel for each other changes into hatred and indifference. <br /> <br /> "Shame" is an anti-war movie by Master Ingmar Bergman focused on the eyes of a few artists who are apolitical and do not listen to the news, but when the war comes to their countries , they destroyed their love, friendship and love by the senseless soldiers. Liv Ullmann and Max von Sydow have the best performances as usual and I do not remember Liv Ullmann's chest in any other movie. The process of brutalization of the Pacific and sensitive Jan Rosenberg by the war is impressive and the dark overthrow is pessimistic and sufficient for the dramatic story. My voice is nine. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vergonha" ("Shame")
