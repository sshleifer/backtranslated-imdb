Story of three eclipses (maybe even Indigo, ha) children starting their love for murder. Oh, and the people who are "hot" on their route. <br /> <br /> Bloody Birthday, a pretty mediocre movie title, was a nice surprise. I didn't expect a movie that dealt with thirsty psychopath children. And I can say it's also one of the best movies I've seen with kids as the villains. By the end of the film, I wanted to seriously kill these children in a terrible way. <br /> <br /> It's a very solid 80-year-old horror movie, but how these kids get away with all this chaos and murder is just something you can't imagine. Even the smallest part of the investigation will be this lil sh! Ts as the killers easily exposed. But there seems to be only a few police in the town, well at the end, just one, and he looked like a fool, so I think they could have got away with it. Haha, yes, and I'm a Chinese pilot. <br /> <br /> However, this movie featured some malignant children who were more than entertained, many premarital sex, and a decent amount of boobage. No kiddin! If you are printed by the less than the star title, print it out of your head and give it a shot. This is a highly recommended and underrated 80s horror flick.
