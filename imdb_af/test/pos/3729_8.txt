I thought Besson's movie could do without words that few movies could do with them; Capture true human emotions. The main character's struggle, triumph, back, hope and desires are all shown so honestly that you wonder if he is acting completely. The film has a low budget and is made, of course, without the brilliance and brilliance of most Hollywood productions, but that is minimalism that allows the stereotypical Sci-Fi labeling to be surpassed and a true drama. be. To call this movie alone, but just a drama, will take away from the fantastic post-apocalyptic plot. It is true that this kind of film has been done before, but I think this one captures the joys and sorrows of that kind of world, perhaps better than any other.
