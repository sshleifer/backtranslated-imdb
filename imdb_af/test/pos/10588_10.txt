The movie was fantastic. If you are a fan of Bams' cky videos, jackass, or his show Viva la Bam, you can't help but love it. I have a few friends who are not fans who enjoy it, and others who thought were not so good. Those who didn't like it were mostly female friends, they didn't really appreciate the rude humor, which I personally thought made the movie so funny. I'm pretty sure the whole movie was filmed in Bams's hometown, which includes many of its regular venues. The film is made up of all his friends and cky friends, as well as some great names for skateboarders. The soundtrack is phenomenal, with music by HIM. In my opinion, Haggard has it all. A great plot, characters you'll never see anywhere. A lot of humor, good music and a role devoted to the project.
