Contains Spoilers <br /> <br /> This is a Peter Watkins movie. If one saw his BBC masterpieces "Cullodden" and "The War Game", one would recognize the style (and his voice) within seconds of the beginning. Made in 1971, it was established in a very near future, when the Vietnam War increased even more and now looks like China. Nixon is still president and civil disobedience and protest are violently dealt with by drumhead tribunals (outwardly civic with "everyday citizens" as judges). Because a prison building cannot keep up, an alternative is being introduced: The Punishment Park. Criminals can choose between severe jail and a man-hunt in a hostile environment, in this case an 85-km journey through the California desert at 100 Â° F. If they reach an American flag at the end without them passing through the National Guard whether riot police are caught, they will be free, or else they should serve their sentence (or be dead, as we see). The film is made in a completely documentary style with three European teams covering a tribunal and the running of two groups already sentenced. Screens jump between tribunal tent, hunting troops and hunted convicted. Watkin's rare comments give us raw background information (time, temperature, etc.). The tribal scenes show a kangaroo court on the one hand and a wide variety of personalities on the other hand range from real terrorists to "unwanted" to clear innocents (eg a total pacifist who can't even hurt flies). The defense attorney (who takes his job seriously) must abuse both sides. What makes these screens particularly strange is their resemblance to the rhetoric of today's administration to detail. Meanwhile, some unfortunate desert events make it clear that the rules of the game do not really apply. The question remains, whether it comes from the beginning or at random from the troops because of the events that lead to the outcome (I suspect it is both). At the end we are back at the square and the next group goes to "Punishment Park". This description may indicate a highly biased (or even demagogic) propaganda film, but it will be misleading. The behavior (all participants were non-professional as Watkins with Watkins) looks and sounds real (the tribunal screens may even contain textual material from contemporary tests). I would say that if the "real thing" could be sold without problems. With Watkins's "The Forgotten Faces" was the response "We can't send it, or nobody will believe our true news rules anymore (because it's indivisible from the right thing)". With "Punishment Park" it should be the same. Effectively banned in the US as far as I know it is a must see that has not lost its power or its relevance (especially today).
