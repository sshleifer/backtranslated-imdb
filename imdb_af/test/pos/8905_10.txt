Attending this film was an excuse to escape the work I had to do for my classes, but it was one of my best experiences here in France. The movie makes quick work of building multidimensional characters and has a very smooth story. The characters really had the voices you would expect to read the graphic novels and the artistic talent exceeded my expectations. The music was striking and the comedy was fun and light-hearted, almost a flintoneish inclusion of modern items in playful ways. The movie was gripping, cute and action-packed at the same time. A wonderful story jumped expertly. I will show it to my French students.
