This can be my favorite so bad, it's amazing movie of all time. Like many pre-teenage children of the 80's, repeat views of ninja revenge have created a ninja phase of my childhood. Man thought Sho k. was then bathing. Jet Li can throw him in a roll with both legs! This movie features crazy crossovers that include flashdance, the exorcist and the Lee Van Cleef Ninja TV show. ugh. but if a friend of mine says anyone can get a good movie, it makes a real genius to make a movie that starts with a ninja-surviving 17 shotgun storms that are long enough to leave the body of the aerobic instructor to take revenge. Wow. While previous commentators have swung the sword out of the closet, man has not yet experienced the powerful love show. Where the sexy chief cop is sticking out his shirt to reveal a man from back. The fun never ends. Rent it !!!!!!
