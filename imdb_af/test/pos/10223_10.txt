That is Clive Barker's masterpiece in my opinion. The movie has a great storyline and wonderful makeup and effects. The one thing I want to see happen is a successor. The movie is set up for a sequel and with improved technology the second movie can be incredible. David Cronenberg will appear in both a sequel and Craig Sheffer. But this particular movie was an excellent original, creative and entertaining idea and I could watch it again and again. Cronenberg was perfect in this movie and Sheffer added an interesting spice to the movie.
