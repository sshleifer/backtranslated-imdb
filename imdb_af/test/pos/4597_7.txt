As social satire, idiocracy is just as good as Office Space, but with a wider range. To criticize this movie as to puerilie because of potty humor, is to be similar to the point, I think. There are definitely fiery jokes etc, but they aren't really meant to be jokes for the audience - they exist to define the state of the "culture" in the world of AD 2500 visited by Joe. a background for the bizarre state of affairs in which he wakes up. The real humor of the film lies in the many ghosts and attitudes that occur in this future society, which are just a shadow of what we experience in our daily lives and which serve as a warning. My personal favorite is the depiction of Fox News. The subtle brilliance in the film lies in the fact that it also digs into "smart" people, and average Joes likes the lead actors. Notice the times in the movie when Joe and Rita almost unconsciously meet the idiots around them, and you realize that Idiocracy is not created to fall on any group of people in particular, but on the culture of idiot in general. I don't know what to say about Fox's "made for conspiracy theory" behavior in the release of this movie, but if it doesn't play in your local theater, ask for it. We should all see this movie, if it is not for the social comment, at least for the jokes.
