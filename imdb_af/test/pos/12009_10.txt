I grew up outside Naila Germany (where they landed), every detail of the movie was 100% authentic, the power lines they flew, the nostrils, the grandmother telling the kids they can't watch the West German TV . . This movie brings great memories of those who are European, a good production of Disney ... In the same German film Klaus Lowitsch and Gunter Meisner used their own voices to translate the English version into German. German version also uses Kookoo birds, a bird that is in Germany as background noise to let you know that you are in Germany. I showed this move to many of my German family members and they really liked this movie. made a prototype balloon that they had to give up because the material they used was too porous and the other 2 balloons they used for the escape. The burner problem was solved when they turned the propane cylinders upside down.)
