This movie seems to have been overlooked by everyone. Someone should bring it to VHS and DVD. It's an excellent movie and much better than the one with Brooke Shields, which was terrible. <br /> <br /> Jean Simmons earns more credit than she now gets days. It will be nice if all her movies are on VHS or DVD. Jean Simmons was, and still is, a very good actress. She was definitely a beauty. In fact, she is still a beauty. She also did very well on T.V. She is so much better than many of the actors today.
