Have the drama, excitement and character development you will enjoy when you like drama that engages and entertains you as well as educates. <br /> <br /> The writers know their stuff and show it. The direction is always tempting and does not blow, and the play is great. Why this show won no awards, tell me the "forces in Hollyweird" do not know drama or much else. <br /> <br /> There is a plot twist in this episode at the end was a complete surprise and was very well played. I'm glad it wasn't used as a shock scene for any climate change that would have been more typical and boring. Rent this series at once! Let's hope it's brought back from celluloid extinction.
