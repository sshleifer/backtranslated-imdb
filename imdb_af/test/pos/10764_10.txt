I can't imagine why it hasn't been released theatrically yet. It has a large ensemble cast, with Sutherland, Lane, and especially Chris Evans doing spectacular work. Wake up, studio execution! <br /> <br /> The story is based on the experiences of the author / scriptwriter, growing up as the "poor child" in an extremely wealthy community where the class is everything and making a difference in every aspect of the life, from clothes to justice. <br /> <br /> During the film's Q&A, the author was asked about his experiences, and especially what we didn't know about the ultra-lows. He said they were not stupid, they were very clever (as opposed to how they could portray themselves), they had plans and they were a threat! <br /> <br /> In many ways, this movie is extremely timely.
