As can be read in many reviews, it is a movie that you love or hate - apparently not so much space for opinions in between. I think this is a good sign. <br /> <br /> I always appreciated this movie, although the genre is not my typical style (for example, I never watched Titanic and is not going to). <br /> <br /> The English Patient grabs because It shows how people can be different if they are in an exotic environment while they are at home (Katherine). It shows how destructive love can be in a slow, strong and painful way, it is excited about the extremely passionate cause, the pain of the one remaining, the uselessness of being able to continue. <br /> <br /> Photography is just stunning, not to mention the act of the actors. The pace is slow, but timely, and it does justice to the book, the timeline and the depth / development of the characters. Setting it in 110 minutes (as some are suggested here) will amputate the multi-layeredness of this movie. People tend to have trouble with the speed of movies ... as if they are in a hurry to go to work .. hey - get a life! ;-) enjoy ... <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4.5 out of 5.
