It is not surprising that this film was made, since I was Kwon Taek when it was. He explored the early beauty and tragedy of the Chosun dynasty life in Seopyonje and explored a well-known Korean folk tale in Chunhyang. It included his last two films. What is surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 presentation, is not offered in the pansori style of the previous two films. <br /> <br /> However, the experienced hand of I come through. Together, we explore the life of a real person: a late-nineteenth-century Chosun-dynasty painter who is on the brink of modernity, but is not a nobleman, and thereby in today's Korean society with his fame and awakening his audience and artistic expressions of contempt for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for Japanese ruling colonies. The painter, Chang Seung Up, commonly known as Oh Won (announced by Choi Min Sik, the famous star of Park Chan Wook's already legendary "OldBoy") is becoming more and more influential and therefore more dangerous in the film. Contemporary Korean audiences will return such a hero, despite the fact, or perhaps because of his exhaustion in his time. I am the feeling of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. I am a master of capturing his country's previous idiosyncrasies, and in this film he almost surprised himself. As expected in a movie, cinematography is breathtaking, the editing is precise and the story is central. Plots are set against Seung Up, family ties are tested and broken. Scandalous behavior is claimed (and is sometimes actually), all to bring down the man who painted "fire." But against all the intricacies of my detailed but sometimes winding version of Seung Up's life, Seung Up somehow controls himself to survive. He becomes legendary because of his ability to copy well-known Chinese paintings to just one look. Art dealers and agents besiege him and try to make money "Oh, Won." In other words, lines of people who want to make use of the actual Seung Up, an artistic star, begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His cleverness in the tension of both the massive hordes and the imperial brothers, impresses the audience, if not the cast. <br /> <br /> What does Seung Up think? He has powerful emotions and opinions on painting, such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and never really completed. He despises those who try to make art in profit. And he doesn't care for politicians who may use them to bring artistic beauty around them and then throw the artist away as treacherous. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming disorder. Shrill scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are being offered. I am the signature historical epic motif, and its influence in the kingdom remains on prominent performance in this multi-million dollar epic. <br /> <br /> The protagonist causes greater sadness for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint. This is when the story takes on a whole new meaning, one that is not only political but also social. I take the issues in a commendable, realistic way. <br /> <br /> He, O Won, becomes a Jesus figure. The people believe him to be artistic miracles and the government feels that it needs his artistic support, but the protagonist remains completely independent and disrespectful of what others want him to do or be. Eventually, both government and people come down to Seung Up in a way that is taken straight from the Bible. His holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; He dies for (or escapes) the sins of the common people, the art critics, the politicians who kill him. <br /> <br /> But does he die? As with most of my movies, a question remains. In this case, Seung Up is really becoming an immortal hermit? The movie does not address that question; it just offers a possible end to the real man of Chang Seung Up, or Oh Won. No death is depicted, because no death is known. <br /> <br /> It is difficult to find fault with this film, but I have become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that he is no longer surprised when he does. As usual for my movies, cinematography, editing and writing are all first. It's a well-crafted movie I caught. I am amazing storytelling ability. Granted, he may be the best to do this by the old Korean music art of pansori. Still, the film contains pieces of this admirable art form, and by the end viewers feel as though they have a great, unprecedented story. And they have, because it is the gift of me.
