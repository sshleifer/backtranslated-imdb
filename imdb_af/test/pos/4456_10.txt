If you are one of the people who think Lucio Fulci is about gore, gut and zombies, then you (and "The Psychic" too). Although the movie also includes some very brutal scenes of violence and a disturbing topic, it's not the most important thing here. It is a truly impressive, story and character-driven murder mystery that may be the masterpiece of the director. Here he proves that he is a true craftsman, creating an unforgettable, disturbing but strikingly beautiful masterpiece, filled with creepy Catholic images and interesting social commentary. It also has a good role, including the beautiful Barbara Bouchet, as well as Tomas Millan (of Beatrice Cenci) and Irene Pappas in a small but important role. Yet it is Brazilian actress Florinda Bolkan (who also stares in Fulci's bizarre "Lizard in a woman's skin") who steals the scene in the role of Majara, providing an excellent performance by a woman by her superstitions driven and her evil murder scene is particularly heartbreaking. The second star of the movie is Sergio D'Ofizi's cinematography, which, along with the melancholic Morricone esquire score by Riz Ortolani, helps bring the "secluded Italian village with a dark secret" to life. I have to admit that the dummy head that hit the stones pulled me, but it is a definite Italian horror classic - a moving, sad and finally enjoyable work. 10/10 for me. If you liked this one, I recommend watching Alfred Sole's "Alice, Sweet Alice" as they are somewhat similar, and both are inferior gems.
