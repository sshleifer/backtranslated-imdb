It's a surprisingly good budget Horror / Comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a very cool ending! All the characters are pretty cool, and the story while the original is very good, plus Eric Jungmann (Adam) and Justin Urich (Harley) had fantastic chemistry together. One of the funniest moments in the movie for me is when Adam gets caught in the bathroom, and Harley wakes up to find that monster truck there. He decides to take ap-ss in the truck, and Aimee Brooks is just sexy! , plus it's one of the best low budget horror movies I've seen long ago. It is very stingy, but in a comical way, and I thought it was very well written, plus Michael Bailey Smith is fantastic as the Monster Man and has some evil makeup! It's similar to movies like Joy Ride, Duel, Jeepers Creepers, etc. And it has some exciting moments here and there, plus the gore effects are really well done for the most part. It's a surprisingly good budget Horror / Comedy, it's funny and pretty well made, with good performances and a very cool running end, I recommend this one !! The direction is very good! Michael Davis does a very good job! works here, with a good camera work, good angles, good colors, and a good environment, and he kept the movie funny and fast. <br /> <br /> There are many gore! . We become extremely bloody nosebleed, gory impaling, bloody stabbing, the man is cut in half by a monster truck, human remains in a boiled stew, gut everywhere, guys' intestines fall out, pencil in the eyes, bloody crevice skin, a lot of people walking around without limbs, greedy dead squirrel, heads are bruised, cut limbs, bloody and mutilated corpses, proper bloodshed, one very stingy end and more! <br /> <br /> The Acting is very good for a low budget movie. Eric Jungmann is fantastic here as Adam, he was a nerd, but a very pleasant one, he had fantastic chemistry with Justin Urich, had some cool lines, and I just loved his character. He also seemed to have enjoyed himself. good at the end! Justin Urich is excellent as the best friend of a friend, but I just can't help him but love him as he was, and often stole many of the scenes. I really dug him! Aimee Brooks is beautiful and has done well with what she had to do, she had good chemistry with Jungmann and as Jungmann was especially good at the end when I loved her mysterious character. Michael Bailey Smith is great if The Monster Man he was very creepy looking, has some awesome makeup, and is now one of my favorite slashers! The rest of the role play is doing well. <br /> <br /> Overall, I recommend this one! *** 1/2 out of 5
