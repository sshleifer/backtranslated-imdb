I saw this film last night at the Boston Internation Festival of Women's Cinema and was sad to hear me. Troche tells us (in her Q&A after the show) that she doesn't expect too much American spread because of her insistence on what all the so-called "gay content" includes. It was a wonderfully entertaining comedy, and it seems to me as if American audiences can enjoy it in the same way as' The Full Monty ', so it's really unfortunate and kind of ridiculous that a couple of boys' shots keep it away of mainstream theaters. Wonderful cast, FABULOUS script, and of course, Rose Troche's direction makes this one of the funniest movies I've seen.
