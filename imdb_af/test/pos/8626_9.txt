I grew up with the Abbott and Costello movies, A. because my dad grew up with them and both of our last names are abbott, so we owe the deo a little respect. I didn't realize the movie touched this movie and others of Theres. It was a very classic appearance, it was funny because Abbott and Costello were always the same characters, but it was so funny, now that I love Jack and the Beanstalk, it is, although the love story is quite boring and the one is the prince singing, caring, awesome, but I love the corner they have taken on love, the story, the couple must marry because one kingdom runs out of money, they meet in the prison cell and fall in love because they both do not pretend to be royal and they end the couple, so happy ending, I don't think it was the original version. If it was, they had to cut it out of this movie, but I think it was original and I love it. But watch it suck, lol, even if the movie really fits in with the giant + abbott and costello, it's so funny. when the giant knocks in the door knocks and the jack is shouted "OPEN THE THROUGH, OPEN THE BY" those things are really funny. And that one time joke where Jack starts screaming, prince, prince and all the dogs jump him. kinda cheezy but really original. I wish they would have least tried to remaster it, although I did have that African scream, and I don't have the memory of the quality when I had it on tape, it was bad quality too, whatever I think . the beginning is gently funny, the middle is really really funny and the end is not funny, but i am 19 years old and when a movie is made in 52, i make it difficult, it rocks, this movie is really funny. I love their style. also the chapters suck. also the part where jack climbs the leg and they all sing a song about what a dipstick jack is and being killed, it's pretty funny
