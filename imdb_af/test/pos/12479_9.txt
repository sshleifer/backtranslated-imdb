Great artists always suffered while they were young. I can call Mozart and Beethoven, but that's not the point. <br /> <br /> This movie was made by HG Clouzot, whose family wanted him to succeed in the legal profession. <br /> <br /> The star is Louis Jouvet who studied and practiced as a pharmacist before becoming "The Greatest Actor" and also director of France's theater before and after World War II. <br /> <br /> They both had health problems. Clouzot had TB while he was young, Jouvet had heart problems and died at a theater. <br /> <br /> Such events are the character of men (and of course of course). One can even say that today's Artists are so poor because they never suffered and fought for their lives. <br /> <br /> For me it's the biggest of Clouzot's movies. "Wage of fear" is bigger in "suspense", "Diabolique" also has more "tension" and a better plot and is more about "female evil". <br /> <br /> Quai des Orf√®vres is more human. Clouzot was falsely accused by De Gaulle's entourage (mostly communists and Jews) of collaborating with the Nazis and banning films until De Gaulle left the French government early in 1946. De Gaulle returned in 1958 as president. <br /> <The main characters are all good souls: Jenny L'Amour can act on stage as a "putain", but she is not a "whore" (dictation makes synonyms of those words but they are not not the same) her husband, refusing the slight progress of her (presumably Lesbian) friend Dora, the photographer. <br /> <br /> Maurice the man is jealous and scary but walks away from the crime scene. coward because he fell in love with a woman and traded an ultimately more exciting career for love. <br /> <br /> Antoine, the detective (interpreted by the great Louis Jouvet, basically a stage actor, feed in these French "Gray" no Noir as well as EG Robinson in "Double Damage") shows flair for pseudo- criminals, tenderness for a Negro boy (?) and compassion for the true writer of the crime, because he remembers that the father cleaned the latrines at a nobleman's castle! <br /> <br /> Clouzot could hit an actor's face to put him in the right mood, but deep inside he was very human. <br /> <br /> I have his horoscope in front of me. He has Venus in Sagittarius, which means openness, dedication, love and altruism. For those who don't believe in Astrology, my sincere apology ...
