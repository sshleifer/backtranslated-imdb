If there were two parts that physically angry, ugly-charismatic actor Gerard Depardieu was born, as a Frenchman, to play, surely Cyrano de Bergerac and spokesman Georges Danton had to be. Here he dominates the film through the width of his shoulders and the power of his voice; his charisma carries the part despite the fact that it is made clear that the character has so much blood on his hands than any of the rest. Danton celebrates while the people of Paris are hungry ... but he is the one man who can challenge the tyranny imposed by the dreaded Public Safety Committee in the name of "freedom" and he is presented as the hero of the film - despite the fact that the bronze game virtually destroyed his opponent Robespierre! <br /> <br /> For those who know the characters from the history, there is interest in identifying the small parts: the frog-faced Tallien, Couthon the cripple, Fouquier-Tinville, the tribunal's prosecutor, the pounding jerk St-Just, the epic painter David. But the writing cuts a little slack in this regard; Names are often late when minor characters are identified at all and there is no Hollywood-style "info-dump" to make sure the audience can post events in their historical context. It goes without saying that you know what has happened before, and what will happen - sometimes it takes too much for yourself, as it relies on a close knowledge of dates to give the tail its tail in the fact that Robespierre soon followed Danton to the scaffold. <br /> <br /> Considering a movie, it's not quite satisfactory, as it breaks away at the end. The structure of the story leads to a great confrontation between the protagonists in the courtroom or a dramatic highlight of the trial, which, due to history, never actually happens. Things just fizzle out: there is no uprising, there is no overthrow of the tyranny, there is no assumption of power by the victor, there is no triumph on either side. It can be historically accurate, but it is not quite satisfactory as a result of a screen situation - it seems a strange place to stop. As others commented, it might be more logical to enter events until the end of the Terror and in the appeal to show the fall of Robespierre.
