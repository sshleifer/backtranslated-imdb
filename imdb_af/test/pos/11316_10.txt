Dirty War is absolutely one of the best political, government and well-written TV dramas in the 25 years. <br /> <br /> The play is wonderful, the writing is spectacular. <br /> <br /> Diry War reveals the true side of why we're not ready to respond to a nuclear, biological and radiological terrorist attack here on American soil. <br /> <br /> Dirty War must be made in a big movie - it's so good! I recommend this great drama to everyone who wants to know the truth. <br /> <br /> This TV drama reveals how British Intelligence (MI5 and MI6) is trying to expose a terror plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims because England's involvement in the Iraq war. <br /> <br /> The scenes of different parts of London, England are also spectacular. <br /> <br /> Dirty War is a must see !!!
