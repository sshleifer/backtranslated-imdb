I attended a preview of this film, not sure what to expect from Kevin Costner and Ashton Kutcher; both delivered less than memorable performances and films. While the underlying "general" storyline is somewhat known, this film was excellent. Both Costner and Kutcher delivered powerful performances that play very well apart. The human malice and strength of their respective characters was played incredibly by both; The scene when Costner Kutcher confronted with the personal reasons why Kutcher joined the Coast Guard rescue elite was the film's most memorable emotional moment. The "specific" storyline was an education that in itself portrays personal sacrifice and demanding physical training. The elite Coast Guard rescuers need to work through in preparation for their only job and responsibility ... to save marine life. The special effects of the rescue panels were extremely realistic and "wowing" ... I haven't seen such a terrible sea since "The Perfect Storm". Mrs. Clancy Brown (HBO's Carnivale), who played the captain of the Coast Guard's Kodiak Alaska base, played a strongly convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and the necessary ice water in his veins. The film is wonderful, and ultimately it gives prolonged exposure and respect to the Coast Guard; This applauded the audience at the end.
