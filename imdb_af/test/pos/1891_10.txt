I went to see this movie at a book signed last night in Lexington, Ky. After a wonderful evening consisting of a few short words with Mr. Bruce Campbell (you have to say it all, not just Bruce or Mr. Campbell; D), friends while the books were signed and a QnA session with our favorite deadly killer muffled the lights. <br /> <br /> Not to spoil anything, I won't go into detail ... but I loved the movie! Mr. Bruce Campbell did a wonderful job of holding the classic b-movie. The characters were classic 'b' characters, the place was refreshing (what movies do you * know it's based in Bulgaria?) And the area was almost original and fun! In addition, the humor shared by the film, which the audience has laughed at by the movie. <br /> <br /> While this movie doesn't have much of a general appeal to people than some, it's a beacon of fun and laughter in a season of (as stated by Bruce Campbell) 'b-movies' called a movie (Bewitched, Dukes of Hazard, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?!).
