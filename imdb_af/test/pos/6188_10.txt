<br /> <br /> There's something about watching a movie in a good old-fashioned movie house that adds a huge appeal to every picture. I was fortunate enough to see a few Ernst Lubitsch comedies at the New York City Film Forum during their three week tribute to the legendary director. The double feature I attended was a show of Lubitsch's 1938 comedy Bluebeard's Eighth Woman and the pre-code classic Design for Living, which I have never seen. Everything I read for Design for Living praised the movie, but I couldn't find anywhere for Bluebeard's eighth wife. Leonard Maltin didn't help it. Video, too, has given the comedy a low rating of IMDB score, not complementary. And Pauline Kael (not a big surprise) reviewed the film in her performance. So, when I went into the city that day, I was planning to enjoy Bluebeard's eighth wife, just a little and love Design for Living. Bluebeard's eighth wife (who first showed up) started, as the eccentrics that populated the cinema occupy their seats and the thirties music dropped. "Adolph Zukor offers Claudette Colbert and Gary Cooper in Ernst Lubitsch's Bluebeard's Eighth Woman," read the title card. Then the picture opened with a hilarious scene: Cooper wants to buy some pajama tops, but he doesn't want a part of the bottom! He gets a little with the clerk, seeking the help of his higher bosses, and they seem to have no end to the argument. Perform Claudette Colbert, one of the thirtieth theater's most beautiful, charming and talented personalities. "I'll take the bottom," she says kindly. And maybe you have the best "screw-on" comedies ever met. The film kept my interest wonderful. I almost constantly laughed at myself. When Colbert was discovered, just before a family portrait was taken, that her groom was married seven times, the whole theater broke in hysteria. When she instantly estimates money, she gets the shock and strengthens the laugh (which has not yet ceased). And Edward Everett Horton also milked hilarious scripture reactions. When Cooper took inspiration from Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew to discipline his wife by hitting her face, I couldn't control my laugh when she slammed him back. And the drunken scene with the shellfish is one of Claudette Colbert's funniest comic scenes. The biggest cartoon of the movie came when Colbert raised a boxer to teach her husband a lesson. "In a purely screw-ball fashion, he knocks out the wrong man, but puts her friend David Niven in a cold sleep. He wakes up when Cooper comes. To cover the situation, Colbert puts her fist to Niven in a moment of strong sexuality and asks, "Where did the man hit you? Here? Here? Here?" And then BAM! knock him out again! The movie was wonderful, from start to finish it was a perfect joy. I also loved Design for Living, but I dare say I think for pure laugh and entertainment. Bluebeard's eighth woman was the better and more pleasant movie. There is a little charm to see a vintage movie on the big screen. And in the presence of others who laugh, one feels more comfortable doing it themselves. This is perhaps why I felt the way I did about Bluebeard's eighth wife.
