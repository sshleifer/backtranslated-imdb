I really enjoyed this short, even as a Toronto Maple Leafs fan. <br /> <br /> Director Sheldon Cohen and narrator Roch Carrier captured all the boys' emotions perfectly. Some of the feelings he had for his hero, Maurice "Rocket" Richard, to the excitement, anticipation and hope of getting a new Montreal Canadiens jersey soon after the appearance of horror on his face when he put his jersey off mother got; A Toronto Maple Leafs jersey was priceless and shameful to wear this horrible (in his eyes) blue and white Toronto Maple Leafs jersey; Not the rouge, the bleu and the blanc of the Montreal Canadiens with Richard's number nine, like his old jersey. And worst of all, his mother had him carry the Maple Leafs jersey out of the house. You can predict and expect the mockery he would get from his friends when he hit the ice with the jersey before he got there. <br /> <br /> I've been laughing all the time and it's one of the best animated shorts. saw. <br /> <br />
