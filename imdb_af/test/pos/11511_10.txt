First, if you want to watch movies, I recommend NOT watching this one. Why? Then you will not appreciate such a movie so easily. <br /> <br /> Actually, I don't want to bring too many expectations, but it's almost scary how perfect, intense and beautiful this work by Einar Gudmundsson is. In most movies there is at least one aspect that spoils the whole thing, such as good actors, but terrible dialogues or a beautiful landscape, but low budget cinematography? In Angels of the Universe "there's nothing of this ambivalence. Actually, everything is just fantastic, even (and not least) the soundtrack with the beautiful Sigur Ros. <br /> <br /> In this story about Pall, A student who goes schizophrenic after being dumped by his girlfriend, especially the dialogues (and monologues) deserves attention: along with (and sometimes in sharp contrast to) the plot varies from depressed and fatalistic to the opposite of comic and totally absurd In addition, they are often (with quotes from Hegel and Shakespeare) of such a poetic beauty that the movie is almost driven into a surrealistic sphere and only saved by the incredibly authentic actors in the real world. <br /> <br /> One of the other comments has already referred to another point: This movie is not a trivial entertainment for evening entertainment, despite several comic reliefs in between, it is largely disturbing, partly cynical and bitter, and m all sad. a modern poetry about a life of madness with all its emptiness, anger and loneliness. <br /> <br /> Finally: If you saw the movie ?? watch it again. There are some great visual metaphors and allusions in what you first realize when you look twice and connect with the moral of the story. "And of course: read the book, it contains a lot more of the small, funny stories in between and also makes you understand some things in the movie a little better.
