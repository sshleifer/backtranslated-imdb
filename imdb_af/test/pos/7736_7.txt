William Shakespeare probably did not regard Stephanos as a gay doctor, Antonio as a faithful woman, or Caliban as a goodbye to a Trinitron, but over time Bard got worse with his good work and could even enjoy the wonderful imagination of life. This is his "Tempest", as reconfigured by Paul Mazursky and co-author Leon Capetanos. <br /> <br /> This time, Prospero is Philip Dimitrius (John Cassevetes), a Manhattan-based architect who is tired of designing Atlantic City. casinos for the amiable Mafioso Alonso (Vittorio Gassman), especially after Alonso was discovered, is a relationship with Philip's wife Antonia (Gena Rowlands) in progress. Along with daughter Miranda (Molly Ringwald), Philip escapes to a remote Greek island with Miranda and his new mistress Aretha (Susan Sarandon), a beautiful Catholic girl struggling with Philip's celibacy style. Will a sudden storm eventually come? <br /> <br /> Here's a thought about the career of Cassevetes: How many other actors can make a movie so confused? A treasure trove of film critics for his earlier work, often with his real wife, Rowlands, presents a central character who really does suffer for his art, but looks and enjoys us too. It is not Prospero, but something rich and funny that makes a huge sea change all its own. <br /> <br /> "It's all here," he tells one of his faithful companions, Aretha's dog Nino. "Beauty, magic, inspiration and calm." That's it. Tempest Transfers 1611 London to 1982 Manhattan and find some good resonances in Philip's displaced life. "Show me the magic," he calls out for a stormy cityscape, and Mazursky's version, supplemented by Donald McAlpine's dying cinematography of sea-shaped purple forms and of course sun-burned Greek landscapes, does just that. <br /> <br /> It's not a perfect movie. In fact, the big finale, which is the only part of the movie that follows Shakespeare's storyline in any faithful way, is a mess. Rowland's character is hard to give much in this movie, and after meeting Sarandon in all her braless glory, it's hard to understand Philip's constant concern for his wife, let alone his left field's desire. make an unfortunate "sacrifice" to restore the natural order of things. <br /> <br /> But there's a lot to know about "Tempest". In addition to Cassavetes, there is Ringwald's debut as his loyal but restless daughter, as in the play, an object of desire for the primitive, rustic Kalibanos (Raul Julia). Ringwald here is the very same teenage boy of privileged adolescence that John Hughes will inspire, but with an emotional depth, the later Hughes films have not buried. Ringwald and Julia never received Oscar attention, but they both won Golden Globes for their playful work here. He tries to woo her in her island isolation with his TV revivals of "Gunsmoke" in Greek, requesting her 15-year-old body. <br /> <br /> "I want you with my bonny Johnny, Balonga," Kalibanos declares that we are being let down, but anyway we win our sympathy, especially after we have a choir of goats' New York. New York 'performed. (When "Tempest" hit the screens, Julia was the toast of Broadway as the lead in "Nine".) <br /> <br /> It's Mazursky's show, though it sometimes feels that Cassavetes is doing things with improvisation lectures and emotional crashes in general. (Philip introduces himself to Aretha by telling her, "I'm right in the middle of a nervous breakdown.") He plays his character as a friendly obsessive, who wants to crystallize his happiness through a theater in his otherwise to build uninhabited island. /> <br /> At the pleasure, Gassman's rich performance adds to the other man, who is so amusing as Julia, while telling a youth-obsessed Philip: "Boys don't have half as much fund as we have ... becomes nervous ... and they make love in the back of an old sports car. "Despite being overlapping and pretentious in patches, like so many art films, Tempest is an entertainment in its remains and a journey that Much like Shakespeare is meant, even though his dreams don't have a red back at a Go-Gos concert.
