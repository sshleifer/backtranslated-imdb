Man, I never laugh so much this year, and it's pretty hard to make me laugh. While I was expecting a hostel style movie, the smile even came to my face from the beginning. This film-inside movie shows a female broken "victim" who kills the whole set of knives until she eventually dies. Her persuasive drives the director nuts and his funny reaction tells us, the viewers, that the Mute witness is not a typical horror movie. <br /> <br /> The main character, dumb American makeup artist Billy Hughes, is played by the beautiful but talented Russian actress Marina Zudina. Her performance is top-notch; her character cannot speak, so the body language and the emotions on her face must compensate. And, oh son, she did a wonderful job. Her sister (Fay Ripley) is the girl or fiancee or wife of the "in-film director" (Evan Richards). They were both very funny most of the time. I will no longer spoil, but the screens that follow the swim, along with their two, the fake policemen and later the fierce neighbor, were clearly brilliant black comedy. <br /> <br /> The plot is cut near the end, possibly misleading at a particular moment. But do not worry. Such a nice movie can be seen in family or with your son / girl / friend.
