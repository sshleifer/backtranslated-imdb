I'll thank Mr Hacke for the movie. My Deutsch is not gut. Excuse you. <br /> <br /> First of all, I didn't know how diverse the sound of Istanbul was, but I live in Turkey. Akin and Alexander Hacke made a different approach to Turkish music. , since Istanbul and Istanbul Music from a stranger component had the right meaning of the music itself. <br /> <br /> In this movie I found out how different our (Turkish) culture is, how interesting our artists are, and how much respect they deserve. Unfortunately, no one was able to serve this kind of documentary before.
