I really like this movie. I looked at the public broadcasting system last night. The part I liked about it was the fact that they didn't treat them in the future or in the past. They basically had some of the terrorists, had a van or two and hired them to be car bombs. I think what the movie had shown was people in different countries at the same time. It has shown that England, or any other country, is not prepared to attack the size they have shown. I have never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie, so I can't really tell if they are normally their parts. After the movie, they discussed this panel of experts about whether something like this could happen in the US. It was a thoughtful discussion!
