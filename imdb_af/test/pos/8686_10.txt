I watched the Princess of the Nile for the first time when I was about 10 years old. I'm now 63 and never forgot the movie. I also didn't come across my fascination with Egypt. I searched the internet to buy the movie, but couldn't find it. It makes me wonder if it's one of the lost movies in Hollywood. I held Debra Padget and Jeffrey Hunter together. They have such charisma together. If you wanted to ask me something about the movie, I could tell you nothing else than it was in it. I vaguely remember a scene at the Nile with Debra Padget a lot of other women. I always wanted to see it again. I have never thought of it as an escape movie, but I can now see where it probably was. I hope they'll put it on DVD and I'll see it again before I die. It was a wonderful movie.
