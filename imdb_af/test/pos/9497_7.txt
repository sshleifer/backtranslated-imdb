I found this movie to be filled with irony. But look at the movie you can almost see what will happen. Leila is a confused, bored housewife, constantly looking for happiness. When she thinks she finds true happiness, she clings to it and leaves behind everything she knew. But she finds her self almost notes between her ex and her current husband. She learned that if she had just communicated about what had bothered her in her previous marriage, it could be much easier to save her. She realizes that the words are not effective, but she learns too far in her second marriage and finds herself back and hopes for change again. The main conflict in this movie is Leila vs herself. You can't really have happiness without really being happy. I like this movie, but I would only recommend this movie to women. I can't see a man who really enjoys this movie.
