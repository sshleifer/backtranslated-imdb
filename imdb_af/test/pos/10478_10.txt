As not the best movie ever made, Babette's Feast is surely one of the most loving ones. It is a wonderful exploration of the meaning of works of art, generosity, loyalty and grace. Humor is mixed with the desired; Characters are treated with the search for honesty, but also deep respect. There are meditations here on memory, fate, age and faithfulness. Wonderful camera works by film artist Henning Kristiansen: seldom did wrinkled faces look so light in the candle light. The meal is accompanied by wonderful music, Brahms, Mozart and simple folk songs. Enjoy this feast for the eyes and the spirit, because as the general says, "Mercy and truth have met one another, and righteousness and salvation will kiss one another."
