Graphics are far from the best part of the game. This is the number one best TH game in the series. Along the subway. It deserves strong love. It's a foolish game. There are massive levels, massive inaccessible characters ... it's just a massive game. Flush your money on this game. This is the kind of money that is properly wasted. And although graphics suck, it doesn't make a game good. Actually, the graphics were good. Today the graphics are crazy. WHO IS ABOUT? As they say in Canada, this is the fun game, aye. (You go to Canada in THPS3). Well, I don't know if they say it, but they can. who knows. Well, Canadian people do. Wait a minute, I'm going off the subject. This game rocks. Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it. This is PURE BRILLIANCE.
