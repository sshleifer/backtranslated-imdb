Another Raquel Welch Classic! This photo hit the theaters on November 10, 1969 with Raquel Welch as Michele, James Stacey as Joe and Luke Askew as Alan Morris. Nikki is on her way to meet her girlfriend Michele and Jackie. As she goes there, she walks into her ex-husband who wants a second chance. Nikki walks away from him, goes to the table where she sees Michele and Jackie. Alan approaches her again and she starts to run away when Alan shoots her back. Nikki is taken to hospital while Michele and Jackie go to the police station. Michele goes to the hospital where she meets Jackie alone to find out that Nikki is dead. Alan then goes after Jackie, who he beats with a car and then tries to run Michele off. Michele jumps into her car and heads for Los Angeles. When she gets there, she calls Lloyd her boss in Las Vegas to let him know she's all right. Lloyd tells her to go to the club to call the losers to see Jeri a job. However, there is one problem! The bartender has a drug problem and Alan knows it so Alan and the barman speak a little. Back in Los Angeles Michele not only gets a job as a dancer with Jeri, but also with Jeri Bouncer Joe. Now a few thoughts on this photo! This photo was much better than Raquel last, and one had a ceaseless action. Luke Askew had a good job of playing Nikki. He was your typical murder with the look that goes with it. As for Raquel Welch's performance, the only word coming to me is fantastic. She was fantastic in this movie and her beauty stood and shone like never before. The outfit she wore on stage to dance was breathtaking. In fact, all the outfits she wore in this movie were breathtaking. Of course it doesn't matter what Raquel had, because she looks good in everything or nothing. I give these movie 10 weasel stars for two reasons. The first and foremost is Raquel Welch, who is the leading actress and earns 10 stars. The second reason is that this movie was wall-to-wall excitement from start to finish.
