This movie brings back so many memories to me! I was very young when it came out, but I remember the first time I saw it! My dad and I will always watch the "Ernest Movies" together. We didn't see them in a few years, and I found some of them very cheap. We watched them and couldn't stop laughing. I love all the Ernest Movies, but this one is my favorite. <br /> <br /> Spoiler share! <br /> <br /> The part I remember most is the "magnet" part. My dad still does the electric chair! <br /> <br /> End Spoiler! <br /> <br /> It's a very cute movie ... but a great one! It's perfect for families (it's not like much of the trash out there), but at the same time adults can laugh too! If you like physical humor (such as facial expressions and the way people move) then this is the movie for you!
