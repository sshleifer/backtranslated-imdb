The efforts of a new group of young talent enhanced by Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, 2 very talented actors, make for an exciting and surprising evening of entertainment. And I can add that Hal Holbrook shines like the Senator. This movie earns five stars. I give it a ten on your scale. And the end is PERFECT. I am constantly amazed at the ability of British actors to master our American accents. I was convinced that all the actors in Louisiana were born. And what finer place for a mystery than New Orleans! The Big Easy, also known as the Crescent City, penetrates every scene. As author and director, Sebastian Gutierrez deserves high praise.
