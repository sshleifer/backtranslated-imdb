I will admit that this movie was terribly, cheesy, sexist, poorly baptized and poorly edited, but I love it anyway. I only saw the movie when I was 14, and it has held me before. FYI, it's very close to hard core porn as I remember. It sure has my juices flowing. This movie gives a whole new meaning to Swedish erotica. It's a humorous onslaught on human sexuality as seen by hot, ravenous female aliens who, in my opinion, are just looking for spermatozoa for their dying race.
