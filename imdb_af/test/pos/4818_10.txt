High on the success of "Rebel Without a Cause" came a flood of 'teen movies'. This is probably one of the best. A very young McArthur shines here as the not really upset teenager. The story focuses more on perceptions of criminality than any traumatic appearance. The supporting role is unforgettable, Frankenheimer leads like an old pro. Just a story of a young man who finds others, takes his actions very seriously.
