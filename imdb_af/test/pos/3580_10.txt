A beautiful view of the sea and life in it. <br /> <br /> The Good: <br /> <br /> The camera work was absolutely phenomenal. Every shot is beautifully done. <br /> <br /> It was interesting to see all the different animals I could never imagine. <br /> <br /> David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice. No one could have done any better. <br /> <br /> The Bad: <br /> <br /> There was one or two different times where there was a reference to the earth that was 1 million years old (I hold another faith). <br /> <br /> In general, a TV series can all enjoy. I recommend buying it. 10/10 stars.
