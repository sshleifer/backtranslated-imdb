Working at a movie as a projection, I have the opportunity to basically watch every movie that comes out. When I first saw the trailer for 'Black Snake Moan', I laughed and thought, 'Great.' Another 'Snakes on a Plane' Samuel L Jackson movie. But of course, I wanted to see it for the laughing factor. Many people judged this movie too quickly based on the innuendo in the title, the images on promotional ads and the fact that Justin Timberlake is in the movie. Personally, I loved this movie every second. It tells the story of an older man and a young woman who both go through difficult times and are able to reach out to each other. The story really touches and sends a good message about life and how we live. Of course, I do not recommend this to young audiences due to graphic material, but if you are looking for a good story and real performances by Sam Jackson, Christina Ricci and yes, even Justin Timberlake, I encourage you to 'Black ' to see. Snake Moan '.
