I had such high expectations for Teletoon Retro to air it, but instead of having such shows, which didn't receive the treatment they deserve, air them things I've seen many times before. <br /> The Centurions was the highlight of my teens. I know it may look a little clich√©d, but it is true. After Duke of G.I. Joe, Jake Rockewell is another of those cartoon characters I really loved. <br /> <br /> It's too bad that Teletoon Retro doesn't see it like the people of my generation do. Otherwise, Teletoon Retro will be much better than it is.
