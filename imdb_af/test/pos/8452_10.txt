I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when it was first released, and every time I saw it. The political drama is effective, if not especially new or inspired. The decades since the release of the film have shown that the willingness to cut costs at the expense of public safety is definitely not just something that is thought by a scriptwriter. <br /> <br /> However, I think the most impressive feature of this movie is Jack Lemmon's performance. It's absolutely amazing to see him at work. He has the gift of being able to communicate so much, sometimes without saying a word. Next time watching this movie, Jack's face looks at the times he says nothing. He does not need to speak (or worse) to let you know what goes through his mind. <br /> <br /> I call it a spoiler because of the impression it made on me when I first saw the movie: in Lemmon's last scene in the movie, lying on the floor, he feels a slight vibration. The horror in his eyes is one of the frightening images I have seen in any movie. It is perfectly acting, because it immediately bears the threat to prevent - if Jack's character is so terrible, there is definitely something terrible to happen. And do it.
