This is a wonderful movie that takes place during the romantic period of the Civil War. This movie is a must see for Eastwood Fans and Eastwood claims it is one of his favorite movies he did. I couldn't agree anymore. Passop! It's a devastating Eastwood eventually dies. Eastwood and director Don Siegel rightly arrested that the end should be unexpected and for some reasons unhappy. They wanted to keep the book, for one. Secondly, there can't always be a happy ending. Third, it was written during the Vietnam War. They wanted a negative explanation for this terrible war battle where people are unnecessarily dying. I agree with all this. It's a great movie and I love most movies that include the Civil War. It's more of a portrait of how misleading women can be - that they can be more dangerous than men, so the title has a lot to do with the statement BEGUILED - to be deceived. The song that Eastwood sang at the beginning and end of the film is yet another statement against not only the Civil War but the Vietnam War and perhaps indirectly the women he touches on the film. Wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes. NOTE: This movie is no reason for R. There is almost no language, it is probably the subject of sex - but there is no nudity. Excellent film- 9/10.
