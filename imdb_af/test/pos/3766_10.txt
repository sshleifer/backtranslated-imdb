Coming from the generation "druggie", I thought this movie was hilarious. It certainly brought Jekyll & Hyde up to date, so to speak. My husband and I laughed all the way. Would like to have the movie in my collection. I told my two teenagers the movie and they would love to see it. They are not in drugs, but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie. It's been so long ago that I saw what I can't remember, but a few things. I should say that the funniest part was when Dr. Jekyll died on his lab table and inhaled the straw while he was killed and then sniffed the powder drug he invented. The finest thing I've ever seen in a movie.
