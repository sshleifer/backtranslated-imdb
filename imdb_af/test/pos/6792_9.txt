It's a beautiful movie. Elizabeth Taylor does a great job just like Mickey Rooney. The movie just makes you happy. It's inspiring, and though some parts are a little too sentimental, it's easy to forgive. I could watch this movie again and again. The race at the end is exciting every time I see it. Recommend this movie.
