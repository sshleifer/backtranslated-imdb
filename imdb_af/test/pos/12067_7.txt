Like many situations comedies, the "War at Home" gets better with each episode. The characters really start and I believe they are a family. I agree with many that the first few episodes were not so funny; I thought the show would certainly be canceled. But with the absence of "Malcolm in the Middle" and "Arrested Development", "War" Sunday night offers a much needed lively action comedy for FOX. And when compared to the rest of the sitcoms air, "War" is now a better choice. <br /> <br /> The appeal, at least for me, lies in its real situations. Teens have sex. Not every parent likes how their children come out. Parents fight and call each other names. But rather than trusting them to be "like" many shows, everything is fine, which is the number one rule of a good sitcom. <br /> <br /> One derivation of the show is the narrative between / between scenes. The "Arrested Development / Family Guy" style of flashback work is good enough, but the story can be too much. <br /> <br /> Anyone who needs something to watch on Sunday evenings must check out The War at Home. especially in light of what is on the other major networks at that time.
