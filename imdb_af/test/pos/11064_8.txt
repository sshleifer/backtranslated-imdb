I have to admit that I am prejudiced about my voice on this movie, but I have strong reasons because I know the true history of the Hollywood treatment here. Edna Ferber's novel on which it is based is from an era where real names cannot be used. In this way, this film is all smoke and mirrors. Although released in 1946, it was filmed shortly after Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman is at her most radiant in this movie as a brunette. <br /> <br /> She plays a beautiful woman trying to get her beauty to get a rich man. Today it is a golden digger, but in this social era she is desirable and the kind of woman who wants all the men, and all the old, handsome societal types speak of her and avoid her while wishing she is her. Ingrid is at his best and plays this role well. <br /> <br /> Some sympathy for Ingrid's character is raised in the New Orleans section of this movie, as she manages to get a decent outdated grave for her scandalized mother as part of her family's settlement to let her leave New. Orleans. The snooty family members are so scandalized by her that they will do almost anything she asks to get her to leave town. <br /> <br /> Gary Cooper is good at this movie, though he is already a bit outdated to play a little Texan bachelor / Gambler. He pulled it off well in light of the disability he grew older than he was because of his real boiler smoking. Flora Robison as Ingrid's Maid was nominated for an Oscar as supporting actress in this movie. Jerry Austin as Cupidor is in many ways told about his role, but is the only comic relief in the film. Do this well. <br /> <br /> When the movie moves to Saratoga, it accurately portrays the importance of Saratoga. in that era. I like the sequence when Bergman walks to the Saratoga spring to get some of the "sulfur" water that everyone saw so healthy. If she drinks something, she forces herself not to make a face and comment on how good it is and to have more. <br /> <br /> True history is the railroad battle that really took place on the Tunnel, New York railroad - which is the real Saratoga tribe that is the title of the movie. This battle actually happened in 1869 between agents for Andrew Carnagie and J. P. Morgan. The line was the economic key to the country in 1869, connecting coal and east coast. The references about it throughout the film are very real. There is even a dialogue that Carnagie describes as a "Scot," although the reference is vague and unknown to anyone who does not know the history of the battle. <br /> <br /> The railroad and railway tunnel in Tunnel, New York Postcode 13848, still exists although the film was shot in California. The real tunnel is about 1 mile long. It's still part of a key freight line today, years after. I grew up there. Gary Cooper's line in the movie while driving the train into the tunnel is right, it's still 'mighty beautiful country'.
