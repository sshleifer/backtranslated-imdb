"Pitch Black" was a total shock to me when I first saw it in 2000. In previous years, I was repeatedly disappointed by all the lame sci-fi movies (Ex: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and thought this movie wasn't different. But to make it clear: This movie provoked me ... in a good way. I wasn't aware that I was still afraid of the dark until I watched this movie; I had to bury my fear in the back of my subconscious mind when I was a child and it deserves just to stay there. <br /> <br /> The strange creatures made my spine go; The individual (s) they designed have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to make something so impressive and grotesque. <br /> <br /> I loved how the authors gave each main character a history and showed their mistakes and strengths without much confusion. <br /> <br /> Riddick's (Vin Diesel) donated to escape from any impossible situation and a battle of battle dropped the jaw. In the first place, you make him out to be a cold intelligent villain, but in some short moments you can see something human behind his animal side. But as soon as you discover it, he does something maliciously unholy. He probably keeps you to the end. I didn't know if he should despise or admire him ... he is definitely a love / hate type character. <br /> <br /> Johns (Cole Hauser) was a perfect example of a good-looking character but in need of greed, showing his true intentions and what he is willing to do to survive. John's knack to know which buttons to print and the right words to say make him as filthy as Riddick. <br /> <br /> Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Johns has said so beautifully, looked at her first, first, before considering the effects. But what is encouraging is that she quickly realizes the mistakes of her ways and desperately tries to pay fines even when she puts her life in danger when other human values ​​are thrown away and run to the dark hills. <br /> <br /> Jack (Rhiana Griffith) just wanted a hero and was the first in the whole group to find the hero in Riddick; by a child's eye can be seen well through the thick clouds of evil. I thought it was absolutely priceless if Jack shaved his head to Riddick; You know what they say: Imitation is the best form of flattery. <br /> <br /> Imam (Keith David), like Jack, has the ability to see well in any evil. He uses philosophy to carry him through the hardships he encounters, and when time allows, he gives his losses and then soldiers rationally. In a way, he served as a moral booster for the survivors, although most characters acted as if they were not listening. <br /> <br /> The decisive movie for this movie was positively perfect. Each actor shone brightly in their role and their talents blended wonderfully on the screen. <br /> <br /> This movie might have a small budget, but the director's leadership and the actor's actions made the movie work and allowed the audience to use. Their imagination instead of having some extraordinary special effects done makes all the work for them. This movie is a definite Sci-Fi classic. Look at it and judge (with an open mind) for yourself. It will be worth it.
