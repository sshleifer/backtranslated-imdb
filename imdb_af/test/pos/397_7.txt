One of the more obscure of Anthony Mann's Westerns, The Last Frontier was also his only cavalry Western (apart from one short episode in Winchester '73), but of course he focused on outsiders and internal conflicts rather than a Fordian comrades celebration. to offer. shared ideals. Do not set in his beloved high country, but in the foothills and forests, it is a much more cynical view of the life of the border, in many respects retaining its Fort Apache without the legend. This outpost is made up of misfits, failures, cowards, and the oddly skilled officer ignored by his superiors, who are poorly guided while the Civil War takes precedence and all the best the army offers. <br /> <br /> Victor Mature and James Whitmore are the free poachers who get civilization on them as they are relieved of their fur and packers by a local tribe who are being harassed by the attack of the Cavalry on their territory. Rather than blaming the Indians for their losses, they decide it was the army's fault for building the fort and deciding to claim compensation from them, and eventually joining their ranks as scouts. But despite the best efforts of Guy Madison's friendly and competent acting commander to bring Adult into the 19th century and make him fit to wear the uniform, the arrival of Robert Preston's humiliated colonel made him eager to revenge him on the tribe that drove him out of his own. outpost ?? And Adult's turbulent imagination with the colonel's wife (Anne Bancroft, too much of an empty slate here to do much about the role of a woman who's tired of being saved by men who think they know what's best for her)? Drive soon in much darker areas. It is not long before some of the soldiers plan to kill each other. Both sides are trying to make their subordinates do the act for them: a little wondering that the blue head had thrown him to maturity at one point, he had long been in horror and screamed. I would have died for this, but it's just a dirty dirty blue cloth! "The Stallone of his day, Adult, was one of the actors who could surprise you with the strange excellent performance here and there when it matches the right part and the right director. It's not one of his better days, despite the fact that his most complex part is perverted enough to be a simple man? well-meaning, but drunk, violent, unconcerned and with unreliable, almost childlike lust for life, the part with Burt Lancaster seems to bear in mind, with some striking similarities with his character in The Kentuckian. But Robert Preston's Agab-like colonel is clearly the best role determined to revive the career he has devastated in a single disastrous suicide civil war by launching another senseless suicide campaign against the tribe that add another humiliation to the list that keeps him out of sight. and out of mind the promotional board. In his obsession with delivering his career, he moves further away from any hope of moral salvation, driven so much by his shame in his wife's sympathy than by promoting former comrades he regards as his inferiors. He is beyond bliss, but there is another recognizable person there and one not completely without a sense of integrity? He admits Madison's courage to make a futile effort to get Preston's orders against their superiors? Like his hero, the movie is a bit rough around the edges (boasting one of the most surrealistic and turbulent titles of any Western), but it's only likely to make it more interesting, and there are many Mann's typically elegant camera moves and plays on perspective, while the border setting is convincingly hard and primitive. Unfortunately, the shortcomings of the early CinemaScope lenses are very evident in Columbia's DVD, with the image often dark (2.55: 1 CinemaScope requires a large amount of additional lighting and early Scope films show lots of trial and error) and grainy.
