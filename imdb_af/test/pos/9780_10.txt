After being a great grandfather, I was arrested and sent to Changi during World War II, I was reluctant to see it when it was first watched on TV. My grandfather kept a diary while in exile and when he died there, his friends bought it back and I was happy to read it and at least I have an idea of ​​what Changi really likes, first hand. <br /> <br /> This is a fantastic narrative of what happened to the poor who were sent to Changi Prison and show how hardship and cruelty they witnessed to protect their country. It is a great story of company, commitment and Aussie Spirit, who will never be minded. It's worth checking out whether you like Australian history or doing anything about World War II. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed this mini and give it 10 out of 10.
