Brilliant Aussie movie ... a little slow at first, but as soon as it goes, you can't stop laughing. When I originally saw the movie, I vaguely knew the plot line, because I don't know if many people are aware that this movie is based on a true story, and more specifically, the director and his mother (of course names are change). I just knew this fact because the director is a friend of a friend of my family. When I saw the movie, my stepmother kept secret that we would meet Matthew Newton after the screening ... Such a good man (except for a particularly nasty incident with his ex)! Brillian also throws with Sam Neill and others! A good reason to support the Australian film industry
