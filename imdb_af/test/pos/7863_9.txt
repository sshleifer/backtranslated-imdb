During the short period between Clint Eastwood's string of Spaghetti Westerns and his Dirty Harry films, he and director Don Siegel worked together to make this unusual picture. Eastwood plays an injured Union Army corporal during the Civil War, taken up by a southern school for girls until he recovers from his wounds. It's been a while since the young women (most of whom are teenagers) had a man on the premises so they were reluctant to take him to the local rebel soldiers. The resulting situations are often humorous, shocking, erotic or even grotesque, as Eastwood slowly restores its power and begins to break over the foundation. <br /> <br /> The basic storyline sounds almost like a porn movie. We suddenly surrounded a male male by young noble women. Most of them are sexually attracted to him. And he is more than willing to spread the love among them. However, the material never really falls on the "tasteless" level. Eastwood, Siegel, and film maker Bruce Surtees are so skilled filmmakers that the film always retains its dignity. <br /> <br /> Eastwood's John McBurney is like no other character he has ever played. McBurney is an amoral, fucking, and funny charlatan. He knows that most of the women, even the youngest, want his bid, and he has more than one shot at him. McBurney often uses flattery to butter women and uses them to look rough. He's like a drunk player at a cocktail party that often beats the same women on different women! In the end, his funny ways cause him great anxiety and loss in a way that you have to see for yourself. This author will not dream of revealing the specific effects of his actions, but there is little doubt that he is coming to them. <br /> <br /> Eastwood gives a typical good performance. He looks as if he has an explosion with the roll until things get really ugly, then he becomes ugly. Geraldine Page is a surprise as the Steely B * tch runs the school. We know she wants McBurney as much as the other girls, but with her many past shows in flashbacks, we find that it's not all! Mae Mercer as a slave belonging to the school also gives a good performance. She obviously knows that McBurney is a skunk from the beginning, and she never leaves his ominous charm. It's a character you want to know more about when the movie is over. She has a greater knowledge of the world than anyone else in the film. <br /> <br /> The Beguiled became poor in his theater release. No one was quite sure what to do about it, and some of his content undoubtedly raised some eyebrows in 1971. For example, in an early scene we see Eastwood kissing a 12-year-old girl. Does he try to keep her quiet when the rebel soldiers get close or does he really enjoy it? Probably both! A fantasy series later even shows that Clint does it with not only Page but her young assistant! Really some interesting things in this one. That's a good thing. Eastwood became the star he had done, or one might have been forgotten for a long time. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended. 9 out of 10 stars. <br /> <br /> The Hound.
