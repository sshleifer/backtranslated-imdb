I lost count how many times I watched this movie. I'm never tired of it, because it's a movie that can be enjoyed and interpreted on so many levels. they just no longer make movies like this. <br /> <br /> Having recently watched the latest documentary about making this movie (Hearts of Darkness: a movie maker in madness), I am even more surprised that this movie is even finished, but alone so great. <br /> <br /> The fact that they actually filmed this movie in the jungle of the Philippines is the biggest asset of the film. you actually feel like you are in Vietnam. <br /> <br /> All the actors are fantastic with my favorites still Robert Duvall ("I love the smell of napalm in the morning!") Martin Glans, and the great Marlon Brando. <br /> <br /> Many people complain that the movie gets too dark, strange and cerebral near the end. Well, remember what Coppolla said about this movie, "This movie isn't about Vietnam, it's Vietnam!" What he means is that this movie is about MADNESS and not the war. <br /> <br /> This movie is based on the short story "Heart of Darkness" by Joseph Conrad and set against the Vietnam War instead of civil war as in the book. I think it was a brilliant combination in my opinion. <br /> <br /> It's a perfect, challenging movie that is dark, violent, humorous and sometimes well done in every way. <br /> <br /> a true classic <br /> <br /> rating: 10
