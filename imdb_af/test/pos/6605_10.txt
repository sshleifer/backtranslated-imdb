Dogtown and Z-Boys <br /> Summary: Dogtown and Z-boys is a documentary about a group of revolutionary teenagers who know the world of surfing and skateboarding in Venice (Dogtown), California as we know it today. changed. With their low turning point, they started a journey made by Larry Bertlemen, which would lead to numerous successes and a few failures. After the Dogtown articles appeared in a restored Skateboarder magazine, the sport was refurbished and members of the Zephyr skateboard team forgot Jeff Ho and watched the rest of their lives on the summer holidays by joining other skateboard teams. to pay them like movie stars. The original Zephyr Skateboard team composed by Jeff Ho (Zephyr Surfshop Owner) and Craig Stecyk (Photographer) included Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Stacy Peralta, Bob Biniak, Chris Cahill, Shogo Kubo, Paul Constantineau, Jim Muir, Peggy Oki only wife), Nathan Pratt, Wentzle Ruml IV, Allen Sarlo, and David Ray Perry. All the original members except Jay Adams and Chris Cahill are still good and navigate / skate. Jay Adams, at the time of the documentary, served time on drug-related charges. Chris Cahill, at the time of the documentary, was last seen in Mexico. <br /> <br /> Themes: The themes of this documentary are sort of read-between-the-lines, but if there was a clear cut, it would be that even children could spark revolutions. Other themes include extensive partying in the past, leading to an unfinished future. Through planning and caution with one's assets, a very rewarding future can be at hand. <br /> <br /> Other works: Stacy Peralta (Author and Director) has a fairly wide variety of documentary documents that he or she has written, produced or directed. Most with a general theme of surfing or skateboarding, such as Riding Giants, Sk8 TV, The Bones Brigrades and Lords of Dogtown. He also made films with a theme to grow in America as a teenager, movies like: Influences: From Yesterday to Today, Crips and Blood: Made in America and The 70s: The Decade That Changed Television. <br /> <br /> Subjects: The topics of Dogtown and Z boys are the original members of the Zephyr Skateboard team, excluding Chris Cahill. Peralta included Jeff Ho and Craig Stecyk, among others, in the interviews. Other subjects were people who grew up in the 70's to read the Dogtown articles as well as skateboard enthusiasts. Skaters from the Dogtown area, but not on the team were interviewed. <br /> <br /> Editing: Editing this movie was phenomenal in my opinion. There were screens of the subjects talking so the audience could see who was talking and feeling the character, but would immediately go to archives that would explain what the speaker said. When a song can better explain the emotions of the subjects, such as when Jay Adams' unhappy life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man was played by Neil Young, which caused many emotions. Sean Penn was the narrator for the film and he explained the transitions in the film. The film was chronologically presented from the time the Zephyr surf team was created, the skateboard team created, to all the Z boys who left the team to join other skate companies or create their own company. <br /> <br /> Camera: The movie was shot in an interesting way. The film from the speakers was all black and white and all the archival images of the Z-Boys surfing or skating were in color. Of course, the imagery was of the seventies, but it only improved the film. The interviewers were mostly shot in the same area, but everyone was outside. All the material was very well controlled, even the archive image I found very surprising. <br /> <br /> Music: "Seasons of Waaner" - Performed by Aerosmith "Toys on the Attic" -Performed by Aerosmith "Generation Landslide" - Alice Cooper "One Way Out" - Performed by The Allman Brothers "Lollipops and Roses "and" Whipped Cream "- performed by Herb Alpert" In The Void "and" Paranoid "- performed by Black Sabbath" Godzilla "- Blue Oyster cult Aladdin Sane and Rebel Rebel.
