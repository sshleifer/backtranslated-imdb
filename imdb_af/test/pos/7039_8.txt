I loved this show. I actually left ten minutes before closing the bar and ran the way to catch it. I remember Daniel Peacock's sketch about Gandhi in the news agencies as a masterpiece. The set design and lighting was from this world, creating an atmosphere you feel you were actually into. V unusual for a comedy. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately I only experienced one other person (apart from the other reviewer here) who ever knew this program existed. In fact, I have to thank the IMDb for the creation and prove that I didn't think of the whole series in a drunken haze, which I seriously began to believe!
