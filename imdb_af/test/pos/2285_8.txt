Not too many people seem to know about this movie. It's too bad because I think it's pretty good. Certainly, it is sometimes a bit cheesy and can have a predictable storyline. But the performance of the movie was pretty good. I think the casting is good with similar actors / characters. Tom Selleck does a good job of playing a baseball player (figure out ... not too much of a rack I think) and Ken Takakura (of Black Rain) plays the lead (Japanese baseball coach) . There is not too much to complain about. It's just a light, easy, happy comedy and I recommend it.
