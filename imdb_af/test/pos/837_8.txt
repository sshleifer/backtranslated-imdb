After finishing the Zero Woman series, I was looking forward to the Female Prisoner Scorpion series; Both are based on cartoons by Tooru Shinohara. Unfortunately, I couldn't do it, as it is the third in the series. <br /> <br /> It starts out well as The Scorpion (Meiko Kaji) escapes from the police. Detective Kondo (Mikio Narita) managed to get a cuff on her, but she cut off his arm and got away. If it's not bad enough, a dog later raises the arm and is stepped along the street before getting a place to enjoy its surprise. <br /> <br /> Scorpio can return to jail as well as life. There is no picnic on the outside. First, a local Yakuza Tanida (v) threatens to put her back if she doesn't smear; and then the gang gets her when she gets rid of Tanida. But they did not keep her long before she escaped and sought revenge. <br /> <br /> Soon they fall like flies. Some surely deserved to wear colored outfits with shirt straps so big that they had gone completely to the shoulder. The lady (Reisen Lee) turns herself into killing to kill. <br /> <br /> Police come to her latest death and fall into the sewer. She's been there for a week and the police find out that a friend (Yayoi Watanabe) provided her with food. (The story of O Yuki (Watanabe) and her brother is a subplot that is very interesting but just by the movie.) They're trying to burn her out, but it's The Scorpion, and she has some unfinished business. <Br /> <br /> Not the usual mix of sex and violence, it's a slow story that's beautiful.
