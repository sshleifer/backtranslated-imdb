Again, we are happy to see a beautiful opening scene where the artists' work is fully restored and we see this old-fashioned grocery store on a street corner with the snow falling softly. Inside are the rich colors of all the goods, from produce to canned and boxing to medicine to candy, etc. <br /> <br /> Essentially, it is a story of those goods that come to life, such as the animals on the labels of items, or a pie or even a pack of cigarettes. <br /> <br /> The whole "show" is told by Jack Bunny, a Jack Benny mimic, with music by conductor Leopold Stokowski, who was in so many Looney Tunes animated shorts, I lost. Much of the humor is topical, so it pays to know who "Little Egypt" and other characters. The Busby Berkeley-type "aqua" number with canned sardines, and the tomato can dance, was clever! <br /> <br /> All of the above, and more, were slightly longer than normal-length cartoon in the first half of this. The second half was about a King Kong type that escaped from the Animal Crackers cabinet and terrorized everyone. That part wasn't much, and ended on a somewhat stupid note. So ..... an "A" for the first half, a "D" for the second, making it over a C-plus or B-min overall.
