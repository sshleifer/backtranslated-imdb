A very good movie about anti-Semitism near the end of World War II. The scene that speaks a lot of the ignorance of these people is the meeting at the church when the priest gives his speech against the "international money ministers and communists". It sounds incredible like the speeches Adolph Hitler used to force his people's throat, but none of the congregation seem to make this comparison.
