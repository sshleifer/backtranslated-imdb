One would have expected Hitchcock's return to the major studio movie entertainment side to be the cautious caution. Certainly little expects its most unsolved, unpolluted film, a lasting blend of evil black comedy, exciting tensions, mocking manipulation and astonishing flight of fancy. But that's exactly what they got: STRONGER ON A TRAIN. <br /> <br /> What is remarkable is how much Bruno's offense disrupts the world of film. Much of the masterful cross motif has been made, but its immediate effect is to completely prevent the straight line of progress. Guy makes his life and therefore the society he represents or is keen to join. Guy is the archetypal American, the worker boy has done well, moving in influential circles, athletic, successful, attractive. Bruno is his devastating opposite, gay, decadent, 'European' (he lives from his father, in a big house, and just about dream of murder). Bruno's life is one of repetition, circular, while Guy moves straight. It is Bruno's achievement to move Guy into his kingdom (represented by the cheerful round) and force HIM to break (break the law, hope for murder (Bruno's). <br /> <br /> Bruno is literally fighting patriarchy All the movie characters in the film are criticized - Bruno's father, a man whose brutality takes a look at us, but the real horror that is constantly mentioned in the film (especially in Aunt Clara's paintings - that incredibly intense negative energy must come from somewhere); Anna's amazing Machiavellian, self-serving father; the insensitive judge who thinks nothing of lunch after performance; The tennis commentator whose smugly authoritative comment is always wrong. By far the mother of the legend, Hitch, like Robin Wood is very hostile to fathers and patriarchy. <br /> <br /> Bruno's transgression changes the world's top-notch, which is Hitch's most surreal movie, when Guy is in his plot, he is filmed straight, with conventional romantic music. But when Bruno penetrates, the atmosphere becomes carnival, bizarre, much nicer. It is Hitch's first truly American movie, which flames in the primitive detritus of Americana. Cultivated men put out small boys' balloons, or try to throw them with throwing rounds. Outstanding maths professors sing about goats on trains. Matron older society is strangled by elegant soires. Washington is filmed like a series of savings lines in a big desert under a big sky, like a haunting Dali painting. There is one of the biggest and funniest plays in all movies when we see a motionless Bruno in a sea turning heads at a tennis match worthy of Magritte. Just look at any scene with Bruno in it, and watch it in the bizarre track. <br /> <br /> Phalluses flow into the most ridiculous permutations - watch all the balloons (Hitch obviously only saw the THIRD MAN) - as well as in more quiet environments: Washington will never look the same again. STRONGER is also, despite VERTIGO, Hitch's most overt sexual movie - as well as the phalluses, the persistent homurothism, the remarkable game with 'row' horses; the gobsmacking fellatio jokes when Hitch's daughter's powder flushes over the policeman. <br /> <br /> And yet, Hitch doesn't stop at good old tension. In the very good attempt to show what a great artist he was, critics tend to look at what made him famous in the first place. Many have been made by Bruno as a prototype of Norman Bates, and Hitch is playing happy destruction on hearing identification, and Bruno wants to have murder. There is a hilarious sequence where Bruno loses the lighter with which he wants to frame Guy in a drain. The grab of tension and sigh of relief to the part of the audience that I was part of an insane killer is inherently funny, slightly disturbing and very revealing about our true responses to conformity and success. And Hitch melts it with recklessness. Listen to the mocking music and exaggerated compositions, and kick yourself for everything so serious. <br /> <br /> STRONGER is one of Hitch's five best movies, and therefore one of the biggest things in the theater. The dialogue is so strange and brilliant, I can't believe it's not written by Chandler. Patricia Hitchcock is a wonderful imp, standing for her fiery father while offending Guy. The fairytale finals are a remarkable, dizzying merger of exciting, tense set-up, black comedy and symbolic site. If Bruno's final words condemn him to hell (according to Catholic prescriptions Hitch is supposed to embody: compare to a similar end in CHILDREN), we welcome his integrity, infinitely preferable to Guy's defective service of self.
