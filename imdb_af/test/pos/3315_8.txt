I watched TCM the first few moments a few years ago, but stopped after about 15 minutes. I listed it on the schedule at Stanford Theater in Palo Alto, and I promised I would make the 40 minute ride. The Stanford is an old-fashioned movie house that every movie begins with the curtains. Yes, they have curtains. They opened when the Fox logo fanfare started playing. When "The Best of Everything" appeared in large pink letters that spread across the New York City skyline, I knew I was ready to wait. <br /> <br /> I loaded this movie. There were so many small moments that added to the look of the movie: When Hope Lange runs for the first time in the public office, the titles of the magazines published there are etched on the glass (The Teenager and Elegance). Joan Crawford's heavy apron she wore, she could serve her guests at her party without batting her outfit; The way the camera tilted to indicate how crazy Suzy Parker was (it was almost sideways at one point); how Hope Lange stays with that dumpy flat she shared with the other, although she does of course make much more money than at the beginning of the movie (it's too scandalous that a single gallon can live alone). <br /> <br /> Hope Lange was so beautiful; so was suzy parker. And how about Mark Goddard in a non-speaking role. I fell in love with him when I was a child watching Lost in Space. <br /> <br /> To see this gem on the big screen, asked me to plan another move to Stanford to see The Old Dark House. By the way, I bought a small cooldrink and popcorn from the franchise, and I was surprised when the worker asked me for two dollars.
