The violent men are reasonably good, which definitely benefits from his excellent role. <br /> <br /> Edward G. Robinson is the big farmer trying to express the smaller ranchers, one of whom is Glenn Ford. Ford is ready to sell to reconcile his fiancee (May Wynn) until Robinson's ambitious brother (Brian Keith) kills one of Ford's hands. Then you know what happens next. <br /> <br /> Barbara Stanwyck, along with Robinson's twilight wife, is the kind of role she specializes in. Dianne Foster plays their daughter Ford. <br /> <br /> The Great Men is nothing more than a "B" plot with an "A" movie, but it's done very well.
