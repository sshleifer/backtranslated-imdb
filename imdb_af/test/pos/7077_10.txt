I saw this movie with my mom in September. I expected a good movie, and I saw an excellent one. This is my most beautiful movie now. It didn't leave me after I left the theater. The situations in this movie reminded me of my grandmother. Meryl Streep and Ren√© Zellweger were equally incredible. This movie made me realize how important family relationships are. Hire it. I can't recommend it enough.
