Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson while on a mission for Germany. <br /> <br /> The songs are beautiful. The two are well matched. July shows a more temperamental side in this movie than the pretty girl she usually plays. <br /> <br /> A half-German, half-English girl singing well and entertaining the troops in WW I, Julie is singing some engaging Mancini songs. <br /> <br /> I loved the movie. Some will say it's a "chick spot", but so. It's wonderful. <br /> <br /> Supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped. It may not be Rock's performance in Pillow Talk, Magnificent Obsession or Giant. <br /> <br /> Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland and used authentic WW I-type aircraft. Landscape for England and France is absolutely beautiful.
