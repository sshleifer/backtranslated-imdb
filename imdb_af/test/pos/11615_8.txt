Go into this movie, I knew two things about it. I knew it was a really extreme movie, and I knew it was somewhat artificial. Both appeal to me in their own right, but when placed, it can be something really unique. And it was right, no doubt, unique. As I mentioned above, this is an artificial film. The way they used intense sound reminded me of a lot of Aronofsky movie. Visually, I didn't see anything like it. The cinematography and lighting were done very well. The movie uses serious visuals and sounds better than I've seen for a while. Especially when you look at the experience of these young filmmakers (20-year-olds), you really have to get your hat off. <br /> <br /> The movie is not easy to describe or even discuss. There is no real story. You can say it revolves around the right and left sides of the brain and how they control your life? I think. These are four segments, or four ideas that are brought alive through visual and auditory extremes. There are a few talk and talk, but it is mostly a non-speaking movie. <br /> <br /> The first segment is the shortest and it turns a bare body and an eyeball. Try and guess what happens. The second segment is my favorite. It involves a brother and a sister (which looks a bit like Sarah Silverman, but with bigger boobs). The brother is crazy and the sister is a bit of a whore. I'd say it's the most extreme of all segments, and the most well-made. The gore effects in this one were wonderful. The third segment revolves around a bunch of bald people who slaughtered it with mother earth. It is probably considered the worst of the bunch, but is still clever and well made. The fourth segment is probably the strongest of the movie and I also want to say the deepest. For myself, I have to see it several times to understand what is really being said. I know it is approaching Christianity in a way that your mother will surely abandon or give up. Try it. <br /> <br /> Unconscious cruelty was recommended to me and I am proud to say that is now in my movie collection. It is extreme, violent, greedy, very sexual and surprisingly beautiful, damning. The next line I'm going to say now is almost every review I've read for this movie. "This movie is not for everyone." Now it's not the truth. If you're in extreme movies and / or you're just a movie lover who wants to see something else. See below. 8 1/2 out of 10
