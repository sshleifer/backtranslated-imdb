It's such a fun and funny movie. Highly entertaining for all angles. It features a foreign variety of memorable, psychotic, but lovely nuts. We have; the judge, the Sargent, the child, the creepy old lady, the slut, the clown. And unfortunately everyone lives in a large house that has no locks and is understaffed. So for our enjoyment we get to see them running around, playing games and being dangerous. We also teach a lesson on the road ... never give your patient an ax! <br /> <br /> It was before Cukkos Nest, and surpassed it. At least on the fun level. It even has its lovely moments. "Love is pure. Love is grace. Love is power. You love me, your love is pure, you will always love me." Now, who can resist it? Nuts are also people. Just a few loose threads. Be a little careful, or you'll get an ax in the back! Children at stake. Hehe. <br /> <br /> The phone repairman was really funny and his reaction to the nuts and bitchy boss was really real. All the characters in this movie have been played tremendously. And I really found them funny. No, HOLY! They can even give dirty thoughts about how to use them. Or how can they benefit you. <br /> <br /> It's actually a very clever movie. There is a brilliant turning end. I must say I expected it to be good, but it never expected. It's terrible. "The court made its decision. You are no longer in control!" I love it. The end is so, so perfect ... you'll shed a tear. <br /> <br /> I'm so excited about watching a movie like this. I will never forget it. It's not just a cult ... it's a CLASSIC cult. Whatever you do ... Don't look in the basement !!!
