Although not as well-known as a murder, which was not only glorious, but almost surpassed the book, it is an excellent adaptation. And you know what, it's a big improvement on the Geraldine McEwan version. Now I'm not proud of the Geraldine McEwan adaptations, two or three of them were surprisingly good, but others started well, but ruined by either a poor script, a confusing final solution or both. The Geraldine McEwan version suffered simultaneously with all the above-mentioned issues, and I would consider the second worst of the ITV adjustments, the worst Sittaford Mystery, which even turned its own merits into dull and confusing. This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a great improvement, it not only respects the book, despite some freedoms, but it really improves the problems the ITV version has. Despite the fact that Lionel attributed more, it was rather annoying, more about how he was written than how he acted, and one or two moments of slow pacing. It is solid as an adaptation of a decent book. It is beautifully filmed, with great photography and time details, and the music is always excellent. The performances are great and make the most of a well-written script, with Joan Hickson as always, like Miss Marple, and solid twists by Liz Fraser, Helen Cherry, Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper. Margaret Tyzack is excellent in a cool and moving display like Clothilde. Overall, worth watching, better than the recent version in almost all departments. 9/10 Bethany Cox
