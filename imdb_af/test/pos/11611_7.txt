The dreams of Karim Hussain must be feared. When the right hemisphere of its characters overshoots the left hand, shocking images of blood, disengagement and various horrors are released. Religion will not save you, not the mother nature or your own family. Hussain's dark poetry, because that's what this movie really is, destabilizes all the institutions of the sanctuary. <br /> <br /> "Subconcious Cruelty" is a current crowd pleaser on the horror fantasy festival circuit. The film's opening meditation on madness is both well written and deep. The protagonist's desire to defile the birth process, which brought him into hell, deployed him with terrible and credible illogical. From here, the film goes deeper into the subconscious and catches the mother's nature. Hussain presents portrayal of hilarious pagan fertility and writhing mushroom madness. Nature is exposed to bloodthirsty and violent in Hussain's frightening relief. <br /> <br /> "Subconcious Cruelty" is disturbing and rewarding for all those who pass the shock in the adult themes of life, lust and madness. explore very worthy movie. CJ Goldman deserves kudos for his special make-up, just like David Kristian for the annoying sound design and Teruhiko Suzuki for the score.
