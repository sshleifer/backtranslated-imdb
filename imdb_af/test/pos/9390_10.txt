This film falls mainly in the kingdom of Lynch and Jodorowsky - with a particularly compelling atmosphere and the viewer dropping the dreamy intensity of his images. <br /> <br /> The narrative is being sought - the narrator is trapped behind a painting (beside the bed), which often speaks for it and calls out its desires and arguments. Yes, Beardsley will sound like that. <br /> <br /> There are some bugs, but its strengths overwhelm its weaknesses. The order in which the woman stretches herself out of bed and crawls over the floor, trying to escape, will leave you breathless. <br /> <br /> The film features a fin-de-siecle air over it; and should be read as a disarming cry of the 20th century's intestines. <br /> <br /> Find this movie and bay in it.
