Well, I think I was in the mood for a movie that got me from the beginning. This movie wasn't. It plowed for the first 40 minutes with a fairly slow, deliberate pace, but there wasn't really anything I was very interested in. There is an intriguing and mysterious feud between Jean Reno's character and an old man, but more of the first 40 minutes is dominated by the delusions of the main character, which I didn't know much about and couldn't really relate to then. no. He mostly wanders alone, he meets no one; I imagine the director was trying to portray the loneliness of the human condition in this post-apocalyptic world or something that is all right, but I still wish he'd cut it off from 40 minutes to 15 because it could be incredibly boring be. . <br /> <br /> But after those 40 minutes things get very interesting. I don't think I will say that anymore because I don't want to spoil anything. So if you've seen this movie for the first 15-30 minutes and think of switching it off (as I was), just stick to it. It gets much better. <br /> <br /> One of the most interesting things I found about this movie was the fact that it didn't have a dialogue at all. It really made me think about what happened, how characters felt and what their motivation was, why was it in this post-Pokaliptic world, all of which gives the story a lot of space for the interpretation of the audience. And it's amazing how much more a movie satisfies is when the actors don't tell you exactly what is going on.
