I don't have to repeat Glenn's summary. The black and white display is even stronger to portray the darkness of the landlord in that time. The deep degree of friendship Babette showed towards the two elderly sisters touches the heartbeat. The supporting role is excellent and their performances are fantastic. It would not be fair to portray one character, as the whole story depends on the role as a whole. I can't explain my finger exactly why I consider this movie so high, since I'm not a professional critic; individual viewers may or may not match my rating, as enjoyment of this type of film is always in the eye of the viewer.
