"Bon Voyage" has the fast pace that somehow reminds me of the Indiana Jones / Star Wars movies - it's like you're on a fast train or roller coaster. <br /> <br /> It's like a romance, mystery, thriller and farce; These are all and more, including frank observations on the reactions of French society during the Nazi invasion of World War II. And it is also an exhibition of juggling involving 7 main characters. All the actors were well-cast and had good performances, but IMO was the best by Isabelle Adjani who played the role of an opportunistic, self-centered French film star; Not only did she still convincingly play the role of a young actress, perhaps half her age, but she also convincingly played so convincingly that the public saw that she was only half serious and more complex than a person than just a gold digger. Her character and energy drives the film from start to finish. It was only when I read Roger Ebert's review that I discovered she was 48 at the time of the film. What a beauty !! <br /> <br /> I appreciated the end - it's satisfactory, but you can make your own conclusion about what happens to the main characters. <br /> <br /> As another user observed commentary - don't let it go; you must be there from the opening scene. Good advice. <br /> <br /> I gave it 9 out of 10.
