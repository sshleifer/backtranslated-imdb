Title: Opera (1987) Director: Dario Argento Cast: Cristina Masillach, Ian Charleson, Urbano Barberini, Daria Nicolodi Overview: The only other Argento movie I saw was Suspiria and one has me with his style, colors and ghostly story. I decided to go to Opera as I said it was one of his best. Man, I think I discover what will ultimately be one of my favorite horror directors. <br /> <br /> Opera is about a young opera singer who gets her big break as the star of a creepy modern opera. Mc Beth is hit by a car. Betty is the defendant so she can do the part herself. Bad to her, there is a psycho behind her that makes her watch over the brutal murders of her friends and co-workers. <br /> <br /> Wow, Id heard good things about this, but I wasn't prepared to get the level of greatness this movie would take me. Yes, the film has its shortcomings that I come to later. But for the most part, the movie blew me away. <br /> <br /> First, this movie is not so full of colors like Suspiria. I expected it to be a bit like suspiria in that department, but no, to my surprise it had its own appearance. The movie is somehow colorless. It has lots of colors in some scenes (like the masterful kitchen / lounge suite) where Argento fills the screen with green and green leaves, but the movie usually has a gray, black sound through and I like that it's its own distinctive had appeared. <br /> <br /> The right stars of this show are the incredibly well orchestrated death order. Wow. Every death scene was like a work of art. Beauty in destruction. This is not just your typical hack and slash series of deaths, but these deaths have been carefully constructed to shock and make the most of his situations. Raised every second of them, there is a lot of blood and chaos here, but with style. But I won't spoil it. <br /> <br /> Then there's the direction. Man, there are many original and beautiful shots on this one. I loved using the inventive camera on this one. You thought Tarantinos shot in Kill Bill. 1 Where did we see the bullet coming out of the gun room was original? Well, that's the movie he lifted it! I honestly believe that Tarantino was heavily influenced by this particular movie with some scenes in Kill Bill Vol. 1. Heck in making the function he mentions that the whole scene with Beatrix in hospital and Elle Driver who wanted to kill her was influenced by Italian Giallos, and here my friends are proof of that. Anyhow, Tarantino references aside, this movie has some fantastic camera shots, like the scenes of the crows flying in the crowd in the opera house ... good stuff. And a main reason why Argentos became one of my favorites. <br /> <br /> The play of most of the films was good, but best of all was Cristina Marsillach as the tortured young opera singer Betty. The body in her eyes as the murders were committed was wonderful. The rest of the roll was a little wood and stiff, but nothing that would deter your enjoyment of the movie. <br /> <br /> There were very few things I didn't have about this movie. First, the logic in some scenes was thrown out of the window. Especially for Betty's responses after seeing the killings. It seems to me for the longest time, she just went over her business and told no one of the whole thing. Not even the police. I mean if you see someone who brutally kills a loved one in front of your eyes ... you're not just walking away from the murder scene and going on with your life. Someone would have linked her with the murders. She might even have become a suspect herself ... but no. The end is also a bit anti-climax. You have to see it to understand, but it was a little unnecessary as the movie ended. It felt like it could end earlier. It would not have been so redundant. But that's about it, not really big problems for me, because I enjoy the rest of this beautiful movie. <br /> <br /> I still have plenty of Argento area to cover ... but I'm devoured every step of the way as if I ate a plate of the most expensive caviar. These guys are really good. I think of his films as works of art, and I only saw two of them! Can't wait to discover the rest of his films. Argento, you the man! <br /> <br /> Rating: 41/2 out of 5
