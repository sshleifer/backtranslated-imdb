I want to say that I absolutely loved campfire stories! For me it was one of the original horror flicks with a twisted end. As if the content of the movie was not scary or strange enough, you have the end. This is a fantastic movie and I'm so glad it was released on DVD on August 30th. I won't hesitate to get my copy on that day. I don't think the movie has received the credit or recognition, because all these other movies came out soon and was acknowledged, but if it wasn't my brother who told me about the movie, I wouldn't have known . What stinks because it is, in my opinion, much better than any "Scream", "I know what you did last Saturday or any other horror for that time. So I hope you can see the movie yourself and at least the difference I loved it, and was a horror movie junkie, Campfire Tales was like dessert to me!
