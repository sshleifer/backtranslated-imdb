007's Goldeneye is one of the best N64 releases ever. <br /> <br /> Better than this game? Well ... Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Episode I-Racer and Zelda Legend: Ocarina of Time is much better and better games. But I still love Goldeneye. <br /> <br /> This is the best adaptation of a movie second only to Star Wars adjustments. The story is perfect. It's like you're in the movie itself. <br /> <br /> The graphics are excellent. The movements are extremely realistic. The enemies' artificial intelligence is the best part of this game. I loved playing the stage in which James and Natalya break down from the Janus base if Goldeneye prepares to burn it. Escape without having to sound an alarm was very difficult. Owning cameras and controlling your fire are major aspects of the game. <br /> <br /> It's also the hardest game I've ever played. N64 games are usually very, very easy. Goldeneye is the one exception. I'm still beating the 00 Agent hard level, but winning the easier levels was already a big victory. I loved when Alec Trevelyan asked, "For England James?". I replied, "No, to ME!" It just happened when I shot him dead. Just like in the movie. I love reaching every goal. <br /> <br /> The multiplayer game is even better. Initially, I killed every holy second. Now I know how to win. I like to force my playmates by playing at License to Kill. <br /> <br /> The music and sound are amazing. Super Mario 64 looks like an Atari next to this. The only thing I still wanted to hear was the Goldeneye theme song that was playing at the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> After releasing Zelda, I almost forgot that I still had this game. It is still excellent, though it has already surpassed it. I hope other 007 games are being produced. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Work Rareware! Nintendo was very smart to abandon this game exclusively on the N64. Beautiful work Nintendo!
