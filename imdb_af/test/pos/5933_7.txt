The Royal Rumble is traditionally one of my favorite events, and I've been a wrestler for a few years. The other shows can have better matches, but I've always found the real rubbish game to be full of excitement. <br /> <br /> I'm not going to reveal the winners of any game, as I don't see. It is fair to destroy the results on a review. However, I will comment on the quality of their comments. <br /> <br /> We have the standard 4 games, and then the big rubbish event. Two of Smackdown and two of Raw. <br /> <br /> Shawn Michaels and Edge open to Raw. It seems to be a good game of two talented guys. This is a game I recommend to watch. It is difficult to summarize without giving away the winner. <br /> <br /> Next, we'll be the usual Undertaker against a big, big, nasty monster, who it is. Giant Gonzales, Yokozuna, Kamala. Well this time it is Heidenreich. It's also a coffin match. Typical Undertaker rate. See if you're a fan. I must admit that I am purely for the entertainment factor. It can hardly be considered a classic wrestling match. <br /> <br /> The next two games are the title matches. For once, Smackdown succeeds in raising Raw. Their title game is pretty exciting and enjoyable, but with an anti-climax and is slowing down. Raw's game is a rather boring and boring matter, which is a pity because I'm a fan of both guys. <br /> <br /> Now for the main reason, I love the event, the rumble. This is a pretty good one this year. So far, we all had a good idea of ​​who might win, and it shouldn't be a big surprise, but hey, it's very enjoyable. There are the usual diverse ways people are eliminated. There is the tokenman who does not make it to the ring, the participant who is ridiculous and we all want to disappear, and someone is eliminated by a previously eliminated fighter. It has its usual highlights and lows, and I loved the end, especially the entrance to Vince McMahon. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this show. Not the WWE on top form, but it's still good. Add it to your collection.
