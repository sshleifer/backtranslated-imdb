May contain Spoilers !!! In no way, form or shape does this movie break the horror movie form. Not by a long shot. However, it delivers a creepy atmosphere, credible characters and gore. <br /> <br /> The story is simple and doesn't save more than it needs. A lot of children died in a mine accident in the early 1900s. Since then, they have crammed and killed the hostel of their sleepy little town in the mountains. Simple: they want revenge on the man who caused their death years and years ago. Of course, his big, big grandson is in town and he's a real snare. <br /> <br /> In addition, a mother and her two daughters experience an old old house after the man's death. The eldest daughter is rebellious, stupid ... a typical teenager. The younger is curious, bright-eyed and comes in with the ghost children. <br /> <br /> The most eager part of this movie is the mere emotionality of the children and they make their way through the victim to the victim. Excellent acting. It was so haunting! I mean, the Children of the Crossbones are one thing ... but it covered some of those (like the creepy kids). <br /> <br /> Sausage and look. I bought it before I saw it and I wasn't unhappy. But I'm a horror fan through and through.
