So you think you've seen every Mafia movie ever made! Here is one that no one has ever heard of. It's a low-budget, fast-paced B-movie shot in Jersey swamps. For our mob-movie fans, it has a bit of everything - sex, violence, curse and wise guys acting like "gafones". While violence dominated the movie, I laughed at some well-known scenes I have seen on The Sopranos and Goodfellas ever since. Search for a 1977 version of the "Badabing Girls" in the beginning of the movie. <br /> <br /> All our favorite mobster stereotypes are found here. And, for realism, "fugettaboutit"! Joe Pesci was excellent and portrayed the classic way male character, as we have seen him, many times over the years. It was probably his first shot, and it was a jewel. Pesci fans have to run to the video store to watch this movie. You have to look carefully for it as it goes through different names. My copy called it the "Family Enforcer". Here it is known as "The Death Collector". But whatever name goes underneath, it should be called - a winner.
