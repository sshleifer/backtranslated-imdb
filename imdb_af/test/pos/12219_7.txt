What can I say? I got up this morning and switched on sci-fi and watched half of the first season and figured it all out. Strange, unusual and brilliant. It gives all potential, and to think first, I said it looks stupid. It should be the next best thing since X-Files, but as always, nothing will diminish the performance. I tell you, it's scary and then exciting and then soft. By the end, you have Miles as a love puppy with a strange pet that is a new species. You have two people running the authorities. And a killer tsunami will fall over! Wow! And did I mention Miles pet is a potential killer (though the rest of his species is). Surface is a brilliant display with spins and twists that deliver it all.
