This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother raised in a Christian environment and taught that appearance is everything. She and her son, who recently returned from Vietnam, clash with some very tense cases. The relationship has intimate connections and is a good accurate portrayal of how it is to live with someone who is false and just looks at the surface of issues. Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either unaware of her cruelty, forgetfulness or does not want to be confronted. Jeremy's wrath is never feared and it causes a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers love him. It is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads one to despair.
