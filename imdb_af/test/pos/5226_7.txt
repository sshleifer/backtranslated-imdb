Raoul Walsh's mega-epic, beautifully filmed in an early widescreen process by the great Arthur Edeson, can be slow and static in the early talkie way, but this classic wagon train journey across America to the North West is exciting as a physical production when viewed. on the big screen. At t.v. the lack of close-ups and distracted noise can be frightening. Young John Wayne easily writes in his first lead with a natural delivery that the rest of the cast can't recommend. Incredibly, the film has gone and Wayne spent most of the next decade in Grade B West Feed.
