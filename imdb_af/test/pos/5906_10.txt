In a genre by itself, this film has a limited audience and a close appeal, along with a subtle undertone that permeates the entire production. Nonetheless, this is a remarkable piece of cinema that is just as timeless as a rare artwork. The action of a time in Quebec, rarely seen in movies, lies in the depth of its characters and the wealth of institutions. Duplessis' Quebec, parish and feudal, have been brilliantly cast as the backdrop that might not be reached by anyone other than a pure Laine Quebec. <br /> <br /> It will be far too easy to put stereotypes, clich√©s and single-minded mitopic statements in this story. Yet, the director chose to skip the forced footage and instead focused on the essence of life in rural Quebec of the time. This makes this movie exceptional in its authenticity while it is not beneficial in its presentation. If only more contemporary films do the same, the viewing public may not be forced to choose among the overheated Hollywood Pablum passing for 'Must See'. <br /> <br /> Mon Oncle Antoine is - in every sense of the word - unforgettable. It will be a lasting impression on anyone who has ever lived - or visited - Quebec. A classic. ****************************************** <br /> <br /> Follow-up: May 10, 2008 <br /> <br /> After watching some of the comments, it's worth seeing. Antoine is NOT - and probably not the intention to serve as a standard Hollywood / American theater. mass market sales. An upcoming life story, yes, but much more than simple memoirs of adolescence in the 1940s Quebec. Viewers looking for pure entertainment at the expense of the complex development of the characters will be very disappointed. Check out action / adventure / romance / comedies to be amused. Watch Mon on Antoine to be drawn to a rarely seen but absolutely remarkable society that has been overlooked and ignored for too long. <br /> <br /> The Grapes of Revenge is hardly a zipper-of-the-seat, but the story and characters are what make this American classic a lasting movie. Monday Antoine is in the same genre.
