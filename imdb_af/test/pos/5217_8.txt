He is very good at this role as an indignant and bored man, an ornate air force officer who gets bored with his predictable suburban life and decides to make a radical change. <br /> <br /> One night he met Karen Sillas, an attractive woman younger than his current wife. A relationship develops, and Cole decides to take it to the next level. <br /> <br /> Not only does he have a relationship, he lapses his death to escape his family's obligations. Lies are becoming more and more of a pattern when he begins to rob banks to keep his new wife (Sillas) happy and produce the image that he is a success. A fictitious deception, apparently. <br /> <br /> It was also based on a true story that made it more interesting. Cole is credible and excellent in these roles. Recommended. 8/10.
