"The belief in the Great Other as an invisible power structure that exists in the Real is the most concise definition of paranoia." ?? Slave Zizek <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> This is a review of Marathon Man and The Falcon and the Snowman, two films by director John Schlesinger. <br /> <br /> Although Hitchcock and Lang are the "Conservative thriller" to Hollywood, the genre only grew in the late 60's and 70's, with films like "The Parallax View", "Z", "Marathon Man", "Capricorn One", "The Manchurian Candidate", "Three Days of the Condor" and "All The President's Men". It was the age of Vietnam and Watergate, the public deeply suspicious of all political leaders. <br /> <br /> The genre fell silent in the 80s and early 90s until the TV series "X Files" was born. With taglines such as "The Truth Is Out There" and "Trust No One", the series has set a world of great conspiracies and government plots, the common man for the grace of all ways of ridiculously extended schemes. The only way out of the maze? "Fight the future!" as the tournament of the series' final season proclaim. It was obviously our duty to trawl through the labyrinth of information, to discover an elusive "truth" that ensured our own freedom. <br /> <br /> This trend ended with the boom of the internet, conspiracy staff now giving a "conspiracy documentary program". The internet generation picked up such independent documentaries as "Los Change" and "Zeitgeist", while Michael Moore listed his audience with things like "Fahrenheit 9/11". All of these documentaries believed in a "secret order", a riot of rich politicians and businessmen who were conservatives to reduce human rights and addiction to the world. They struggle to create a mono-myth, linking several conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single, all-encompassing story that explains the purpose and point and future of everything. <br /> <br /> It should make a story easier, making them more "effective" is reflected in the scientific community struggling to create a "Grand Unification Theory" and eventually a "Theory of Everything" ", which merges everything from Quantum Mechanics to Special Relativity into a giant comprehensive formula. /> <br /> In the end, the "conspiracy player" is rooted in man's desire to have control. The modern subject is one that actually shows cynicism towards official institutions, but at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies (an invisible others pulling the strings). This seemingly contradictory link between cynicism and faith is strictly related to the downfall of the great Other. The disappearance causes us to build another of the Other (conspiracy) to escape the unbearable freedom that causes his loss. Conversely, it is not necessary to take the Great Others seriously if we believe in another of the others. We can therefore display cynicism and faith in equal measures. <br /> <br /> Man therefore seeks control over a reciprocal universe, creating a kind of paternal babysitter (whether it be God, a mathematical formula, a conspiracy theory, an explanation for violence / conspiracy / murder / war etc.) giving meaning and symbolic order. The Great Others offer reassurance to the believer. It is a "lifestyle choice", similar to religion, in which its place in the world depends on mere irrationality. <br /> <br /> The problem with most "conspiracy player", from the innocent days of Hitchcock's Topaz to the modern price like the Da Vinci code, is two folds. First, it is not wrong to suggest that something is "wrong" among the "elite" or "best people", but they are wrong to personalize and personalize in social and collective and systemic processes, an approach that implies that it is just a matter of personal morality rather than social structures. Secondly, and above all, these "conspiracies" ignore the fact that the Great Other simply does not exist. There is no symbolic order to draw the strings. Some modern "conspiracy drivers" ("Eyes Wide Shut", "Existenz" etc.) recognize this with their inexorable webs of lies, accidents, truths, and half truths, nothing that ever picks up, nothing that ever makes sense, the real and the hyperreal, the truth and the desire, all vague, without any identifiable ground, but these are mostly films by intellectual directors. <br /> <br /> Compared to these modern "conspiracy player", "Marathon Man" and "The Falcon and the Snowman" is positive archaic. "Marathon Man" is about a graduate student (Dustin Hoffman) who gets involved in his big brother's business (Roy Scheider), who unfortunately has to deal with spies, guns, double agents, diamonds and evil Nazi dentists. Separator is suave, Hoffman is excellent and Schlesinger hits us with some neat visual art (revealing the Eiffel Tower is beautiful), but what's most interesting about the movie is the way his different plot lines don't cross to the 1 hour point. Even then, it takes half an hour for things to make sense. Unfortunately, the movie ends with a cliché picture between the villain and the good man, everything is neatly resolved and explained. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> is a bit more ambitious. Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the Soviet Union. Hutton works at a civil defense contractor and smuggles information from his office and into the hands of Penn, a small drug dealer who has not sold the KGB. Penn does it rigorously for the money, while Hutton is disillusioned with the US government (especially his attempt to deposit the leader of Australia) and so sells the secret strictly because he hates how his country plays crimes and espionage games. In other words, the film is about a conspiracy undertaken as a response to conspiracies. <br /> <br /> "Marathon Man" ?? 7.9 / 10 <br /> <br /> "The Falcon and the Snowman" ?? 8/10 <br /> Apart from a strange slapstick car accident and its clichéd ending, "Marathon Man" is an effective thriller, with several neat scenes. "The Falcon and the snowman" are even better, Penn turns into an unforgettable performance.
