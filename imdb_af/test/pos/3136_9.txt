This little picture succeeds in where many fail a great picture. Because it was a small picture, John Ford was not harassed by the studio. He was happier with this movie than any other because he could do it. He was also able to use his repertoire of gifted character characters who played such an important role in his past successes. Some of them, like Ben Johnson, have been discovered by Ford and given the opportunity to show their talents. Johnson was recruited by Ford because he was an authentic cowboy from Oklahoma who usually did his own stunt work. Years later, he will win the prestigious Oscar award for his brilliant performance in "The Last Picture Show." Ward Bond even raises Ben Johnson in this movie. He is not the wagon master, but Johnson plays this role, but as a result of this movie he is later the role of wagon master in the classic television series "Wagon Train". Ironically, one of the bad guys in "Wagon Master", James Arness, in the hit series "Gunsmoke" on a competitive network to Wagon Train would die. Ward Bond plays the leader of the Mormons who are west, who often fall back on his sinful days by just crying by Mr. Adam Perkins (Russell Simpson) invited. When a troublesome situation arises, older Wiggs (Ward Bond) shouts, "Blow your horn, Sister Ledeyard!" The grandmother's sister, played perfectly by Jane Darwell, blows so loud and loud that even the devil must be shaken by the sound. Darwell and Simpson were known for playing Ma and Dad Joad in Ford's classic version of the John Steinbeck novel "The Druids of Wrath." <br /> <br /> Another of the great character players in Ford's company was Hank Worden, who plays one of Uncle Shiloh Clegg's infamous intentions, but not too bright, is the death of children. Will be known a few years later to play Moses in Ford's "The Searchers". Being 91. He still made movies when he died. <br /> <br /> Wagon master Travis Blue (Ben Johnson) and his partner Sandy (Harry Carey Jr.) are horse traders who never take their jobs seriously, with lots of fun along the way, especially with the local sheriff. They are mixed with a Mormon wagon train heading west. Ford's beloved Monument Valley is the setting for most of the movie. The main reason for the teamwork is a redhead Mormon beauty Prudence Perkins (Kathleen O'Malley) who catches Sandy's eye. Along the way, the train gets a hoochie coochie show that includes a charlatan doctor (Alan Mowbray) and two dirty angels (Joanne Dru and Ruth Clifford). Also with the Clegg family, who are willing for murder and armed robbery. Ford shows how difficult a journey west with wagon was in those days. <br /> <br /> The songs in the film are written by Stan Jones of the legendary Sons of the Pioneers. Jones's writing was almost as good as that of Bob Nolan, who had previously done much of the writing for the group. Jones's best-known song, not in this movie, is the much-recorded "Ghost Riders In The Sky." The Boys of the Pioneers do the background in "Wagon Master". This contributes to the overall impact of wagons rolling westwards. <br /> <br /> It should also be noted that well-known native American athlete Jim Thorpe of Oklahoma plays the role of a Navajo leader. It was his last movie appearance. He didn't die long after "Wagon Master" was released.
