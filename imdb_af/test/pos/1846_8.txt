This particular movie was one I wanted to see in theaters, but never worked on it. When I finally rented it out in the summer of 2001, I enjoyed it so much that I bought out the DVD soon. Bonnie Hunt and Don Lake have done a wonderful job with the screenplay and are great to listen to the audio commentary on the DVD. They did a good job of creating characters that you really care about. I really have a whirlwind feeling of emotion that this movie has seen, including sadness, anxiety and joy. The film also does a good job of showing the importance of family (a rarity in the film today), which is reflected by the director, Bonnie Hunt, based on the comments she made on the DVD. David Duchovny showed me here that there is a life outside Fox Mulder that offers a great show with some beautiful, spectacular scenes. I recommend viewing this movie. I am very grateful to the creators of this film. They gave me a wonderful movie show I would recommend to all my friends. I have seen many movies over the years and it is very rare that I get such a feeling of satisfaction after watching a movie. I'll watch this time and time again for the coming year. Back to Me reminds me that there are still filmmakers who know how to sincerely be their film audiences. Thank you !!
