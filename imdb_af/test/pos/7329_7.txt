I was quite surprised to see the low rating this movie received here, personally considering it fun family money. It's about a young teenager, Sandy Ricks, sent by his mother to Coral Key to spend the summer with his uncle Porter. While befriending a dolphin named Flipper. Many adventures come amid the predictable cousin as well as a small romance for Sandy with a local girl. <br /> <br /> I'm a great Crocodile Dundee fan, but I absolutely loved Paul Hogan in his role as Corsican and comic Uncle Porter. To begin with, he keeps an endless supply of Spaghetti O's in his home to serve as his usual meal, warming up with a rocket! Elija Wood, Frodo of The Lord of the Rings, has become quite capable of playing the young Sandy. A boy was initially not too fond of his forced summer holiday environment. <br /> <br /> Of course, the dolphin is beautiful and there are some wonderful underwater scenes. In the Florida Keys, it was apparently filmed in the Bahamas. This adaptation of Flipper makes great family entertainment, a lovely, sentimental and fun movie that is one day better than many of the films for young people.
