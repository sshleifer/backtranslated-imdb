If you like Gary Cooper, it's one of his best roles. His gentle intensity to correct the wrong is what made his career. "Blayde Hollister" comes to Dallas to take revenge against Will and Brian Malowe, who burned his Georgia farm and killed his family. Inept Marshall gets Hollister's way of arresting him when he is interrupted by a street shoot between Hollister and Wild Bill Hickock. The shooting was staged to get Hollister's law, and he took the "back-east" Marshall under his wing to keep him alive in Texas, as their identity changed. <br /> <br /> It was a good start, and the picture goes all the way. Action can be a bit slow according to today's standards, but it is one of my top 10 favorite movies.
