Ok I'm a big Traci fan so she's just in the movie, automatically making it to the 8.5+ rating. But even as if she were in it, I thought it was a good movie, especially because it was a HBO movie. But I'm afraid if you get Traci out of the movie, it'll be fine. But one cannot do that she is and she is a wonderful actress. She just keeps getting better and better.
