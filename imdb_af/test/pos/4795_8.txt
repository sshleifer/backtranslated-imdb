Spanish director Luis Buñuel's career played almost 50 years from 1929 to 1977. His best films were probably those he made during his exile in Mexico - from the late forties to the early 60s. There he had to deal with very cheap budgets and work in an industry that is primarily interested in making commercial movies into unsophisticated audiences. Yet, he somehow managed to make interesting, thought-provoking movies that endured the test of time. This movie is based on a novel by Spanish writer Benito Perez Galdos - and the adaptation is pretty faithful, even though the environment is early in the 20th century, Mexico instead of early 20th century, Spain. The lead role, Nazarin, is a priest who tries to live a life that is so faithful as it can be to the one prescribed by Christ. The question that many would ask is whether such an endeavor would be possible, without having to do with the hostility, misunderstanding and mockery of your fellow human beings. As it happens, he has a lot of indignation, but he stays stubborn (to the controversial final shot) to this end. I think Buñuel wanted to show Nazarin as a somewhat ridiculous figure, but perhaps his stubbornness (at least to this viewer) is so admirable. Anyway, a good movie.
