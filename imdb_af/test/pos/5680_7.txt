The basic piece of this film has already been set out in several other remarks so I won't bother. I would like to recommend the producer, film, directors and crew for creating a wonderful movie with a meager $ 1M budget, a small fraction of standard Hollywood price that doesn't look cheap. These people have a drive to make something new and entertaining while not spending a fortune. It is mainly art for the sake of art. I know, I know, some of you will decide that it is not art, but something less and it is good. I am delighted that people like this will continue to bring the time and effort to our benefit without expecting a large multimillion dollar to be paid out. <br /> <br /> Now to the criticism. I feel that the scenario offered is credible to a point. It's great when everything works out and the hero / heroine saves the day and everything is good that ends well. What gets me is the blatant manipulation of events, so that blind happiness is more than courage and power. <br /> <br /> When lee was attacked but not seriously injured, she somehow washed a mudflat right next to the dead guide. Then wonderfully, his loaded revolver is still in his holster and it actually works (after some cleaning and fiddling). Finally, when Lee is attacked on the mudflats and jumps into the water, the crocodile gets killed again. She ends up with her hand in his (her?) Mouth and control to pull the trigger repeatedly, eventually blowing out the crocus's brain (literally). <br /> <br /> I came to the conclusion that Lee went hand in hand with the crocus was just a way to end the movie with man in triumph. On the basis of what I saw, the crocus's attack and continued until the prey stops struggling. Crocus's will turns around to push and prey on the prey. This happened to the first 3 victims, but not to Lee. She had teeth, but they were not deep. <br /> <br /> I think the end would have been better if the crocus were honest, proving its dominance of the mangrove, its area for millions of years. But then, how many of us would have been upset or disappointed that the pretty girl didn't live?
