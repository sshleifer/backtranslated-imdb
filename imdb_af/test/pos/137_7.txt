Anything that creates Park Chan Wook is guaranteed to be unique, brilliant, and very twisted to a minimum. Well, anything that doesn't, I'm at least a Cyborg. Park's latest movie titled Thirst is a vampire romance-erotic-thriller-dark comedy drama? Yes, they are very adjectives ?? inspired by the 19th century French novel by Emile Zola entitled Therese Raquin. Park creates a unique Korean and unique Park, a vision of the vampire mites and asks the audience to explore the dilemma of a Catholic priest and discover that he has a thirst for blood and the moral and spiritual crisis that will develop . Park delivers the elements you would hope for, but certainly no more than masterpiece quality like Oldboy or even that of Lady Vengeance. Heavily inflated with a story that often loses itself, Dors urgently needs another journey through the cutting room. It crawls when it needs to run, but fortunately it returns home before the audience is completely lost. As negative as it may sound, the positive is definitely bigger than the negative and another volume is undoubtedly added to the dark and twisted Zeitgeist of Park Chan wook. <br /> <br /> Check out the rest of our review at www.thefilmstage.com
