Having seen NAKED CITY and NIGHT AND THE CITY (which is still my favorite Dassin), I was more than excited to see his "Masterpiece" (O-Word Criterion) RIFIFI. <br /> <br /> Now I'm a little disappointed about the story. <br /> <br /> So I have at least these five questions in my mind: <br /> <br /> 1. In the last Countdown Louis Grutter shot the inside of a house Character Tony le Stephanois . He doesn't know if he's still alive or not, but he doesn't mind and then runs straight outside the house (with the money) to reach his car. Of course Tony wasn't dead and he shot him. GREAT QUESTION. <br /> <br /> 2. In another important scene, the specialist in Cesar's vault directly after the robbery as a gift to a diamond ring (which was part of the robbery) A woman in charge of Louis Grutter worked a nightstand. Mute, because before this character it was not stupid. And of course Louis knew directly that Tony was planning the jewel robbery. SMALL QUESTION MARKET. <br /> <br /> 3.After the gangsters behind Louis Grutter's murder, Mario Ferrati and his wife, Tony and his best friend Joe took revenge against Louis gang. At the same time, they don't care about the safety of Joe's wife and his five-year-old child. Of course, Louis kidnapped the boy. START AND SIMPLE. <br /> <br /> 4. The perfect hoist: Of course, it's best 30min. long scene throughout the plot, without any word spoken in the whole time, but was it a perfect hoist ?? Compared to other movies dealing with this theme, I could only smile when Tony, for example, took a fire extinguisher to ban the alarm. Also too simple. <br /> <br /> 5. The Grutter gang went to Mario's house because they knew (but ....) the gems would be there. Then they kill Mario and his wife. And then? They are not looking for it! NO. They ran straight from the apartment. And more. They don't see the apartment afterwards, so Tony can go inside after a while (which same day) to take the jewelry. GREAT QUESTION MARKET. <br /> <br /> About everything: it's a good movie. Due to the brilliant 30 minute silence scene. Because of the very good cut (The final stage in the car by Paris is amazing). Due to a very good actor named Jean Servais. As a result of this black / white fever, you will get it while you watch it. For other reasons, other users also wrote, but please do not tell me this is a beautiful story.
