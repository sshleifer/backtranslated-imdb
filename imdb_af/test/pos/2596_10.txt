Chuck Jones' Rabbit Seasoning, the second in the much-loved hunting trilogy, is often considered the best of the three. While I find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, I have to admit that 'Rabbit Seasoning' is the most delicate one. Here, the emphasis is on language such as Bugs and Daffy running through a series of complex dialogues in the great tradition of Abbot and Costello's 'Who's on next' routine. As a long-term Daffy fan, I have always been thrilled with the hunting trilogy because it is consistently Daffy who gets all the best lines (the well-known "Pronoun trouble" is one of the all-time classics) and does most of the work. Bugs play the role of a cool manipulator, while Elmer, as always, is the frozen thrust. Part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that Daffy and Elmer have so little threat to Bugs that he basically just kicks back and plays with some easy moves. Elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him, but it is poor old Daffy who comes worst, again and again in his face, his beak ends in more and more ridiculous positions. It all builds on the inevitable climate statement "You are contemptuous". As an example of Chuck Jones' impeccable timing as you come, Rabbit Seasoning is a real classic.
