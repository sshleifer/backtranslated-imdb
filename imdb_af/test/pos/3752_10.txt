The main reason I loved this movie is because IMx (formerly Immature) was in it. They were in House Party 3 when they were 11, but they all grew up! I was a little shocked by some of the things they did in the movie (almost ready to tear my hair out), but I had to realize they were not my little boys. I think Chris Stokes did a good job as it was his first movie.
