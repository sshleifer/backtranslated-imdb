Some may think Imaginary Heroes is a movie exactly like "Igby Goes Down", but it's not. In Imaginary Heroes, the director makes us feel like the Travis family and the people around them. <br /> <br /> The movie itself is great, and the play is done extremely well. Weaver and Hirsch's play is credible and helps to make the movie what it is. The actors, director / writer, Dan Harris, made a movie that many people should see. Don't think it's just another teen movie, it's a family movie and their problems. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie a 10/10 because I believe it's not the best movie, no movie can be, but the closest to it is perfect.
