For all those who are confused about the length and fitting of this movie (such as, why does he show spaceships for example 15 minutes?), Here's a word you might want to think about: <br /> <br /> Beauty. <br /> <br /> Beauty is an under-rated concept. Certainly, you will often see nice pictures and so on in movies. But when did you last see a movie that contains beauty just for the sake of it? There is a strange belief among moviegoers that anything that is not plot or character related should be removed. It's depressed. There is nothing wrong with creating a beautiful series that has nothing to do with the movie's plot. A director can for no reason show 15 minutes of spacecrafts as they are beautiful, and it is also not illegal or evil to do so. <br /> <br /> '2001' requires you to look differently than you normally watch movies. It requires you to relax. It requires you to experience strange and beautiful images without feeling guilty that there is no complex plot or detailed characterization. Don't get me wrong, plots and characters are good, but they're not the best and everything's all. There are different kinds of film, and to enjoy '2001' you have to fit your brain to a different wavelength and be swayed for the pleasure of beauty, clean beauty, unmanned by the banal conventions of everyday movies. <br /> <br /> "All art is pretty useless" - Oscar Wilde.
