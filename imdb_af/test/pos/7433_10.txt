OMG !!! Have you ever thought they would make a movie about it? Well, I knew they wanted to, but I didn't know when !! and now it's finally here !!! when I received it by mail yesterday, I placed it in my (evil) stereo playing DVDs and grabbed this huuuuuuuuuuge on my face as cloud appeared (look good .... beautiful !!) and they other fascinating characters from the final fantasy game! including tifa and aeris, my favorites .... (they are also nice in this) the graphics knock me out !!!! they were really wonderful. so actually up to the last hair !!! The story line is OK, a bit confusing, especially since my version of the movie was in Japanese, but of course - a long final fantasy fanatic - I didn't mind - I just read the captions !!! all the characters speak as they would in the game, and reno and rude are still ridiculous. The dragon scene is also angry. look so good !!! anyway .... the graphics were fantastic .... the storyline, fantastic .... and the basic idea to even have a ff7 movie ....... genius !!!
