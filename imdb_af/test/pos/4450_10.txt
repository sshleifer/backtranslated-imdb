I saw this movie five times and never get tired of it. These features trace the general "giallo", but also with a lively Italian rural environment where ignorance and superstition are more deadly than any serial killer. With an excellent location (sometimes reminiscent of Fellini, sometimes of the Taviani brothers), good characterization and some of the best genre actors (including the great Tomas Milian and Ida Lupino in an unforgettable role), it is NOT euro trash , just a masterpiece It must be discovered generation after generation. (It was recently praised by the Paris Cinematheque at a double tribute to Lucio Fulci)
