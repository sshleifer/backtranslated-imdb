... don't like this movie and everyone will understand why. The plot is poor, so is the play. But in my opinion, it is better than Halloween 5, although it doesn't even give very surprising moments. A few scenes are really well aimed. But these few moments don't give the reason to rent it. I do not despise violence in movies, but H6 has extraordinarily strong and bloody scenes that do not fit the Halloween movie tradition. The most sucking aspect of H6 is the lack of tension. No comparison with the first masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Halloween 6 only gets 4 out of 10 stars from me. If you like, rent it. But don't expect a great horror experience. <br /> <br />
