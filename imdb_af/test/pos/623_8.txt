Superbly crafted low-budget thriller with more turns and turns than you can shake a stick, and also a lot of humorous humor on the go. <br /> <br /> The role-play plays it very well, although Richards's self-centered film director is sometimes difficult to take. The little two scene came by Sir Alec Guinness, who radiates the threat of Moscow's ssar crime, is simply the icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> It's worth repeating, but not on dark nights if you're not quite alone!
