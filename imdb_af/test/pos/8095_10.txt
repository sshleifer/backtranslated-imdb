Although I haven't seen it yet, I know that Chaplin is a genius, and only one of his talent will continue this brave subject - a comedy about Hitler. All the great satire is based on going out on a rim. Also, all good comedies deal with the other side - pathos. This movie looks like it's both sides going to dress. Like Kubrick's dr. Strangelove, trading the Great Dictator about history through the distorted lens of satire. The only way to deal with the horrors of this world is to laugh at it. And hopefully, by laughing, we can learn to see the world in a new light. Another movie that does this comes into my eyes to Emir Kusturica's Underground, and Fando And Lis. So, let me first watch the movie.
