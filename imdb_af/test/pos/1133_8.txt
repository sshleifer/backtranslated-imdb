I recently stumbled upon this show when the ABC family had an everyday marathon before season 2 first presented. I remember seeing the previews for the show in 2007, and thought it would be short-lived, and not very well written, because it was on ABC family. <br /> <br /> Never doubt an ABC family program! This show surprised me in the best possible way. Not only is the show well written, story lines are realistic, funny and enjoyable. I talked a lot about relationships, something like "this guy dated that girl who plunged me to that child ... etc." But this show is nothing else! The characters are attractive and you really feel a connection between them all. There is a lot of chemistry between the actors and they can really make you feel that things are right in front of your eyes. <br /> <br /> Don't doubt this show, it's really enjoyable to watch. and become addicted;)
