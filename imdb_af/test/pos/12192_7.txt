Despite the pans of the judges, I like this movie. In fact, I donated it better as Maintenance with a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt. All the major players of the series were present: Talbot, Lestat, Armand, Maharet, Khayman, Pandora, Mael, Marius and half a dozen more (although most in cameo). Marius, Lestat and Akasha were the main players (and Jesse of the Talamasca). Also, despite other reviews, I think this movie and the music was true to Anne Rice's depiction and ethos, at least as I see it. Aailiyah was pretty good like Akasha, in compelling places (her first entry and mini dance scene). The film did not capture the breadth of the book series, but I thought it was a good addition. <br /> <br /> I'm a big fan of this series, mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivity and treatments. And I found this movie a faithful and often superlative representation of the writer's vision.
