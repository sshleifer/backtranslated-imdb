As many of today's movies are guilty, the plot isn't actually sterile, the movie doesn't move anyone and it certainly won't justify an award (outside Blockbusters) ... but then again, who really cares. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy and Robert De Niro team to produce a very funny, sometimes hilarious, movie I really enjoy. Russo and Shatner also played their small parts. Man, I hope in the future that my wife as well as me. Renee did. <br /> <br /> It moves together, this "friend" head movie produces high lag in a reasonable amount of time. The movie is enjoyable to avoid the video / DVD release and to do so earlier. <br /> <br /> Eddie Murphy is on his regular top form and is really nice to watch. De Niro poured perfectly into this kind of roll. <br /> <br /> I really enjoy this movie and think that any real movie lover who needs a good movie or just likes a good laugh. Showtime. <Br /> <br /> Top Performance: Murphy. Hilarious. Enough said. Director: Nice. Fun action scenes, use Murphy and De Niro together as a charm, Russo nourished in a nice supportive work. <br /> <br /> My rating: 7 out of 10. It's not going to move you, but it's a very enjoyable movie. <br /> <br /> It's Showtime ... was a great success.
