It was one of the few Norwegian films I actually looked forward to. It started out as a couple of ads with a moody bunch at soccer matches. Then they made a movie out of it. The clues are not benefits (and you can see), but they are still doing a very good job and the movie has broken me all away. <br /> <br /> Norway is known for making crazy movies (no offense), but I had a good feeling about this one. Even you don't have interest in football, I wanted 2 to see it. The story is much better than expected and the laugh just stops. There are numerous cameos from Norwegian celebrities and players. The characters are well portrayed and you feel for them. If you ever see GONNA a Norwegian movie. Let it be!
