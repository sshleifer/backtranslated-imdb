One of the best known of all movie series! Still interesting today, though it does have an "old movie". The second series looks better but is simply not the same. Actors have a good time, especially Middleton and Lipson. Great editing by the Universal Expert Crew. The musical score was tracked by Universal's "Destination Unknown", "The Invisible Man", "The Black Cat" and "Werewolf or London". And what great action music was it! If there was a choice for the best range of the best time, it should (probably) be # 1.
