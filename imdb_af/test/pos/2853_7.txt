Ren√© Zellweger is a Kansas housewife, whose dominant husband is mixed in drug trafficking. Two professional men, Morgan Freeman and his son, Chris Rock, killed the man in his dining room. Zellweger, who is not seen by the killers, testifies to this and undergoes a dissociative reaction, assuming that the personality of a nurse - the eponymous Betty - is a character in her favorite soap. She believes she is the TV character, Zellweger pulls in her husband's car, which has a little dope in the suitcase, and travels to LA where she hopes to connect with another character in this incessant afternoon drama. "Dr. David Ravell," Greg Kinnear. Not realizing she was being pursued by the two hits, she drove to LA where she could call Kinnear and was actually written in the show as a nurse named Betty. A handful of men in the know, including the local sheriff, stuck to what is happening and are also looking for Zellweger in LA. The end is credible and attractive. <br /> <br /> If it looks crazy, it's because it's. And this is the author's responsibility, John C. Richards. The curious thing is that Richards and director Neil Labute, with great help from the artists, are just about everything. It's not a plot that has been thrown into a familiar shape. Nope. I give it bonus points for pure originality. Someone went out on a limb. Somebody threw a chance on a movie that was NOT a copy or reminder of something that earned money ten or fifty years ago. I imagine the people involved every night, on their knees, fervently. I don't know if the movie was remunerative, but it's mostly successful on its own aesthetic terms. <br /> <br /> That's what an initial premium movie can be called. You start with a single transforming event, in this case killing Zellweger's husband and adopting a truly new personality, and following the resulting logical paths realistically. "Groundhog Day" is another, better and more complicated example. "Nurse Betty" has his logical cracks, where the incidents give their likelihood. For example, at a festival in LA, Zellweger eventually runs into Kinnear, the guy who plays her former fiancee on TV. She's stunned (because she thinks she's Betty, who lost her fiancee long ago). She approaches Kinnear and some of his colleagues and introduces herself as "Nurse Betty", the character. She addresses Kinnear with the name of his TV character, "David Ravell." The group was first confused and convinced that she was an aspiring actress who insisted on "being in character" during the conversation - and afterwards, after Kinnear was fascinated by her and the others got bored. Kinnear drives her home and even when she chooses, she is still in character. Kinnear is overwhelmed by surprise. She fixed Betty's character. On the next day, Kinnear returns her love. The development, the relationship between Zellweger and Kinnear at this point is a lack of logic, the kind that is absent from "Groundhog Day." By the end of Night One, Kinnear, like any other person, will realize that Zellweger is a few clowns short of a circus. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie, which includes many deviations, exceeds expectations. The relationship between Morgan Freeman and his insolent, nihilistic son is splendidly spelled out. Morgan is flawless in his excitement. He manages to fall in love with the image of Zellweger, as he unleashes clues for her accommodation and activities, and in the end he cannot shoot himself to shoot her. She's too sweet to shoot. After her transformation in Betty she left a letter in Kansas. "I want to help everything, whether animal, plant or mineral." Who can stop the writer of such a deadly song? His admiration comes as an epiphany, as he stands near one of the fire lights at the edge of the Grand Canyon. Zellweer, dressed as Dorothy, or maybe the Good Witch of the East. Well, characters that, like Zellweger, are from Kansas anyway - appear to Freeman and he embraces her and kisses her. It's a scene that's at once ominous, romantic, and a bit spooky. I once stood at one of those lights and threw a piece of torn paper out of the dark canyon and surrounded me by a thousand swirling bats that misperceived the float drops as moth. <br /> <br /> Reg. Where was I? Okay. I tried not to run out of space. Zellweger's performance deserves plaudits. Everything she does, every move, every statement, is naive and preliminary. She is really a nice character - and this despite the fact that she is not a glamor girl by Hollywood standards. But - what an actress. Compare her performance with the poverty of the 19th century in "Cold Mountain." Just the opposite. But then everyone is sniffing in this enjoyable movie. Allyson Jannings does a good job in a small role. Look at her when she tells Greg Kinnear that she is considering killing his character in the soap in a drowning accident in the soap operation. Kinnear is one of those daffodils wearing the kind of ten thousand dollar thin black leather jackets that was popular at the time. He cries and says, "Oh, one of those castaway deals, right? Okay, how am I going back?" Jannings didn't answer. She just smiled at him with those big blue eyes and mocked her head. <br /> <br /> Not a masterpiece of movie recording, but a good, original, professional work by everyone involved.
