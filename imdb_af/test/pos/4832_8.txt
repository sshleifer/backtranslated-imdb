To finally get the DVD of this 1997 HBO movie is to see it. By the time I finished it, the old saying "those who can't learn from the past, doomed to relive it" echoed in the mind. First show four years after the first bombardment of twin towers (and four years before the events of 9/11) Road to Paradise reveals the series of close encounters, blunders and official decisions that led to the first bombardment of twin towers and the lessons we learned from them. <br /> <br /> Path To Paradise offers good role players of credible actors. Peter Gallagher and Marcia Gay Harden lead the role of FBI agents John Anticev and Nancy Floyd, who not only face the threats of terrorism, but the lack of official interest from their superiors with their NYPD counterpart Lou Napoli ( Paul Guilfoyle). Art Malik, Andreas Katsulas, Shaun Toub and Tony Gillan are among those who plan and execute the attack, all who do not play their role as potential cliches, but make real-life people and make the movie better for it. Of particular mention is Ned Eisenberg as Emad Salem the man who, if not for skeptical FBI officials, might have informed the plot. <br /> <br /> The film is also well-produced. Despite being made for cable, this movie doesn't feel like a low-budget movie, with its production values, especially in its sets and New York City venues. The film's fascinating cinematography gives the film an almost documentary style. When all of these elements are combined with the text, it helps to give the film a sense of reality that takes place, all the more disturbing. <br /> <br /> The most disturbing thing about his movie is his writing. The events of the film are true (minus a dramatic license that is always needed) and afterwards even more shocking, they must have been when the film was first shown twelve years ago. The film reveals just how a group of men could smuggle a bomb into the World Trade Center. They have done so, due to the lack of Arabic translators, government agencies that do not give information to each other, the FBI does not suggest that a source and police departments cannot pick up clues. Worse than the investigators' inability to connect patches, the fact that many of these things did not only allow the attacks of 9.11, but in some cases (such as the lack of translators) are problems that still persist today. Even more chilling is the end that really happened and looks too prophetic today. <br /> <br /> Path to paradise is a movie that needs to be essential today. Not only did the film perform well and produced it, but it teaches us a lesson that we had to learn earlier. The lesson of the movie? That those who cannot learn from the past are doomed to revive it. If you can find this movie, look and learn from it.
