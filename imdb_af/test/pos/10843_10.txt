The BBC has surpassed itself with the boundaries they crossed with Tipping the Velvet. In the past, they were "brave" with Dennis Potter's works, but this mini-series (as it was selected in the UK) is excellent. What's more, Andrew Davies's work is. I didn't read the Sarah Water's novel, but I can imagine he did it fairly. I comment on the inconvenience - most men watched it. It was an important talk and sales point when it was originally advertised. The fact is that it depicted the lesbian side of society in the 1800s - a time when most thought it was old men and renting boys - well, it was - Lesbianism occurred mainly behind closed and often respected doors. <br /> <br /> You can also look at Tipping The Velvet as a 'love story' - it's actually - as well as 'self-discovery' that goes through gay / bi and straight people and comments on it and always repeats . /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet - either repeat on TV or DVD - get it - you'll be a surprise - and even the production and filming of it is perfect. Just try to hide your blushes in parts - as I said - 'bawdy' is the order of the day - and beware of a 'phallus' or two! <br /> <br /> Enjoy!
