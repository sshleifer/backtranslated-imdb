Who should watch this movie? Anyone who ever took acid read Philip K. Dick, thought the Matrix premise was better than the special effects, has an interest in philosophy, or likes to exchange their sense of reality. I laughed aloud at this movie just because it was so outrageous and so stainless. This movie is wonderful. This movie is cool. It's better than the Matrix, with a long shot (I haven't slept in Existence, for a kick off: action / special effect movies carry me stupid and despite a probable philosophical sheen, that's exactly what the Matrix is) . Existenz is gross, it's disturbing, and it's funny. David Cronenberg also did some shonky stuff (Rabid) and some works of genius (Video Dreams is another one worth checking out, like Stephen King's adaptation The Dead Zone). But this is one of my all-time favorites. I can't remember the end - that's a good thing because it means I can see it again. Or maybe I never watched this movie. Maybe it's an implanted memory. Or maybe it happened to me. I do not know. Anyway, it is now stitched seamlessly into my overall illusion of reality, and I'm happy.
