Chris Noth plays a maniac that has written a children's book as a young boy, acting as a doctor threatening a community to push his sister's son in the position of his school's genius. The only man who can stop him is a police spokesman who plays his own rules and is forced to communicate with his naughty dad who communicates via oujii board. Will Rick Springfield find out how? Or will someone sabotage his recording studio! Did the mentally handicapped boy run the book cellphone? Look to find out! I don't make it up!
