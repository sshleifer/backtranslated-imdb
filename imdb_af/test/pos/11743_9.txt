This movie always hits me hard emotionally at the end. Although the issues of the film - interracial romance and adultery - were controversial at the time, this film goes beyond the narrow parameters of groundbreaking novelty and the rowing uniqueness. Here we tell a true love story, as written by the woman involved in this love affair, in a brilliantly aggressive style that evokes the virtues and glory of crazy passionate love. I "love" this endorsement of the only emotion that life really makes worth living. Jennifer Jones is full of grace and William Holden is simply beautiful in his role as a reporter. A wonderful movie that only people who are in this kind of love can truly appreciate and understand. And for those who have not yet fallen in love, just hope that one day of lightning can hit you, life is worth living - because love is worth even, but for a short while - even if you lose - because love is the "stuff" - the essence - of life. This movie works for me. A warm feeling experience!
