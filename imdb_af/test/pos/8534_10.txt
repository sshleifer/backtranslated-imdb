(Spoilers warning) I can't say enough good things about this movie. It's a great horror comedy / spoof that fixes everything for a change. The humor is great and ranges from funny to funny - you will be funny. In one scene, Ed is modifying-crazy and removing a big scene. When his boss looks at Ed's edit, he shouts: "Where in the fu% # is my beaver rape scene?!?!" Hysterical. There are also many other great, humorous and memorable quotes and moments throughout: Ed shouts out: "Don't fu, look at me !!!" while repeatedly pushing a few poor schmuck. Very funny things. The plot of the movie itself is so ridiculous that it is invaluable: Ed is a gentle everyday man who is being moved to the horror movie editing department, and after a while goes nuts, sees monsters and attacks people while the horror quotes be. movies that he edited. This movie has everything and is simply hilarious. The DVD costs just about $ 7, and is a great bargain as it is the unprecedented widescreen cut. I own many DVDs, most of which cost much more than this one, but not many are as big as this movie. My Evil Ed DVD is one of the highlights of my collection and I will hit someone with a phone receiver trying to steal it. Evil Ed shows style and quality - something Hollywood movie makers need to learn. Evil Ed is a rare jewel, and I'd like to thank everyone involved in making this wonderful movie - you've done everything right, and I love Evil Ed! 10 out of 10 !!!
