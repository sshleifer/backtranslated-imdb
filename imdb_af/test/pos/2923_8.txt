Film historians have told a lot about the old epics that have been the interest of many directors since the beginning of the theater. The pioneers of such epics, especially Biblical, were D.W. Griffith with his "mother of all epics" INTOLERANCE (1916), and Cecil B DeMille with his flair for gorgeous glasses, costumes and cute scenes. Who can forget his Ten Commandments (1923, 1956) or THE SIGN OF THE CROSS (1932)? Yet another epic, made in the 1950s, led by Michael Curtiz, based on the novel by Mika Waltari, "The Egyptian." Michael Curtiz, already known for his great classic CASABLANCA (1941), manages to adapt his film to the audiences of that time, to include the key ideas and facts from the thick novel and the lifestyle of Egyptians. in lived, to recreate one of the most wonderful periods in the government of Akhnaton. <br /> <br /> The first and most important fact for me in this movie is the psychological development of the main character Edmund Purdom plays. Sinuhe, who is raised by his step-parents in a simple family, becomes a doctor. All his life, he never stops asking a question "why?" and looking for the answer. Attractive love he finds in a courteous Nefer (Bella Darvi) leads him to financial and spiritual disaster. He needs to repair the mistakes made by hard work in the House of Death and start building his reputation of nothing. First, he thinks the only healing is revenge. In the long run, however, he realizes that "eye for eye" is not a solution. Finally, standing in front of him in very strange circumstances is the temptation to be a pharaoh. Yet there is one moment he gets the answer for his questions that have touched him through his life. The story of the main character, although based on the book, is so psychologically interesting that every frank person this aspect of the film. The main character's psychological struggle is enhanced by the times in which he lived, the times, probably for the first time so far, clashed with the power of the sword with the mindset. <br /> <br /> Curtiz's movie also retains one line that keeps all movies of its era: great throws and cute sets. There are mostly British actors and actresses who perform very well. How is it possible not to mention the mainstay of ancient epic Victor Adult. This time he is not Demetrius, Hannibal or Samson, but Horemheb - a fighter, a lover, eventually a pharaoh. Jean Simmons appeared in a very delicate role of merit, a woman who loved Sinuhe all her life, but it was too late when he realized it. Peter Ustinov, probably best known for his beautiful performance as Nero in QUO VADIS? Three years earlier, doing a good job as Kaptah, Sinuhe's friend. The royalties of the film are also played by two major role players, Gene Tierney and Michael Wilding. Tierney is excellent as cold, desirous of Baketamon, Pharaoh's sister. Wilding gives a wonderful show as "crazy" Akhnaton. When I was in the Louvre in Paris and carved Akhnaton's original face in stone, he looked very much like the actor in the film. Bella Darvi, an actress born in Poland, is quite memorable as an evil Nefer nephew. And there is another actress who only appears in one scene but who is difficult to forget, Judith Evelyn as Taia, Pharaoh's mother. This voice, these eyes! <br /> <br /> The sets are great. The director recreates the most likely image of Aaton's outside temple, the god that the Egyptians worshiped in the government of Amenhotep IV. I also loved the scene of Pharaoh's first entry. What a glorious picture that remains forever in your memory !!! However, there is also one aspect that I want to draw the attention of all people interested in watching the movie. The Egyptian is in many ways similar to other epics, but it also stands out as a unique movie. There are very few films that make such a wonderful use of different inquisitive ones as for ancient times. Iron is mentioned which is first used by the Hittites. It is also the only film about ancient Egypt that speaks openly of Egypt's wonderful healing ability. This indicates the contrast of lifestyle, especially the moment of a slave's death for whom no one cares, followed by the announcement and consequently the widespread mourning after Pharaoh's death. Finally, the Egyptian shows one historical fact: there were other nations except Jews (before Christ) where the spirit of God shone in some human hearts. Still, the only difference was that it didn't survive as long as Jews did, because it didn't have a strong foundation. The scene of Akhnaton's death gives you so many Biblical and Christian values ​​that you may think you are looking at a religious film. <br /> <br /> Consider everything, I recommend Michael Curtiz's movie. It is an excellent production on several levels: an entertainment for epic fans, an admiration for wonderful performances for film fans, a soul festival for spiritual people. Finally, it is a beautiful story of extraordinary things that happened thirteen centuries before the birth of Jesus Christ.
