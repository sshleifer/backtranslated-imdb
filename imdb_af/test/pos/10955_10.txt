Improvisation has been used in this film for a pioneering degree, but it only functions as a novelty. No greater truth about the situation is by asking the actors to improvise. The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they deliver the line well, but whether the line itself is good. That's why the performances in many Robert Altman movies are often very popular - because the actors aren't really confident about calling lines they've made and that's why it's definitely not good. <br /> <br /> And honestly, it's often not very good. Often, the dialogue does not really follow one line to another, or the environment does not fit. <br /> <br /> It cracks with an unpredictable, youthful energy - but frankly, I found it difficult to follow and concentrate so much on it. <br /> <br /> However, a fascinating raw piece of film, and commendable 100% to take the power over the green light into the street. <br /> <br /> There are some great things in general. in it. This joke, for example: <br /> <br /> I'm a dancer. What kind of dancer, like a ballet dancer? Oh no ... exotic. <br /> <br /> And the whole party tone is in, the next trip to the park and the scene where the boys are going to look at statues. <br /> <br /> 2 / 5. I won't say they're worth 2 hours of your time.
