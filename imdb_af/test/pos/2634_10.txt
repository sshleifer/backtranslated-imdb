Chris Penn is hilarious as Jeff Spicoli's all-time stoner brother. This movie is great because it was much more real and harder than fast times at ridgemont high. Casting was perfect and one of my favorite soundtracks of almost all Eddie van Halen, which became songs at ou812 and illegal carnal knowledge. This movie is one of the big stoner movie heroes with cheech and chong. Quick times were more depressed than funny. Abortions, friends who cheat friends, bump into bathrooms, bad work, and not school. Someone must hate the eighties to be more than the wild life. The movie even had big cameos like the creator of city limits. Michelle was shocked in the liquor store or Ben Stein in his first role in the solar system's surplus shop.
