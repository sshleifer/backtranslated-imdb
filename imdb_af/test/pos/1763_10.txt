Could it be one of the earliest color films? It's actually the second. This is a very nice piece of film produced by Thomas Edison. It was one of many of his other films. <br /> <br /> I think it's the most beautiful of any Thomas Edison movies. It lets a girl dance and moves her dress everywhere, which turns red with the movie. It's just beautiful. <br /> <br /> You look at history when you look at it. You watch what started making movies of the day! It may not have a plot, or something very interesting, but it is the second color film ever. <br /> <br /> I recommend it to everyone, especially if you teach students about filming or something of the kind, you need to show them what starts color films!
