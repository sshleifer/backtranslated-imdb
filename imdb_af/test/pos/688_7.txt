It was a dark film that betrayed a low budget with poor cinematography and not so much of an editorial. It may be of interest to those who know something about submarines during World War II, but I recommend that all beware. Many of the scenes in this movie were flat and some of the actors were slightly weak. The story of the men who return during a short leave seems realistic enough, but there is no real pacing or tension in the story. I also had a hard time understanding what the actors said, partly due to some strong English accent and perhaps due to an inferior sound recording job. I give it a 55/100. Most people will want to "send" clearly.
