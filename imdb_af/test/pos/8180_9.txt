Another time for Chen Kiage ... (can't remember him doing a modern movie!) ... Good characterization with a simple story of trust and broken promises. None of the HK fighting scenes, or the Hollywood-type heroes, but that's good because of that. The characters are strong, I really felt for them. <br /> <br /> Understanding the Mandarin certainly gives the English subtitles the edge. The movie is 3 hours, but it didn't feel.
