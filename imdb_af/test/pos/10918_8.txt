I saw it because my cousin is an extra in one of the wedding photos. I read somewhere that Oz and Rudnick wanted to have fun on liberal message movies, but the climax eventually comes out of one of those movies. Also, some of the humor is a bit on the side, Joan Cusack was too over for me, and someone has a strange timeline for the Oscars. Yet there were more than enough funny moments, such as the coastal scene, the wedding that didn't, and the scene with the principal, to enjoy it. Cline as always is good, but to me the real surprise was Selleck, which I am not a big fan of, but pop fun on himself beautifully here.
