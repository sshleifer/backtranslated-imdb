A brilliant horror movie. Totally gruesome and very scary too. The thing is a reminder of John Carpenter, but don't let yourself be turned away from the movie. It's simply brilliant. The beginning of the movie has plagued the alien's spacecraft in the ages before the Earth before humans walked the planet with an explosion that unleashed the title of the movie in incredibly shiny white and blue with the words "THE THING". One of the best opening points for a horror movie ever. <br /> <br /> The role-players of the twelve-man science team are a pleasure to see and the sites for establishing their station in Antartica are visually impressive. on widescreen. It should have been good in the theater. I'm sorry this is not seen on the big screen. <br /> <br /> Kurt Russell is excellent as Macready, the helicopter pilot who is reluctantly the leader of the men trying to combat a deadly form-changing monstrosity that infiltrated their base. All the actors in this are really good and create wonderful scenes of paranoia and tension over who has infected the thing. My favorite movie in the whole movie should be when Macready tests everyone who is still alive for infection, it is tense, scary and ultimately spectacular. I love it because it's funny too. <br /> <br /> Special mention should be made to Rob Bottin for his truly amazing makeup effects and form changing alien designs. If he didn't get an Oscar for the best visual effects at the moment, then he should be fine. It's also debatable whether it's John Carpenter's biggest movie. It's definitely an abominable masterpiece. <br /> <br /> Waiting for a cold winter weekend. Get some Budweiser out of the fridge. Sit and watch The Thing, a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes that transform the shape of towers of gore and slime. <br /> <br /> Completely brilliant. <br /> <br /> Ten out of ten.
