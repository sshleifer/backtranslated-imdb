Kate Gulden, played by one of the most nominated actresses of the past decade of this century, and one of the most talented actresses Meryl Streep (From Africa). She is wonderful, every part she plays. The Yale graduate is the pride and joy of the American film. Kate's health is worsening and her husband, George, is well developed by brilliant actor, and Oscar winner William Hurt (Smoke, Kiss of the Spider Woman) also has a difficult time with the worsening health of his one real thing, and looking for his daughter's help. Poor daughter, Ellen Gulden, Ren√©e Zellweger (Jerry Maguire) expected her too much. No breaks! The story takes a very realistic view of the illness of a parent. In this movie, the only daughter has to put her life at risk to care for the needs of others. There is always one in every family who has such responsibilities. Ellen is angry at the start of the movie, but eventually she ends with the understanding of her mother's lifetime commitment to her family. She even asks her mother: How do you do her, every day, in and out and nobody knows? That's what women do, much of what I call invisible work. In addition, we clean, repair, restore, stretch, celebrate, we are the best friends, we are confidants, mistresses, outreachers, disciples, sensitive. Some of us, like both women in this movie, have the perfect education, is the psychological pillar for the whole family and do all that invisible work! It's Kate Ellen, and many women in our society. Many of us have already gone through that stage of life when our parents go to age and death. I was already there. They just went too young. I thanked my parents, but I never understood them so well, but also when I had to play their roles and walk in their shoes. This movie reflects the reality of life. Maybe it's sad, but that's how life sometimes is. George, a professor at Harvard, is a complicated person, who seems to be more important than others, and has a very "master / servant" attitude towards women in his life. He is not strong enough to handle. If you want to see good acting and the reality of life, don't miss this movie. Favorite Scenes: The restaurant comes to Kate, violets and everyone. Making a table out of broken China. That I am so symbolic! We are all broken ships! Favorite Quotes: George: "It's just going uphill, realizing you're really going downhill." George "You have a Harvard education, but where is your heart?" <br /> <br />
