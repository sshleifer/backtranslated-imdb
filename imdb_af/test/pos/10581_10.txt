Haggard: The movie is the real life story of Ryan Dunn, and his girl who cheated on him, also with the help of his two friend, 1. A Skaterboarder who lives for nothing, and 2. a try-to-go. be funny scientist (who doesn't really work) played by Bam Margera and Brandom Dicamillo. <br /> <br /> The movie Haggard The Movie also has many characters from Jackass, etc., but to say it was written by Bam Margera and Co. This is a very poor attempt. It seems like it was written when he was bored, or as a project they didn't pay much attention to. <br /> <br /> The movies also star Bam's girlfriend, Jennifer Rivell, who plays Glauren, Ryan's girlfriend who basically cheated on him, again very badly acted by Jennifer, another actor some people might be interested in, is Steve aka Hellboy, played by RakeYohn, who doesn't seem to be his character with the story, again, this character doesn't really have many lines in this movie that basically doesn't make it very boring. But worst of all, is Raab's character, the voice sounds like a smoker who actually has throat cancer, and I think he could also be improved! In general, I think the characters in this movie are not in the story, as in one scene, it would be on one particular character, a minute later, another scene, different character. <br /> <br /> To say this is supposed to be a movie, a documentary version, not played by the characters as a documentary. The play makes you think it's a cheap effort to make a movie with your free time. <br /> <br /> By the middle of the film, we are starting to lose focus on the main character Ryan Dunn, although much attention is given to Bam and Brandon. <br /> <br /> In conclusion, this movie is good if you laugh at things It's not very funny, stupid stunts, horrible acting and the occasional nude scene! Also I think there are too many scenes of just no talk and just music! 10/07
