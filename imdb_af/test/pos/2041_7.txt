<br /> <br /> SPOILERS IN THIS OVERVIEW <br /> <br /> The Long Kiss Goodnight is another great example of a common tribulation of many modern films; It begins on a very interesting concept - a trained assassin whose memory has been wiped out, regains consciousness of herself. And the initial setup is tempting, but it seems as if the authors don't know well where to go and the whole thing goes down increasingly confusing and / or wrong roads, and the disappointing taste of something that is good, but promises much better to be. The bad things are remarkably imperceptible, and even Jackson's comic strip looks more like something from his pre-Pulp Fiction days; It seems that Harlin, as in Cutthroat Island, made every effort so that no one would raise his wife. Her character is by far the best of the movie and it makes you feel more frustrated that they couldn't do better. <br /> <br /> There's still something about this movie. that sets me apart from the running action-hollywood action and puts it above average, if only. It's something very subtle. I can't raise my finger completely; It is a disturbing, cold, dark, even sickly edge, a nightmarish and unreal feeling, a decadent air, an average stripe that picks up in different ways. It is in dark red photography and almost permanent night where the characters live. That's in Samantha's dreams before the mirror. It is in her evil eyes and smiles when she wants to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy watching her nemesis. dying with her daughter listening, it is in Mitch's return to the wheel of a car while he injects so much blood from his mouth, he can barely speak. I don't know, it's an atmosphere, something I can't define but what gives me the crawl (a bit) and what makes this movie even more interesting to me.
