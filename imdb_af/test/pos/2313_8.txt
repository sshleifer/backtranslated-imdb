I can't explain it, but I find this movie not only funny, but so nice I feel compelled to watch it over and over, or at least I did when I had cable television. I always felt it was a very bad movie, but maybe it's because I watched it on cable. I plan to get a DVD of this movie to really take a look, but more importantly just to watch a good time. I like the plot and the idea of ​​the movie and I especially like the movie. I always wonder if the movie enjoyed making the movies they were in and that is no exception. This movie earned a better deal than it received and Kelsey Grammar earned at least one love scene with me. Holly. Who wouldn't? The characters in this movie were the kind of guys I could identify with when I was in the army and the zaniness was exactly. Good troops.
