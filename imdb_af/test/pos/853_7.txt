The Jungle is more of an adventure than a science fiction movie. The only sci-fi part is the Woolly Mammoths that live in contemporary life. <br /> <br /> Elephants attack villages in a part of India and these attacks also kill people. An expedition is being sent to investigate and one of its members, an American hunter blames that these elephants are terrified by Woolly Mammoths, who are supposed to die. No one believes him at first, but they do when the mum appears at the end. An earthquake finishes them off. <br /> <br /> The jungle is shot on India and has beautiful scenery and some good Indian music, including some songs that move the movie properly. The mammoths are actually real elephants with fur coats and long teeth fixed. <br /> <br /> The film includes Rod Cameron, Cesar Romero (The Lost Continent) and Marie Windsor (Cat-Women of the Moon). <Br /> <br /> The jungle is worth seeing just for the scenery and music. Very pleasant. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
