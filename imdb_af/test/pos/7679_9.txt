I saw the movie in his original theater release in Austin Texas. The old Paramount theater (I don't know if it still exists.) All went out with speakers around the walls that are connected accurately to all six channels. By 15 years I was blown away. The concept of surround sound was quite strange at the time for music and film. <br /> <br /> I remember at least three outstanding scenes where the surround sound has made a huge impact. (Although forgive me if the time distorted my memories with inaccuracies.) The first was a camera trip through Catfish Row, alive with the daily activities and sounds. You first saw everyone, such as a blacksmith, and when the camera overtook them, they would continue to be heard left or right along the back of the theater. The second was a marching band that was first seen in the front, and it slammed along the camera and split left and right. Not only did the sound of each instrument follow its own direction path, it also changed in timbre as it played to you, towards you and then away from you. And if that wasn't enough, they also accounted for the Doppler effect for each instrument as it passed. The third scene was near the end of the movie, as Porgy left Catfish Row for New York to look for Bess. He and about half the role-players pass the camera, leaving the town with the same sound effects as the march. The other half of the cast / chorus sings along with them and also golf and voices goodbye to Porgy and their other friends. The friends' answers can then be heard from the sides and back. <br /> <br /> Surrounding sound was used by the film with great effects. I think I remember a rock or something being thrown from a pier and hearing it in the water behind me. Little things like that were obvious to theater-goers happy to have the full six channels - things that would just look like in the theater. <br /> <br /> I stayed in the theater for several shows. You can do that then. And I went back a few times before leaving town. I have never seen the movie. It literally STARTS for release on DVD restoring photo fidelity and surround sound. I hope someone has kept it somewhere. Please, Gershwin family, let it be released before it is lost to other generations.
