Written by brilliant Monkees TV writers Gerald Gardner and Dee Caruso, WHAT GO TO THE FRONT was the last of the "Jerry Lewis" movies until nearly a decade later. Jerry's comedy is apparently an acquired taste, and sometimes he can be his own worst enemy if he as producer / director helmets - but even in the most threatening of his films there are always moments of brilliance. <br /> <br /> WHAT GOES MANAGEMENT TO BE AMUSIVE, entertaining and yes, very funny. This is somewhat different from any of the typical Lewis films. The pace is very exciting and there are many excellent supporting players - a kind of JERRY DOES HOGANS HEROES. The whole thing looks like an unsold TV pilot and you will also love it or hate it --- but hopefully you want to laugh
