It is one of Chaplin's First National Films of the period between its glamorous Mutual shorts and the more mature United Artists features. More exaggerated than the Mutual films, Chaplin's pursuit of his comic expression continues. Most people forget that the movie is actually a dream Charlie has while waiting to be sent to the front. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of slapstick via the Limburger cheese used to gas the enemy, and Chaplin lapses into enemy territory dressed like a tree. <br /> <br /> By this time in this career, the great man has so far immersed in cinematic expression that his films give the impression of making themselves. No doubt this was the case, but it still gives a convincingly realistic view of life in the front, as I can remember, even from an ironically humorous point of view. <br /> <br /> As far as Chaplin's work is concerned, being a prerequisite for all cinephiles - don't delay!
