The plot: Michael Linnett Connors has done everything in movies but straight, and is looking for his first big chance. He discovered Molly in a play and immediately knew that she would be a great movie star. He signs her a contract with the provision he has to make. The producer agrees and their big time careers are underway. What follows is a relaxation of the silent movies and early sound films with a great emphasis on comedy. And, oh yes, there is romance, and a little sad. Also, performances by Don Ameche and Alice Fay are. The music is also a real plus with a few well-known songs that have been heard. Many DVD extras also feature in this restored release released in 2008. It should be emphasized that this movie is a story. 1, not just a tribute to silent movies. Later years, similar films such as Singin 'in the Rain (1952) and Dick Van Dyke-Carl Reiner, The Comic (1969) will be released. What is especially about this movie is to recreate silent movies in 1939. We see parts of it as the theater audience in the lost period (although some sound effects are included) in glorious B&W, while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. One of the biggest in the silent era, Buster Keaton, who was climbing up the hill at this point, is well used in 2 quiet movie-based scenes and he is at the top of his game! It is said that he also had inputs on his screens. But the real reason to watch the movie, if you're a movie story, is above all else, Hollywood Cavalcade is Mack Sennett's movie legacy. It doesn't take a genius to realize this movie is a "positive" review of Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand's life. The character Michael "Linnett" Connors is Mack Sennett, whose real name was Michael Sinnott. And Molly, of course, is Mabel. Sennett had the teasing throws, the bath animal and Keystone Cops. He joined Buster Keaton, Ben Turpin (cameo), Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle (body double) and fell in love with his front lady. Not only that, but Sennett was a technical advisor for this film and also appeared in it. Since most movie viewers today prefer sound features, those associated with short subjects and silence are left to grazing. As Mack Sennett falls into that category, it's fortunate that there is Hollywood Cavalcade! Sennett was, of course, very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies. His career began in 1908 as an actor, then writer, director and producer. He retired semi-retired in 1935 with about 500 films. He worked with the best, such as Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson, Bing Crosby, W.C. Fields, Keaton, Harry Langdon, Arbuckle, and even Roy Rogers (in Way Up Thar). As a movie comedy is a very difficult road to pursue for a whole career, Mack played it wisely and has only selective work for the next 25 years. In 1931 he received an academic award in the short subject category, and another in 1937 for a lifetime of work. In the 1940s his presence was still felt, eg. Here comes the Co-Eds (1945) where a recreation of the oyster festival that is used in Mack's Wandering Willies (1926) is done. In 1947, The Road to Hollywood used some of Sennett's Crosby films. 2 years later he brought nostalgia with the movie Down Memory Lane in which he participated. With its ability to always associate with the right people, the ever-popular Lawrence Welk and his radio show played a prominent role later in the year. 1950, a re-release of his greatest triumph, Tillie's Punctured Romance (1914), brought sound. In 1952 he was honored on TVs, This Is Your Life, then published his autobiography, The King of Comedy (1954), a good companion for Hollywood Cavalcade. 1955 brought a more concrete association with Abbott & Costello, as he has a cameo in A&C. Meet the Keystone Cup. Finally in 1957, another tribute to the compilation film, The Golden Age of Comedy. So if you look at Hollywood Cavalcade, it's the legacy of a movie pioneer. In the movie at the dinner scene, the camera falls on a long table over the guests. As we get to the silver-haired Mack, he just turns his head to the camera as if to say, "Here I am!" When he rises to give a short speech for a short time, he is underperforming the words that have been conveyed mentally to him in his most subdued way. "I know my influence on comedy will never end, but people will forget Mack Sennett's individual. Maybe this movie will help."
