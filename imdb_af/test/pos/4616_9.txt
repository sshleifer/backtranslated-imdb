At 2:37 a high school student commits suicide. Not showing who got their lives or reasons, the time goes back to the beginning of the day. From here we follow six separate students; Marcus, Melody, Luke, Steven, Sarah and Sean. Each student struggles with their own moral dilemmas, which all reach boiling point, to an end for one. <br /> <br /> Having lost a friend and surviving his own suicide attempt, he / she has authored author / director Murali K. Thalluri to create a dramatic drama that focuses on teen life and the terrible act of suicide. Suicide is a topic that has been shaded, 2:37 is Thalluri's attempt to reveal it. If you are affected by the act of suicide or someone who has it, 2:37 is getting harder to see. <br /> <br /> With heavy and hard subject, Thalluri also tackles the daily teenage crisis. Sex, pregnancy, sexual identity, bullies, friendship, Thalluri manage and show them in a very realistic way. The factor on Thalluri's talent is his subtlety. He respects his subject and the problems everyone has ever suffered. It sometimes comes together in documentaries, it has such a painful realism; The interviews with each character split through the film just increase it. <br /> <br /> 2:37 has a distinctive deal with Gus Van Sants film Elephant. While the essence of each movie is different, the teenager tackles life. Like Sant, Thalluri uses long tracking shots, with time to and fro, to show each character interaction from different perspectives. A definition point for Elephant was its ethereal atmosphere. With savings talk, small character development and the long tracking shot, Sant has created a ghostly atmosphere for an upcoming fear. While this fear is in 2:37, the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level. Sant couldn't reach it. Over time, each character increases fragility and traps them with their emotional roller coaster. <br /> <br /> The right hit in this movie comes with the inevitable suicide predicted. The difficult part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort that we have heard to see someone's life in a horrible way. Although many films that have shown suicide, shine about the act or romantic act. Thalluri shows the pain and pain involved in this act and is not the best solution. With unknowns in the clues and their first major roles; Teresa Palmereach, Frank Sweet, Joel Mackenzie, Marni Spillane, Charles Baird and Sam Harris all show tremendous talent and promising acting careers. <br /> <br /> Forcing and destroying, 2:37 is an absolutely unacceptable movie.
