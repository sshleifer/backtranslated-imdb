It was sad that COMMITTED lasted only two weeks in Dallas theaters. I thought this movie went a long way. The writing was funny, full of subtle emotional shifts, and it had a good message. The acting was wonderful. Everyone did a great job, especially with the script's subtleties. Heather Graham not only has beautiful eyes, she has * expressive * eyes. For the sake, all the actors were attractive! Why it wasn't good in his theater release, I don't know - unlike the studio, not much of a pressure on it. But it deserves to do better, and I hope video is going well. This is definitely one of my favorites for the first half of 2000.
