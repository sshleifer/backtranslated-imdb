Michael Jackson is the greatest singer and dancer ever to live and this film proves it. It is brilliant to watch and the dance is fantastic. When Michael turns into a werewolf, the first time you see it is a bit of a front of your seat. And Vincent's rap adds to the fear when all the zombies come out of their graves. If you like this, I suggest you buy 'Michael Jackson's Thriller', which has the film as its making. The show shows an incredible performance of 'Billie Jean' by Michael, who was the first time he performed on television on the moon. Beware.
