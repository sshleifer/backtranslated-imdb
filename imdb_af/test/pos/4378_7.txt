I can't say I've enjoyed it so much as "The Big Lebowski" or "Raising Arizona," and have a bit of a sense, but "O Brother" is a nice movie worthy of some good laugh and " a taste of the Koens, twisted sense of creativity. The DVD edition contains the featuret, and I was interested to find out that the Coens are fairly simple in their registration techniques. It surprised me! Of course, this movie is not the best example (and I just say it in comparison) and it wasn't worthy of any Oscars (many feel it has been robbed), but perhaps it depends on the appeal. <br /> <br /> Although I enjoyed the Coens' previous work, I have never been a fan of old westerns or "The Dukes of Hazzard" or any of those things they show daily on TNN. I think that's why I don't feel so enthusiastic about watching this movie, as it revolves around the South African people. For anyone from the South who reads this, I don't want to offend any of you people! I'm sure you feel the same when you watch movies on urban areas like a Bronx Languages. "If you live your entire life in the city, it's hard to get used to movies of this nature. But all the excuses, I found the characters fun and strange. I think John Turturro played the accent perfectly and saw how he speaks in real life, I find it wonderful. Tim Blake Nelson was also good. Of course, George Clooney - what I assume is not the best at the hits, and judged by his decision to visit the idea of ​​working with a dialogue coach and developing a New England accent for The Perfect Storm. Of course, it looks a little disgusted and constantly struggles with the accent. However, his performance was good. You can also coen tribes such as Holly Hunter (in a short but fun role) and John Goodman (also on the screen for a short while, but every minute of it stealing). <br /> <br /> Although I don't normally dig country music, I like the title song "A Man of Constant Sorrow." The DVD also contains the music video for that song. <br /> <br /> Overall, I found the movie entertaining and original, but it doesn't have the quality of your face that the Coens have proven to us in the past. It's a slight effort, but a good one. I'm still suggesting you pick it. <br /> <br /> My Score: 7 (out of 10)
