I'm not going to walk around, but I'm just going to make it short. basically for those who do not know how weddings actually died ... ... the first time the demonic assassin catches the pipe and moves with an energy ball, they fly all over the wall. Phoebe the third sister comes down the stairs, saying the game that sends him away but is not overcome. (The power of THREE needed). Leo comes to heal both of them and so on. They are exposed to the line and the only way they can be saved is for a demon named Tempus to return. The only way he can do this is to stay Phoebe in the underworld. she agrees, tempus turns back time. it is now in the morning at 07:00. demon comes hitting pipe and trying with energy ball. they fly through the wall again. But this time Phoebe is not there to say the game to ward off the devil. Demon dead doctor. doctor flying through the window. He's dead. demon goes into a vortex wing type thing and glass shatters on the doors which is a good effect, and the air is good. that's where it ends. NOW .......... what the whole world doesn't know if they don't pay attention to the next episode. Although what I'm going to say now is not shown what happened, trust me ............... because this time there was no phoebe to call for leo this time as he later don't come. piper survived because her injuries were not as fatal as the prunes, and Leo healed her first before it was so. The prunes have already died. there was mystery solved. ps calling for a game play had to work !!! and she had made a surprise in the last episode
