Absolutely the most considerate, spiritually deep, intense Hamlet ever done - no other version comes close. Jacobi has the best understanding of the role of all the actors who played it. Patrick Stewart's Claudius is furious and still sympathetic. I especially like the two dead who play Rosencranz and Guildenstern. Very impeccable and yet sinister. Some may concern the necessity of a strong Ophelia - she is not a strong person, that is the point, and Lalla Ward strikes the proper nuances. Amazing. Simply Amazing - each of the more than two dozen times I watched it.
