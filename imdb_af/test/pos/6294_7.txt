Along with the Army !, this is one of Pauly Shore's best movies, if there is such a thing. While the entire West Coast meet Midwest culture clash is not something new, this movie proves the story a little more entertaining with the wild and unpredictable antiques of a fresh coast. While the change in values ​​would probably have gone the other way, the whole concept was quite entertaining. Not only was Shore's interaction with the family hilarious, but also Carla Gugino and Tiffani-Amber Theissen (she will always have the Amber in my book) in two big and early roles. One of those movies, I have no problem watching when it is on TV.
