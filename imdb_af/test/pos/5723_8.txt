I have always been fascinated by silent movies. There is something about the fact that actors and actresses act from 100 years ago. Driven by today's high-tech special effects, I always try to imagine what it was like to watch a particular movie at the time of its original release. It helps to appreciate the roughness of the early theater. <br /> <br /> The life and passion of Jesus Christ is a very beautiful production of Pathe, originally filmed in 1902, but expanded and eventually released in 1905. Imagine a series of famous religious paintings come alive, separated by title cards, and you will have a good idea of ​​how this film is. For example, the scene in which Mary and Joseph rest as they escape to Egypt is almost identical to Luc Olivier Merson's 1879 painting "Rest on the Flight to Egypt", to Mary sitting on the famous Sphinx. While some may find these "living paintings" an indescribable cop-out, I have found them to be very charming and very nostalgic. <br /> <br /> The sets and costumes appear to be a stage production of Christ's life. Possibly out and expanding passion of the day. The make-up on the movie is very theater, so much so that a close proximity of Jesus is almost comical. Again, where others are affected by their thoroughness, I was quite charmed. <br /> <br /> After 3 years of filming, the continuity is not bad. The biggest mistakes are in the decisive changes made over that time. The characters of John the Apostle and the 12-year-old Jesus turn into the middle scene, much to the audience's surprise! <br /> <br /> The best unintentional humor of the movie is in the Birth of Jesus scene. The baby appeared LITERALLY, as if restrained, in the manger between Mary and Joseph. Perhaps it was just my state of mind when I looked at it, but I laughed out loud! If the child's birth was just as easy !!!! To coax it, Maria's actress seems bored through the whole scene (actually through the whole movie), as if this sort of thing happens every day! Me, how times have changed! <br /> <br /> As simplistic as this movie, it is compared to today really a wonderful window in the past. I recommend it <br /> <br />
