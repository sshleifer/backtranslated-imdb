This is one of the better sci-fi ranges. It involves character development, some very exciting moments and reasonable episode scripts. As another commentator said, it looked like a mini-series, not a full range of filler episodes and low budgets. <br /> <br /> The problem with the show, which is briefly a Godzilla series, is it starting too big, with incredible monsters, fantastic science, then it all boiled for local Americans doing things. Then the show ended too soon, as the Olympic Games come and go! A sci-fi show is a sci-fi show, but half-naked athletic people running around are more important. So they did just 15 episodes instead of the expected 22. The audience was also small, as people didn't really catch it at 20:00. In the end, the packs did. Trust a marketing plan to destroy everything that looks original and promising. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: You have a show with good special effects, things like big monsters that kill people or destroy boats, then in genetic engineering, transformation people, human clones, end of the world, tsunamis. Also, the only fillers are scenes with aggressive rednecks or other annoying people murdered for their stupidity. The downside is that after 15 episodes that make something big, the end ends. No real end, no closure, just a bitter taste of cloth in your mouth, as if you just swallowed a pack of it.
