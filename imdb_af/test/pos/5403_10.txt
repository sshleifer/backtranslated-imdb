Just watched this movie, in Australia on satellite. As I have avoided the news so much more than usual over the past week from the US by A about armed men, it is good to kill absolutely. This movie is a former gem. A great bravo for everyone involved. I just had a small idea of ​​what the movie entails, as is often the case for good effect, and it certainly came with movies. The setting of the scene is effective in the true sense of the word, with all the hairy confrontational topics of today's world in relation to its own false family, although suburban. For the first forty minutes, such a professional theater presents. I wasn't right for the loud laugh when they came. Although the cathartic moment was built through comedy and character, the family and neighbors met in an extraordinary way. <br /> <br /> All in all, a prediction of who and what we are. A most meaningful movie and a must see. <br /> <br /> Please note the date of this review.
