Samuel Goldwin brought his friend, Jascha Heifetz, to the screen for years. One evening when Goldwyn and his wife, Frances, had dinner with Heifetz and his wife, silent fencer Florence Vidor, Goldwyn suggested that Heifetz star be in a movie. After some persuasion, Heifetz agreed, provided his acting was limited to a minimum. And the film, originally titled "Music School", was born. <br /> <br /> The story itself is fairly stocked: a Streetwise boy (Gene Reynolds, best known as the "M * A * S * H" manufacturer), walks away from home and ends at a financially troubled music school led by Professor Lawson (Walter Brennan). While trying to raise funds for the school, the boy and other children are happening about Heifetz at Carnegie Hall. Over time, Heifetz arrives to appear at the school concert and sponsor the school. <br /> <br /> The story, while predictable, has been surprisingly well written, although the film contains several smaller gaffes that have different scenes attached. The most obvious is the young cellist coming from the orchestra chamber on a legacy a few seconds later in the orchestra. <br /> <br /> What is not surprising is how good the acting is. As the studios used to be, the studio surrounded the inexperienced star with veteran talent: Brennan, Joel McCrea, Andrea Leeds, Porter Hall, Marjorie Main (later of Mum and Pa Kettle fame), Arthur Hohl, Paul Harvey and a Who's Who character characters. Actress Diana Lynn and singer / actress Kaye Connor made their (unreasonable) debut in this film, as well as the prolonged Nelson Eddy singer, Gale Sherwood (like Jacqueline Nash). Child veteran actors Reynolds, Walter Tetley and Terry Kilburn also appear. <br /> <br /> Goldwyn recorded the high-profile youth band from the Los Angeles area, the Peter Meremblum Symphony. Most of the kids in the orchestra were not actors, but they were excellent musicians as well as professionals (many of whom later became). Many of the children in the orchestra have tackled remarkable careers: Kaye Connor and Diana Lynn both played in the theater and movie. Richard Berres was a producer and director. Mitchell Lurie founded a well-known music supply company, and Elliott Rapaport continued. A prominent cardiologist, Lewis Elias, was a band leader, Thomas Facey, a conductor with various symphonies, Channing Robbins, a prominent instructor at the Yuliard School, his sister Joyce Robbins, a SUNY Stonybrook instructor. Many of the children in the orchestra have musical follow-up careers with important symphony orchestras. <br /> <br /> While Heifetz's play was limited to a minimum, his salary was not. He ordered $ 70,000 for seven weeks. When some scenes had to be shot at a later time, he got another $ 50,000 for another four weeks. What was fortunately not kept to a minimum was his musical output. Composer Alfred Neumann (who was once a Meremblum Orchestra conductor) handled the score. Heifetz performs the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso by Camille Saint-Saens, his own arrangement of Manuel Ponce's "Estrellita" (with a Teddy Saidenberg accompanist), Dinicu's demons difficult Hora Staccato (of a Vitafoon recording, with Emanuel Bay at the piano), an excerpt from Tchaikovsky's "Melody", an excerpt arranged for violin solo from Tchaikovsky's famous Adante Cantabile from his opus 11 string quartet (played during the opening credits at the beginning of the movie) the final movement of Felix Mendelssohn-Barthody's E Minor Violin Concerto. During all these performances, there are many closest to Heifetz's performances, including a few shots of his fingers and bends, which will be of value to violinists who want to study his technique. <br /> <br /> The Meremblum Orchestra Also sparkles the performance of the arias "Caro Nome" by Verdi and Casta Diva by Bellini (both singing with Sherwood), an arrangement of the transfer of Rossini's "Barber of Seville ", a short extract from Mozart's" Eine Kleine Nachtmusik ", and the former Mendelssohn concert (with Heifetz). Diana Lynn can be heard in the background of one scene, part of Chopin's Nocturne in B-Flat Minor, and a five-year-old Mary Ruth performs Chopin's popular "Minute" waltz. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a great movie. AMC regularly showed it until early 1992. I haven't seen television this past year, but copies of it are not difficult to obtain. If you have the chance, I strongly advise you to watch the movie.
