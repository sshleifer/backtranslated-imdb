A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon. <br /> <br /> STEAMBOAT WILLIE, an impenetrable rodent, fails his pilot and walks his way to film history. <br /> <br /> On November 18, 1928, a struggling young genius debuted the world's first successful cartoon with synchronous sound. Walt Disney or his alter ego Mickey Mouse will not be looked back. Financial struggle will remain, but essentially the world was their oyster bed, and Mickey would eventually face Chaplin as the most recognizable cultural icon of the century. <br /> <br /> As entertainment, STEAMBOAT WILLIE is still fun to watch, with fine work by animator Ub Iwerks and showing a Mickey with all the frivolity and indifference of a small child. He must handle a tyrannical captain (Pete, without his pen leg, since February 1925 in Disney cartoons), a wisecracking parrot (in a few years, it would be a duck) and a cute mouse named Minnie. Together, the two rodents make music on the living bodies of a goat, cat, goose, pig and cow (a precursor to Clarabelle). Everyone conveniently stayed aboard the steamship. Audiences cried for more and the pattern was set for the subsequent Mouse cartoons of the next few years. <br /> <br /> ********************** ******** <br /> <br /> Walt Disney (1901 -1966) was always impressed with pictures and drawings. Like a boy in Marceline, Missouri, he sketched farm animals on paper bullets; Later, as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War, he pulled cartoons on the sides of his vehicle. Back in Kansas City, along with artist Ub Iwerks, Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated advertisements and small cartoons for the local movie theaters. Always the innovator, his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke the ground to put a lively figure in a cartoon university. Business returns sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923, where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager and counselor. When a slightly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was taken away by the distributor, Mickey Mouse's character originated in Walt's imagination and ensured Disney's immortality. The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut, STEAMBOAT WILLIE (1928), a tremendous audience success with the use of synchronized music. The SILENT SYMPHONES soon appeared, and Walt's growing crew of wonderfully talented animators quickly conquered the new full-color territory, the illusion of depth and radical advancement in personality development, an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeaten. Mickey's festive, naughty behavior caught millions of fans, but he was soon joined by other animated companions: temperamental Donald Duck, intellectually challenged Goofy, and energetic Pluto. All this was in preparation for Walt's biggest dream movie. Between a stormy doomsday, Walt persisted and over the next few decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi & Peter Pan. Walt never forgot that his fortunes all started with a mouse, or that the childlike simplicity of the message and very hard work always paid.
