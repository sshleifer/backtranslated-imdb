In KPAX Softley brushes on the subtleties of Eastern Religious Mores of the small archetypes embedded in the film to Prot's real purpose. Spacey (Prot) assumes a predominantly didactic role throughout the film - it is as if the statements embody general truths about a culture of peace strongly expressed in Buddhism and Hinduism. It can be said that Prot is the eye of the storm - the world is in disarray and is "bright" and the false veil of reality is what everyone sees, but Prot sees the truth - he sees the moment - and appreciates it And at some points it fears if it surpasses its social construction of reality and becomes more human. <br /> <br /> The movie is particularly detailed. Therefore, I would recommend that you see it at least twice to see Softley entering the nuances. Listen carefully to the narratives at the beginning and end, as they really touch on concepts not commonly presented in Western philosophies. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10 review - Superb - with nominal departure space.
