I only saw the movie when I was about 12 years old. It was one of my favorites since ... It has been so perfect in all its glory with an incredible soundtrack, a cheese dialogue, and it was both hilarious and terribly sad. The first film I really just got fit over the end ... I won't ruin it for you, but boy is it a tummy duck ... I just remember being so sad for Gary! What a bunch of cool characters in this movie is this genius !!! They are all so good, even the nerdy girl Gary doesn't like ... (she did have a nice little body). I can't believe all the girls are going to Rick, he's such a sleaze ball with his handkerchief tied around his neck !!! ha ha ha ... If you watch this movie, be prepared for many sex jokes that have been completed with sexually transmitted diseases (almost). But a love story of heart with real problems that change from insecurity to life changes decisions that make you feel and feel really sad for the role. I love this movie !!! If you love Valley Girl, you'll always be classic too!
