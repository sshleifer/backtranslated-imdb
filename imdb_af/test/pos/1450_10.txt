I am fifteen years old and have seen thirty-three of Sinatra's films (not videos of TV shows and documentaries) and have only been implicated by two of them. "" To the clouds roll through "" and "The Miracle of the Bells" don't really count, however, as it first sings everything he does, a beautiful Ol-Man River, and in the latter he is not My favorite records , radio shows, TV shows and movies about Sinatra change almost every day - everything takes a different connotation with each look and sometimes the best thing he ever did and sometimes the worst looks until the cycle comes back, but there is a some things that are not comparable. When it comes to movies, the man with the golden arm is the head of the list. Everyone who knows Sinatra knows he thought it was his best-ever performance, he was Oscar-nominated, it was the first serious look at drug addiction, etc. The jazz score is unforgettable, Kim Novak is in spite of a ridiculous accent, Eleanor Parker is annoying and waaaay too dramatic; a wonderfully thin drug dealer. The sets are unconvincing. At first glance, it looks like a peculiarly mixed bag that has been joined by the great Otto Preminger with an out-of-town charm. <br /> <br /> Then you come to Sinatra. Just like everything else in his life - unlike music - reports of his acting are divided in half. Directors such as Fred Zinnemann, Frank Capra, Billy Wilder, Stanley Kramer, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich and Otto Preminger, all agreed that Sinatra worked so hard on his films as he did during the song. He was among the greatest actors in the world - if not the biggest. Humphrey Bogart even said, "This man has the most natural acting talent I've ever seen." Not bad for a man who never took an acting lesson in his life, at the same time was the discography that would make him the "greatest singer of the 20th century" and he did almost all his scenes at once. <br /> <br /> In direct conflict with all these things, the other reviews and biographies that talk badly about what a lousy actor was, were this Mr. Sinatra, and how many "bad" movies he made. The question will never be answered to everyone's satisfaction, because controversy was among Sinatra's greatest assets, and both arguments were in some sense in his hand. In this case, Sinatra is wonderful in this case. A reviewer said in the late fifties, "Sinatra may not be the biggest actor in the world, but there is nothing more fascinating to watch." No matter what Sinatra does in a movie, it's hard to take your eyes off him. This is, of course, a "charisma", which I have only seen in a handful of other people - Orson Welles, Richard Burton, Marlon Brando, Montgomery Clift, perhaps James Cagney. There is no real definition for it and it often makes it difficult to determine if you really enjoy a show or just spellbound, but the quality shown here is what makes the movie. Sinatra is straight-forward, actually, intense - overwhelming decades and thousands of paper-pop stars with something called quality. Like it or not, it is a one-man show with some character traps hanging around in the background. He covers every emotion with remarkable subtlety, from sweet, lonely tenderness to Kim Novak to the frightening shock of Frank Sinatra (Frank Sinatra!) Shouting in the wasteland of "cold turkey". Sinatra was right - it's his best performance. No issue. <br /> <br /> I was eight when Frank Sinatra died. I wasn't around for all the years of bobby soxers and "Anchors Aweigh," "Ava Gardner and" From Here to Eternity ", albums with lamp post and swingin lovers, Kennedy, Vegas, ring-thing thing. Basie and Mia and Reagan and concerts from Madison Square Garden to South Africa to the White House after the Sands. I can't say that I like Sinatra because I heard him at the Paramount or because I hear "September of my years" autobiographically - the usual excuses. And my excuse? When I was eleven, I watched a movie called "On the Town" ...
