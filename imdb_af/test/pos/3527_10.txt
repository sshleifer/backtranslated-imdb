This completely forgotten slasher movie is one of the best horror movies ever made. Very dark, sometimes it reminds me of a famous thriller "Deliverance". Director Jeff Lieberman creates great atmosphere of fear and despair. All the actors are decent and the climax is really exciting and memorable. So if you are looking for something creepy, try to find this little treasure. My personal rating: 10 out of 10.PS This one is even more chilling than "Halloween".
