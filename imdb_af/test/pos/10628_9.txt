Isabelle Huppert portrays a talented female piano teacher who is weak, unfriendly and far from the public and bitter to her students. Private, she sees with violence and frustration, and her sexual life is alone and perverse. She lives with her excessive mother, who obsessively manages to find (and so forth in life) as a talented pianist. The key to the characters of both mother and daughter is 'obsessed'. These characters can no longer change their impulses as a rabbit caught in headlights can avoid death. <br /> <br /> The piano teacher meets a young, attractive, talented pianist who is attracted to her from the beginning. They start a relationship in the most unconventional way, but from the beginning they make perverse and violent terms that he has to do on her, making him sick enough to end the relationship before it really starts. <br /> <br /> The film links him to the female head. Isabelle Huppert stunned with a brutal, totally convincing performance as the piano teacher. She cleverly shows a woman who is attracted to beauty and perversion, but her violence is fed by her distorted impulses. As a movie so character-driven, you don't know it will work halfway, she acted poorly. <br /> <br /> It is powerful, intelligent and intelligently and intelligently adapted from the novel. The camera also works with the movie. There is what I can only think of calling, shots where the director owns and forces a scene to watch. It's done extremely effectively against an empty bathroom wall, and is a further test for the mastery of the director. <br /> <br /> Expect this movie to be disturbed and sick. But be brave. Be brave to go look. It is a very private view in mainly one person's life, but don't expect to be entertained in the Hollywood sense. There are no motor hunters in this movie!
