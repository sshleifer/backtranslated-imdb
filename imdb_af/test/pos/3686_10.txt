I wonder why I haven't heard from this movie yet. This is really a wonderful comedy (I want to say farce, but it's done too well and I hate to harm the quality). A comedic character study on the crises of middle-age crises, the inequality for gays that do not recognize their long-term unions and the general differences of people who cannot fit well into society, that couples Kathy Bates and Rupert pairs Everett to a wonderful effect. Forget Julia Roberts and Rupert; Kathy Bates and Rupert have to do another movie together. Maudie (Meredith Eaton), the anxiously hidden, sharp and shameful son-in-law, is a wonderful character. If you like the Tales of the City movies, you want this peculiar lover.
