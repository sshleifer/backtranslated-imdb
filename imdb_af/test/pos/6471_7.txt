Alex North (John Cassavetes) is in trouble with his father and flees to the army, from where he is deserting and arriving in New York, intending to start a new life with the benefit of nobody knowing about his past. He finds a job at the Waterfront, where he meets Tommy Tyler (Sydney Poitier), a vibrant young man who is happily married and has a living contrast with Cassavetes' sad and unhappy character. They quickly become good friends and Tommy does his best to help his friend. The only problem is that they are superior at work, hard worker Charles Malik (Jack Warden), jealous of their friendship as well as Tommy's ongoing happy attitude and success in personal life. He is really making their lives difficult when he gets to know the truth about Alex's past. <br /> <br /> A great drama nominated by Oscar-nominated director producer Martin Ritt (The Hud) and with wonderful performances by Sydney Poitier and Jack Warden. 10/07
