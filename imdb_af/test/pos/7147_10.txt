I loved this movie very much about love between two adults in post-war Britain. The high standards of BBC TV are evident in the production, and excellent main players (Claire Bloom and Joss Ackland) make it an uplifting experience. Bloom and Ackland previously worked together in theater, and their chemistry and interaction is wonderful. I recommend this version of Shadowlands about the 1993 movie version.
