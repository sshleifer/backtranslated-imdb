"Female Convict Scorpion - Beast Stable", the third in the series, is a beautiful piece of pulp slush. Taken closer to the tone and subject to a Nikkatsu-violent phantom than other Scorpio entries, it has been amazingly photographed, angry with enthusiasm, and populated with a villain's rogue and degenerate gallery. Shinya Ito, the director of the first installment, returns for this surreal fable that begins with Scorpio (Meiko Kaji). She cut off the arm of a policeman. She is a handcart and flies in the Tokyo subway with the arm still swinging from her wrist. She seeks refuge in a red light district where she is befriended by a prostitute, who is first seen as a complicated intercourse with her brother (who eventually fertilizes her). Scorpio's desire to protect this unhappy woman eventually exposes her identity and hell breaks loose. She is beaten, sexually assaulted, and locked in a bizarre birdhouse in the villain's army. I loved everything about this hypnotic, nihilistic and emotional touch of the movie. These are the superiors of the three first Scorpion movies and feature one big scene after another. I can't recommend it highly enough.
