There is one of the best movies directed by Andrzej wajda. The story tells of young writers looking for a second war (he survived the German camp). Excellent true atmosphere (action will be placed in the camp for displaced), chief hero (played by one of the best Polish actor Daniel Olbrychski) eventually falls in love, but unfortunately his wife was killed. There was a beautiful scene when he spoke to American soldier and said (about the death of his girlfriend) "nothing happens, simply you are shot at us ... his condition of soul is destroyed. 10/10
