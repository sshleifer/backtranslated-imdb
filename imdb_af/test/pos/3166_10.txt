Almost four years after the war started in Iraq and we are in a bigger hole than ever. That's right, so all the flag wavers who were so sure of the law and power of the American way are now chasing their tails, isn't it? You bet it is. This movie said from the beginning. It's a little freaky how much the movie, or should I say, movie maker, know what's coming. It's almost like going to a fortune teller and hearing what will happen in the future. There was a point when I noticed the hair on my neck, as GW announced that a major combat operation was over, on top of a visual of a demolished RV dragged away with the American flag in the back You have to see it to understand what I mean. But even if you are apolitical or even if you are pre-war, this movie will have an impact on you, as it is so embedded in history.
