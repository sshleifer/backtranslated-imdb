What will Prospero be in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why should a man choose to live on an island with his daughter and girlfriend? Because it is too difficult to live and love in good conditions in the "civilization". This man (John Cassavetes) is a broken heart, he can command the storm. He has the power, the strict, but he is human. Deep love for life is the subject of this extraordinary film. The acting is incredible, all the geniuses of John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman and Shakespeare and Paul Mazursky of course. don't miss it, it will be a mistake. This movie is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. And I saw a lot of movies.
