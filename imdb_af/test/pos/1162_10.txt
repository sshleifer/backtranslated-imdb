This is one of my all-time favorites. All the actors do a good job. To compare this movie with "Lawrence of Arabia" is not entitled to both movies. The wind and the lion have a much lower budget with fantastic actors depicting heart-warming characters in a heart-warming atmosphere. There are also performances and beautiful photos, which guarantee me a favorite movie.
