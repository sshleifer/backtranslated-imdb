I feel very strongly that this movie, just like in the 1950s, was waiting with white women. As in the waiting to get out, all the female characters mingled with men who were married or not good. The only difference, apart from the obvious, was that there wasn't much humor in this movie. I would even say it was tragic. Only one of the male characters was friendly and sincere (Hope Lange's guy), but even then there was conflict in this relationship. <br /> <br /> The story was about three young women who shared a flat together and who had hope and dreams of success. Unfortunately, it wasn't easy for romance to come, although they were young, intelligent and attractive. This movie can be called a tearjerker with the saddest part of Suzy Parker's character, whose obsession with an ex-boyfriend leads to a tragedy. <br /> <br /> It's a must see.
