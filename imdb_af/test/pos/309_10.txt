From all of the Vietnam War films, this is probably the most terrifying and disturbing and it says many with many spectacular children coming out. It has this terrible feeling about it. Everything is so chaotic in the movie that scares you. It's not like it shows a lot of different things compared to the other Vietnam war movies. What is pushing to such a high level is the: <br /> <br /> Directing was spectacular here. Francis Ford Coppola shows his talent in his last epic movie. Unlike other directors, he makes you feel like you're in the war. Most others just show and show you the horrors of war. However, Coppola makes you confused, shocked and scared. These feelings of war are usually told to us about a movie or story. This is something I've experienced just a few times while watching a movie. Of course the writing was incredible too. It wrote you in the middle of the movie. It never bored me and this movie is three hours. The cinematography goes hand in hand with the direction that has greatly contributed to the freaky experience of watching this movie showing all the chaos around you, even though it looks calm. <br /> <br /> The acting was bottling. Just look at Marlon Brando and also give his last big show a scammer from the colonel. If I ever think of a crazy, sold-out soldier, I think of Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. With Brando and this movie you don't want to look in his eyes. Like the movie, he was freakish. For me, this show is as memorable as the one he gave in The Godfather. Martin Sheen delivered a very deep performance and probably the best one of his career that shows you everything through his eyes, all the madness he is experiencing and yet he wants to achieve his goal. It's just a wonder why these two did not receive Oscar nominations. Robert Duvall could show part of that madness with his ridiculous fighting strategies, among which play music to tell the enemy what he is coming. Duvall's character, who asked one of the soldiers to navigate in the middle of a battle, was also shocking but credible. Other great supporting performances were given by a young Laurence Fishburne, Sam Bottoms and Frederic Forest, who all summed up the attitudes of many of the soldiers at that time without becoming a clich√©. For once it was well used by Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford, whom I both love. <br /> <br /> I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie. It has a message and everyone involved in making it is at their best. There was nothing more that I could ask for from this movie, with its great acting, directing, writing, cinematography and good ending. See and you will see why it leads to its title Apocalpyse Now.
