A year after the release of the average "House of Frankenstein", Universal released another Monster Mash, where all their familiar character would collide. "House of Dracula" would reunite Dracula, the Frankenstein's creature and the Wolf Man for what their last battle would be and will eventually close an era for the studio. Director Erle C. Kenton, "House of Dracula", offers a small but noticeable improvement over the previous film and delivers a better-built (though still flawed) story that, while far from perfect, is a more appropriate closure than the previous movie. . <br /> <br /> The story ignores most events of the previous entry, "House of Frankenstein", and introduces a new angle to the story. Count Dracula (John Carradine), tired of concealing sunlight, asks for help from the brilliant scientist, dr. Edelman (Onslow Stevens), a doctor known for his research in biology. Edelman is fascinated by Dracula and soon begins an experimental treatment. Meanwhile, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney Jr.), the Wolf Man, visits Edelman for the purpose of getting rid of his curse. Soon Edelman realizes that Dracula is a monster to be destroyed, but his own exposure to Dracula's blood also develops a disease in him. The discovery of the Frankenstein monster (Glenn Strange) in a nearby catacombs will provide more turmoil to the mind of the brilliant scientist. <br /> <br /> After the previous clash of monsters, it's good to see the series back. to the roots and produces an almost straightforward gothic horror that returns to the dark pessimistic nature of these types of films and moves away from the comic relief of previous entries. The story (by Edward T. Lowe Jr.) has many interesting themes, such as the contrast between Dracula and Talbot (both seeking a healing, but with different purposes) and Edelman's increasing madness. Probably among the most interesting themes is the inclusion of the character of Nina, a beautiful but distorted woman who dr. Edelman helps to hope she is cured of her condition. <br /> <br /> Director Erle C. Kenton is back again and this time he has finally captured the dark nature of these three characters, a type that was apparently lost in the previous film. In spite of the low budget, Kenton's craft is a simple, gothic horror that is fairly efficient, and even manages to present old partners such one of these characters in a fresh way. While it's never on the original levels, House of Dracula recovers the charms of Universal Studios horror movies, and Kenton makes sure the monsters get the chance to shine at least the last time. <br /> <br /> This film is very good this time, with Carradine, Chaney and Strange performing their roles (although Strange's role is significantly smaller) with more enthusiasm than in the previous movie. The addition of Onslow Stevens, Jane Adams and Martha O'Driscoll to the film brings the drama and drama back to the series. Stevens gives an excellent performance as dr. Edelman. A small comedy by Lionel Atwill and the presence of Skelton Knaggs as the creepy Steinmuhl completed one of the more popular Universal horror films, has been in years. <br /> <br /> "House of Dracula" is a great addition to the series, especially to the mediocre "Frankenstein House". It is nice to see Kenton again in the form of a somewhat serious horror movie, and while the plot is fairly original, it does not only suffer from the budget, but because the film tries to do a lot in a lot briefly with bad results. It is true that the characters have many inventive story lines, but the film gives very little time to each of them to develop, and the movie looks very rushed and unpleasant. <br /> <br /> While it's perfect, it's also far from the worst of the series. "House of Dracula" is a good closing of one of the best times for the horror genre, a time when ghosts and ghouls grieved the foggy nights, and crazy scientists gave life to horrific monsters. Later, the samples will be back in "Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), but that would be a completely different context. After the disappointing previous entries, it is easy to dismiss House of Dracula, but give it a chance and leave the monster one last time. 10/07
