Estevez, Martin Sheen and Kathy Bates are beautiful in this depiction of a Vietnam veterinarian's home from the war but still haunt them. Bates plays a clueless mother who just wants the family to be a "family". Sheen is fantastic as the father who tries to understand what his son is going through, but is also wrapped up in his principles to really be too empathetic. The institution is Thanksgiving Day and the family comes for dinner. Estevez, who plays the returning veterinarian, does not want to be part of family tradition and insists that he wears his fighting ability to dinner and explains: "This is what I was wearing last weekend." The struggle and family arguments are invaluable, especially the "peanut-brittle crisis", but the end is both gripping and frightening. It should be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Overall, one of the best movies I've ever seen.
