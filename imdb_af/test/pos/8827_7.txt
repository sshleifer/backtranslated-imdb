My main criticism is simply that it is not long enough or sufficient enough. I would like to see more of everything: building the vessel, engineering, training, the first driveway, preparing for departure, Venus Orbital Injection, everything. I'd like to see more of the first leg, Venus, to Earth, instead of folding like a n Â° 10 corporation bus. In fact, I would like to see a series on the scale of Earth story made from it, with a full hour devoted to each planet and perhaps once again to the loop around the Sun. As it was, I was left hungry. On the other hand, I understand the attention of budgets and viewers. <br /> <br /> Re the science: Let us be fair about the speedy light passage: they have already mentioned that there was a laugh in conversation, but they let it evaporate when they reached the outer planets. There had to be some sort of conversation with the viewers, and we must assume that the delay was worked out for the sake of palatability; so there are no complaints. But zero for noisy spaces. The only film in which spacecraft makes no noise was Kubrick's 2001, and even then he listened by using the noise of the crew members in their helmets - which were "fairly effective." I wish Space Odyssey's designers realized how awful the eyes of big rocket cars being blown in absolute silence could be, but Pegasus roared much like any other cardboard spaceship in any other cardboard scifi movie. <Br /> <br /> But the rest of science was excellent. No complaints there, in fact praise for bringing out the radiation problems as well as they did. I just hope this movie won't discourage the BBC from making a very detailed version, but I think it's not for next week or next ...
