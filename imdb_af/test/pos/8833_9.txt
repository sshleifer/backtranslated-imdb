I was part of the Space Odyssey cast, which plays FIDO in mission control. I just want to say that none of our actors, especially those in mission control who had to respond most of the time to a green screen, had any idea how wonderful it would be. I knew it was going to be fine, just for the sheer camaraderie and professionalism that the production team at Impossible Pictures provided for everyone involved. but when we all saw it for the first time at the show at the Curzon Mayfair, well, I feel very proud. I was so happy that none of us looked like we were in Star Trek. Joe Aherne, the screenwriter and director, is the most wonderful man to work with. He gets a good team together and then implicitly trusts them to freely do what they do best. I'm very happy to be part of this show. Who knew something that this epic and complicated to understand would seem to look like. and my god it's a beautiful universe out there.
