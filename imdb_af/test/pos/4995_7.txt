I think the consensus is pretty one-sided on this recent TV miniseries: it's good, but it's far from 'Lonesome Dove'. It is compared to the latter just because it is a prequel to the well-known story. <br /> <br /> "Commanche Moon" is definitely worth a watch for any Westerns fan. Don't just expect it to be as intense as "Lone Dove." Steve Zahn and Karl Urban are not Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones, and the characters they play are not as strong as Duvall and Jones portray the same two guys. Some say it is unfair to criticize this movie because of the comparison, but you have to compare it. This is the story of the same two leading Texas Ranger characters: Woodrow Call and Gus McCrae. <br /> <br /> The biggest difference, I found, was that these prequel times were slower and more relationships (the two Rangers and their wives) at times. Yet I didn't mind, because the two main women were pretty ladies and generally nice and pleasant people. They are played well by Linda Cardelini ("Clara Forsythe") and Elizabeth Banks ("Maggie."). They helped make this long film enjoyable. If you saw pictures of women in Old West, none of them looked half as beautiful as Cardelini and Banks. They were a joy for these male eyes to claim. Maggie's son, Newt, was also a wonderful kid - the kind of boy every parent wants. <br /> <br /> The most interesting character, I thought, was "Inish Scull," which Val played. Kilmer. As in the Western movie, "Tombstone", Kilmer steals the show from the lead. "Scull" is really an original, if I've ever seen one: a strange man, indeed. <br /> <br /> Actually, all the supporting actors did a good job here, from Keith Robinson's "Deets" to West Studi as "Buffalo Hump." I always find Studi fascinating, no matter what role he plays. I wish he had a greater role in these miniseries. <br /> <br /> One thing this movie has in common with "Lone Dove" and other good westerners: the scenery and photography. It is sometimes beautiful and is a joy to watch. We also have an excellent director of this movie: Simon Wincer, who is "Lonesome Dove" and another excellent TV western Crossfire Trail. He also did two of my other favorite feature films, both based in his homeland of Australia: "Phar Lap" and "Quigley Down Under." <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, although I enjoy it, "Commanche Moon" is nothing as good as the above movies. You've always looked at it and were sorry it ended, if it made sense. It made me see Woodrow and Gus again, this time with Tommy Lee and Robert. <br /> <br /> Note: The title page says it's 360 minutes. It must have included the TV ads. The two-disc DVD version I saw was about 4 hours and 40 minutes.
