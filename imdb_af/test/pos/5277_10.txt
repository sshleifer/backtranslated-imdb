I absolutely loved the movie. I just saw it and can't wait for it to come out on DVD. It is a beautiful, well-drawn masterpiece. I'm always amazed at the complicated work of Ghibli studios. <br /> <br /> Others commented on Sosuke, who named Risa at her first name. He never calls his Father with his first name unless he talks about someone else. I didn't get the impression that Risa was his mother. It has never been mentioned or implied by anyone. Obviously she is his stepmother. That's why he makes her promise to come home and why he gets so upset when he gets her empty car. His mother must have been dead when he was a baby because he is being nursed by Risa. This, together with the fact that his father is out of the sea, is why he has abandoned issues. Everyone also talks about how mature he is. This usually happens when a child loses a parent.
