Based on the actual events of 1905, the silent movie THE BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN is an Imperial Russian ship on which horrible conditions lead to a mutiny. Shocked by conditions on the ship, citizens of the port city of Odessa support the supporters of the mobs - and consequently they find themselves in the imperial forces attacking civilian supporters with a brutal force. <br /> <br /> POTEMKIN is a movie in which individual characters are much less important than the groups and crowds of which they are members, and it achieves its incredible power through the clash of groups and crowds in a series of extremely visualized and showing edited sequences. Surprisingly, it is possible to emphasize each of these ranges the previous one and the movie actually builds in power as it moves from mutiny to the citizen's rally to the massacre on the Odessa steps - the last of which is one of the best-known empires. in all film history. Filming mainly where the actual events actually took place, the vision of director Eisenstein is extraordinary, as not only from sequence to sequence but from moment to moment within each row also some of the most memorable images ever dedicated to film . <br /> <br /> Describing POTEMKIN as a wonderful movie is something of an understatement. It is an absolute necessity, an absolute necessity for anyone who is seriously interested in the film as an art form, pure visual theater at its most brilliant, often imitating, seldom equal, never spent. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
