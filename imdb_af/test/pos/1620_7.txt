As with many films of this ilk, my non-Catholicism had the way to understand me. The church has these rules that have been compiled for centuries. We have a short time to teach them and accept it at face value. Then some bad guys throw revenge for a long distance against them, work under these rules and try to bypass them, and you have this book and movie. I thought, "It's pretty cool. Why did they do that?" There is this accidental thing in the Robert Langdon character, no matter what the problem is, he always looks the right first step. I think it's like watching CSI, where they solve incredibly complex issues in a few days. They know the lick of the land. In this movie there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything. But if you create Robert Langdon, you have to set him up. That's right, because heroic nerds like him spared the day forever. I thought the movie was fun. I thought the Da Vinci code was also fun. Interesting and not as bad as people wanted to think. It's a wonder to watch and never stop for a second.
