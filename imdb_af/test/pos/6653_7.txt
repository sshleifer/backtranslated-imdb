Watching Cold Cold I got the impression that his director Anthony Minghella deliberately tried to persuade himself and his own film of "he was trying to defeat" was the virtually impeccable "The English Patient" of 1996. Comparing the two Movies, the starting point is very similar. We have a passionate love affair between two people who are in a turbulent time of war and they end up more or less a disturbance in the background, returning to each other's arms. The primary plot difference is that Nicole Kidman's character is not married, Jude Law's is a desert, and the conflict is the American Civil War. <br /> <br /> "Cold Mountain" is reverent, more watery and mellow, as it says "The English Patient" and it's more on the level for people who want a simple love story with a kind of turbulence that a cause problem. It's a shorter movie, which is a plus for people with less patience. However, this is not as spectacular or original or really poignant as "The English Patient." My * only * big complaint about "Cold Mountain" is surprisingly the love affair between the characters of Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Surprisingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. They do not have a proper relationship; we do not feel a true passion that comes from them and the passion we see is more physical than emotional. I was more fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Oscar winner Renee Zellwegger and also Jude Law's journey across the country evading vigilantes and hostile soldiers. If Minghella enhanced the importance of the love story, he would have had a better picture. <br /> <br /> Of course, the movie is entertaining, even if the love story is uninteresting. The Civil War rows are absolutely amazing; they are of the modern tradition that regards war as terrible and inhuman. The reshaping of the Petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives have been exploded from underground and then followed by a hand-to-hand battle, is terrible. Minghella is not ashamed to show blood and gore in an artistic and sensible way, and he is not afraid to show accidents and life in these scenes. There are moments where both women and men are killed, often by crossfire. And there's more to it. Only the sound design of the movie generates tension. There is a scene where Inman and another despair make themselves a meal by cutting the head of a dead cow. We don't see the cut, but the sound effects of the blade going through the leg are sick. <br /> <br /> Finally, I must congratulate the cast for the performances. Jude Law was great in the movie and deserves the Oscar nomination he received. I feel that Nicole Kidman also deserves one, although her character was a bit shallow. Ren√© Zellwegger had the most personality and display room atmosphere. And then there are only the bits that really work to complete this stylistic world, which results in a terrible time in America's past. <br /> <br /> Perhaps "Cold Mountain" would have been better than a war image, but it's definitely better. would have been spectacular such as "The English Patient" as his love story sparked and made more passionate by screenwriters and director Anthony Minghella. As it is, it's a nice picture, I didn't get bored, and I recommend it. I'm just saying that his love story - though it's a central plot point - is a bit softer than it should be and all the stuff around it was really working.
