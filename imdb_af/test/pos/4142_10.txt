The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock, Texas. As the credits start, the camera moves from the moon to the parking lot, in the rocky track, past the concessions and across the track to a small tire position where a small group checks their sound. This is a locator Welles and Scorcese will both appreciate. It cuts Buddy Holly's facial facial that concentrates in the rape while handling the headphones and talking to a man putting this band on the radio. <br /> <br /> A young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his performance is key. He somehow showed the passion Holly had for his music to make the movie work. It is a rock-and-play storyline that has been chasing boils with heroin shots and a fifth whiskey. It's not about a man with multiple women to choose from in a gender-scandalized, in love, abandoned tragedy. It's a movie about a lovely Texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same friend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll. Busey finds it spark and ignites it, his passion is clear and contagious. He really plays the guitar in the movie and sings, it's not overwhelmed with Holly's recordings. Busey was a young man in Hollywood in the 1970s, a struggling actor and so much or so a struggling rock musician. So he gives a good performance, because although he is not Buddy Holly, he is in a similar situation. <br /> <br /> His first song is the old Les Paul classic, "Mockingbird Hill" and he forced the country to nail it. Next is a kid looking for a bop, and against his two group mates (in fact, the Cricket were 3 guys, but the acronym works well for the movie's limited narrative). He leads them in "Rocking with Ollie Vee". The kids love it and the parents hate it. The DJ at the rolling lane taps it and it is released later in New York without Buddy Holly, even knowing it's ever been recorded. This leads to the funniest scene in a movie full of humorous moments. An official CD player from Buffalo calls Buddy home. The DJ plays for 12 hours "It's the day" and goes for 24 hours. Police hit the station's barricade. Holly is confused, but when the dust settles, he is very excited. He tells the boys, and their meteoric rise begins. Dan Stroud as drummer and Charles Martin Smith as the bass guitar make the band look good and have good chemistry with each other. There are problems, but not a remaining drama that occurs in most rock (all?) Biopics. The movie doesn't manipulate you either. Your emotions are rising, but they are not manipulated. When the Cricket on the Apollo stage rises in Harlem, the first white group will ever play, then jerk into an electric charged performance of "Oh Boy" and conquer the audience, my rock and rolling ass have astonished and shouted. Then Busey and the boys make "It is so easy" sound school and more soulful than I might have believed. <br /> <br /> Anyone with a fluent knowledge of Buddy Holly's story will know where this movie will end. Holly died in a plane crash with Richie Valens and the Big Bopper road too young. We know, as the audience knows, the movie is so well written, directed and lovingly acted that we almost forgot it immediately. The movie is not about his death, it's about his life and his place in rock and roll history. The movie ends with his last performance and it is a good fifteen minutes from Busey who is eliminated by the ghost of Buddy Holly. I was glad to hear him end up on "Non Fade Away", my favorite of his songs. The movie freezes before the end credits with the information about the plane crash, but I barely noticed it. I was still thinking about how good that last song was.
