I first looked back in the early 90's and immediately fell in love with it. Richard Benjamin and his wife, Paula, made the 1981 movie on the 14th of 1981 before making this film in 1983. I think they work pretty well. together. This movie made me laugh several times. It also has a young molly ringwald, which was in the late 1980s going to do movies as beautiful in pink and sixteen candles. It's nice to look her a little younger. Not seen by many people. I don't even think the average movie lover ever heard of this movie. But when I first appeared, I was glad I did. I gave this movie 10 out of 10 stars as I think it is a fun movie that the whole family can enjoy. Lastly, I would like to say that it is not available on DVD, so I picked up a VHS copy on ebay, so if you are interested, you can probably find one there. $ 20- $ 30 dollar range, but I thought for $ 12 dollars. I wish they would eventually release it on DVD.
