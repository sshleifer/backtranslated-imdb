I must admit, before I watched this movie, I thought, this is one of those smooth love stories where everything goes well and foolishly. but I was wrong when I actually sat down to see it. I found it to be a really good story about a family going to a dance park for a 3 week holiday and finding the youngest girl, baby, love, but it's hard to get there with her newfound love because of disagreements with her father. But along the way, another dance instructor helps and runs the whole relationship ... A real heartwarming movie, like no other. <br /> <br /> 10/10
