This satire is really really dead, and no one is spared. But although this movie has a lot of laughter in the foolish story and the grotesque imitation of Hitler (here cleverly renamed "Hynkel" and speaking in a hilarious kind of pseudo-German), the general tone is pretty sad, perhaps because of the movie its place in history. And the actors aren't even exaggerating as much as I think. One of the greatest movie moments of all time must be the Jewish barber's final step, if it could only end in that way. It's not even the character who speaks more, it's Chaplin who says something he really wanted to say. If you ignore the technical aspects, the movie does not feel dated or old, it actually moves beautifully. And the sharp humor we find anywhere in this work will never die. The only thing I don't mind is the slapstick, but it only comes with the era I suppose. It is an incredibly daring, harsh attack on fascism. It's so hard to keep beating after all these years.
