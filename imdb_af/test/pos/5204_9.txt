I recently watched this movie hoping to see an accurate portrayal of the bloodiest battle of the 20th century. I have what I expected and so much more. Just to think I got this movie through luck before I heard it before. It is a German film made in 1993. So I can't be surprised that it's almost completely unknown to modern American audiences. It's a pity that it's really a remarkable movie, I dare say it's as good as it isn't, then Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Apocalypse, and All Western on the Western Front; all are iconic war films. <br /> <br /> 1942: World War II is in full swing. Nazi Germany has flown over Europe and parts of North Africa, and Adolf Hitler commands the full-scale invasion of the Soviet Union. A fatal move that ultimately defeats Nazi Germany. In the early stages, the invasion goes well and the German armies conquer large parts of the Soviet area, but a critical battle comes at Stalingrad, a city that has great symbolic and strategic value. The battle is soon in a massacre of epic relationships, a nightmare for both German and Russian soldiers fighting. About to take the city, the Germans suddenly become counter-attack by the Russians who eventually cut off the entire German 6th Army in Stalingrad. To make matters worse, Russian winter comes, causing incredible suffering for the Germans. This whole struggle is seen through the eyes of a few young German soldiers fighting for survival, not only against the Russians and the harsh winter conditions, but also against their own Sadist officers who are merely medals and glory and the generals who dislike give on the average foot soldier. <br /> <br /> This movie will haunt me for a while. The German soldiers on whom the film is concentrated are so young and naive, then their humanity and common sense are stripped of them, and you really feel sorry for them because they are not often portrayed in the demonic Nazis in film. Everything they fight is no longer important, and everything they believed was broken and after they fought a gruesome fight against the Russians in Stalingrad, we see them worsening further with the onset of Winter causing much to death freezes. The Battle and Winter scenes were like a terrible nightmare, but it also felt that way. It's incredible, in the beginning we see young men in the forefront of their lives, and in the end they have stripped off shells of their former selves. After witnessing so much blood expectation, these men only lost their will to live, it was very sad. When there is a moment of hope, they are betrayed by Hitler, who eventually leaves these men to a terrible death, which is just one of Hitler's crimes slaughtered by the Russians by the Russians. , abandon. <br /> <br /> A good anti-war film portrays the horrors of war and that is what this film does. The battle for the tractor factory order is the closest thing to hell on earth, but it's really what The Battle for Stalingrad was. The German and Russian soldiers were portrayed with humanity. It was just the bad apples (specifically on the German side) that sentenced the men. Bottom line is this movie is great because we see men breaking down physically and emotionally during the war. We all have our borders and these men are pushed far beyond their borders in the most deadly battle of our time. What the average foot soldier at Stalingrad endured was beyond imagination. Even if they survived everything they saw and did, they would have shaken life. <br /> <br /> Stalingrad shows us why War is hell and what looks like hell.
