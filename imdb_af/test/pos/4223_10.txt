The success of SCREAM gave birth to a whole new horror movie wave. I'm happy with it, as a big fan of horror, and I love most of the new horror movies. BOC is a huge pack of horror. Colorful, fast and original. I see this movie more like opening a new trilogy (much like Episode 1 and Aliens: Resurrection), as it comes with a new twist. Instead of focusing on the little boy-killer pop relationship, we have a twisted couple about couples here. We have the lovely young lovers as opposed to the killers crazy pop-size lovers. Very inventive!
