This movie is great - especially if you enjoy visual arts. The scenery that the two girls paint and photograph is beautiful. The story is both funny and horrible. <br /> <br /> People who hold European films and art films will love this movie. It's really an art film - it has a lot of art in it. Go hire it. <br /> <br />
