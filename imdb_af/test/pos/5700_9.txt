What a wonderful documentary - I sat and thought it would be a rehash of the bitchy stories in Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, but it's actually a clear, glorious celebration of a strange and twisted era that is truly a real good movies. What struck me was the lack of bitterness in the director interviews, as the film industry is now sucking in a big way. Instead, people like Friedkin and Coppola's eyes look positively glittering to remind their glory days. The footage of an audience coming from a daily performance of the Exorcist was priceless. "It was traumatic," one guy says. A great cover for late Ted Demme, an exciting movie, I just wish it was longer - I could've put it through a three-hour cut.
