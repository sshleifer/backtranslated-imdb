Not a treasure, but a good movie to see once or twice. Bill Macy shows he can do more than just do it; His writing was pretty good. Great supporting role, especially Jamie Cromwell as the private personality. <br /> <br /> The greatest power of the movie is the work of Macy, reminding us of his Jerry Lundergaard role of Fargo. He has many scenes where he is very funny as a clever, manipulative and deceptive character. It is nice to see that he is a weasel, and for a while I was glad that things turned out well for him. *** out of four.
