I read the movie and thought it would be nice, a good Saturday night movie. I didn't expect anything, thought it would be mostly fluffy, but hopefully not a totally bad experience. I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was perfect, most of the actors were exceptionally good and it flowed nicely. Ash Christian was perfect, his ability to touch an awkward moment was nice to see. He could turn this character into something we've all seen before, but instead done away with stereotypes and focused on the whiteness of character. It was great to see Jonathan Caouette again, I didn't know what he would do to Tarnation. Ashley Fink is a jewel, a great young character actor who hopefully will get more work. <br /> <br /> There are moments in the movie that could use a little work, but not a bad time at the theater. My friend described it as a gay Angus / Napoleon Dynamite, but it's more than that. It's a character study of how to become gay in a small town, the pain is there, but the humor behind that pain (which only makes the age clearer) is enhanced. Looking forward to seeing more of Ash Christian, Ashley Fink and Jonathan Caouette soon.
