at least for me. and rather unexpectedly - as subject. A movie that lets you find out about your beliefs, your life, your approach to everything. that helps you see the world, we live through a lens - or a multitude of lens ... a moving, surprising and ghostly movie. <br /> <br /> This is one of Kevin Spacey's greatest achievements ever. Jeff Bridges has a very good health. There is no false note in this tango. It's a perfect dance. perfect 'to the end. <br /> <br /> What reveals the end? Well ... everything you want ... <br /> <br /> A movie one will want to see again. maybe not immediately. maybe after a few days. months. year. but it's something to go - or come back to.
