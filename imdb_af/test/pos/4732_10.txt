If you appreciate your freedom! <br /> <br /> For the first time, I was seriously interested in The Branch Davidian debacle after reading an article in the British magazine The Fortean Times. To learn more, I rented this documentary and looked at it, I was amazed at what I saw. This movie has reached my interest in the subject and since then I have read several books on the subject. This movie is a must see for people who only know the facts reported in the so-called "mainstream" media. The baldfaced lies, double talk and contradictory statements made by officials and politicians shown in this movie will make you think twice about calling people who question governments' actions in this fake nuts "loonies" and "coke" . <br /> <br /> What is frightening is that I know some people who love themselves openly with "liberal" intellectuals and freedoms who are still convinced that the government has done the right thing at Waco and refuses to do so. watch movie or read any of the books on the subject. They insist that it is not worth their time, because it is propaganda of popularity, Clinton hates, religious fanatic, right-wing anarchist nuts. One publication by an organization consisting of so-called "big thoughts" claiming the promotion of "reason", "common sense" and "rationalism" condemns the film and claims it would poison people's minds and strongly suggested that this film be suppressed. . They even indicated that the Davids had it. I won't call his name, because I'm a coward. If you are one of those who read this (of course you will never read it), I can only say it is a pity, you will not open your mind.
