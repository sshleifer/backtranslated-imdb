People should give this opportunity a chance. The people who write bad reviews (there are very few of them) are clearly people who have not seen many episodes. One really has to sit down and pay attention to this show to appreciate it. All the characters are realistic because they have so many mistakes. They make mistakes, but these are REALISTIC errors, which is an unusual thing to see on television today. Also for the most part, the play is excellent. Lauren Graham was caught for six years by an Emmy. Someone should give this woman the credit she deserves. The same goes for Kelly Bishop who plays Emily Gilmore so perfectly. It is also nice to see a show that a young girl can have in the middle of it and not be filled with teenage anxiety. Rory is a smart girl, who is not much seen on television either. If only other shows can capture the wholeness of this show ...
