A MUST see documentary .-- This movie has so many things to consider while watching it. It was a great documentary story of a 15-year-old black child, Brenton Butler. He accused him of murdering a white tourist in Florida. It shows how the police took statements from the man of the dead woman about the description of the man who killed his wife. The man wanted to change some things to merge with what the police said the young man was wearing. Police are scared to investigate the crime. Brenton's lawyer Patrick McGuinness is careful to get information to help his client. He tells the viewers what he thinks and the strategy he is going to use with the police to show their incomplete investigation and complaints against his young client to confess him. The camera goes with McGuinness to where Brenton was being questioned. McGuinness also takes pictures of the room and how the sound is monitored. He asks a policeman at the stand and asks what the Brenton trial is saying to one of the investigators and he puts out their own words. McGuinness investigates with Ann Finnell wherever the police had to go and the things they had to do but did not. The film shows the Butlers as a loving Christian family who believe in their son's innocence and belief that God will release Brenton. They visit him in jail and pray with him to encourage him. There are scenes of group prayer for Brenton, the lawyers, the Judge and everyone involved in this case. I'm a white and I was surprised to see blacks in high police stations treating other blacks. It was very disappointing that the black and white police were staying together when they thought they got their husband. The police have a hard work and I believe most of them are honorable, not like those in this movie. I think it's a good movie for everyone involved in the judiciary, including Judges, Police and Attorneys and even potential jurists to watch this movie and learn from it.
