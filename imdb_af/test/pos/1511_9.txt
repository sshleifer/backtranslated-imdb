'Cat In The Brain' is a series of extremely violent sequences that are merged with a plot that feels more like an overview, describing the best-known years of film production by Lucio Fulci. The film can also be seen as a dark comedy of all kinds, effectively condemning the various claims that violent films cause violence in real life. Fulci goes beyond that, he throws himself as the star, the central figure of the movie that shows the audience who is the man behind all the film. "Cat in the Brain" is not about presenting a clear story and following it. Instead, it makes fun of some of the clich√©s that have been doing the horror genre for years. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci plays himself as a horror director struggling to keep his humanity completely. Years of violent filmmaking finally hit him. It starts slowly, steaks and meat in general begin to discourage him, his colleagues assure Fulci that all he needs is a little rest. But this doesn't help and soon the grotesque ideas for his movies will overwhelm his daily thoughts. In an effort to find a cure for his dangerous embarrassment, Lucio began to go to the local psychiatrist. Unfortunately, it is more wrong than good and Fulci is thrown into an even bigger junk, as the psychiatrist is a psychopath who mimics Fulci's real-life films. <br /> <br /> The movie keeps everyone The brands of Italian wrestling are good or bad, they are all here. So, any comment on the acting or technical aspects and budget constraints is quite irrelevant to the quality of the film. It's a visual experience, no doubt about it. Fulci throws in an incredible amount of violence, which almost exceeds what he has made. Amputee by chainsaw limbs, cannibalism, child murder, baptismal apathy, these are just a few of the very grotesque acts seen in "Cat In The Brain". Some of them are, of course, recycled from some of the directors' lesser-profile films, but they are not out of context and really feel at home here. As I have noticed, the movie is much better than a satire of the genre rather than a serious piece. The way some of the violence is presented helps to establish that idea. Such sequences shortly after climax are rejected by reality in the film, as they are revealed to be scenes in a movie directed by Fulci's character. This kind of movie-in-movie presentation slightly reduces the effect of the gore. But in no way does it make filming easy. Oh no, it's far above and above the levels of mainstream gore, and ghore will no doubt be satisfied. <br /> <br /> Lucio Fulci was a very polarized figure. People also hate his work or love it. "Cat in the Brain" will not convince one of Fulci's opponents in the opposite, but that's an interesting part of his filmography. One that fans should really watch.
