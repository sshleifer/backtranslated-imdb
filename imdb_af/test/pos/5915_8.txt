What you bring to the movie influences your view. I brought here to the Air Force for 30 years, and every time I see it, I am moved by the end. Would a 15-year-old boy who had flown into jets feel the same way? Yet I can only have that impact on me. <br /> <br /> Jimmy Stewart gives a wonderful turn - Jimmy Stewart. Being a pilot and an air force general, he probably came so close to being an expert on how a pilot would act as someone who lives. One cannot blame his delivery, or his actions. He's a pilot. It's a pilot. That's enough. <br /> <br /> --- Spoilers --- <br /> <br /> These are the final minutes of the movie my heart goes on. Lindbergh flies without radio communication and has no idea if anyone even expects him. When flying into Paris airport, the uncertainty of the landing field draws you. What is it below? Those moving circles that look like cobblestones or a grain field should make you wonder, is he in the right place? They go over and over, stumble over his vision until he gets low enough and sees that in the Paris night, which he sees, the light of the city was reflecting from the faces of the DUSKES of people waiting for him to land. .
