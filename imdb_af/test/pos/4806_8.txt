Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan are both fantastic in Johnny To's tough crime thriller who faces most Western shame attempts. Think of it as the Hong Kong 'Heat', just better! Everything about the movie screams class; from the performances to the soundtrack, the cinema. The tone continues to be serious, but the film has a good line in black humor, friendship and romance in its heart. Certainly, it becomes a bit ominous a little later, but it will be a hard-hearted viewer who didn't get to love this movie. Thanks, Hollywood hasn't yet (yet) redesigned and destroyed a classic. Do yourself a favor and see this movie!
