The Italian Job needs daylight and no experience is needed. It's a good matinee and a good afternoon at the movies. The plot is good, but the actual plot of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process. It's a car hunt, explosions and everything for the simple purpose of defeating the "bad man" played by Edward Norton. For Norton, he seems happy to portray exactly the same characters as his previous films like "The Score". Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts. Warning: If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie. If you are looking for entertainment at cheap prices then you need the Italian Job.
