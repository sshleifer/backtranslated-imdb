There are a lot of movies we say should be seen twice. In most cases it is mainly a recommendation: you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing, and watch it for the second time, help you catch the plot twists you just didn't see. However, it is different for Mulholland. The sequence that worked for me was: see it for the first time - spend a day in the internet trying to find out what it's all about - and see it the second time. Otherwise, you probably won't be able to enjoy this movie fully. Then you begin to understand that this piece is ingenious, the camera work is amazing and the aftertaste follows you for weeks. <br /> <br /> 9/10
