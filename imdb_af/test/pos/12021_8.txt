Although I saw this movie when I was very young, I already knew the story of Wild the Thief-Taker and Shepherd who got rid of the Newgate prison. <br /> <br /> Apart from the freedom that is right at the end, the film follows more or less faithfully on the true story. The temptation to bow down the facts that so-called so-called historical films are, resists this film and the filmmakers have to be praised for it. <br /> <br /> Of these performances there is hardly any poor performance, and Tommy Steele is ideally thrown. Also good is Stanley Baker, as the thief-taker and Alan Badel are good as always. <br /> <br /> Because the film clings to the facts, it makes it suitable to be watched by the whole family.
