The story of Tom Garner begins with his great funeral and is told by a series of elegant flashbacks told by his faithful lifetime friend Henry. Henry and his wife are debating whether Tom was a great man and a genius or a completely worthless crook. The film is beautifully written, performed and directed, and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br /> Tom was the wonderfully rich and successful owner of a major railway that dominated his board and competition and terrorized his employees, butchers. Tom's ambitious wife, Sally, was responsible for all Tom's success. When he met her, he was illiterate and completely satisfied with his work as a railroad railway. Sally teaches him to read and take over his trackwalker work while Tom goes to school. He started one step at a time through the railway hierarchy until he eventually took over as president. <br /> <br /> But as Tom becomes a businessman, his marriage to Sally gradually falls. His perishable son despises him, and he takes on a much younger woman, with predictable catastrophic consequences. In his business life, Tom is a total success; in his personal life, a disastrous failure. Like the Hearst figure in Citizen Kane, Tom symbolizes the best and worst of the capitalist system. <br /> <br /> Spencer Tracy is great in the role of Tom Garner and the business scenes depend on authenticity. Colleen Moore is also excellent as Sally; Both are beautiful in the multi-generation story. The film was written by Preston Sturges, but nothing like the screw ball comedies for which Sturges became known.
