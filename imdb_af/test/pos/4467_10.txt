This is Lucio Fulci at its best. If only all the movies he made were like that. <br /> <br /> This extraordinary movie is as intriguing as Dario Argento's "The Bird with Crystal Feathers" ... <br /> <br /> If you're an Argento fan, but you don't like Lucio Fulci films such as <br /> <br /> "The Beyond", "Manhattan Baby", "The House by the Cemetery" etc. do with the others ... that's what the Italians call "giallo" ... it'll be something like a "what-it-done" movie in a nutshell. <br /> <br /> You won't know who is the killer until the last moments of the movie. <br /> <br /> In addition, there is the plot: A manie living in a small town is killing little boys. A journalist (Tomas Milian), a sexy young woman (Barbara Bouchet), a priest (Marc Porel), his mother (Irene Papas) and a witch (Florinda Bolkan) are the main characters in this confused, bloody story. <br /> <br /> Talk about the actors, I want to say that Tomas Milian is excellent (as always), and Florinda Bolkan is fantastic is the town witch ... <br /> <br /> Want to know who is the killer? ... <br /> <br /> I can't tell you ... but I can tell you to see this movie! <br /> <br /> (10 out of 10) ... of course!
