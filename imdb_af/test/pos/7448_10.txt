I will start with an indemnity: This movie is NOT recommended for anyone who is interested or has never played the FF7 before it is watched. The film relies on the audience's knowledge of every character in the game to convey storyboard elements. And it does it very subtly. Do your homework before watching this amazing piece of CG movie and I promise it will be so much better. <br /> <br /> With this in mind, this movie has some of the most spectacular CG rows I've ever seen. The whole experience felt like an extra-long FMV sequence of the game, on steroids. Yes. The attention to detail in every scene, especially in the heavy action-oriented, is so impeccable that it gives me a sense of awe. <br /> <br /> I believe the soundtrack is simplified to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music. Again, for those familiar with the FF7 story and background, the music should not surprise anyone (although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompanies each scene and mood to the point where music simply enriches the animation). <br /> Once again, I only played FF7 once, and thoroughly enjoyed Square Enix's artwork. And this is the feeling in most scenes, choreographed and organized. Like a dance. <br /> <br /> In short, if you enjoy the music or the game Final Fantasy 7, this movie will blow you out of the water. If you're in the unlucky majority who didn't get the well-known FF7 on Playstation or PC, do it before watching the movie allow for an exponentially greater experience. <br /> <br /> Finally, I just want to know the quality of this movie animation. Characters move with fluidity. Every scene background comes to life and tells its own story. For those who criticize the thinness and dependence of the story plot, I urge you to review the animation. Face reactions, subtle clues that elevate another amusement over the typical narrative method of story plot rendering. <br /> <br /> Square Enix and the great Tetsuya Nomura have a new bar for quality animation and storytelling. Advent Children has introduced a new era for CG animations so that the subtleties that lie in each character can put volumes into and out of themselves. <br /> <br /> Thanks Square Enix. The guard was worth it.
