My husband received DVD from OBWAT for Christmas and it was the best gift we received! We see it every time we have to laugh and so far we've seen it 12 times! The scenery in this movie is beautiful and the music is excellent! We also bought the soundtrack and we play it in our vehicles and at home whenever we ever pick me up and that is also daily! If someone has a proposal for a good gift for movie lovers, this movie is it! The characters are hilarious, charms and their facial expressions are too funny to describe! I've always been a fan of George Clooney, but now I'm also a fan of Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) and John Turturro (Pete) and now they're looking for other movies! You must see this movie !!!
