Well, I don't know much about anything, but I liked this movie. In short, it was creative, humorous, simple and heart-warming. In other words, that was all it would be. <br /> <br /> The story is about a girl's first love, as the title indicates, and I have to warn you: don't expect anything challenging or challenging terms from the subject here. I mean it's a kid's picture. It's just a simple story, but it's well said, and it keeps your attention. <br /> <br /> In the end: it's short, it's funny, it's cute, it's simple, it's good.
