All those who identify it as a simple rip-off of "Elephant" - there are no other comments that you can make on their own merits as an individual movie (regardless of its apparent similarities with other movies). <Br /> <br /> All those who question the validity of the movie - in terms of its stereotypical characters (the mandatory gay, the jock, the disabled child, etc.) - I don't know how long it has been since you joined was not. school - but no matter how amateurish the acting may be - the events that go one way are surprisingly close to what may really happen. <br /> <br /> And all those who consider the movie so little: just six teenagers with The regular teenage anxiety that pushes one over the edge ... stopped anyone thinking, noting that the girl took her life, actually not one of those six !! As one comment points out, its screen time may be 2min maximum (excluding the final scenes). I think the point of the movie is not just to make a teenage anxiety issue, and how far it can take someone - but also that it's not obviously obvious that is always in danger of such an act to commit (suicide).
