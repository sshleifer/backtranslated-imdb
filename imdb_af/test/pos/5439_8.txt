Over the years I have come to be a fan of director / writer Barry Levinson and he has not let me down with this very funny look at politics. Popular TV comedian Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) illuminated the nation with its turbulent jokes about the country's state and elected politicians. Night after night he threw his fans into the islands; then the question is suggested that Dobbs runs for president himself. His manager Jack Menken (Christopher Walken) says so. Dumb's flippant truism flames a grass roots movement that puts him in the mood. Comedian to President-elect. Meanwhile, a young woman (Laura Linney) finds a bug in the computer system that will count the ballot coast to coast. My favorite order is Linney's collapse in the coffee shop. William's is completely hysterical with his quick quills. Other notes in the movie: Jeff Goldblum, Lewis Black and Rick Roberts.
