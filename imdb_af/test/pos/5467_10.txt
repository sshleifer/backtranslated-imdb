I saw this movie when it was broadcast in 2004. I have never seen it, but have often thought about it. It left such an impression on me. I've been looking for that lately. I finally found it and realized it was just made for television. The movie is fantastic - filled with great writing and acting. William Petersen is perfect, as always. This movie left me speechless and in tears. It is a wonderful story of faith, love and compassion. Does anyone know how to get a copy of this movie for my home? Is it possible with television movies ?? I really wanted to see it again. This is a must-have in my collection !!
