This mystery / psychological thriller is I think one of the best I've ever seen. All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes the nerve stars in the beginning by the strange events she is part of the cool star. You learn a lot about the right emotions of people in this movie, and much about the movie business itself. The movie movie in the beginning and by the game played by her by the "acting coach" is fascinating. Also the music by Mark Snow is probably the best score I've ever heard. You will not forget this movie!
