Hello I am John and I want to tell you everything my dog ​​was in this movie at the bottom of the screen. He was the well like one who would bite the man chain. My dog's name was Colin and he filmed for a week for this film. He was also in other things like crime watching uk and other small parts. he won some dog shows, but he is now dead, i miss him, he was a big, real and loyal dog and we got together some good times but he had cancer that could not be treated . The worst day of my life, I hope it will give you something to watch the movie when you watch it again. <br /> <br /> Thank you all
