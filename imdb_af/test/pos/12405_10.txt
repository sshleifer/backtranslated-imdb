This movie was so good that I didn't think I was actually looking at it. One intense situation after another glued me to the set. However, I would have liked to see Corey Feldman much more in this picture. He only steals every scene he is in. This could be my favorite big Corey show. The end was clever and unlike other films that are once again away from body parts of similar supporting characters, this film goes for it! I liked that it was not graphic blood and gore, but rather left the imagination's imagination. Bravo. I literally had to wipe my forehead during this particular torture scene with a paper cutter. Eventually, the film works because of its similar main character and the incredible presence of my everyday favorite bad guy, James Remar (48 hours, remember?) I strongly recommend this movie to anyone who wants a sweat. <br /> <br />
