I actually found out about Favela Rising via the IMDb website. I have a particular interest in Afro-Brazilian culture and films. Favela Rising is one of those gems that gives new meaning to human transformation. Beautifully documented and filmed by Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary is the story of Anderson Sa, a former Rio De Janeiro drug dealer who, after the death of relatives and friends, became a Christian, Malcolm X and Ghandi. Together, AfroReggae, a grassroots culture movement that utilizes Afro-Brazilian hip hop, capoeira (Afro-Brazilian Martial Arts) drums, and other art forms to transform the hopeless and most often angry youth into vibrant, viable, caring community of individuals. <Br /> <br /> A few years ago I remembered to do a show of City of God (Cidade De Deus) and walk out of the theater. The images were grim, but incredible and you could not hide your eyes from the screen. I remember how hopelessly some situations were in the Favelas and how decadent society was because of the governments' neglect. How drug trafficking was a way of life, the careless people of the slums were, because death was a daily occurrence. Like City of God Anderson talked about how the people of the favelas were also desensitized. He talks about the corruption of the police and how the communities are so immobilized by immunity and gangs that you could not visit relatives in other Favelas that you had to meet in a neutral place. Unlike the city of God Anderson Sa's footstool AfroReggae offers solutions to anger, hopelessness. <br /> <br /> There was one section in the documentary document where Anderson, in the spirit of a preacher, approached some youth and asked them to join AfroReggae. These dressed youth were so scared of daily survival and violence. Their role models were drug dealers and that is what they intended to be. Anderson said drug dealers didn't live very long. Of course, there was reluctance, but five months later he could come from the youth to join AfroReggae. <br /> <br /> The visual art in Favela Rising is surprising. It is clear to me that Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary are not only great storytellers, but also visual artists. This is a must see documentary! There are some very magical and transforming moments in this documentary. I don't want to spoil them. I want you to see it yourself. Please tell your friends, academics, youth counselors, family members about this wonderful movie. It will care for the world and our children. <br /> <br /> I'll give it eleven stars!
