I read the comment on this movie before I watched it and didn't expect much, but as a B movie it was a curiosity. I think you should be some kind of person to enjoy this kind of thing, but I thought it was wonderful. People should only consider it for the experience, because it is quite one of a kind. Don't expect much from it. The acting is poor, transitions are apparently done on a computer, etc. Definitely a B-movie, but it's really worth checking out. Very funny. Mild gore, and some dubious themes, so probably not something to show your Gran, but for the more adventurous viewer I want to say it's a must see.
