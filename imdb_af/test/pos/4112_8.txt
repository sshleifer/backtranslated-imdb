At that time I was 19 or 20 years old and I live in Salt Lake City, Utah, and I still remember the new dome theater, the 21st century. Exposed rocking chairs and a new sound system, large screen and large open space between the screen and the packaged theater. We've all felt the thrill of a new movie preview. I can still hear the opening of the trumpet and the clash of cymbals. I loved the interaction of characters and the filmed views. I know that Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some trouble with the lips sinking, but hey, that was a good feeling, was better about the movies! What I regret is the way they cut the meaningful heart out of it, showed the cut version and then called it a flop. I saw the cut version and I can see that it has lost its view of the vision in the preview edition. Yes, I imagine Peter's attempt at making love through music, but you know I didn't see it that way when I left the theater. When they questioned us while we were away, I regret any comments I made that changed the original. I liked it and still see it while listening to the music on my LP. Most of my family heard that I was singing a lot of the soundtrack and I could use the monologues in the movies in our games of "which movie is that". I wish a director's track on DVD was available. It's available on VHS, but it's not quite the same. I especially want a full, serious gentleman of the ring's style remarks about his origins, struggles and triumphs. Picky people should leave well enough alone. Bring it back !!!!
