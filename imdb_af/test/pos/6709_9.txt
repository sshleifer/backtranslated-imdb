Many people say the end didn't make sense, but it did. With the female vampire death, the link to the earth was broken and the ship kicked off and picked up hundreds of thousands of souls. Enough to redesign the hexagon cells and create new bullets. They don't seem to have carnal sex, like vampires of legend. <br /> <br /> Outer space vampire bats can be ridiculous, but killing them with a shot at a heart power center is consistent. All you can ask is consistency. The viewer must suspend unbelief, even for scifi. <br /> <br /> The only problem is to be a sword or a game, not bullets. It puts a supernatural twist that doesn't fit into the sci-fi. So it's a problem. <br /> <br /> The only major contradiction I found was killing the male vampires with the sword, but the soul of the girl and Carlsen went to the ship. I suppose the male souls also went up the ship, but not shown. <br /> <br /> What about all the people killed? Do they qui-powers ("souls") to the ship as discrete entities, are all the life forces merged into one, for use as the ship seems? In other words, all the human souls who have gone to the ship can be reborn as bats. <br /> <br /> The basic concept is no longer ridiculous as Star Wars "Force" or even reincarnation. <br /> <br /> This movie was over, kitchen sink (Dawn of the Dead meets Alien meets Dracula), but in many ways deep. It was also a beautiful love story. The beginning and the end were ethereal. It both started ("what happens to me") and ends as a love story. <br /> <br /> Most of the criticism on the movie is that it is bizarre. Approximately? Bizarre is an art form. As far as it is ridiculous, apply it all. The plague concept is much more interesting and subtle than the Aliens that kill people. Maybe they didn't need Patrick Steward's blood to form an image of the girl, but it was a very distant surreal scene. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie is hated is because of the end. But the end fits perfectly at the beginning. People are so wrapped up in the naked girl that they miss the movie's core. It's a love story, from start to finish. It starts with Carlsen and the girl on the alien spaceship and in the same way. So it fits perfectly. Most people are tied to the hero who kills the monster, and this movie did not end. That's exactly why I love it. <br /> <br /> Instead, it made a happy ending, with the 2 of them returning, to be born again. Way cooler than the hero kills monster end, but that's exactly why it's bombed. It was not a straight horror or even scifi / horror, but a love story, with a beautiful start and end. All the souls flashing on the ship. And the crystal room polishes with new life. <br /> <br /> Most people can't handle a love story, which also meets Alien Dawn of the Dead meets Dracula.
