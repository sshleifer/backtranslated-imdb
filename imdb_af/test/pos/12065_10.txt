Hilarious show with so many good stories that it reflects the world today as we know it. In such a funny way it literally stole my lagers for other performances. I laughed so hard that I just found another comedy show. The unique confessions of each character is an excellent original technique that only makes the show funny and very humorous. You may think that this is an average comedy program about the hard life with a family. This is what I first thought, but I found that it contains new and unique techniques that completely separate it from another average comedy program. Michael Rapaport is a star. I want to make sure this show is not canceled.
