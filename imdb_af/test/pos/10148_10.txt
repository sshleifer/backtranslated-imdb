1956's The Man who knew too much was extraordinary entertainment. For those who prefer the 1934 original, I will say that one is faster and wider. Even though the US version (the sky was banned!) Was a huge budget, but I believe it beats the British version out of the water. I think this is one of Hitchcock's 10 best-no-small performances as he has made over 50 movies and many of them were one of the best of all time. I find so many things to love: <br /> <br /> 1) James Stewart, America's favorite all-man for so many years, does a great job of playing the troubled father here. He can make any movie enjoyable, and with such a similar character in such a gripping story, he made me very intensely rooted. Leslie Banks in the original is nothing in comparison. <br /> <br /> 2) Doris Day. Yes Doris Day. Despite all the criticism directed at her, I think she makes the loving woman / mother a very sympathetic person. I disagree with the negative remarks about her character; Just because she is soft and gentle doesn't mean she is foolish and helpless. I don't want to spoil anything, but she makes an important discovery by herself after her husband has failed. She gives the story a level of warmth that just wasn't there in the first place, and for those who care, this version is the way to go. And I loved Que Sera Sera; I think this is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard and deserves his Oscar properly. This raised the film to another level. <br /> <br /> 3) The Albert Hall Series. I don't think it was too long; I think the tension has been building all the time until that awesome crescendo and Hitchcock's direction in this scene was absolutely brilliant. And the assassin was really scary. <br /> <br /> 4) The end really put a smile on my face; Even after the aforementioned scene was over, I found the rescue scene to be exciting and it was nice to see the beautiful family again. The last line in the movie is very amusing. I don't think the movie started slowly; Hithcock tried to get to know us and like the McKennas and he did a good job. I wasn't a big fan of the kid playing Hank, but I didn't have a problem with him. Since Hank Ben and Jo's child, I also cared for him; It's not like he was a brat or anything. <br /> <br /> I have found no major mistakes in this movie and so many great and lesser virtues. Away to fetch!
