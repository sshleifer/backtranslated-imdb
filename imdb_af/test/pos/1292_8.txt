Humphrey Bogart, in his first lead, looks very young, performs well, but has an outspoken lash that only occurred later in his career. Yet he is very good and very attractive as the idealistic young inventor of a new aircraft engine. <br /> <br /> Dorothy Mackaill is the right star here, playing a once rich woman torn between her true love for Bogart (he is also broken) and the comfort and safety of an older man (Hale Hamilton). <br /> <br /> Along the ride is Astrid Allwyn as Bogart's trampy sister, Bradley Page as her producer, Barbara Leonard such as the beautician, Jack Kennedy as Gilligan and Halliwell Hobbes as the faithful (and wise) butler. <br /> <br /> Both Mackaill (who was a star in silent movies) and Bogart tried to get a hold. in talks in 1932. Bogart was a slow-rising actor of the Broadway stage; Mackaill slips and will soon appear in slate-free production such as PICTURE BRIDES. Yet they are both very good here. Mackaill wasn't even 30 when she appeared in this movie!
