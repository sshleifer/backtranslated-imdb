This show is there with the best Comedys made in Australia, as it makes a lot of everything that many of our audience want. Of the best bits in the show is the ad path test that tests how an ad will do in real life. What is great about the show is how original it is and the fact that it has people (the chasers) who like to do what they do and who doesn't. This show has many bits and pieces in it that can kill someone like the advertising path test I've already mentioned. Mr Ten Questions where he really asks 10 quick questions for well-known celebrities such as Hugh Jackman and the Beach boys, temporary people. such as The Chasers Emmys and those who were there from the beginning, like What we learned about the current affairs. Overall, I give a thin 98% show.
