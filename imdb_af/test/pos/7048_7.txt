If you take the movie for what it is worth, you won't be disappointed. If you think Murray is supposed to win an Oscar for his performance and that is the type of movie you expect, don't bother it. It was funny when I saw it in 1979 and didn't lose its charm. Good, clean fun for the kids and sensible entertainment for the older people. The story line is simple and easy to follow. Murray did better, but it's his first movie. The movie reminds me of a time when we didn't need to entertain blood and bowel. Morty is the head thin and plays the part perfectly. The other advisers are typically established teenagers who want fun this summer. One nice thing about this movie, it has a message.
