1904. The North African nation of Morocco depends on an uninterrupted independence, as the various European powers - France, Germany, Britain, Russia, Spain and now the United States - have the influence of influence in the region. The Sultan (Marc Zuber) is a weak puppet; his uncle, the Bashaw (Vladek Sheybal), manipulated by the French and Germans, is the true force behind the throne. Carries Berber Chieftan Raisuli (Sean Connery), the leader of the Rif tribe and "the last of the Barbary Pirates", kidnapping an American missionary, Eden Pedecaris (Candice Bergen) and her two children and taking them hostage. Back in the US, President Theodore Roosevelt (Brian Keith) is threatening to raise the issue: "Pedecaris Alive or Raisuli Dead!" - See the problem as the perfect way to exercise his "Big Stick" diplomacy, although State Secretary John Hay (John Huston) is not as confident. The Raisuli, however, has less sinister plans for the Pedecarises, which in any case is more than capable of handling themselves. <br /> <br /> John Milius's great historical film, based much on a true story (ie, Pedecaris was a middle-aged man), is a wonderful part of escapism. It has some amazing action scenes, a spectacular, well-written script, a great role to enjoy with the material, and does not elevate its welcome like, say, "Pirates of the Caribbean" or "Lord of the Rings" "movies. It's not really an "epic" movie in the strictest sense, but it is one of the best pure action movies ever made. <br /> <br /> While the historical context is shaky, the storyline is interesting and, as some reviewers point out, it's even more relevant today than it was when it was made. As President Roosevelt says, "America is like a grizzly bear" - fiery, strong, but a little blind and reckless. By the time of the film's launch, America was named world champion as a superpower because of their overwhelming victory in the Spanish-American War - and Roosevelt seized this incident as a way to prove America's value. In real life it didn't work out so well, but it worked well. While writing from a right perspective, Milius's script is fairly accurate to assess America and its place in the world. He admires Roosevelt and his method of big stick diplomacy, and acknowledges (in the words of Roosevelt) correctly that while America will be feared and respected, they will never really be "loved" by the world, no matter what they do. And there are a few scenes like Roosevelt's target shooting of European leaders and the almost comical surprise attack by marines on the trumpet's palace. It shows America's reckless and violent side, while others - the climax with the Germans - show their heroism. br /> <br /> The historical / political context of the film is, of course, just meat on the legs of which is essentially an exciting action / adventure movie. There are some brilliant action scenes, such as Raisuli's rescue of the Pedecaris from double-crossing tribes, which contains some of the best sword games in any movie. The opening entrance of the Raisuli and the aforementioned march and the attack of the American Marines is brilliantly done bravura set pieces. And the last battle, which combines the elements of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Wild Bunch" while a great historical fantasy (a threefold battle between Germans, Americans and the Rifs), is an excellent increased adrenaline pumping sequence. <br /> <br /> The excellent cast gives some great performances. Everyone seems to have a fun time with the movie, and it shows. Sean Connery is surprisingly convincing as a Berber with a Scottish accent, but manages his interesting, well-drawn and chivalrous character who respects his hostage and disregards the modern, impudent warfare. Candice Bergen, an actress I have never loved, gives a good performance as the festive Eden Pedecaris, who is as difficult as her boss. Brian Keith is an incredibly convincing TR - you really feel he has been so, an athletic, blustering but hands-on and intelligent man with an admirable sense of self. The scenes of Roosevelt boxing and target shooting while discussing foreign policy are among the biggest "bad ass" moments in film history - and what can lines forget like "Why spoil the beauty of the thing with legality?" John Huston offers solid support as the tired, cautious Hay, acting as a perfect foil for the much more turbulent Roosevelt. <br /> <br /> Among the fine supporting role-players, best-known Geoffrey Lewis as Samuel Gummere, the cynical ambassador caught in the middle of political intrigue, and Steve Kanaly, as the gung-ho Marine Captain who is merry and argue) "Military intervention!" as the blunt and simple solution to the whole complex situation. Other well-known faces such as Vladek Sheybal, Nadim Sawalha, Roy Jenson, Larry Cross, Marc Zuber and Darrell Fetty also do good work, no matter how small their role is. Spaghetti West fans will recognize Antoine Saint-John ("A Fistful of Dynamite") as German general and Aldo Sambrell as one of Raisuli's tribal members. <br /> <br /> The wind and the lion are all around the world, a great adventure movie. It has something for everyone: wonderful rifle and sword games, lots of humor, a tough, demanding heroine (and her two cute children), a nice (as unprecedented) romance, and an interesting (as imaginative) political / historical context . It's not a masterpiece, but hey, it doesn't try to be. I give The Wind and the Lion a stir of nine stars and my highest recommendation.
