It may contain decay. <br /> <br /> It's just a good movie. Very good stupid things to laugh. However, don't watch the TV version, they cut out too much. Dom Deluise is quite nice like the mafia Don hired to kill Robin. All I can say about his ten minutes: it's a long drive from Jersey. You also have to love them to check the writing to make sure Robin gets another shot. Also: 12th Century Fox. <br /> <br /> Any bad stuff? The rappers at the beginning and the end look rather dated. The songs were rather lame. Once I watched this movie, I could think a few times more when they could throw in another joke or 2. <br /> <br /> Overall, however, a pleasant movie experience. A must watch for the comedy fans.
