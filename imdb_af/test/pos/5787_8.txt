The end of Suburbia gathers much of the concern with the upcoming "Peak" of the world's oil supply. As the world population grows, demand for oil and power demands. As our oil and power withdraw, we come to a peak in production. More oil is required, less oil is generated. The inevitable outcome is conflict and great change. <br /> <br /> This movie will be disturbing and worrying if you're new to the subject. You may react with anger and denial because the implications are so bad. It needs to be watched. In addition to politics, beyond optimism, mathematics is unmistakable. <br /> <br /> Suburbia is the focus, because our suburban living areas will be the ones most affected by the price of energy shift. While intuitive logic will tell you that the big cities will be the places to avoid during a crisis, the scattered nature of suburbia will make it difficult if it is not impossible to maintain an efficient community without our vehicles transporting us. . <br /> <br /> Peak oil is no longer a topic for discussion by survivalists and backwoods crazies. This problem will be sooner than we think. This film is a clear, coherent look at it.
