The funniest show was by Shalom Harlow, and Matt Dillon's supermodel girlfriend. She was more interesting to me than all the lead actors. This movie misunderstood it; even the most reliable actress of the century, Joan Cusask, could not rise over the ridicule of the plot. I enjoyed hearing the "Macho Man" by the Village People about the final credits. The rest of the movie might have been acceptable if it were to rise to that level of energy.
