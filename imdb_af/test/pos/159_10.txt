If you like Chan-wook Park, you know what to expect. His films are brutal, poetic, tragic and artistic, with splashes of very grim humor. THIRD is clearly Park's style, and I loved it every second, from the cinematography (every shot is wonderful and creative) to the story, which mixes the Shakespeare tragedy, murderous love, gothic horror and layered character drama. The characters are complex and there is a lot of moral ambiguity to go around. Even the most sociopathic character makes sympathy known. The direction is held and the performances are nuanced - such as SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, there are too many subtleties to go into the first viewer. Chan-wook Park is an intelligent, bold, consistently surprising movie maker. It's unpredictable - plays go from brutal and heartbreaking things to a moment's release. This is closer to LADY VENGEANCE than SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE as far as top and comics. But, like LADY VENGEANCE, it's incredibly rich, exciting and rewarding. <br /> <br /> If you love vampire stories (LET THE RIGHT ONE IN) or a fan of Chan-wook Park, you see THIRD must be obvious. Easy one of the best movies of 2009.
