This film regularly shows on the premium cable channels and I find that I am constantly watching it. The performances are wonderful and the material has happened so much that there is always something new to take away from the movie. Maybe I'm too often distracted when I watch movies at home, you know the drill, the dogs bark, the phone rings, the popcorn ends during the credits. But this film is about people and what motivates us, what makes us love, which causes the ripples between us and what inspires us. <br /> <br /> For me it's movies like The Love Letter that gives me the chance to watch new movies. Frankly, I'm surprised the movie isn't better known. I would like to see Blythe Danner and Geraldine McEwan in much more roles. They are a pleasure to watch. Kate Capshaw is wonderful and I had no previous idea that she would be. Ellen DeGeneres plays a role that is much more complex than just the comic relief. <br /> <br /> This film provides interesting visuals as a proper backdrop for the characters and their interactions. I find it refreshing every time I take the time to see it.
