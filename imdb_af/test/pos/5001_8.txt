I originally saw this movie while working in the summer supply as a musician. If you've ever done a work in the theater, especially at a summer stock theater, you'll really enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, there are a few moments of very bad writing in the movie, but overall it is a beautiful tribute to the theater and why people love it.
