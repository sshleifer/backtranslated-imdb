As I watched this movie again, I think it belongs to Hitchcock's greatest films. The first time I saw it, I was just blown away by the tension, action and images. It has the gripping end, the horrible murderer, the innocent man who has been estimated or victimized by circumstances, some good on-site shots, eg. the Jefferson Memorial in Washington and Penn Central in New York. It also has great supporting actors with Hitch's daughter Patricia in the role of the younger sister to Ruth Roman and the sturdy Leo G. Carroll in another of his Hitchcock movies. The merry-round episode near the end is one of the most nerve-wracking in Hitchcock's work. <br /> <br /> Robert Walker as Bruno Anthony (his last full movie) gives a good performance as the confused stranger on the train, living in the life of the unsuspecting tennis star, Guy Haines (Farley Granger), worm . Granger plays the good guy caught up in a common divorce. The movie opens with the camera showing the shoes of two separate men, as they leave their taxis to go on the train. Eventually they meet and the story takes over. The stranger takes an unusual interest in the tennis star and if the film continues, the stranger becomes a stalker. The action moves from place to place, including Washington, the fictional small town of Metcalf, the Forest Hills tennis championship, and a passenger train that takes the two leading men back and forth on separate missions. At the end, the speed of a tennis game is plunged into the plot, as they jump against time. The camera cuts to the faces of the athletes as they volley and serve in a remarkable series of shots. When the meticulous game is over, the climbs take place. Hitchcock has a love for trains and it's great to see Penn Station, long gone. Trains appear in the 39 steps, the Lady Vanishes, the Shadow of a Doubt, Spellbound, North at Northwest and this movie. <br /> <br /> This classic Hitchcock thriller took place at the start of a period of great creativity for the Master of Stress - the 1950s and I am convinced that it will one day be known in the Hitchcock Hall . .
