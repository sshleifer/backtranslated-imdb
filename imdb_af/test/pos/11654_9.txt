"Dead Man Walking" is a film that does not cover the death penalty, but about the people involved in a death sentence - the murderer, the families whose children were murdered, the nun being his spiritual adviser and what happens. It tells the story with little fanfare, but a lot of compassion and sensitivity. I have it on DVD, and every time I see it (not often it's never an easy movie to watch). I'm more impressed with what Tim Robbins and the whole cast did here. So revealing that it can be a documentary, so compelling, you can't throw your eyes away, so subtle and yet powerful ... "Dead Man Walking" is nothing short of a masterpiece. No matter if you are for or against the death penalty (or even have no opinion), this movie will definitely think about the issues. It takes a brave scriptwriter and director to face this material without flashing, and anyone involved in the movie pulls it off - there is no single fake scene. A masterful movie, but don't expect to look light. For some, the final scenes can be graphical if anything imaginable, even if no blood or violence is shown. You are recorded in this movie and become a participant, and there is a character for just about everyone to identify. 10/10.
