I think when I saw this episode, I saw enough Twilight Zones to find out before the time. There is this strange combination of characters that find themselves at the bottom of a cylinder. They are good until a war soldier appears in their midst. This is his first guideline to escape and thus he collects the forces and puts them to work to reach the top of the cylinder. There is much discussion about purpose and reason and speculation about their past, but no one can remember anything. They represent different jobs: a piper, a ballerina, a clown, a man in a dressed hat. Why are they there? This leads to an adventure and is finally solved, but I think I had a good idea before it all happened.
