A soft story shining on anger, with a delivering message and glorious celebration. Photography was performed wonderfully well. Cinema writers look at this kind of movie to grind their craft, not just for the purpose of improving a story, but for the right camera vocabulary to boost emotion. To feed the soul is by definition what this movie addresses, but with an elegance and grace of delivery it no longer happens, at least with this degree of taste, restraint and finesse. If you care about story and character development, it's also a good movie to watch as an example of what simple lines and the right delivery can do to completely fill in a character's impression. Match everything with a movie score that is almost minimal in nature and also perfectly designed, and you will get this movie.
