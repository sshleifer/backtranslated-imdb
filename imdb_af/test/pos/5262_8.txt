A fantastic comedy drama about the powers of friendship. Despite being a remake of a 1939 movie of the same title, it will probably be compared to Sex And The City. I wouldn't quite compare it. The story begins with Mary (Meg Ryan) who looks after life, most women will envy, she is happily married, has a good daughter, good friends and a good home. But Maria's perfect life is not what it seems, when she discovers, her husband is out of hand with Crystal (Eve Mendes) of Zach's deception. Mary is surprised and does not know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing), and Alex (Jada Pickett Smith) are trying to be there for her anyway. I really don't want to give away anymore. But I found it enjoyable and I am a man. Meg Ryan is wonderful, it's nice to see her again on the screen, after a series of flops. And the rest of the movie is also great, including Eve Mendes and Crystal. Just a pleasant, loud comedy.
