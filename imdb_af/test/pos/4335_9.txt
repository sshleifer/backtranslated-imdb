It's an amazing fun action / exploitation 80s rocker. Charles Bronson rules Paul Kirsey. The villains are hilariously bathed. The soundtrack, by Jimmy Page, is nice. Alex Winter (Bill or Bill & Ted) is wonderful as one of the punks wasted by Bronson and crew. Crew? Oh, these are the weakened villagers who work with Bronson to win the streets back. The whole movie is enjoyable, with the last half hour or so in a non-stop action and chaos. 9/10
