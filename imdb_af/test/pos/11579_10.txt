A friend of mine asked: "No one should be pro-euthanasia to keep this movie? Is it a mistake of the movie to determine that most quadriplegics want to end their lives?" Interesting questions. <br /> <br /> As far as I can see (correct me if I'm wrong), there is only one quadriplegia that wanted to end its life in The Sea Inside. Ramón Sampedro also remembers it in the movie. It is he who wants to die. It is he who is fighting for his right to decide his death. He speaks for himself and not for other quadriplegics. Although his pioneering work, depending on his perspective, may be beneficial or detrimental to quadriplegics under the road, his primary goal is personal. But one thing this movie does (my opinion anyway) is that it forces us to ask the viewers to ask the distracting questions my friend is so brief. <br /> <br /> After my first performance at The Sea Inside, I walked home in a conflicting blur. I struggled to reconcile with this exciting idea; why would Ramón die? Given the love, care, and sacrifice that unconditionally plunged Ramon through the people around him, why would he have held himself to his painful decision? Then, on my second show, a shared thought between Ramón and the lawyer entered my consciousness. It cast a perceptible observation: "... total dependency comes at the expense of intimacy." Most people crave such intimacy. Of course, how much we appreciate such "needs" depends largely on the individual. <br /> <br /> As a person with a family biased sensibility, I experienced a lot with the caregivers in this movie. Why can't Javier consider the sacrifice and love of his family and friends? Is he blind to that? I won't think. The miracle of The Sea Inside is therefore his insightful portrayal of a very humanistic rope. When faced with the guardianship of a healthy but incompetent lover who had a calm, conscious and rational intent to die, what is the right thing to do? Is caring and keeping this lover alive, against his or her will, a pious gesture? Does it show the value of our love? Or are we just stroking our "selfish" fears of irreplaceable loss? With so much understanding given to caregivers, would their invalid charges not, by subjecting themselves to the total dependence on others for survival, be an excessive act? Rhetorical or not, how much is the dignity of an individual? Is (or dies) with dignity a privilege or right? If we really give one's attention and love, should we also respect their ultimate life decisions (as in death)? A flash of questions the movie might have asked, answers that I'm unable to provide. <br /> <br /> In our quest to intellectually break down the merits of pro-life or pro-choice, we run the risk of ignoring a sea of ​​gray, weakening the most affected people, the caregivers and those who care for them. The sea then sought to present the delicate but complex relationship dynamics between them. Intuitively, this movie understands one thing; that the nature of "sacrifice" is never one-sided. In this queue we should try not to win arguments, but to determine and hopefully determine who the "stronger" party is to bring that sacrifice. <br /> <br /> The Sea Inside is a sobering movie. It opened my eyes to things I didn't want to see. And for that I am grateful.
