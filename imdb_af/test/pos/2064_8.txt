A small-town teacher (Geena Davis) slowly realizes that she has suffered from amnesia and is really used to being a secret murderer! Soon there are men after her and a small private detective (Samuel L. Jackson). <br /> <br /> These were action packs, with some special special effects and very funny one-liners (especially from Jackson). Although the action can sometimes be a bit stupid, who cares? After all, movies aren't meant to be a good time? <br /> <br /> Craig Bierko is fun as a ruthless villain. The movie itself was a good time. Don't just expect to think too much about it, because then, if you take it too seriously, the movie won't be fun, but stupid. Instead. <br /> <br /> This movie is not called stupid or any other bad name.
