As long as you don't mind paying a little more attention to what you normally can do for other movies, it's one of the best thrillers you'll ever see. The movie shows an incident that may occur in real life; nothing in it actually seems to be fictitious. It also illustrates how people can respond in real life. <br /> <br /> In fact, it looks so good that it looks like real life. Combine that with the lack of soundtrack, and you almost have the best news-like movie you've ever seen. Jane Fonda and Jack Lemmon are particularly good at this masterpiece in the late seventies, which is excited about concerns and sincere tragic pity. I recommend it to anyone who likes thrillers.
