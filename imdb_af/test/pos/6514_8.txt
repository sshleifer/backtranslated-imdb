I love this movie, one of my favorites. Ann Blythe as Sally O'Moyne is sweet and hard. She believes that the prayer to Saint Anne will solve all her and her friends' problems. The sub-plot of the bad guy to get her father's property is funny and clever. Her brothers are what kind of brothers a girl would like. Also look for "Tannie Bee" as her mother, a strong Irish woman who did not leave her home for bringing in her family. They no longer make them like this, it sure is.
