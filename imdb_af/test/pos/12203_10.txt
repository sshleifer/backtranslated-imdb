A new and innovative show with a good throw that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Lake Bell is wonderful .. it's too bad her other show "Miss Match" has been canceled. I'm just glad she came back to "Surface". I can't wait for the return of "Surface". This show is really something unique to watch. With an ominous underwater world related to Jurassic Park, this show keeps you wondering what next. Nim is cute, even if he is going to turn into something bigger and more ominous. There are so many generic performances out there that look just like old topics. When something like "Surface" comes together, you just have to "THANK YOU!" Say.
