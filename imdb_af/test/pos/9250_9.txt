I've always been a fan of the show, so I'll admit I'm biased. When the show career ended, I felt that too many questions remained unanswered. This movie made me feel like closing. To see all the people I followed in the past few years was ultimately the most rewarding. I heard that this is probably the only Homicide movie we can expect. If so, it's the right way to go. This movie is sometimes dirty, sometimes disturbing, but always satisfying. If you've ever been a fan of the show, watch this movie.
