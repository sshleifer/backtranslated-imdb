When I first heard of this movie, I was slightly interested. The plot looked like an opportunity for hilarity and Bam Margera as an actor and director was like something good. When I found out filmmaker Ryan Dunn, I was even more interested. (I was a fan of Homewrecker when it was. Yes, I'm that lamb). However, I didn't have much confidence that it was good. When I sat down to see it, I was afraid I was wasting my time. <br /> <br /> But even just five minutes it became clear that I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I think the comedy of this movie was fun and definitely not suitable for all kinds of people. The acting was pretty good, much better than my expectations. I thought it was pretty easy to link to Ryan's character, which gave the movie a center of credibility. This is the key in a movie that is as indignant as it is (and probably I'm not a fan of Borat). <br /> <br /> The movie is not suitable for younger people, DUH, and will definitely create more if it is a fair share of uncomfortable tortoises than watched by parents. But it's a good one for you and your friends on a movie night.
