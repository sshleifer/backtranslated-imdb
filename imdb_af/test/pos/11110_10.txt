Celebrity, I think, was the best movie I've ever seen. In ways it was funny and dramatic, but it made a movie. True, it has some loose points, actually a lot, but I still think it's a huge movie. Some of the funny things happen in the audition at the beginning of the movie. I think it's hilarious when the girl tries to act O.J. Simpson in "The Towering Inferno" and Raul / Ralph went to each art section to say his father was good at each one. He says his father danced with the Rockets and Ralph left his scratch shoes. The Rockets, as far as I know, consist of women. And the crane shoes were just plain shoes with bottles at the bottom. Also, the man reading the lines of Juliet in the Romeo and Juliet was funny. One thing about the movie that just turns me on is the music. I've never heard anything !!! My favorite song is "I sing the Body Electric" and my second is the theme song itself "Fame". Irene Cara has a good voice and is a great actress. I like the way the film focused on many ethnic groups. It has shown all kinds of people actually in what is now known as the La Guardia Performing Arts School. This movie featured the triumph and trials of many young artists, including Angelo, Doris, Bruno, Coco, Montgomery, Ralph, Leroy, Hilary and Liza. They all had a difficult time, but it made their own way. This movie could have added about 30-45 minutes (before the graduation), but it's still my favorite movie, no matter what !!!!
