As I said earlier this year, in my review of Swordfish (written by this author / director / producer Skip Woods), this is a good movie. It is very high up in my crime movie list under Lock Stock & Two Smoking Barrels, Pulp Fiction and Snatch. Basically I think this movie is for me what Reservoir Dogs was for many people - a cult classic - although I prefer to compare it to Pulp Fiction. I mean, I never had much of Tarantino's first attempt, but I probably liked this one as I want Pulpfiks because it simply has everything that needs a classic. A great story and good actors. OK, the budget can't be as big as in, for example, Godzilla, The Avengers or Mission to Mars, but it's probably like hell beating the living shit out of those movies (and many others). <br /> <br /> The story of This movie is about a man named Casey (Thomas Jane), who settled with his wife in Houston. Unexpectedly, an old friend of his life comes by disrupting his life, revealing his secrets and basically making his life a living hell (and bloody). <br /> <br /> The film is very original and very bloody / sexually oriented. So based on the first and last quality, I can assure you that if you like this movie, you also want Swordfish, which of course has a much larger budget and more familiar faces than this one, but is just as good ( although not so bloody and not quite as sexual. I saw this movie for the second time last night and I really enjoyed it (again). I mean all the characters and actors are good, although I have to give very large credits to Thomas Jane and Paulina Porizkova, who were the best actors (and had the best characters) in the film. Also, I would like to thank Skip Woods for being so imaginative and original. Brutal, sexual, offensive ??? Maybe, but just as enjoyable and an exciting ride to the end. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
