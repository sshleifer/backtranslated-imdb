The Three Stooges have always been one of the many actors I loved. I love every one of the shorts they made. I love all six of the Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and Curly Joe)! All the shorts are hilarious and also many other great actors and actresses who were many of them in many of the shorts! In my opinion, the Three Stooges is ever one of the greatest actors and is the all-time funniest comedy team! <br /> <br /> One of the hilarious Three Stooges shorts is men in black. In this brief are Bud Jamison, Jeanie Roberts, Phyllis Crane, Dell Henderson, Little Billy Rhodes, Billy Gilbert and Ruth Hiatt. Acting actors are good, especially by Jamison and Roberts. There are many funny scenes here that I think most Three Stooges fans will love! According to me, this is one of the most different Three Stooges shorts. I recommend this one to everyone!
