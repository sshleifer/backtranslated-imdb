Enchanting. The best time to watch this movie is sometimes when unhappy or sad. It's all just as cute, just as the white bear loves the Queen secretly and finally gets her, the performance the two young actors of Gerda and Kai gave. It's music is also very nice. The two of us will always be one that is combined with sad piano tone. In some places it becomes very gripping. If one sees both parts immediately, he will see that the Snow Queen is not that bad. She only tries to surround Him with love in the wrong way. That night, this movie was here (first part). I just watched it because I was bored, but I loved it a lot more and was very angry when they didn't show the next part because of the pope's funeral. Yes, it was terribly sad for me. But when they said it would be next week, I was so happy that I had recorded it and now I'm happy to do so.
