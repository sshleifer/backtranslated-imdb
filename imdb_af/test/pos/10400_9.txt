Like a bunch of horror fans out there looking for the next big scary flick, we plundered the Asian horror market for everything we could get our hands on, without a dark-haired ghost woman being left untouched. We had good reason to do so, the Asian market created such terrifying wonders as Ringu, Dark Waters, Juon - the Remorse, and a Languages ​​or Two Sisters. By the time Takashi Miike started scratching the mop in 2003 with One Missed Call, the market seems to be drying out, leaving it open for ridicule and ridicule, despite the persistent steam-using Hollywood Remake Machine. Don't get me wrong, there were still very good Asian horrors made, such as Marebito and Shutter, to name but two, will stand a day as underage genre classics. But the long haired ghost woman definitely had her food at the party, and it was time to go home drunk! Then comes a movie like Noroi - The Curse. A movie that is clever enough to pay subtle tribute to the roots throws the rule book out of the window while it's done. What I will describe in terms of plot will probably make you think there is nothing new. The film is a documentary about one of Japan's top-notch investigators, as he receives stories and types on ghostly performances. He started investigating the claims of a woman that she often heard a baby crying in the house next door, but there was no baby there, except a middle-aged woman and her son. These two disappear sharply as the reporter flips his nose, but strange other accidents start to emerge. A psychic young girl, a mentally ill, a beautiful young actress who has a strange vision, many dead pigeons and a very sinister devil named Kagutaba, has made a frightening uproar in a small historic village led. <br /> <br /> To say even more to the plot, fun can ruin a little. The film is shot in a faux documentary fashion, featuring recordings of TV shows and news releases. The labels via captions let you know where you are in terms of the timeline. The film drew more than a few comparisons with the Blair Witch project, but apart from the shooting format and the horrible journey through the woods, the equation ends completely. <br /> <br /> What is refreshing about Noroi is how it doesn't hit modern horror audiences. If you expect a ghost lady to come out of the attic, look elsewhere. The film's strength lies in the slow, gradual build-up of terror, a terror so deep that it will stand for you for days. The climax is pretty damned, but just when you think the movie is over, you are treated to the "right" end when the credits start rolling, and sweetly holy, it's a killer. In terms of acting, it is usually convincing. You get a 'comedy' relief from the crazy, canned leaves that are brighter, but it quickly gets halfway through the movie. The movie also has a little 'nastier' feel to it as a lot of Asian ghostlyness, as there is also a violent streak for some of the events. Overall, Noroi is one who looks on your own, late at night. Not since my first viewing of Ringu ten years ago I was so beautiful watching a horror movie. It is one that will lead to you until it's too late, then it's under your skin. Just let yourself go completely to this one. And not a long-haired ghost lady in sight? No wonder it was barely released outside of Japan, let alone another American remake set up. Check this one if you can, essential viewing in my books!
