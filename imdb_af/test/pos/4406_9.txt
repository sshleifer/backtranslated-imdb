As someone who spent hours driving North London's stern in an effort to prevent the terrible congestion, this film immediately appealed. Throw my interest in what London was like in the late 70's and you have the basic premise for my version of TV heaven! On the paper, the movie has chosen all the right boxes, and just watched the "Knowledge", the real movie surely surpassed my high expectations. <br /> <br /> Visually, I was surprised how different London then looked back (I lived in Islington in the 90's, long after gentrification transformed the area). It really got stuck like grim, tatty and down-at-hell. London may still have bad housing offices, but the general feeling of the place is now much cleaner, brighter and more enjoyable (based on what this movie shows rather than my own memories). <br /> <br /> Regarding the story and the acting, good points are of course going to Nigel Hawthorne as The Vampire. Absolutely brilliant! He deliberately acts unpredictably and alternates between total straight face and surreal mind games to evade the Knowledge Boys, as he tests the test. <br /> <br /> All in all, it was an excellent, enjoyable trip back in a very specific time and place that I find endlessly fascinating. But even if you're not particularly interested in London in 1979, you still enjoy the witty dialogue and similar characters of "The Knowledge".
