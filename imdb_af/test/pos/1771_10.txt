I saw this movie when I was very young in Houston, Texas. I really enjoyed this movie, and I wrote to Jean Peters in Hollywood and I told her how much I enjoyed seeing her in this movie. She sent me an autograph photo. This movie is starred by Jacques Tourneur, and besides Jean Peters. It is also star Louis Jourdan, Debra Paget, and Herbert Marshall. It was released in 1951 and is 81 minutes long. Jean Peters was married to Howard Hughes. She also died in the Viva Zapata with Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn. He won an Oscar for the role of Zapata's brother (Marlon Brando who played as Zapata) (1952). And she also played a "Captain from Castile" (1947) with Tyron Power. Since then I've been trying to find a place where it's available, but so far I haven't succeeded. Anyone have any suggestions on where to find and buy this movie? This comment contains spoilers, I don't know.
