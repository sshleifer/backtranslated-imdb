Closet Land. The title itself expresses thoughts of secrets. And that's really what is at the heart of this Amnesty international movie. Government secret, personal secrets, both are integral pieces of this story. <br /> <br /> By far, the biggest play seen for too long was Alan Rickman and Madeleine Stowe phenomenal in their portrayal of a state investigator and victim respectively. With just the two actors in this unusual standard-length movie, it is immediately clear that both actors were dedicated and talented to draw the viewer into this tiny bubble of a world and close the door. <br /> <br /> A WORD OF WARNING ... <br /> <br /> What is not mentioned in the description of this movie is that there is a subplot dealing with child sexual abuse. While there is no graphic detail about the abuse, its nature can be difficult for some viewers to watch - especially the intensity of the movie as a whole. <br /> <br /> I'm not a big fan of Amnesty International movies, but this movie enrolled me because the play was so exceptional and I can't help but make this movie one of my personal favorites .
