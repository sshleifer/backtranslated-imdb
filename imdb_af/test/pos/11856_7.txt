Sophisticated sex comedies are always hard to pull off. Watch the movies from Blake Edwards, which is probably the master of the genre, and you'll find just as many misses as hits. Because if a film of this kind ever fails to work, it can never fall back on the tried and true toilet sex of a teenage sex comedy [ie "American Pie") or warm the audience with the sentimentality of a romantic comedy [ie Julia Roberts' entire career]. It can only sustain a push to the end and hopes the audience can appreciate the almost required irony of its resolution. <br /> <br /> Written by husband / wife team Wally Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, "Seeing Others People" opens with the fianc√© couple Ed & Alice [Jay Mohr and Julianne Nicholson] just seconds away from the back of the car them. As the frame freezes, we unexpectedly hear the thoughts and fears of both characters. From here on, we welcome the fact that the story of unfolding both sexes will enjoy a viewpoint. <br /> <br /> Two months shy of their vows, Ed and Alice are already looking like an old married couple. In an early bathroom scene, their actions only show us how comfortable they are with each other and how long they are together. So, when the line to forward the plot is pronounced - probably at least probably of the two - it is as if the relationship calls itself a change, even if it means its own destruction. <br /> <br /> Once all the ground rules are set [Ed cannot sleep with her mother, or not, Salma Hayek], the two go in their separate directions in the hope of finding meaningless sex to strengthen their relationship. Initially everything looks as planned, as their daily trysts only help to burn the passion between them. But predictably, as the deeper emotions of regret and jealousy begin to emerge, they soon find themselves separated and about to break. All of these actions lead to a resolution that you may or may not have - depending on your own degree of cynicism. <br /> <br /> For a comedy like this, you need a solid role with supporting characters, as strong as the clues. And director Wolodarsky disappointed. Here he cast two of my favorite actresses as sisters - Julianne Nicholson & Lauren Graham - and enabled them to play their strengths. For Nicholson, who has always reminded me of a young Shirley MacLaine, she brings an air of naive and vulnerable to Alice even when her actions look less like this. And, as for Graham, an actress who has proven herself able to perform an entire Howard Hawks ensemble, she steals every scene in which she is in an edgy "no BS" persona. <br /> <br /> Like the guys, Jay Mohr is useful here like Josh Charles. "Malcolm in the Middle" Byron Cranston must be applauded for the adoption of a British accent and let it all out. But the right show here is Andy Richter and his sub-plot with single mom, Helen Slater. While his scenes are almost in another movie, they are by far the funniest, and his dead are stolen by the show. <br /> <br /> For an independent production, 'Seeing Other People' feels more personal and introspective - something that would be remarkably absent from a great Hollywood movie of this kind. Not to mention that this movie also has really funny moments - unlike most Hollywood comedies in general. <br /> <br /> Rating [on a 5 star system]: 3 1/2 stars
