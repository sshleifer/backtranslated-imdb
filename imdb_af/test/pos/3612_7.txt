Here is a well-made war story, beautifully shot and benign. The portrayal of the Italian and German occupation of the Greek island of Kefalonia was well done. John Hurt as Pelagia's father and the island doctor is wonderful, Nicolas Cage does a good job as the title captain. Penelope Cruz does a great job of being beautiful and batting her eyelashes at Cage. There is heroism and humor, there is drama and romance, and it's all on an idyllic island. Strangely, a very similar, or should I say almost identical, storyline, with the same characters by The same series of events is told in a novel by the same title, written by Louis de Bernieres. This wonderful historical novel tells the story of beautiful Pelagia, daughter of Doctor Iannis, and their life on Cephalonia during World War II. Pelagia's fianc√©, local fisherman Mandras, involved when the Italian army in Northern Greece invaded Albania in false pretenses. When the Axis finally reigns, with a great help from the Germans, a garrison of Italian soldiers is stationed on the island and Captain Corelli plays a major role in keeping the profession peaceful. As Mandras joins the parties, the charming Corelli and his mandolin quarters with the doctor and his beautiful daughter. Of course, this makes it a novel about love. But it is also a war novel, a summary of Greek history, a story of communist uprising in post-war Greece, a portrait of the madness of Mussolini, and above all an ode to island life on Cephalonia. <br /> <br /> Some of these elements return to the movie, but in general it is an impossible book to film. I'm glad no one ever tried. <br /> <br /> However, the movie 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is worth seeing. Just make sure you read the book * to * you see the movie.
