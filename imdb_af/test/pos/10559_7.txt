I watched this series for Tipping the Velvet, for which I gave 10/10 degrees. I read user comments on this and I expected an equally good series, or if possible even better. At this point, I must emphasize that this series is good, and it definitely caught me throughout and therefore worth looking at. However, I did not enjoy it as much as typing the Velvet for the following reasons: <br /> <br /> 1. Less passion, love and related sexual content. There was surprisingly little emphasis in these elements, which I kept as integrals for a love story. Vingersmid felt like a watered down version of Tipping the Velvet. <br /> <br /> 2. Similarly, as in Tipping the Velvet, the story had three parts: the beginning, a shocking second and the end. The second part had to be the highlight of the story (as in Tipping the Velvet), but instead it was almost completely skipped, perhaps due to the inability to make shocking but credible asylum content. The series had to be in three parts, with two cliff hangers, with much more focus on the second part. <br /> <br /> 3. Almost no weight was given to what Fingersmiths were and how they influenced their personalities. I found it rather annoying that the series did not address such a central topic correctly. <br /> <br /> 4. The end was much faster than in the Tipping the Velvet. Fingersmith left several interesting plot lines open. <br /> <br /> Despite these shortcomings, Fingersmith is a good series and worth 7/10. However, this is not a classic like Tipping the Velvet.
