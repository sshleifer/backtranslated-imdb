The second in director Cohen's trilogy of World War II comedies (the other is to the death of our part and Adolf Hitler - my part in his demise) is a film version of the BBC's long-running (and much-loved) situation comedy. Like most television program transfers, this movie suffers from a lack of plot and is more a collection of sketches. Some of what works better than others, for example, the scene where a high-ranking army officer glides over a river is a memorable, surrealistic moment. <br /> <br /> The joy of this movie is the portrayal of a never-ending past and an England that is defined by picturesque countryside and offers the opportunity to veteran theater actors such as John Le Mesurier's greatest see scroll roller. Arthur Lowe is great as Captain Mainwaring, a bungler, who, when the chips are off, shows great courage and saves the day (the climax is probably the character's greatest moment). <br /> <br /> Of course, episodes of the television series are funny, but as an introduction to a British legend, you can't find anything better.
