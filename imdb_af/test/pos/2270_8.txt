Author Jonathan Safran Foer, author of the author, turned writer Liev Schreiber (the sum of all fears). This story of travel and self-discovery is highlighted by strong ensemble performances and sharp direction with a storyline that enriches and enriches the soul. <br /> <br /> Jonathan Foer (Elijah Wood) is a young man who saw his grandfather, Safran, over. Jonathan has a peculiar habit of taking small objects and life's little memorabilia and sealing them in plastic bags to show them on his wall. Safran gives Jonathan an old photo that leaves a young Safran next to a beautiful girl who saved his life many years ago. So Jonathan starts on a long journey to track this mysterious woman in Ukraine without knowing whether she is still alive. He acquainted with the help of a young, guide, Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his grandfather (Boris Leskin) to bring him to his goal. Initially, the voyage goes dead and falsely, but if the group reaches their target, the men find themselves amid the ruins of a dark chapter in history with the memories of war and the past of a non-existent city. There they find their own different destinations and they will be forever changed by what they learn. <br /> <br /> This movie feels it is directed by someone who knew how to get the most of his actors. Sometimes the movie is spoken in Russian and looks like a strange movie. The title itself is a play about self-discovery. It is a considerate move of one man in his past, and his past is ironic of his companions; Jonathan's obsessive journey is also an emotional journey for Alex and his grandfather. This is a story of long-distance connection and the debt one has to bear for a lifetime. By the end of the film, these characters experience all the life-changing events that will permanently change their lives. It proves that memories can be powerful in traumatization and also cleanse the soul. It's also about the legacy and how others see an event or a person in the past. Alex finally sees his grandfather in a completely different light. Even our perception of these individuals will be changed by the end of the film, which is a tribute to a story that is well-spoken. <br /> <br /> The story is deceptively simple. It functions as a road trip film (such as The Straight Story) combined with an interesting puzzle story. It really involves very low emotions and subplots that range from past to present. Elia Wood (Sin City, The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind) has chosen a wide variety of roles since splashing into the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Here he does a good job with what is essentially a minimalist role, with not much to show. Eugene Hutz and Boris Leskin cost better than Alex and his grandfather respectively. Even the grandfather's dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (that's right) is funny as a very loyal companion. <br /> <br /> Paul Cantelon's music savings score is a moody compliment to the thoughtful nature of the movie. Editing is effective as past and present images are linked and transferred effortlessly. The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (Gothika, Requiem for a Dream) is pretty sharp and lively with some impressive images of war and its aftermath. <br /> <br /> The coincidences that occur in the last half of the movie make for good drama, but are a bit too coincidental. We never understand the whole background story of Alex's grandfather and what his motivation is. Similarly, Jonathan's white stars and lack of apparent dust and depth don't give us much more than a sketch of a peculiar man. Sometimes the film feels a little indifferent and depressed, because more terrible revelations are exposed. But it is small criticism of what is a good, introspective story with good performances and interesting themes of memory and closure. The fact that Schreiber has not only targeted, but adapted the script to this valuable piece of history, is a tribute to his talents and promising future potential.
