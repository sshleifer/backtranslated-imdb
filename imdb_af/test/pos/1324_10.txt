One would think that a movie based on the life of Japanese author Yukio Mishima would be a frightening or impossible task. However, Paul Schrader did indeed make a movie about "Mishima" which is wonderful and complex. While this is not a literal biography, Schrader and his writer Leonard Scharder (his brother) have taken several incidents from his life, including his succession and manufacture, which can best be described as casual table clays that are visually sparse and stunning. Mishima's homosexuality is hardly there because of his widow's legal threats, but in spite of this, the film is still great and one of the best movies I saw in 1985. I also have to mention the important contribution of Philip Glass who did the score, which adds an additional texture to the film, and is better than the one he did for Scorsese's Kundun. Also striking is John Bailey's delicate, beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design and costumes of Eiko Ishioka that made the memorable costumes for Coppola's Dracula for which she received a well-deserved Oscar. Hopefully this movie will be available on DVD soon.
