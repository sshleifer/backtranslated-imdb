This film is one of the most wonderful examples of compelling and artistic films I've ever seen. Herzog seems to capture the almost transcendent tragedy and beauty of Dieter's story, as well as his engaging personal character. By the end of the movie, I had left the opportunity to meet Dieter before she passed. <br /> <br /> On a technical note, cinematography is intimate and amazingly beautiful. The narrative is intricately woven, with great awareness of the subject and its ability to relive and reproduce the traumatic events. Few documentaries have such a strong ability to invest the audience in character. This movie is a must see !!!
