The biggest tragedy around this wonderful movie is its lack of American distribution. I was fortunate to see this movie at the Boston International Festival of Women's Cinema, and recommend it to anyone who gets the chance to see it. Wonderful performances and thoughtful writing and good direction of the talented and funny Rose Troche combine everyone to make this movie a winner!
