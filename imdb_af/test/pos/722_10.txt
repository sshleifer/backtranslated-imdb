I've seen this movie know nothing about it. I suspected it was a sci-fi b movie of some kind. How wrong I was. The plot is surprising and intelligent, the movie is all charismatic and the whole movie just makes you think for a change. Some of the riddles completely crushed me, but in the end the answers were quite simple. I'm very surprised at the low score of this movie, because I thought it was quite unusual. If you liked the movie Se7en (Seven) with Brad Pit or The Matrix, you'll love it. There is no great special effect or music at all. It's all about the plot, about building the characters and building an atmosphere. However, it is a movie, but eventually gives no answers that some people may irritate, but I thought the end was wonderful. I'm still not sure if the movie is based on a true story or not ......
