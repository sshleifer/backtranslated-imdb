The film was apparently created from an idea that one of the authors had when he saw one of his creations in a supermarket. The residents of Royston Vasey are in 'our' world to persuade the writers not to write about them and thereby destroy their world. <br /> <br /> If it's not too serious, don't frighten it. Within the first few minutes we get: Bernice (the filthy female minister) who is placed on an unfortunate repentance during a confession; Cheerful (the veterinarian who accidentally destroys every animal he touches) tries to collect semen from a giraffe; Mickey (thick out of conviction), ah, thick; and Tubbs (inbred sister-woman and local shopkeeper) is sweet as always - but still disgusting. <br /> <br /> Some of the common characters are missing, but a new idea by the Gents introduces a 16th-century character - and we also have the Gents themselves in action. If you're new to The League of Gentlemen, it's an easy introduction and fun. If you are a tall fan, it has everything you expected - including the joys of Jeremy Dyson's mockery. <br /> <br /> All told, it has the same, faint surrealistic humor that characterizes the series, plus a few moments to "introspect". For example, Herr Lipp has a gentle dignity to learn that he is regarded by his creators as a 'one-joke character'. While most characters remain as they are, some evolve in unexpected ways that are perfectly natural when they happen. <br /> <br /> This movie is a swan song for Royston Vasey, but it is also a showcase for the Gents who prove it (gasp!) They can write other things - and it can be very funny . (But you knew it.)
