I was really surprised to see it, unlike most documentaries, it was written, directed and produced by a film critic - Richard Schickel. Most of the times I know where film critics have had a big role in movies, the films seem to be bombs (Rex Reed in "Myra Breckenridge" and Roger Ebert writes "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"). In this case, however, the critic's powers are good and not bad and the results are better (though not much, as the movies I just mentioned are one of the worst movies ever made). <Br /> <br /> As far as the documentary is concerned, it is told by Clint Eastwood (a fairly good choice) and he can discuss his long career - from his silent days to his death in the early 1960s. The only negative, and they are small, is that the film is very short (like most movie documentaries) and there is very little about Gary Cooper as a human being - you don't really learn much about his life. But as a good overview of his films, it works very well.
