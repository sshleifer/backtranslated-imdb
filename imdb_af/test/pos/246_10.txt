It is one of the best musical of the 1940s. The glorious Technicolor shows off Rita Hayworth's beauty and spectacular hair. She had to make more movies in color, but then Columbia was barely able to splash money for Technicolor shows. <br /> <br /> Rita is a WOW as Rusty Parker - she likes more than any of the most beautiful numbers ever. She also looked beautiful in the turn of the century's gown, so she had the opportunity to play her own grandmother. <br /> <br /> The movie opens with "The Show Must Go On" - it looks good to me Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly) is not impressed. His motto is work, work, work !!! One of the dancers, Maurine (Lesley Brookes), is determined to improve herself and is going to audition for Vanity's Golden Wedding Cover Girl competition. Rusty just happens to find herself at the auditions. On a very funny scene, Maurine had just such an audition and saw Rusty, giving her some tips on how to impress the judges !!! "Don't be ashamed and don't talk." Rusty does it with load !!! <br /> <br /> They decide on Maurine and go to the show to see her, but John Coudair (Otto Kruger) sees Rusty - she reminds him of someone from his past. Cornelia (Eve Arden) still has nightmares about Rusty's audition. Johnny remembers a long lost love (Rusty's grandmother, Maribelle Hicks), the man who has a dress. first time he sang her a Sure Thing "- put on the races. Meanwhile, Danny, Rusty and Genius are looking for pearls at their local dinner. They then start in the happiest song of the 1940s (in my opinion) -" Make Way For Tomorrow ". <br /> <br />" Sit My To The Test "is a passionate song and dance number with Danny and Rusty. Meanwhile, Rusty has been chosen. Cover Girl and Danny McGuires' is the place to be seen Lee Bowman appears as Danny's romantic contender and puts a damper on things - Lee Bowman is probably the most boring leading man ever, so Danny should never worry. <br /> <br /> Rusty (named by Martha Mears) Sing "Long Ago and Away" and it is beautifully danced by Danny and Rusty, the gown that Rita wears is beautiful, Travis Banton and Gwen Wakeling have designed them. Gene Kelly is also fantastic in the "Alter Ego" number where he is dancing with himself. <br /> <br /> "Poor John "Another look back to the turn of the century - it was written in 1906 and is an extremely important Funny song that makes fun on rich relationships - Hayworth looks beautiful in an amazingly beautiful outfit. Search for Al Norman in both "Poor John" and "A Sure Thing". He was a wonderful eccentric dancer, who appeared in several early musicals, including "King of Jazz" and "Paramount on Parade". He was easy to see. <br /> <br /> The "Cover Girl" dance is just wonderful. Rita was so talented - beautiful and a good dancer. After a series of beautiful model parade through the doors of America's leading magazines, Rusty bursts into a gorgeous golden gown that sits down to the very catchy "Cover Girl" song. Gosh, I love this movie !! <br /> <br /> Highly Recommended.
