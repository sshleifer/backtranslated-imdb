Hello, I wondered if anyone had a copy of the film Broken Promise ?? I loved this movie and watched it every time. It's been years since I saw it and would like to get a copy. I checked the internet and couldn't find it. If someone has a copy to sell or sell, send me an email at NoelGypsy@Yahoo.com ... Thanks and enjoy a good night !! Christine --------- The "broken promise" was made to eleven-year-old Melissa Michaelsen, whose parents left her and her brothers and sisters. Michaelsen had to be helpless, since her brothers and sisters were divided and transplanted to different families. One of the children is even institutionalized. Juvenile court officer Chris Sarandon joins Michaelsen in her struggle to reunite her family under one roof. Broken Promise was originally presented as a "General Foods Golden Showcase" offering. This was the first issue May 5, 1981.
