To paraphrase Thora Birch: "I like this movie. This is exactly the opposite of everything I hate in a movie." <br /> <br /> This obscure movie was too low key and intelligent to get a theater release, any chance of success would have required an expensive promotional campaign. And an age story where nothing spectacular happens - where the focus on character development takes place is a limited target audience. Who heard about an adult teenage movie? <br /> <br /> But if you have the opportunity to see it or if you can share a few dollars for the DVD, you can do much worse. Jason London (senior high school Todd Boomer) is the star and adapts this character as well as his parts in "The Man In the Moon" and "Dazed and Confused". He is helped by extraordinary work of his supporting role. Tia Carrere in the title role is a revelation (she can act) as Todd's calculus tutor and love interest. Christopher McDonald as the teacher in a good self-parody performance. Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as Todd's best friends, and Jeffrey Tabor as his father. <br /> <br /> As someone said earlier, it's an "adult" teen movie because the romantic relationships are universally unsuccessful - at least through traditional happy ending standards. Even Todd's parents are indifferent to each other, with his father listening to the title character and his mother (Leslie Lyles) all the time on the screen (a device that offers successive comedy relief every time). The London-Carrere romance has unexpected charm and is far more credible than any other older-woman storyline you will likely find. <br /> <br /> But the real strength of the movie is the developing relationship of the three friends. There is no remaining melodrama here, just three immature people who alternate between testing and trusting each other, subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to these kinds of things. They actually get a three-person relationship, perhaps the first in a theater history. <br /> <br /> Then again, what do I know? I'm just a kid.
