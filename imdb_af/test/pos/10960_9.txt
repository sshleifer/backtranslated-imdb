Shadows are often praised as the film that was the breakthrough for American independent theater. Whether it is true or not, it is an undeniably important film, the influence of which can be traced all the way to today's Sundance feeders. Here is a film that deals with controversial topics of the day (namely racism), and refuses to give easy answers and manipulative. It's also about sex in a frank way, that Hollywood won't even discuss "The Graduate". <br /> <br /> Still, the question remains that it is as powerful today as it was when it was originally released? The answer is yes. While many important movies today are hard to watch and dated, "Shadows" each retain our emotional resonance when it is seen. It's about racism as a personal matter and not a political one, so it's still relevant. Plus, it works as a great time-saver, setting the 1950s knock-down generation and the New York art zone in a way that may not have any other movie. <br /> <br /> At technical level, it is unfair. Cassavetes does not yet need full confidence as director and the cunning editing reflects the film's low budget. Yet the film's story remains powerful. In addition, the play, seen as the inexperience of the cast and improvisational nature, is phenomenal. The actors create realistic characters everywhere, those who remain sympathetic despite their often less than admirable actions. "Shadows" is absolutely mandatory for movie buffs. (9/10)
