I remember it a while ago, and I knew most of the concept, but no detail, and I'm glad I watched it again, by director Frank Oz (The Muppets Take Manhattan, Bowfinger). Basically, new star Cameron Drake (Matt Dillon) won the Oscar award for his latest, playing a gay soldier, and he does the usual "thank you". He even calls his previous school. English teacher Howard Brackett (Golden Globe nominated Kevin Kline), and he makes him gay! Howard is determined to clear his name and get out of the media spotlight as a gay man, especially since his marriage to Eman Montgomery (Oscar and Golden Globe nominee Joan Cusack) is on his way. So it comes to the wedding day, and when it comes to Howard, yes or no, that is when he emits himself, and he and himself acknowledge that he's gay. Of course, it gives him a teacher, but everyone is at the graduation ceremony to put themselves out (in support), and Cameron even points out to make things clear so everyone, especially the principal, Tom Halliwell (Elf's Bob Newhart) know it is okay to be gay. Also Tom Selleck as Peter Malloy, Debbie Reynolds, Berniece Brackett, Wilford Brimley, Frank Brackett, Gregory Jbara, Walter Brackett, Glenn Close, Whoopi Goldberg and Jay Leno. The highlight of the film should be if Kline can't help dancing with Diana Ross's version of "I Will Survive", it had to convince him of his sexuality. Kline is always good, Cusack is a surprising Oscar nominee, and all the supporting role players do their bit too in this very funny comedy. Very good!
