I read a lot of unflattering comments about this film, and the only things I have seen all are "boring" and "unrealistic". <br /> <br /> First of all, they use real frickin 'Crocs! How much more realistic can you get? No CGI, no animatronics, no thumbnail. Just a bite and a piece of meat. Enjoy, fellas! <br /> <br /> There is no doubt that this movie is going to slow down. Character development, how small they have, anyway, takes some time, and I think it's mostly where this movie is missing. <br /> <br /> But if the movie goes, I got the action. dramatically. I don't want to say there is much action. If there is something, there are more moments where the crocus cannot be seen at all, and people are not waiting. However, we know that there will be no relief, and that the crocodile will only spoil its time. It had a similar horrible feel to other films that had reached their abomination through non-action, such as Open Water (another movie criticized by some viewers as "boring"). Personally, I think viewers who aren't able to feel the tension suddenly have their attention removed at birth, but it's just me. <br /> <br /> Finally, the characters really feel, and the situation is so that it can really happen to anyone in the right circumstances. Furthermore, the deaths are quite real, and sometimes it is a bit difficult to look at. <br /> <br /> All in all, this one is a winner.
