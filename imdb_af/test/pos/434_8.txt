Like the classic Hollywood musicals, the plot is just an excuse. A must have for those interested in the French music hall (including a song by Edith Piaf) and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finals. The dance in the movie is not as usual as cancan. <br /> <br /> Some people may object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting, but this gives you a clear picture of some great costumes and sets. <br /> <br /> Consider Jean Renoir's love letter to Paris where he grew up. Certainly the Jean Renoir movie for people who do not like their serious movies, or just like his Hollywood productions. <br /> <br />
