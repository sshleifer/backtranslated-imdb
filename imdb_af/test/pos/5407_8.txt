As Salinger's "Perfect Day for Bananafish" ends with the suicide of a prodigy, this movie is opened with the death of star school swimming legend, Matt, who shoots him in the head with a revolver in the opening scene. But the death of Matt Travis serves as a key to unlocking the door of another prodigy, his brother, Tim, who never seriously bothered with the question: "What am I going to do?" <br /> <br /> When he finds his brother dead, his head is broken like a watermelon, the Travis family started throwing out his secrets one by one. The film focuses on Tim. He is a victim of bullying, domestic abuse, family alienation, sadness, issues of sexuality and friendship. <br /> <br /> Tim reveals his wounds through physical bruises, but it is not the only injury to his person, as we realize slowly, as the writing painfully reveals Tim's origin and outcome. Everyone who loves him hurts him. Hirsch plays the character very well, reveals frame to framework in the visual expression of his body, a variety of conflicting emotions in the soul of a child that no one seems to listen to or knows well, unaware and unaware of his depth of soul and wonderful talent. <br /> <br /> Two brothers and sisters sharing a doopie curl on a red spinnable playground shot, Tim Penny asks: "What am I going to do with the rest of my life?" The scene is set in a well-known, repetitive image of the movie: the comfortable playground where Tim obviously feels at home, is seen as a bird's eye view, because with each character Tim feels comfortable sharing a part of himself and us see these intimate moments that he shares in the red, spinnable playground, complete with childish graffiti cut in pencil from above. Immediately after advising him to succeed, Penny told him, "Tim, well, the secret to life's success is finding something you love. And you have to do it for the rest of your life. "And you hope better to hell that you are good with it, because if you are not, you will probably fail." This simple advice from Penny serves as the film's central theme, talent responsibility and the possibility of failure. Why does one person have a talent he can't stand, like Matt, who hates the attention she has brought to fame, but nobody sees Tim's talent? no one ?? Because nobody bothered him to ask him? Not even us. The film makes us aware that we don't know Tim himself, and we thought we did this when we met this hearty, sad man. In our intimate understanding of Tim, as it progresses, we are reminded that not everyone seems to be like them. This is the other side of the film, the failure of those who need parents, friends, teachers ?? wie ?? to see and see the gifts of the people who claim to love them. Not even his mother Sandy, played by Sigourney Weaver, sees Tim's gift, despite her love for her son. Weaver does a good job of a middle-aged woman struggling with her own inner demons, as she randomly tries to play the role of household and support. When Tim is bullied at school, she storms the trailer's trailer and threatens his life: "You can plague, torture, punch, drunk, I can forgive you. Hell I can understand, I'm a good Christian, you know , I can forgive and forget, but you waste with my child and may God himself come down from heaven to protect you as long as I live, and I will survive you all? I will wake up and go to sleep at night just dream of ways to make your little insignificant lives in hell on earth. "After she clicked a paper cup into the mother's face, she looked at the trailer, and looked at them, the child and his astonished mother, remarks , "nice trailer" and leaving as fast as she gets. Weaver weighs in her ability to match gusto with visceral white which is acidic and greasy. And Tim's father, played by Jeff Daniels, is blind to whom his son is, treating him as a stranger, not telling his family that he had taken time off the office, spending his days in the city park, listless, a carved soul, and sleeping in Matt's bed, pressed in with his high school letter jacket. Jeff Daniels does a great job of making us believe he can be a bastard and lover, because we are growing to see that even an unknown father can show his love for his son. In an emotional scene, Tim confronts his father. Just when you think his father is going to hit him, he grabs him to hug him. If he doesn't let him go, he tells Tim: "I'm your dad and you're my son and I'm okay here, but you have to talk to me. I don't know how to do it myself". It is here right now in the movie that a father tells his son, you must tell me what's coming in you, tell me who you are; I want to know who you are. It is in this scene that the film reaches a cathartic moment, the visual movement of Tim, angry and alone, to his father embracing him as he breaks down and weeps, revealing the emotions hidden under his shell. Tim is experiencing this moment of cleansing with his father as a catharsis, especially if you look at the abuse, manipulation, disregard, violence and betrayal, he has been treated in the long-term that includes the film. I recommend this movie.
