This movie was hilarious. This gave a somewhat comical view of the British club scene, which if you really look is a funny thing. The characters in this movie were so realistic to those of us who looked at my place here, that it was like watching a movie about ourselves. <br /> <br /> There were some scripts that really made this film work: the ready scenes; the "Get me a real doctor" scene; the white background scene showing every character in a total state of destruction, ending with the notorious line "what did I say?" and the komedown sunup scenes. I lived these moments myself and I laughed hysterically at my own ridiculous behavior. <br /> <br /> I can't give this movie a 10, because it doesn't measure Groove, which I thought was outside this world, but it certainly has its moments. The mise-and-scene and camera work is great, the special effects are worth mentioning, and the play is fantastic. <br /> <br /> After a long time watching this movie, I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed. I hope to see more of the author / director in the future.
