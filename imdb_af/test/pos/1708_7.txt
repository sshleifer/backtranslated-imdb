Like talk shows, Larry King Live is not bad, and as he sometimes gets good guests, it's a show to turn on for a while, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president or other content guest sits against him, it's not bad. At other times, he tends to present guests to the latest celebrity scandal, delivering absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeding a largely uneducated public who wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars. During the OJ Simpson trial, every other guest appeared to be related to the case. But is this really journalism? Or the National Enquirer on the tube? Sometimes it comes down to a bit like television. Jerry Springer is in an interview with telephone calls instead of a live audience. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, King's show is definitely much better than Bill O'Reilly whose performance is nothing more than a legal-political platform of the Rush Limbaugh variety. That said, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but unfortunately he is not a good one. King does not always come down as he fully understands when intellectual material is offered, especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. Always looks like the minute King can't really handle the problem, that is when he goes to the calls, maybe someone in the country will hope he has a better question than he has. He may question someone like David Gergen, but may not have read any of his books. Similar to the film producer who never reads the script. <br /> <br /> When it's an entertainment festival, it's not a problem. He can come down as if he is thoroughly informed, since the material is not so substantive anyway. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not actually rocket science. And I see that he usually saw the star's latest movie. Watching a movie takes much less time and consideration than reading a book. However, if it's like John Dean or Bob Woodward, King comes off a bit as he hasn't done his homework properly. So on the phones. <br /> <br /> Looking for real in-depth interviews, NPR Terry Gross is probably the best interviewer in the United States. She reads and / or examines everything that was written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas. I don't see King really doing it. Admittedly, he probably has an audience 1000 times bigger than Terry Gross, who can say more about the American audience as king. In short, Larry is better than Bill, but not as good as Terry.
