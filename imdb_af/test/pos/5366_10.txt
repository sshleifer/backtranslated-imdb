A wonderful thoughtful and involved film that leaves a print, far above it is initial ramp. Based on a true story, one of the many "little" stories before World War II, which provides an understanding of the minds of the majority of common human cultures, influenced by others observed as former enemies and perhaps future enemies, with the obscurity of war clouds on the horizon. The film was enthusiastically received at the Stony Brook Film Festival. Well written and expertly thrown. The characters were most credible and entered one to experience their trials and tribulations.
