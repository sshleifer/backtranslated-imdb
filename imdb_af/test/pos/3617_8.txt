I must admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and fear. Louis de Berni√®re's bestselling novel is one of my favorites and anyone reading it will realize that there is no way in hell that any screen adjustment can be 100% true. <br /> <br /> All through myself I convinced myself that the film was unsuccessful and the book's plot withdrawn to make it superfluous. However, the end is much better than in the novel, and I couldn't stop thinking about the movie. Yet, the pluses (John Toll's beautiful cinematography, Stephen Warbeck's big score, etc.), What I felt, didn't get my initial negative weighting. (Cage's miscasting, a heavily diluted script). <br /> <br /> But two days later I was back in the line to see Corelli, and although it wasn't perfect, I must admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. Cage is actually brilliant in a role that even Bernier was worried about, was not a completely rounded character. His carefree spirit, which gives a broken remorse, is about to compliment the beautiful double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer is trying to reconcile his feelings to his newly-found Italian friends and his innate superior complex to those around him. And the fine Greek-Italian burst brings the Bernier's healthy world of Cepholonia alive. <br /> <br /> When I leave the cinema the second time, I leave my passion for the novel which prevented me from filming WW2 Cepholonia's story. My hat goes down to John Madden, who, despite the almost anticipated critical drubbing he received from British critics (any director who had a great success like Shakespeare in Love behind them, is always a target for these moaned nunnies! ) to place a terribly difficult book on the big screen with such a heart, verve and humanity (the core virtues of the novel, in fact) that he has created another classic love story that is likely to be fully appreciated if the fabric has established a few years from now. <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the book, like me, it's hard, but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing. Try to lose sight of the book for two hours, bathe yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere, and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr Iannis, as if for the first time it looks as if you have looked at something of an original script), and I guarantee you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> In fact, you will be eager to have your own copy of this beautiful movie on video or DVD. <br /> <br /> 8/10
