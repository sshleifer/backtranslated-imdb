This movie, for what it was, managed to succeed. It's a short tragic movie. Although my choice of movie is the one that really develops characters and their relationships, this movie is meant to give just a taste, leaving you the "next" factor. After looking at it, I actually wanted more, more of the character story, that influenced them to make them in the people they were. I think that's what the makers heard the viewer think. The acting is wonderful. There are not many lines in the film, so their body language, facial expressions and overall presence should be strong enough to keep a scene off. Both Franco and Miner have that element and it shows. Of course, for them (especially Franco) to take the time to make it, they say they believed in this movie and wanted to be exceptional and therefore I appreciated the movie for what it was. I'm also fortunate to have it, so I can share it with other people who never knew it existed.
