Lauren Himmel's debut film is well-directed with a nice polished feel. There is a strong storyline with a meaningful point to it, even if nothing is resolved in the end, hence the name Treading Water. The storyline revolves around a Lesbian couple and their struggle with that mother for acceptance. 7.5 / 10
