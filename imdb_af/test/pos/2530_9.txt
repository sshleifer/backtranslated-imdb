For me, this is one of those movies I had to watch from the Los Angeles-based "Z" channel when it was in service. And that was one of those movies I saw when I was young ... and taught that there was a world there ... one I didn't want to accept. <br /> <br /> Moving to Los Angeles and watching international theater has become my guilty pleasure and so far no premiere channel programming has adapted the Z channel in its performance of international films. The three international films held in my head were "Spetters", "Beau Pere" and of course this one, "Pixote". <br /> <br /> It was the most shocking and sad movie I've ever seen in me. life. It was also one of the first movies that made me understand that there is a difference in cinema: to entertain and inform. Let me be honest. In a small town on the east coast, I had no idea of ​​such a thing. All I knew about South America was brochures of beautiful Brazilian holidays and that Columbia had a lot of drug trafficking. <br /> <br /> Then comes a movie like Pixote. Heart broken. Upsetting. Strong. Frightening. You look: Children. Those who need shelter, love, understanding and all this are a way to survive every day through drugs, sex, robbing, stealing, sleeping in the streets and in sadistic group homes. Their survival is difficult to see with other street children. , prostitutes, etc., and you begin to wonder how things can happen like this in this world. <br /> <br /> Pixote is not a movie for entertainment, it's a movie of information. It shows shocking and disturbing images - but it shows life for these daily street children.
