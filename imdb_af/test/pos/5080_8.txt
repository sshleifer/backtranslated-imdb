Imagine you were just on a plane for 18 hours. You were on a business trip to South Africa. You are a high-paid professional. You've lived in the US for 20 years. You are in your thirties, you have a woman a little boy and another baby on her way. One thing, even if you have a green card, you are still Egypt. During the tour you will be asked to come with 2 security guards. The next thing you know is that you are overpowered, chopped and chained and after a brief (but still fairly civil) inquiry you have to make! This is what happens at the beginning of the film with Anwar el Ibrahimi. She is a story of pain and (literally) torture. This is one of several story lines. One follows his wife's efforts to get more information. One follows the (cold) bureaucrats behind the show. Another story is about the man's family leading the interrogation of Anwar el Ibrahimi. There are other stories too and by the end they all come together neatly. Although the more famous actors, such as Reese Witherspoon (like distorted pregnant woman), Jake Gyllenhaal (as the CIA newcomer forced to see the interrogation in North Africa) and Meryl Streep (as CIA boyfriend Corine Whitman), It really is the more unknown actors who carry the story and give it its heart. To me, the actor playing the unlucky Mr El Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally) was the heart and soul of this movie. His portrayal of a man in need was shockingly well done. It's almost like he's actually tortured! Also, Israeli actor Yigal Naor was very impressive, as the part is concerned about the family man and part of an extremely cruel torture chief. Difficult to look at and not exactly fun, but still worth it.
