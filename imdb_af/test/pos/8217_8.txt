The net is an excellent movie! It's about Angela Bennett (in a big show by Sandra Bullock) who is a computer expert working for the cathedral company, cleaning viruses and testing games for the clients. Angela is a typical nerd who does not have friends outside cyberspace, barely taking holidays and going out and staying almost always attached. One day, her friend Dale Hessman (Ray McKinnon) asked her to help Angela send a disk with a strange program containing lots of confidential information. On the same evening, when Dale was going to meet her, he was suddenly killed in a plane crash. Angela meets a beautiful man named Jack Devlin (Jeremy Northam) who is a cold killer. and one of the guys behind the secret of the Floppy. <br /> <br /> Her life then becomes a nightmare: All her records are erased and she is given the new identity of Rut Marx, a woman with serious problems. with the police. <br /> <br /> This movie is great because it shows how we, people, a lot of computers and machines are dependent (sometimes more what we need) and how vulnerable we are to somebody deciding to control and change our personal someday records, without giving us the opportunity to prove the error.
