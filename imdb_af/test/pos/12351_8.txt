Multiply named and strangely cast, "One Dark Night" aka "Mausoleum", is one of the better early horror video rentals. Originally and fairly raw, we briefly meet Adam West in this film about telekinesis and teenage main games. Meg Tilly is daring to spend a night in a cripple by "The Sisters" a high school gang in blue satin jackets. The initiation is interrupted by the recently gut body of a mass-killing psychic wizard called "Raymar". Surprisingly awesome makeup and horror effects paint this chiller film with style and deliver a heartbeat climax.
