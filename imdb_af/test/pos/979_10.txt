Big Fat Liar is what you get when you combine wonderful writing, good production, and emphasis on smart ideas about adolescent porridge. The two stars work well together, and - what can I say? Amanda Bynes shines. Placing 'Irkel' and Lee Majors in the film was a brilliant touch. Watch this movie with your kids. If you don't laugh at that, don't pay attention.
