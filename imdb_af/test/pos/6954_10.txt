I don't know how the IMDb "weighted average" came with such a low rating on this movie. It is, in my opinion and through all the other accounts, an exaggerated gem of a movie. Rip Torn is fantastic as the stubborn Noel Lord, and Tantoo Cardinal superlative as his homemaker. Torn and cardinal are both underrated actors who eventually get a stage to work their craft. <br /> <br /> Their relationship is not always nice, but it really is. It is NOT the "loving and touching love story", it is charged on the DVD jacket. In the end, it's a tragedy. Lord aims simply too high and ignores all the advice to use the money offered by the power company to move. <br /> <br /> The music is fantastic just as the era sets.
