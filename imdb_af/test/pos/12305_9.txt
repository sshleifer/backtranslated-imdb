"The Death" is really a work of art. Clearly, John Huston intended to show that he was still "in the full glory of passion" by making it even if his body failed him. This movie is powerful and long in the mind long after it's done. Reading the Joyce short story certainly adds more depth to the characters, especially Gabriel's inner turmoil, but the essence is all there in this movie. As a statement by an artist of his love for life and his craft, "The Dead" is alone.
