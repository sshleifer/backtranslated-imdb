Goldie Hawn's portrayal of a simple young lady trapped in a love triangle with an older man, a dentist, played with such pleasure from Walter Matthau that she won the best supporting actress Oscar for 1969. <br /> <br /> However, the film is a tribute to Ingrid Bergman. Rarely did we ever see her in a comedy, and she literally kicks her heels as a dedicated dental nurse who is put in a scheme for Matthau to tell Hawn that they are married. <br /> <br /> Seeing Matthau and Bergman fall for each other is such a joy. They are a casual love affair in the making. <br /> <br /> As Matthau's friend Jack Weston is fabulous as his partner in the scheme. Rick Lenz also gives good support as Hawn's new-found boyfriend.
