I don't think I've seen another movie in my lifetime about a high school kid who creates his own college, just to impress his parents. Currently movies are either remakes or persecutors, or plots used in many different films. This one has an original story line and to follow it up by making it a comedy film, just lighten the deal. With this well-thought-out story and mixed music, it's a good movie. Now I saw better, but when I was in the theater, I thought of another drug / beer / frat party with a sexual innuendo thrown into an "American Pie" movie, but I was surprised. To sum it up, I enjoyed the movie and the next time you move the movie for movies, look for showtimes on "Accepted". If you want to laugh out loud, it is.
