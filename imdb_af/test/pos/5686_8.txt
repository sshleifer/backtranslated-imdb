Black Water, co-directed and written by David Nerlich and Andrew Traucki, is still very simple in its performance. The film is an Australian movie with a low budget that does not deserve the recognition it deserves, because it is one of the best in it. The setup is rather basic; Grace, her husband Adam and her younger sister Lee tour some mangroves in the Northern Territory when a saltwater crocodile flips their boat and is stranded in the trees. The whole movie is about their survival while the crocodile is waiting to strike. Unlike Greg McLean's Rogue (another killer-crocodile movie released earlier in 2007), Black Water isn't about the public having fun saying what's next. about hope and pray that the three people will come out safely. <br /> <br /> The three unfamiliar actors do a good job with fairly demanding roles as they were filmed with a real crocodile instead of CGI. The characters work realistically in the situation and the dialogue seems natural and not forced. Suspension is built up throughout the film, we don't see much of the creature, but just knowing it's close is scary enough. This is the best of your seats and is highly recommended if you enjoy original and (most importantly) scary horror movies. <br /> <br /> 4/5
