If that is true, sadomasochism is a two-sided coin that contains the entire expression of its opposites, then the film portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality. Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a sort of fascist sadism as they desire the same self. Her outward expression projects her desire. Therefore, she can be hurt without guilt or remorse. <br /> <br /> Along talented, attractive, attractive, young Walter Klemmer (Benoit Magimel), who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity. He wants to be her student to be close to her. She rejects him from the hand, but because of his talent, the vineyard agrees. He falls in love with her. Again she pushes him away, but he will not take an answer and thus begins his own descent into depravity and loss of self-respect. <br /> <br /> The question the viewer might ask at this point is, who is in control? The sadist or the masochis? Indeed, who is the sadist and who is the masochis? It's hard to tell. Is it the person who has just been psychologically and physically abused, who actually lies on the floor in grotesque triumph and fulfillment, or is it the person who storms out the door, gives the command that no one is to know what happened. <br /> <br /> But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak. She's a sex-extreme freak. She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while preserving the facade of respectability. Actually, it's not even true. She says she doesn't care what others think. She doesn't care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she's in love. Love, she calls it. Because her sex and love are one and the same. <br /> <br /> At one point, Walter tells her that love is not everything. How ironic such abundance is to her. How free of charge the comments. <br /> <br /> The film is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke who works the story with expert camera and turns carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not only clear but also an example ( as in the bathroom when Walter pushes himself high above the stall to find Erika). He also uses a fine positioning of the players so that they must always be with good intersections from one corner to another. This is especially important in the scene where Erika, like a blood-drained body caught in sharp white and black light, lies beneath her lover, stiff as stone. Here we see most of her face and the sharp outline of her neck with his pulsating artery. We no longer need to see. <br /> <br /> The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes; Indeed, she rejoices in them. I saw her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone has become the character of body and soul. Like the woman she plays in this movie, she is indifferent to what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense. What's important to her is the show and the challenge. No part is too demanding. No character to corrupt. It is as if Huppert wants to experience all humanity and wants us to see her as she does. She is always fascinating and almost flawless. She is not merely a leading light of French theater; She is one of the great actresses of our time that has created an incredible variety of work. <br /> <br /> I think it is highly educational and offers a wonderful and striking contrast to her performance here with her comparing performance in The Lacemaker (La Dentellière) from 1977 when she was 22 years old. There was his apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme, a Parisian student hairdresser. Her character was ashamed of sex and modesty - just an ordinary French girl who hoped to be a beautician one day. Here she is a self-destructive witch, bitter with hateful knowledge of herself, shamelessly and completely withered. <br /> <br /> Huppert is happy to be an actress in France, where such parts as starlets women. (Hollywood can never make such a movie.) In the American cinema, just a handful of the best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of thirty. Huppert raises her exposure considerably due to her ability and scope, but also because she is prepared to play unsympathetic roles, here and also in La Cémonie (1995) in which she plays a dirty, careless killer. <br /> <br /> See it for Isabelle Huppert. You won't forget her or the character she brings to life.
