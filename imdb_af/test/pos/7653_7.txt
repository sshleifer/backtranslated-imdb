I finally liked this movie, but it wasn't the easiest to go through. What makes the movie great is the music and the scenery. The songs are beautiful and the musicians are talented. A great job has been done to show different institutions to the Rome people. <br /> <br /> However, the viewer is not sufficiently guided. A more in depth history of the Rom people would have been nice. Only a fraction of the spoken words are given English captions. In addition, more statements about the institutions and what they and some of their challenges would be appreciated. It would have helped if there was a narrator to also explain about customs, dress and music.
