There are so many '10 Best 'lists that can easily fit the "The Dead" - Best Screen Drunk, Best Literary Adjustment, Best Use Of Music Not Specifically For The Movie, Best Use Of Poetry, Best Screen Speech, Best Ensemble Cast And Finally , maybe, Best Movie ever made. It was John Huston's last and best film, adapted by his son Tony of James Joyce's short story and on the evening of the Epiphany Feast in Dublin in 1904. It is mainly limited to one institution, home to the Morkan Sisters , and not much happens in conventional "dramatic" terms. They entertain their guests; There is singing, dancing, reviews and very small talks, but watching this movie. You can't imagine anything other than you would rather than in this company. <br /> <br /> Of course, it's much, much more. It's about love, loss and regret, the stable pillars of great drama. In the film's finale, farmer Bartell D'Arcy (Frank Patterson) sings a song, "The Lass of Aughrim," which in the mind of Gretta (Anjelica Huston), Gabriel's wife (Donal McCann) is the spirit of her first and probably greatest love, a boy who died in all certainty of a broken heart at the age of seventeen. Gabriel suddenly realized that he never really knew his wife and that he was not the great love of her life. , after all. Emotionally, these scenes are incredibly powerful, firstly as Gretta tells the circumstances of her lover's death and then the voice in Gabriel's head summarizes his own feelings. It is a wonderful cinema, the monologues excellently delivered by Huston and McCann. <br /> <br /> But then all the performances are extraordinary. This is a high-order ensemble game and while it would be surprising to postpone one artist over the other, the screen has ever given us a more enjoyable, brilliant or convincing drunk than Donal Donnelly or is poetry ever made so much passion that Sean McClory, (the IRA man in "The Quiet Man"), leads to reading Lady Gregory's translation of "Donal Og" here? Of course, it should also be known that Huston himself was near death when he made this film that made me look the highlight of his life's work. Death may be the central theme, but watching this movie is a life-enhancing experience.
