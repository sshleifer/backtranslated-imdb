If Western Union is not exactly the true story of the construction of the Transcontinental Telegraph, it certainly takes the spirit and dedication of the people involved in the project. <br /> <br /> Dean Jagger is the man in charge and one fine day he is thrown from a horse and sustained ribs are maintained. An illegal attack, Randolph Scott, finds Jagger and is ready to steal his horse, but changes his mind and adds Jagger. Later he is hired by the Western Union and works for Jagger. <br /> <br /> Jagger also hires a young east that is played by Robert Young, who is an engineer. Young does one of his little loan from movies away from MGM for 20th Century Fox. Both Young and Scott become friends, but rivals Jagger's sister, Virginia Gilmore. <br /> <br /> Western Union has plenty of action, enough to satisfy any Western supporters. The telegraph staff are dealing with outside men, Indians and your garden variety. There are some of the funniest scenes. Slim Summerville as the crook and Victor Killian as the border character that fitted him to protect him. They both provide good relief. <br /> <br /> Fritz Lang performed well in his role and quickly moved the film. Western union is solid Western entertainment.
