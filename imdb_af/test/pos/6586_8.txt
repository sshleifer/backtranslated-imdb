For Estoninans, Finland sometimes looks like a land of dreams. A country where many of us want to work or start a business. Find love, start a new life, etc. But ... Aku Louhimies made this brilliant piece that shows that everything is not so good in Finland. That Finland can be just like any other country like Paha Maa (The Bad Land). It shows that people in their lives can be just as miserable as we are in everywhere else. There is sometimes nothing good. This movie shows why Finland is one of the top suicidal countries. Living in North is not easy. Cold climate changes us. I have been attracted more and more to Finnish movies and this one is very good. The acting is also good. Jasper Pääkkönnen became one of the best Finnish stars. Beware of the sex scene (if you have small children) and a little depression that can come after the movie! 8/10
