I am an opera buffalo, and operas are full of sex, blood and death. It can help to get to know the librettos of the operas whose arias appreciate this movie very much. My mileage is very different from Tug-3. I am a classical music lover, and I like this movie. <br /> <br /> I loved Ken Russell's "Nessun Dorma" segment and would like to see Turandot produce because opera is supposed to be overwhelming. multi-media experience, but then I loved Lisztomania. I love * Turandot * and to tell the libretto so well why can't I find this segment the travesty that Tug-3 did. <br /> <br /> The Buck Henry / Rigoletto segment is probably the most accessible to the average viewer - they will probably recognize the songs, and this is a classic bedroom cat. I like sleeping camps, so the cowardice didn't upset me. <br /> <br /> The "Liebestod" segment is so outstanding that I recommend people only see it for that piece. "Depuis la Jour" was beautifully spiritual to me. And the Caruso recording of "Vesti la Giubba" (also I Pagliacci) with John Hurt as the clown was wonderful. But people who just want naked women can feel there is too much music and not enough naked flesh and sex.
