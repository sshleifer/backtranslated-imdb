Don't watch this movie while eating shortly afterwards. <br /> <br /> Having said that, birth will last for the rest of your life or not. Based on the nihilistic philosophy that life is nothing more than the one who strikes the ground (to paraphrase the title series / introduction), it will probably contain the most intense and creepy footage you'll ever see in a movie. <br /> <br /> There is no dialogue, only image to image describing the cycle of life. The film's combination of crisp black and white photography, made up of some creepy backgrounds, works to bring the author's message home. <br /> <br /> The movie starts with God (portrayed as a bandage and of course mad man) torso with a straight razor and then dies in his own rubbish. After his death, mother comes from nature to satisfy herself with his blood and semen and gives man a birth to man. He is represented by a mouth of a human cramp on earth. <br /> <br /> The landscape is an infertile waste, populated by hilted humanoids that eventually happen to Mother Nature and Man. After a series of violent scenes depicting the rape of nature and the destruction of man, these humanoids continue to pump the remains of the bodies back into the ground, and the cycle of life begins again. <br /> <br /> I actually rented it from Blockbuster one night, based on the cover art and hype content, but it's definitely not a Blockbuster type movie. Don't expect narration, dialogue or any drawn bumps. This is an intense visualization based on a dark subject. <br /> <br /> I give this movie some high marks for film and audio, but I don't think I will watch it too often, if it is again. I like my movies dark and unique, but this one is exponentially more than I expected.
