This is one of the funniest shows on TV today. It hits the point 99% of the time. Usually, after a few years, the actors look at a sitcom, as if they become the beloved characters they play. These actors, in my opinion, remained true to their roles. The chemistry is still there, the writing has not come down and I still look to see it. The family dynamic looks still real and the situations have not yet been accompanied to make it seem as if the authors are in an empty pocket to keep the show for one season. This is one of the few shows I see without the distance in my hand for quick switching.
