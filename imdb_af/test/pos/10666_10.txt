Much has been said about this film and its important role in shaping the language of the film. If you are interested in film history, to understand the innovations that Eisenstein brings on the medium, you can try Potemkin next door to most of the movies made before that (that of D.W. Griffith offers a good contrast). It should be allowed that Eisenstein was not the only mounting theorist and that the principles of editing editing were likely to be discovered by another time. But even today, some directors approached the skill that Eisenstein has created through the combination of images at such an early stage in the evolution of the medium. <br /> <br /> If you're not interested in that kind of thing, Potemkin is still one of the most beautiful and moving movies ever made. You have to see it, buy it and tattoo it to your chest.
