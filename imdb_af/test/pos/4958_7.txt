I'm sorry, but I can't help it, I like to watch Iron Eagle. Don't get me wrong now, I'm not saying it's a good movie. No, I'd rather say it's an endless entertaining movie. For people who have cut this role into pieces because they are not realistic, the point is very much wrong. Of course, Iron Eagle's plot was ridiculous. But I believe his target audience was children, and I remember being cool when I was little. Now I just find it amusing as a guilty pleasure, similar to Road House. This movie is part of the amazing pantheon of the 80's, children at stake. You must remember D.A.Y.L., Real Genius, E.T., etc. If you ask me, it's just worth it to appreciate Doug and Knotcher "Ride the Snake" in the beginning to appreciate the cost of the DVD. That whole row was so SO! But at the same time it was hilarious, funny, totally 80s, all those good things. So bottom line, Iron Eagle is a great 80's guilty pleasure. The hairstyles, the dance, the music, the dialogue, it's all funny like hell. I have Iron Eagle on DVD and for me it was absolutely $ 9.99 at Best Buy. If you like to laugh at dated, unrealistic action movies, this one is a must-see. Oh, and I think his plot was only slightly weaker than 1986's other fighting pilot peak, Top Gun.
