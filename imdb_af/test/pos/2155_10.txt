Sony Pictures Classics, I Look At You! Sony has the right to Harry records - you have to distribute the movie and you will get radically increased sales of its catalog! Anyway, it is a wonderful study of a fascinating musician, enraged, full of wonderful stories, bigger music and it could have been 3 hours longer and I would have loved it even more. Seeing it at the American Cinemateque Mods & Rockers Festival at the Aero Theater in Santa Monica, where it played for a packaged house. They turned people around the door! I went to much of the Mods & Rockers festival movies, and I can assure you that no other movie has even sold out, let's turn people away. Watch it in the theater, buy the DVD, and make sure a few slow-on-the-recording companies [* Cough SONY Covers *] get it as soon as possible!
