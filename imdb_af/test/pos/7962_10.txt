It is without a doubt one of the most perfect debut films for any director. The movie is only 90 minutes long, but just about everything is about life and death. Not much action, and the dialogue is minimal, but the movie flows perfectly and requires your attention because of the wonderful natural feeling of everything going on. The lead performances are perfection, and even some supporting characters get strong emotional scenes. The movie will be a bit lost on today's modern audience, but it is one that everyone should see. Indifferently unintentional and honest, it is equal to Ozu's works. <br /> <br /> Scratch my title, this one is perfect!
