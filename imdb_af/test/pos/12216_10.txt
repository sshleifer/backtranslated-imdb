Surface is one of the best shows I've ever seen. NBC is so stupid to cancel a big show like this and worse from everyone just to finish it halfway. NBC or someone else must give Surface at least one season so it can be completed. It is as if NBC has given you a book to read and halfway through it to take it away from you and then you can never get the end. I just want to see what's happening to everyone and most importantly to see what's happening to Nim. I think I can say it safely about most Surface fans, that is, we want to save Nim! Nim took away our hearts and then NBC cut them into two. Come on NBC, give Surface another season!
