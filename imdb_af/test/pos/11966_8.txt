I wonder if I could take a whole musical comedy from Russia or East Germany or other countries that for decades almost always propagandist film, anti-fascist films, anti-war films (such as this documentary) dark, bad times under Stalin and the life behind the iron curtain. It is then fascinating to see the other side of the coin, the kind of clowns and rebels with music on their side holding the masses more often than not in the socialist way of life. One movie was actually impressive, called Jolly Fellows by the pioneer of the small group of musicians filmmakers, Grigori Aleksandrov. From the clip (s) I saw of that movie, I would admit that it was one of the only works to actually get out of itself and just make wild, manic, comfortable. But as this movie shows, if you want to entertain a filmmaker, it's a 'message' better. <br /> <br /> Through interviews, sometimes alternating quasi-dramatizations (of Russia / Germany / etc's kind of movement photo association) at the censorship table and clips, you get the full picture of how it was - both behind the screens and on the screen - just to make the masses pure entertainment. Some of the films (well, most of them, as apparently only 14 certified over 40 years in the mentioned countries) have made a good deal of change, but for what purpose really? One is also drawn into its culture, how much different from the American way of "if it works, make em while warm". But at the same time, perhaps from this repression, some interesting, funny, and (from what I have seen) were made tapestries. They might have been pretty typical of what was asked to show to the masses, under Stalin's crazy but demanding terms, such as life with tractors. It even becomes a more sweet story, as we have shown how it was in the sixties, the last wave of musical comedies, such as rock and roll and pop tunes, finally hit their airwaves. <br /> <br /> In short, some good things ... but only if you are interested, really. I showed the film in a class on documentary films, and half of the class fell asleep. So be warned on the one hand, though on the other hand if you are looking for it, it can make for a very rewarding journey into European film history.
