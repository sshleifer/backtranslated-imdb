Straight, I love this movie. I love everything about it. It has a good soundtrack, it has many recognizable faces and it's funny like hell. There are so many plots in this movie and each one is somehow funny. <br /> <br /> Two years ago, when Spicolli illuminated the screen, Drake is almost unforgettable. All he wants to do is have fun. He moves out of the house without the permission of his parents, he works when he feels it, he is obsessive with sex, he loves his drugs and drinks and he tries to be a good friend. It's his lack of attitude that makes him so happy to look. And he comes out with some big lines. And there are so many small observations that you don't see coming, but they let you laugh at the sheer speed when it hits you. One particular moment is when Tommy and Bill talk about Bill's ex girlfriend who is now someone else. At the end of the conversation, Tommy takes his big beer bottle and just throws it over his shoulder. He says good night and the scene ends. It's a perfect scene. Tommy's world is his own. He really lives to party and have fun. When the conversation is over, his time is over and he doesn't care who he insults in the process. He has an innocence over him. "It's comfortable" is his favorite. <br /> <br /> Another classic scene is Reggie who gives Bill a donut. He says something to me that my friends and I will never forget, because we have regained the movie ten times and watched the part over and over and hurt ourselves. It must be seen to be appreciated. <br /> <br /> Wild Life is a return to when teenage comedians were funny, resting, having a good ear, entertaining and just wanting to get lost in their world. 90 minutes. Wildlife does all the things perfectly. If it's a movie you haven't seen, give it a chance. It's a classic. <br /> <br /> Also look at the army store that Jim is having trouble with. He is now a well-known face and it's his first role on the big screen.
