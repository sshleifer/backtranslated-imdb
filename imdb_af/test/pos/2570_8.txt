I was actually all that Black Snake Moan was a big movie taking place in the south. The story follows a man named Lazarus whose wife shed him for his brother and found Rae to leave and hit the side of the road. Lazarus finds out that Rae is a sex addict and murdered as a child, so he decides to take matters into his own hands by tying Rae with a chain to cure her of her evil. Samuel L Jackson and Christina Ricci have great chemistry together and their performances make you believe it by their struggle and seek salvation that Lazarus and Rae become best friends. I was also amazed at Sam's ability to play and sing an electric guitar. S Epatha Merrkensen is wonderful as Lazarus love affair Angela, Justin Timberlake plays Rae's boyfriend Ronnie who is used under the film, but does the best he can to make a good show.
