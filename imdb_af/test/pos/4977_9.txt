This is the classic western. The good, Glenn Ford, the pounding hero, the former soldier, the man who would not hold a gun again. He must eventually establish the evil Land Baron, Edward G. Robinson, who owns most of the valley and wants it all. Then there's Barbara Stanwyck, the right ruler. Edward G. Robinson's wife, allowing no one to get in her way, even though Edward G. Robinson looks weak. She is so angry that everyone alongside her blind ambition and ruthlessness falls to rule the valley and everyone in it. The glare in her eye as people see death to her is unpleasant. It's worth waiting for. Hit a young Brian Keith and some others and you have a drama that stands alone. With the necessary punches, shooting, lurking and close-ups of tough cowboys and you have a west of a western. If you don't give anything away, there are plenty of turns and turns to make it not just a standard cowboy shoot-em. -up.
