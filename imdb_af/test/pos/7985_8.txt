What can I say, this movie is wonderful. It has its flaws, like every movie, for example, wobble tombstones in a cemetery, a distinctly visible slate board during the penguin's death screen. Max Shreck loses his heavy jacket in a split second between shots during the image consulting scene, batman losing his black eye makes a sudden merger so he can reveal Bruce Wayne to Catwoman. Dialogue is recorded, but is played and spoken differently when it is spoken in the first place. Lastly, Catwoman suddenly knows how to use a bulb without any training whatsoever. these bugs are small compared to some you would see in a batman for example, where the riddle can of course be seen and waiting for her visit or fall Kilmer's hair that changes between shots. <br /> <br /> making this movie so worthwhile from an 8/10 is the big play because the shows are absolutely amazing. Michael Keaton replays his role as Batman and has much more to do in this movie. He looks more comfortable in the role the second time and is on par with the villain performance. Danny Devito is the perfect penguin. I really like the conversion of the penguin into the grotesque penguin man instead of the non-threatening character of the comics or TV show, because now the character has more depth and has a much more interesting story arising from the basic need and have a need for family and to feel. It gives us an evil character who feels sympathetic to him because he is rejected because he is what he is not. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as Catwoman. She is weak and sexy and she is also a villain who can feel sorry for the way she is victimized. Christopher Walken is a great secondary villain and is so interesting a character, although he is not even in the batman universe. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is much better than the first and Danny Elfman gets more chance to show. of his musical talents this time. The sets are wonderful. They are detailed, striking, sinister, gothic, unique, dark and so many other adjectives can describe how wonderful they look. the costumes and make-up are great and of course, a lot of work has been done to make them and all the work is rewarded because the Batsuit is better, the cat suit is great to look at and the penguin and effects are so convincing. The animatronic penguins really look realistic and are played to good effect. The writing is really good and the storyline is, in my opinion, an acceptable one. Generally, because of all these factors, this movie earns an 8/10 and stands as my favorite of all the Batman movies
