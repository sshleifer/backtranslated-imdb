Currently playing at the 2007 German Film Festival in Australia http://www.goethe.de/ins/au/lp/prj/ff07/enindex.htm thanks to Peanutqueen and especially AriesGemini for her finishing on the actors in this ensemble cast . <br /> <br /> In Australia, these movies are subtitles in English and while French movies often get a mainstream release, German movies are still this kind of commercial audience. But like BMWs and Mercedes when Germans do it, I really like their movies. Like PQ, the time went so fast, much of the audience laughed, as each of the 9 men and 9 women shifted the speed data line 5 minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> While many movies overlook one that I could have looked a lot more at. It had the kind of characters and character development for a series. Over time, I will read AriesGemini100 review again and refer to the actors I liked and their other work with a view to keeping them in mind. I agree .... most of these actors go on bigger and better things. Some very good character actors in this fine movie. I saw it in the program listed as a mockumentary. Mock or else it feels very real. And quite romantic in that way. <br /> <br /> Viva la Deutcsh!
