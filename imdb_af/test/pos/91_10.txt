This film by the NFBC was made in honor of the Montreal Canadian dynasty years in the 50s, 60s and 70s. My 5th grade teacher played it in class in honor of my 11th birthday in 1987 and also to celebrate my return from a serious facial injury in 1986. I was a Canadian fan for 29 of my 30 years of life. At a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a 117. All hockey fans should see it because I hope it will be placed in the Fame Hockey Hall in Toronto and at the Bell Center in Montreal or here in Edmonton Rexall is placed. location. Watch this movie with your family. It's a good movie. I also recommend the book in both French and English. Go Habs Go.
