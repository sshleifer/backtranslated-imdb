A few days ago, I watched this movie at the Magnolia Theater in Dallas. Punk! Everyone and everything involved in the film added to it. The music, of course, of course. But the movie itself caught the whole punk genre. Even a grandmother and school teacher (I) can appreciate artists who can actually transform their ideas (well, reality, film-wise). This movie takes a handful of signed off young filmmakers and shows clearly and cleverly the "why" of their anxiety that they don't get the green light to finish the Waldo movie. The (relatively) happy girl gave good comic relief, a beautiful break from the constant (but understandable) attack on the man who had let them down. But love Stu. And be sure to check / read the credits - this is the icing on the cake!
