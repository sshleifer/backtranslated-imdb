Look ... I came to expect this level of acting from William Macy ... the guy just keeps a tremendous performance ... but MISS LOAF? Just then did his loyalty decide to leave Jim Steinman behind and definitely throw down lower weight in the wonderful world of Stanislavsky? Well, what can I say? I'm really impressed. To paraphrase an old expression: "It's not the meat, it's the emotion" ... and the Loaf silences his acting branches. Outside Laura Dern, the 40s carry out. perfect here ... good work at the costume and hair sections ... David Paymer is tipecast but right on the money. Fixed camera works throughout the movie. The plot line is reminiscent of "Gentleman's Agreement" (anti-Semitism after World War II). Worth your time ... especially for the growing legions of Bill Macy acolytes. <br /> <br />
