After being a Marine, I can tell you that the D.I. is so accurate an image to date that depicts the Marine Corp boat camp and how boys have changed in men. Jack Webb is excellent as Sgt.Jim Moore, a tough but fair drill instructor in Paris Island North Carolina. The film focuses on one site that doesn't "want to come to the program." A more recent film, Full Metal Jacket, also shows life in basic training and is worth watching.
