I originally posted the first user's comment on this movie, claiming it was a crap and it didn't make sense. I DO SENSE. Campfire stories are a very enjoyable movie (now that I am 2 years older and watch it last night). The actors were known, but not too familiar. The play itself was more than acceptable, it was pretty good. I will evaluate the movie by segment of movies. <br /> <br /> 1) The black and white scene (AKA - "The Hook") This one was rather useless, it looks good but has not kept much grip, the only disappointing one, I don't think so is even included as a segment. Here's the scare-o-meter. <br /> <br /> --- --- (Poor) <br /> <br /> 2) The RV Story (honeymooners sitting in the bush). Perhaps the most entertaining of all stories, the acting was also good in this one, disappointing by the typical caravan sex scenes. Yet it was offensive, you think, "Who knocked that door." It had tension and not too much trouble. I had this one <br /> <br /> -------------- ------------ (Very good) <br /> <br / > 3) Internet Chat Languages ​​(Little Girl Meets Psycho) It was a smart addition, gore left on a minimal, scare left at EXTREME. Although sowing sometimes, the last few minutes were most entertaining, don't misunderstand me, it was still fun to watch. Really scary, and can happen to anyone, so see who you're talking to. <br /> <br /> --------------------------- (Very good) <br /> 4) Ghost Languages ​​(Man kiss ghost) ?? Not the best, it wasn't too atmospheric for a ghost story. This one was funny, the aspects were pretty good, music and screaming, but everything was too real to be horrible, though it was good, it was quiet and bloody. could have been better with that idea. <br /> <br /> ------------- (Acceptable) <br /> <br /> 5) The End (the 4 lost teenagers) These are the 2 attractive gals and guys who tells the stories through the movie. The best thing about the movie is definitely the end, it makes a good impression, the end is completely unexpected. Look, it was done so well, realism was spectacular. <br /> <br /> ----------------------------------- (TOP NOTCH) <br / > <br /> 6) THE FILM OVERVIEW Campfire stories were more than I used it, I actually like it now, I buy it on video because it's a wonderful movie that is entertaining. garbage you see today, like many, I'm disappointed that it doesn't really go anywhere, it was straight to video, to me it was better than all the hype "ho rror" you see these days. Overall for campfire stories <br /> <br /> ----------------------------- (Very good) <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10
