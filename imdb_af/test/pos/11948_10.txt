I saw this movie for the first time in 1988 when it was on HBO and I loved it !! It was so hilarious I had seen it too many times to count. I love the brothers Stork and the keen, ugly dog, Bosco! My favorite quote from the movie is: "It's so ugly, it must be slept." I also loved it when the little sister hit the girls back and their faces stick like that. I also love John Cusack and Demi Moore in this movie. They were wonderful. This movie reminds my colleagues when I first saw it. I hired the movie countless times and watched it over and over. My college roommate and I just couldn't get enough of it. Who couldn't love this crazy movie? I want to buy a copy on DVD, does anyone know where to find it?
