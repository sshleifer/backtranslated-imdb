"Prime Suspect 4" continues to exploit the inexcusable and dogged seeker of truth and justice, detective superintendent Jane Tennison; the first of three miniseries (PS4, PS5, & PS6) with the significant absence of the founding author Lynda La Plante from the credits. The second three series, with the same eager reality of the first three series, type Tennison against the forces of evil while dealing with middle-aged, loneliness, indiscretions, a host of personal and professional problems, and decisions that are sometimes less than ideal. is, handle. PS4 announces two stories, while PS5 and PS6 are some episodes that each find Tennison seeking on behalf of the brutally aggrieved justice while fighting institutions that are willing to provide the interests of its victims for those of greater importance. In other words, to overcome, Tennison must overcome both evil and good forces, making the ever-gray scenarios of the PS series even grayer and the Tennison wars so much a matter of principle than finding murderers. Very good things that only get better from series to series. (B +)
