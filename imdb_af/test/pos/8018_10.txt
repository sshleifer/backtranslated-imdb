While "The Jackal" (Remake of the Excellent Jackal) has better aesthetics [and a bootload budget], this movie cuts the real persona of "Carlos" ... <br /> <br /> Quinn excels if the naval officer has chosen to personalize the wiley fox to stick it out and in the hands of Kingsley and Sutherland he turns inside to do so. <br /> <br /> To say more, his family, his career, and everything he believes will do, even if it is unwilling. <br /> <br /> To say more, it will spoil ... it's an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> 3 1/2 Niro ~ Stars [of 4]
