If you need that instant buzz, it's just the late 60's / early 70's that can give Euro sex movies, look no further, because you've just stumbled over the mother! Subsequent TV director Schivazappa's exercise in psychedelic porn (of the soft core variety) generally cannot be considered a classic of its kind, but it beats much better-known titles such as Tinto Brass, Jess Franco and Joe D "Amato for a loop. . Radley Metzger was probably so hip to someone else when he picked up this wonderfully distorted small number for American distribution by his company Audubon. Beautiful cinematography (promoting symmetrical compositions) can call 'pretentious' calls from those who swear by foamy fleece skirts shot in someone's backyard. Quite as far as I am concerned, it is their loss, as it is an exciting movie of a movie with a twist, so that you won't even believe them after you have seen them on the screen! Dagmar Lassander (immortal as the caretaker of Lucio Fulci's HOUSE THROUGH THE BUDGET) has never looked more exceptional than she is here, and the innocent (?) Researcher stole hostage by medical doctor Philippe Leroy (with all the art house favorites for his name, you wonder if he has the good mood to name this one on his resume) as their initial violent relationship with S & M-tinted love story changes. Nothing, however, seems to be in this sick and imaginative jewel of a movie with several truly erotic moments reached with surprisingly minimal nudity. I was completely astonished and enchanted by the way Schivazappa chose to introduce oral sex during one scene (I'll let you find one for yourself ...) and Lassander's gauze-dressed boogie for an impossible gruesome 60's becomes iconic in a way similar to the image of Sylvia Kristel lying in her wash chair in her EMMANUAL days. You may not know this movie yet, but trust me, even if you have ever seen it, you will never forget it !!!
