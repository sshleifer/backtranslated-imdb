This is without a doubt the most exciting and satisfying movie I've seen for years! The plot seen in the picture is almost banal. A ship falls on a desert plan with three suns, the survivors have to adapt to the landscape and to each other, then the darkness falls and the monsters appear. Pilot Fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere when she almost destroyed the passengers, took control of the group and renounced the help of convicted killer Riddick to guide them through the darkness to the escape ship - he is the one with surgery-enhanced eyes that can see in the dark. But it's really not that simple - every character is complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting features, so you never know who is good and who's bad. <br /> <br /> The performances are uniformly beautiful - Radha Mitchell shows Braai herself for leadership, overcoming her own fears, and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, like the man Riddick is again in custody, shows that he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. But the movie belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen for years. For many of the film, his face is in the shade, and he doesn't say much, but he draws your attention the same way. Sometimes he draws your attention by not talking - or by not moving. And Diesel doesn't trivialize the character, as it can be done so easily, giving him a "heart of gold". Riddick is another one and evil man as they approach the ship. He just lets us see the first preliminary steps just take care of the self to care for others. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is very good. The lighting effects are excellent on both sides of the spectrum - the over-light triple sunlight and the pitch darkness. Special effects that show both Riddick's as the samples' standpoints add to the tension as well as the sound effects of the monsters that fly and use ultrasound to "see" (the samples themselves are anatomically plausible and appropriately frightening). Editing is so stiff that at times it almost falls apart - there is literally no padding in this movie, not fading, no time to re-orient yourself. <br /> <br /> From the opening shot to the end of the credits you have To keep your mind over you. Every scene, every line of dialogue, every camera shot is important. See it three times to understand everything. <br /> <br /> My only warning is about science - the solar system shown in the model is impossible (planets revolve around suns, not the other way around). However, this does not affect the human story, so I have not declined it.
