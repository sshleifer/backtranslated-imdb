* The residence of Al Capone <br /> <br /> * Who shot JFK? <br /> <br /> * Cynthia Gibb lands part of "Gypsy" in the TV remake <br /> <br /> These are some of the great unsolved mysteries of the 20th century. How else can I say, except I thought it was unreasonably terrible. Mannequin ways, poor reactionary acting (ie: it is empty, stare staring while talking co-star in the scene) and a singing voice that most voice coaches will "mediocre" regard. But she is beautifully beautiful and it was not what the Gypsy character is about? She didn't cut the mustard in the talent department. <br /> <br /> As for the rest ... Bette is fantastic. Whether she's playing herself or playing Mama Rose, or it works either, and for one I thought Rosalind Russell was as exciting as plaster in the original. Peter Riegart as "Herbie" is the perfect, understated foil for Bette's overnight Mama, and he is the medium temperature glue between Midler's hot dish and Gibb's coal mash. Riegart is right. <br /> <br /> A final holler for the man responsible for decades to come from Cher jokes: Bob Mackie. Sleep queens will kill for the brilliance and shine here. Everything comes on sequins and bugle beads! <br /> <br />
