I love this movie! When I watched this movie on TV when I was a kid, it scared hell out of me. Probably because mannequins also make me crawl. Jocelyn Jones (Molly) is an excellent actress. She uses her facial expressions, especially her eyes, on terrifying play. Chuck Connors is great as Mr Slausen. I was happy to see him play such a different role. The other actors in this movie are also fantastic! Tanya Roberts (Becky) and Robin Sherwood (Eileen) are great actresses and I hope to see it in future movies, especially Jocelyn Jones! <br /> <br /> If you love scary movies but are tired of seeing the same old thing, watch this movie!
