20 years later and this movie still has echoes of the greatness that floats around. Never over-movie Valley Girl's incredible soundtrack. The film has completely shifted the 80's to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized many years later. Nicolas Cage at its best. A movie that has so much character for it that makes you realize how sad Hollywood has become (as far as quality is concerned). The special edition DVD is loaded with tons of extras and it's worth buying, as you'll have enough material to sift. For sure.
