If you take the Huxtable parents and mix them with the Kyle parents, you get a perfect combination of top and bottom education that you can wish for your own family education skills. The best part of every show is that the parents do not come down because the pompous self-righteous upper class knows it all, but at the same time they are not the stereotypical under-educated parents who are constantly becoming bamboo and don't respect their children. My children are 20, 16 and 6; About the same ages as the Kyle kids, and I see so many of their situations reflecting my own experiences with my family. The slackness they enjoy just shows that when you have love in your family, you don't have to take yourself too seriously to keep your household together and have fun with your children.
