This movie reminds me of 'Eternal sunshine of immaculateness' and 'gardening' not because of content, but because it is one of those movies you don't hear from mouth to mouth, or you read the back of the DVD the video store and think "why not". Needless to say, I was pleasantly surprised (like the aforementioned films) how good it was and how much I enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> The best seen with little knowledge of the movie and with just the plot that leads you to actually watch It. Also best seen with someone else or if you know someone else who saw it - you want to talk about it !! It's a beautiful movie that will stay with you after you watch it. It is also an intelligent watch that requires little effort to find out. <br /> <br /> Just enjoy :)
