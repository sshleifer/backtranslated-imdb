<----- Minor Spoilers! -----> <br /> <br /> A woman becomes pregnant, but not by her husband. She developed "something" in her, or at least that's what her husband thinks. They are going through very difficult times while on the verge of a nervous breakdown. The man contacts a UFO professor, and with his help they try to find out what is wrong with her. <br /> <br /> <----- Minor Spoilers! ----> <br /> <br /> The story could have been a little better, or at least less predictable, but the movie is striking and it helped me and my sister to run the whole movie without problems get. The acting is very good, and the filming is much better than normal if you compare it to your normal b-alien movie. The effects are good, and something happens every second of the movie. The characters are really nice, and apart from a stupid nurse in the scene, they are all convincing in their roles. <br /> <br /> I thought it was a good movie, and can recommend it if you want strangers / monster kidnapping movies! <br /> <br /> 7/10 - The story could have been a little less predictable.
