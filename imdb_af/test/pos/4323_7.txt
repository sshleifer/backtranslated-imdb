Woaww Is it just now that you see the links between all the characters? Of course it's Libby! And for the man in breeding with Desmond, any deja vu ??? Yes! He was the "same" man who gave money to Sayid after he killed or tortured the other soldier in the episode 14 of the 2nd season: One of them. Actually, it's not quite the same man, he called the name Joe in the 14th episode and Kelvin in the last 2 episodes. Gemini ?? :) Who knows ?? JJ Abrams ... mmmm I don't even know :) There are hundreds of links like this between all the characters. <br /> <br /> But it was just in response to the Libby comment. <Br /> <br /> I found those 2 episodes much more interesting than the whole season. 2. Throughout the season I felt that there were many things I missed and very few things I learned. Especially at the beginning, the 1st episode of the 2nd season is excellent, and then the 2nd one is a kind of flash back from the 1st one. I found it disappointing, even though I'm pretty sure everything in Lost tends to have a meaning. It was just an example of how I was frustrated to watch those episodes. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the last 2 episodes. I think we learned more new things in the 2 episodes than in the whole season. But all we learn is small pieces for the next puzzle, like the involvement of Desmond's "family members" (sorry if I spoil too much, believe me or not, I'm not trying). So many things that have been triggered in the past 2 seasons are still unclear or have been developed once, nothing. And still, there is new material as if all the holes in the picture were not enough. We all want to see the big picture of everything, but I think we have to be very patient. I hope there will be only 3 seasons. I'm not sure I will look at more than 3 seasons anyway. There were also many actions in the very last episode. And a good cliffhanger at the end. <br /> <br /> So basically yes, I loved the last episode ... and yes, I want to see the third season.
