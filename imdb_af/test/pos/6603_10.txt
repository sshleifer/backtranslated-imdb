My son, an avid skateboarder, sat me down and showed me. Since I liked documentaries, it didn't put much pressure on him. The whole amazing story of it all - a bunch of impatient kids float together and end up creating something revolutionary from the air. Well, more from some woods, wheels and lack of waves to navigate - it just flooded me. It still does. I didn't think I'd enjoy it as I did, and I also didn't think I'd tear up to watch Stacey Peralta about the fate of Jay Adams. And just look at Jay Adams himself ... the sheer genius of the skater and the shoulder of the adult who remembers. I watched it last night for the 10th time and I still get dumplings and watch him fly the hill with Jimi Hendrix's "Freedom" playing in the background. And I tore it again. Not too many movies have the same impact with me after several views. Brilliant.
