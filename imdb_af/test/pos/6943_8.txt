Although I lived in Australia in 1975, I have not moved abroad long ago, with constant industrial turmoil, the general worship of mediocre - unless one sportsman is! - and the complacency of so many Australians who have chosen to ignore the breakthrough of change taking place in countries to their north. <br /> <br /> As a result, I missed The Dismissal, along with many other Australian TV dramas of the 80's and 90's, such as the excellent Janus and Phoenix series I've seen since, along with Wildside. <br /> <br /> For me, the filmed story of The Dismissal is fair and, to my knowledge, accurate. But with regard to public "outrage", it shows just one side of the picture, not how families were torn apart by the controversy. I know, as my two brothers would not talk to me months later. <br /> <br /> But the comments are, in my opinion, very one-sided throughout. The inevitable fact is that, despite fierce expressions of anger from a significant part of the community, Australian voters - and decisively decide - favor Fraser, as they did two years later. <br /> <br /> These separate, historically accurate and extremely well maintained docudrama.
