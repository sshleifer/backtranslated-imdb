This movie for me and my wife is more entertaining than all the abundant thriller / mystery / murder movies. It's about real people who make the best of their lives. They are only Indian and the main characters are in law enforcement. The realistic play and wonderful scenery is more than the easy unpredictable plot. The soundtrack is by BC Smith, who also did the soundtrack for Coyote Waits, and that's fine. Adam Beach plays a tribal policeman who harms a little accident and West Studi is the stoic fully professional detective. There are many other good, either supportive or como roles by Graham Greene, Tantoo Cardinal, etc. We also saw Coyote Waits, another adaptation of a Hillerman novel, and we also enjoyed it very much.
