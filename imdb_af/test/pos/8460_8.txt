Although the assumption of the movie is a great coincidence, the actors all do a deserving job and look good to bring the story to life. I chose myself for the characters played by Mary Tyler Moore and Christine Lahti, and encouraged and reconciled. Sam Waterston and Ted Danson are also good at their roles, and do a decent job with the stereotypical friendship. While the story tends to jump through time, occasionally the audience may get a little hungry for missing detail, it still flows and avoids any real confusion. This interesting story has all the elements for a good "chick flick".
