Nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 2004 Academy Awards, my filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn follows in his quest to find out about his father, legendary architect Louis I Kahn. Lou Kahn died in 1974 when Nate was 11 years old. He has left an incredible but limited body of work, unpaid debt and three separate families who all live within a few miles of each other. <br /> <br /> My architect follows Kahn's life by examining his buildings chronologically and fading their beauty with the story of a charismatic but selfish and emotionally immature genius. As the boy Lou had never publicly acknowledged, Nate put him in the narrative without overwhelming the main focus. <br /> <br /> Exploring the beautiful Salk Institute in California, Nate calls his father's mythological use of space and light into his buildings, making it a peaceful and fascinating experience for viewers. The shot of Nate rollerblading in Salk's smoky white central meeting place highlights the building's harmony with nature. It's awesome. My architect also covers the issues Louis Kahn had to accept his designs. Several fantastic buildings only exist on paper, fired by more practical architects and property developers. It was only when Louis Kahn went to the East that his visions were enthusiastically embraced. In India, where he built the Indian <br /> <br /> Institute of Management, a former co-worker describes him as a guru. In Bhangladesh, where he built the beautiful National Assembly, citizens see him as a father of democracy. <br /> <br /> Looking at my architect is a great way to start or continue to learn about architecture and the importance of space. But this is the irony of Lou Kahn's egoism combined with the transcendence of his work that will inspire you. 4 stars.
