The three shorts included in this composition were issued in 1959, timeless Chaplin classic, nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either. Chaplin's score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between shorts is also well done. The problem with this composition is a small but annoying one. The shorts are stretched around the 24-frame p. speed of contemporary movies while shorts themselves were shot at 20 frames p. These results are rough-looking, not very attractive, yet it was an excusable solution that gave rise to optical pressure technology at the time. It's just not excusable that the current DVD version is undamaged, the movies look dirty as they did in 1959 and are still printed. There are separate restored versions of these classics available, even on DVD, and it won't be a problem to restore the picture, but it hasn't been done yet. <br /> <br /> A small problem has taken on a lot. from the space in my article, but again I say a small problem, it should not detract from the experience, although it detracts from one point of my judgment. The shorts are still worth '10 '.
