This movie has it all. Great actors, good dialogue, drama, comedy, and excellent writing and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson. I've seen this movie several times and enjoy it every time. It doesn't get old, it's consistently entertaining and stimulating. Easy Burt Reynolds' best role, and he does a good job. John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle also give excellent comic performances. There isn't a bad element in this movie.
