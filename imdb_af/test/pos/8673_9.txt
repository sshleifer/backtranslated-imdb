What we have here is a movie that is perfect for anyone participating in the world of post-industrialism: earning money from sensual-less commodities to buy and sell, and to maintain a system which is little different from self-preservation. <br /> <br /> The beautiful filming (I always appreciate fix 35s and soft boxes) makes it a strange place to go, both enjoyable to look but scary to grasp (maybe it's too dramatic but she was true). <br /> <br /> Andreas's journey through his hell is overwhelmingly tragic. His pursuit is honorable, commendable and precious. The conclusion is needed and we are not sure if he is better off, which is the perfect conclusion. <br /> <br /> Letters! Highly recommended to all people who view their world with a critical eye and especially to those who do not (maybe it will encourage a reflection or two).
