I saw Jimmy Stewart in all the regular roles, but the "Spirit of St. Louis" was one of his favorites. A poor boxing office exporter when released, this film is largely forgotten today. Stewart, who tells the well-known story of Lindberg's famous flight in 1927, is initially bad, but his familiar voice never lets you forget who you are watching; It feels like George Baily again. But Stewart apparently worked hard and he did everything right, so long before you give up that Stewart was 20 years older than the man he portrays. Stewart's Lindberg is so gosh-darn, all-American, apple pie delicious that you're trapped in the story. And you realize Stewart wanted to portray Lindberg with all the worms, Yankee knowledge he could collect. up. Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the US, and Stewart seems determined to hold performances. <br /> <br /> Flashbacks are cleverly used to hold what is really a rather dull story moving, and I was struck by the subtle references to faith that was spread through the film; Lindberg is trying to teach a hopeless priest how to fly, only to be confronted by the priest on his beliefs, or Lindberg refuses a promoted St. Wearing Christopher medal to save weight on the plane, just to hide the medal in his lunchbox. after crossing the Atlantic. For me, it's not a movie about a man's epic journey to the unknown, but she realizes that this life is far greater than the things we can see and feel.
