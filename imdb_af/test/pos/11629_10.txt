I can understand how Barney can be annoying to some, but the hatred he gets is very ridiculous. Barney is simply made from the beginning and simplicity is not bad, especially for the little ones he entertaines. I find this display to be very disadvantageous personally. In my opinion, Barney & Friends is a very educational show and even 17 years after his debut (and almost 21 years after the character's home video debut), he repeatedly proves that he is still calling on young children. Perhaps less so than in the early 90's where Barney was the Hannah Montana of the time, but he's still a classic. As a fan of Barney himself, I feel I have to defend him in a way that doesn't look like spam. The way the persman learns things can be very simplistic and unrealistic, but would you rather hear them about war? Be grateful for one (a bought dinosaur, but still) there to comfort children and let them be children. At this time and age, I feel we are chasing our children to grow up and Barney is there to say that you can still be a child of heart. In addition, many of Barney's lessons about current episodes about plagiarism can be honest, and yes ... even death, call to everyone, not just his target audience. In addition, our children must learn to be kind and respect others for who they are, and he helps them to do so. In short, Barney can be annoying to some people and I understand why, but slap him. All he and his friends (with HIT Entertainment, his production company) are trying to do is not only teach help children the skills they need, but have fun and look at the positive parts of life. If more people listen to their children's favorite character and see him through their eyes, we may not be so negative about him and possibly life itself.
