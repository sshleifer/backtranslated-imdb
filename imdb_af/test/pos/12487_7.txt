The exceptionally sweet Suzy Delair plays a stately performer who is obsessed with the success of the theater. Her husband and accompanist, played by Bernard Blier, is a complicated but jealous man. If he finds out in a less than preferred way that his flashy wife planned a rendezvous with a nice old businessman for the purpose of promoting her career, he lost all control and threatened the businessman with murder. Now I have to stop describing the movie to you because it skates on such thin ice with its twists, revelations, ambiguities and tensions that suggest any of them will endanger it. I'm not sure how good or bad it is for this French police procedure that originates from the song and dance community, although it is certainly interesting that what we do not know is throughout, which did not. We don't know who did it. <br /> <br /> The story depends on the procedure of the following clues, where ideal alibis fail and where carefully crafted manufacturing and misleading decomposes. Interestingly, this is a suspense movie in which tension is generated, despite the tradition that is traditionally too much to think about. <br /> <br /> Quay of the Goldsmiths is the least dark of Henri-Georges Clouzot's films. It's nowhere as meaningful as the shocking Les Diaboliques, just as tragic as the budding Loon of Fear or just as honest as Le Corbeau. Perhaps this is due to the vibration of the dance halls and theatrical institutions of the 1940s France, which all work as the environment of this crime thriller. <br /> <br /> Clouzot understands and approves both his characters, even the more agile children, where he has more of a vengeful streak with his other films. Where he had understanding for the scheming women in Les Diabolique or the drivers who are at the level of dangerous terrible death to push themselves out of the unfortunate life in The Lords of Fear, there is not necessarily support or agreement about the part from the filmmaker, because these are the characters who made clear the direct decisions that determine their destiny. All the characters in this more establishment film have scenes and moments we suppress them, even the hard, cold detective played by Louis Jouvet. He worries his young adoptive son amidst all the trouble and despair that ever happens in his life. with the drop of a hat. <br /> <br /> There is humor and triviality, the latter mostly from Delair, which neutralizes pressure to some extent. Clouzot was quietly practicing his craft, patiently until he made his relentless later films, in which he would not forgive his audiences for the tension.
