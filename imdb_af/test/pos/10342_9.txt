Turning through the canals, I was fortunate to stumble at the beginning of this movie. I must admit that it almost immediately caught my attention. I love older movies and that is or should be considered a classic! One of the most wonderful features of this movie is that the main character was not only a woman but also a bad girl. I recommend this movie!
