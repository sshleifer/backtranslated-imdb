Some users are confused about the identity of the armed men walking the stairs in the "Odessa Stairway". These men are not Cossacks, but regular army troops. <br /> <br /> The Cossacks come to the scene a little later and they are the horses scraping the crowd with their saber. <br /> <br /> To experts on Russian history: Please correct me if I'm wrong. <br /> <br /> But there are some lines in the movie that apparently no one is commenting on. After taking over the Potemkin, someone in the crowd says to the beach, "Kill the Jews!" It's only a few seconds on the screen, but it's there. How cruel of history, not only in Russia, but in so many other countries, to blame Jews immediately, unthinkable and instinctively for any domestic trouble! Perhaps other parts of the movie aren't historically factual, but the cry against the Jews is too real. Comment, anyone? <br /> <br /> Also, why can't English speakers learn to declare the name as "Potjiekoek" instead of "Potemkin"? There is a need in Russian to distinguish the two possible statements from "e": either "you" or "yo." Sometimes two dots are used to distinguish these two statements, but usually the difference must be remembered.
