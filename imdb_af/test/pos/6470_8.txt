Martin Ritt's first film presents an exceptional existentialist answer (three years later) to Elia Kazan's more conservative "On The Waterfront." While "Waterfront" benefited greatly from Marlon Brando's electricity, unaware of Kazan's offensive theme of defending names (such as Kazan keen on the House's Un-American Activities Committee), "Edge of the City" boasts A young John Cassavetes and an upstart Sidney Poitier dare to confront issues that "Waterfront" have not recognized, namely workers' rights and race relations. <br /> <br /> "Edge of the City" boldly dives into this (then) unfamiliar area, and although the attractive black protagonist (Poitier) may look a bit Hollywood simplistic, the brave battle against thin assassin and violence hardly older. One wonders how shocked initial 1957 filmmakers were against such a bold representation of white-black relationships (if some of the fiancee did not leave the theater early, they should be hidden from the left, if not offended). <br /> <br /> The last role of the film will still surprise the audience as it refuses to sink into expected clich√©s, including those that have "waterfront" contaminated. Only the most select viewers will not realize what a radical and entertaining movie Edge of the City ends. <br /> <br /> What is most upset about this lost classic: how unfortunately it remains unavailable in any format, for reasons that remain quite cloudy. This film should be required to watch high school or college history classes across the country, but it can only be found on obscure late night TV, as ever.
