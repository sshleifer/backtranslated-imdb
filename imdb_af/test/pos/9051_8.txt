This 60 minute movie shows just how fun it can be. It's all great fun as it plays-out a no keep banned comedy attack on the Star Trek genre. In 'Hick Trek - The Moovie', a group of good boys are on a mission to exterminate a group of apostate cats to destroy the entire Redneck Federation. <br /> <br /> Can Captain Jerk stop the ominous Fluffy with the power of the RSS Bovine and that's Cow Ray ?? She may have nine lives, but he has ten dots! This cult classic (previously only seen at the scifi conventions) is a favorite party. Very funny moments!
