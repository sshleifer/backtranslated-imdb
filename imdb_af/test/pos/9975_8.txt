this movie has a decent story in my opinion, very good fight scenes, but i was a little disappointed at the end of the movie. I think it was a better way if Lydie denier also knew Karate or if she knew how to use some weapons, her character also became more interesting and she was a decent opponent of cynthia. I think when the director filmed the final 'fight' between cynthia & denier, he wanted to finish the movie so he didn't mind the end. All I think is that fans of cynthia rothrock will be very happy to watch this movie. It is not like 'yes, ma'am'! or sworn for justice, but it was fun enough and cynthia looks fantastic in this movie, so my rate for this movie is a solid 8/10
