If you asked me to choose the best active movies ever made, this movie, along with 1951's Streetcar Named Desire, will be on a short list. I think I will discover some others who qualify, but Kramer vs Kramer is an excellent exercise in naturalism. So it's a very satisfying experience on the level: just look at the wonderful, ingenious performances of Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep and the child Justin Henry in particular. One of the best children's achievements ever. <br /> <br /> But I also find it very satisfying to look, as it is such a thorough story - it always makes me forget my own problems. It has such an excellent narrative drive. As soon as you have kept Kramer vs Kramer, and Alice Kramer lets Ted juggle work and their young son, he doesn't tell him anything more than she has to discover herself - you keep knowing that everything looks good to them. And even when you know how things come out, every moment of the ride turns so brilliantly that it's a joy to see it again and again. <br /> <br /> Make no mistake - Kramer vs Kramer is not light entertainment: it is a very realistic portrayal of the effect of divorce on everyone involved. <br /> <br /> 10/10. <br /> <br /> For one of the best scripts (born from talks between Benton and Hoffman, which was then divorced) ever performed, executed and performed beautifully and flawlessly. Not to mention what a wonderful story is. Put simply, a perfect movie.
