I recently watched this movie and fell in love with it. I loved the storyline and the actors. It has a bit of everything. I was completely taken away by the story. It has so many surprises along the way. I highly recommend it. In fact, I loved it so much that I bought out and bought the book. I felt I had to read it to appreciate the art in the writing behind the movie. I also wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything in the book but was kept out of the movie. I recommend people who love the movie to read the book because there is enough difference in the book, especially in the second episode, to read it. It became my favorite movie. I'm now a Sarah Waters and Elaine Cassidy fan !!
