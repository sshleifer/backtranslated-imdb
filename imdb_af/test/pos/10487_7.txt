PRICE OF HONOR aka PRICE OF POWER is an ambitious Western melodrama, highlighting the action, aimed at telling an Old West version of the JFK assassination. In 1881 the president traveled to Dallas and was shot from a window while driving through the town in his cars. Corrupt officials carried out the murder and a humble slave took the rap. Our hero, the giant but intense Giuliano Gemma, aims to unravel the conspiracy. An impressive story, rushed for his subject, but entertained despite the scarcity of shooting-up action. The film is a 7 out of 10, despite the poor presentation of the DVD, which is too dark with poor sound. Search for a good copy.
