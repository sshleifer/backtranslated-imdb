The art of absurdity is alive and thriving in the current Danish cinema! Well, at least in this movie. No one in this movie is amused. They are all very annoyed or shocked, and if they are not yet, they will be quick! It is a story of screws, murder, embarrassment, dignity and ultimately love and redemption. The chilling, uncomfortable humorous style is idiomatic and won't appeal to everyone, but personally I found it to be just the right fascinating mix of bizarre and absurd. You're sorry for the characters from a distance, even if you don't like them very close and personal. But their story is so tragic that you find it in yourself to forgive and be happy for them even when they get away with murder. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this is definitely the best Danish movie of the past few years. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
