I happened to happen it. I was at my friend's house and he just started watching, so I sat down and thought we would shoot the breeze while playing in the background. But within seconds I was immersed in this documentary drama, and we both focused completely on the rest of the time and didn't say a word to each other. <br /> <br /> I never knew the story of the first solo about the world yacht race, let alone the tragic events of one man's attempt at odds living his salvation for all his irregularities, but eventually it becomes an example of them. If I didn't know the story, I watched it with the same fervor as I followed those who read about the race at the moment it actually happened and was eager for more information, with hoping that the only amateur would go against the chances and beat the pros, making the shocking twists and turns of the story all the more tragic. I felt like I was living the story. <br /> <br /> The story is told with great care, and the interrogators clearly had time to think about the tragedy. It gives good insights, but is also well confronted by the archives of interviews during the tragedy. The recordings and photos of the lone sailors are also well used, and the insights into the mood of the sailors and how loneliness influenced them were excellent. <br /> <br /> I am shocked that this story is no longer widely known or changed in a movie, but also grateful. Thanks for having this drama documentary to tell the story of those who knew the man, instead of a wish-film adaptation, and grateful that I caught this jewel of a movie with the right chance. <br /> <br /> It's a must see whether you like documentaries or not.
