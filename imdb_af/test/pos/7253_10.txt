It must be my favorite movie. The script is sharp and played by an excellent Miller and fantastic Carlisle! Sharp white, excellent narrative and no Hollywood polishing; a complete movie you give to the bad guys! Stott shines again as the horrible chance, while Liv Tyler really hits her other, lighter appearances than the excitement hunger Rebecca! The soundtrack may not be known to you, but someone who has ever seen Top Gear, watched the football or watch any TV show series, is probably familiar with it, especially because of Craig Armstrong's "Escape" who never have to allow work again! The soundtrack on the first play may no longer be in a costume drama / action / comedy, but a repetition shows that it is perfectly at home to give the script, is it drama. <br /> <br /> My one grip on This movie is not shown enough on TV! Where is it? Actually excellent, sharp and stylish - you won't regret watching it - again and again! (outputs to turn on DVD player!)
