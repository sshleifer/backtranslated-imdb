Michael Jackson's Thriller (1983) must be the greatest video ever made. Dude, you got Zombies, Gore and a catchy voice, for which you can ask more. John Landis mixed elements of Night of the Living Dead and American Werewolf in London and from this video. What starts out as a nice evening for a young couple literally becomes a date from hell. You've got dancing zombies, a werewolf in a funky jacket and rapping Vincent Price. A cool video for a song that everyone in the neighborhood noticed. <br /> <br /> I have to give this one a high recommendation because it should be the best music video ever made. There was not one like it yet. <br /> <br /> Look at "making Thriller". The documentary has some "interesting" things in it.
