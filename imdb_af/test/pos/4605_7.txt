When I watched Lon Chaney, Jr. and Boris Karloff in the movie, I expected to find a typical "schlocky" 1950s-style horror movie. The opening scene (a cemetery with a wolfheap in the background) confirmed it. Only when I started watching did I discover that an English man (Richard Green) had a sensible little riddle to try to find out what happened to two of his friends who disappeared in the Black Forest and, if necessary, revenge against the evil count (Stephen McNally) who ruled the territory. Chaney, as the voiceless Gargon, had a rather limited role (one that reminds me of the Hunchback or Notre Dame, actually) while Karloff had a somewhat larger role than Dr. Meissen. In fact, Meissen was one of the more interesting characters in the movie, and it was hard to know until the end whether he would be formed to be a good guy or a bad guy! The castle was wonderful, and even the limited portrayal of the Black Forest was really enough. It certainly did not have such a low budget compared to other movies I saw anyway. The only disappointment I think was Rita Corday's performance as the Countess. She looked a little dry and didn't look much passionate about it. <br /> <br /> It found me that this movie kept my attention all the time, and there was enough tension about how it all went to look worth watching. Definitely recommended, with a 7/10 rating.
