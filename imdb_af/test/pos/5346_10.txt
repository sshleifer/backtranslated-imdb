This movie is what most of the industry has forgotten how to make: FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT, which means something that is pleasant to people of all ages. This particular Wallace & Gromit can be enjoyed by everyone from toddlers who love the colors and cute bunnies of their grandparents who understand the adult references. <br /> <br /> This movie has as good as any I've ever seen, and I mean it literally. It's also full of little bits of humor, and every scene has so much humorous detail in the background that I'm going to buy, even if it's just to read all the signs and handballs in the world of W&G. <br /> <br /> I plan to watch this movie at least twice in theaters, then buy it on DVD. You should also see it.
