I was a schoolboy when I first looked. The next day I knew that all of our students watched it and everyone was fascinated by the movie as I was. I think the same situation was in all forms of our school and throughout the Soviet Union. Later I watched it every time it was shown on TV and wanted to watch more. I think the comparison with "Back to the Future" or other Sci-Fi movies is not suitable. "Gost'ya iz budushchego" is unique in many ways, once you have looked at it, you never forget. <br /> <br /> This film is full of faith in peaceful science achievements, full of faith in the beautiful future of our world. It is not just the movie, but also a prediction of many scientific inventions and achievements. The time shown in the film is the year 1984 (the year of its creation) and the year 2084 (where a schoolboy Kolya Gerasimov traveled for some time and where his friend Alisa Seleznyova came from). The year is now 2005, many inventions and achievements predicted in the film are not yet realized. Like "Mielophone" (a device that can read minds of any animal and human), expeditions to Venus and Mars (as easy as a picnic in the weekend), creating and launching the satellites as a homework for pupils, Easy to manage flying machines (which have completely replaced cars), biobots, "historical identification" of any kind of material or being executed in a few minutes, and many others. Meanwhile, some of them have become much more realistic these days than they seemed in 1984! Just wait for 2084 :-) <br /> <br /> The movie also shows typical Russian schoolgirls and schoolgirls (and of course that too!). With their ingenuity, curiosity, humor, dreaminess. For example, look at Fima Korolyov, you can find such a character in almost every form of every Soviet school. Similar character was also in my form! Alisa Seleznyova ... myself and many of my classmates and I are in love with her first face! By the way, later, an actress who played Alisa became a scientist. I think she was so much influenced by the movie as people watching it on TV. <br /> <br /> Beautiful idea, beautiful realization, beautiful actors, beautiful music, beautiful song "Prekrasnoye Daleko" ... Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful ... <br /> <br /> The last thing I is saying that different remakes and new versions "of the song from the movie and even the film itself were later made and distributed on TV and on the internet. All of them are not even comparable to the original. comment, my comment is about the original, so request the original and enjoy it!
