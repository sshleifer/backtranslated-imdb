Everyone loves the cool, memorable heist movie. Alain Delon offers the antihero, Melville offers the cool, and a handful of other great talent (Yves Montand, Gian Maria Volonte, and Andr√© Bourvil, mostly) come to add a sharp, engaging movie. <br /> <br /> ... with very little dialogue. This is wonderful because one particular aspect of the genre tends to be a lot of dialogue about the fast and their different parties. However, this movie can be watched with the sound completely off and will not be missed too much. Not to say the sound is bad, oh no, the jazzy soundtrack and the sharp sound of the small movements make the slow, patient deliberation of the patients very compelling. <br /> <br /> What is really neat about this movie is that the color kinematics are pretty fantastic. Usually when it comes to cinematography, black and white movies tend to stick out in my mind, but this movie has some very strong and beautiful images that make the film observe pure visual pleasure. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
