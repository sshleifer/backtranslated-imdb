Less a thriller than a colorful adventure with exciting elements, the man who knew too much, shouldn't really be compared to such Hitchcock masterpieces as VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW, or PSYCHO; rather, it is similar to such a pleasant trunk as to get a deep and north through northwest. The film largely tells on the spot in Morocco and London. The film tells the story of a married couple (James Stewart and Doris Day) whose holiday is interrupted when they run out of innocence - and when their young boy is kidnapped to ensure their silence. <br /> <br /> James Stewart and Doris Day are fairly effective in their roles as the All-American couple, and the characters are given an unusual dispute: Stewart, a Midwestern doctor, is outgoing but has a touching the "ugly American abroad" about his personality; Day, playing a popular stage and recording a star that retired on her marriage, has a suspicious nature. These characteristics of personality and background play very well in the story. <br /> <br /> THE MAN WHO KNOWS contains a number of famous scenes; Both the scene in which Stewart's drug told her about kidnapping and the very complex Albert Hall series, which includes hundreds of cuts, is very powerful. Less often noticed, although in my mind equally or no longer satisfactory, are the more subtle scenes in which Hitchcock combines a tension of tension with perverted humor, such as when Stewart tries to find a taxidermist shop and ties from Que Sera, Sera "(written for this movie) in a most inappropriate way at an embassy sundowner. <br /> <br /> Although the man who got too much, the depth and impact of Hitchcock's bigger work, it remains a pleasant film and one that compares very well with his work as a whole - this is Hitchcock light but recommended. <br /> <br /> Gary F.
