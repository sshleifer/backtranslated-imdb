With documentary films, the question of realism is always raised. How much of the movie is real and how much is being manipulated by the filmmaker? In LITTLE DIETER, Flying Herzog must be absorbed to tell the story of a man who tells his own story to even address the question of realism towards formalism. From the beginning, Herzog's role as storyteller is obvious. Fortunately, he is a master storyteller. LITTLE DIETER is the best, most engaging documentary I've ever seen. Dieter's story is staggering, and Herzog's efforts to respond again have made Dieter speed up the story of his story while it is being filmed, being very effective. The story that Dieter tells is real, but Herzog is forever present, cruelly absurd comments of realism. This film is a must see for any documentary film and / or Werner Herzog student.
