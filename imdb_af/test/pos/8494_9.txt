Taylor Hackford wanted to make this movie for 15 years, and eventually Jamie Foxx played the title role. Foxx is wonderful in his portrayal of Ray Charles. From an interview I saw with Foxx he met several times with Charles and the two also played piano (Foxx had piano lessons as a young child and actually played piano in all his scenes). I didn't see Charles until she later years, so it was great to get a perspective on how his career developed. I hope Foxx is nominated for the best actor Oscar because he definitely deserves it. The music is also incredible - it shows the breadth of Charles's music, from country to blues, and everything in between. The film also gives an immaculate representation of Ray Charles's life, of the many women he had relationships with his drug use and its consequences.
