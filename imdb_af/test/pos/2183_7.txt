After a few years of the Humphrey Bogart film, "Two Against the World", it unexpectedly acted as a TCM title entitled One Fatal Hour, a First National Film of 1936. Bogey's character is Sherry Scott , the man who manages WUBC, a radio station whose program range loses listeners. The owner, Bertram Reynolds (Robert Middlemass), is a pathetic CEO calling the shots at the station, but hides behind his decisions by engaging Scott. <br /> <br /> In an effort to strengthen the audience base and Revenue, Reynolds has the idea of ​​reviving a 20-year murder case and playing it as a fifteen chapter radio. Scott learns from Dr. Martin Leavenworth (Harry Hayden) to write and present the plays. <br /> <br /> The Pembroke Murder case relates to a woman acquitted of the murder of her husband, the circumstances of which are not made clear. However, Gloria Pembroke married and now lives as Martha Carstairs (Helen MacKellar), married to a successful banker (Henry O'Neill), and their daughter Edith (Linda Perry) is about to be married (on the same day No less like the radio game is to reveal the identity of Gloria Pembroke). To overcome the devastating effects of this revelation, Martha and Jim Carstairs start a crusade to stop the program. At the same time, Edith's future in-laws respond by demanding that marriage not take place. <br /> <br /> Without revealing the final outcome, the film takes a devastating turn to shock the viewer. Edith Carstairs confronts the radio station principals, who admonish Scott strongly and vividly Reynolds. While accepting his share of the blame for the outcome, Scott partially lost himself by leaving his job, firing his secretary and taking her out of the office and acknowledging the conscience he had once. With a completely abrupt finish, the film leaves one as disoriented and upset as any movie that doesn't have a happy ending. <br /> <br /> With about a dozen films under his belt, Humphrey Bogart gets the opportunity to make the middle stage here with interesting results. With no name supporting players, Bogey rises after the event by controlling the radio offices, and performs the show as if it were his own. In an interesting little characterization, he expresses his excitement by crossing his hands over his curved head. He had a similar effect for half a year, which we will see in Casablanca. For Bogart fans it is a real surprise to catch such unexpected nuances.
