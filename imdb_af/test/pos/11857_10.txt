Why this movie was released in only 4 states is beyond me. I thought this movie was a divine story. The name says it all: See other people. This movie has more logic than laughter, which I suppose is why it works so well. Common sense also makes an appearance that looks like another sexual comedy. Alice gets her feet frozen in the cold when she feels irrational about the way she can do her fianc√©, not just sexually, but as a partner and friend. It starts with an almost archetypal trip for the two. of them. One after the other flings leads to problems, as if it wasn't a bad idea from the beginning. Sharp dialogue and comic essay make this one funny like hell! Nicholson and Mohr have the scene of the film early and keep the promise they expect. Other highlights include Lauren Graham, Andy Richter, and Helen Slater (in her first theater movie in 10 years!). Climax is turning bad, but a simple ending makes this one much more enjoyable than most movies today. Mohr fans will see something different in his Ed character, and fans of Helen Slater enjoy her shining moments of quick but excellent return. Any Richter takes the award for the most moralistic character. Romantic and funny, or just fun. To see other people is a jewel to be noticed.
