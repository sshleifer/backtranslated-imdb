Written by William H. Macy of, probably, Donald E. Westlake's best and most difficult novel, "A Travesty". * Much * true to the story, the movie dies Macy as a fearless man who comes too far over his head after trying to cover a casual death. Costs Adam Arkin and James Cromwell in good supporting roles. The strength of the movie is in the intricate turn-to-turn storyline and in the play, especially by Macy, who breaks routine and beautifully through the 4th wall and gets away with it every time. A good storyline with very dark humor, this one made me enough to watch it three times a week since it came out. Prepare your critical faculties and place a hard, dual "wheeeeee!".
