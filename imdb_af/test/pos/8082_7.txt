The film is a remake of a 1956 BBC series called 'My Friend Charles', and as such gallops through the material in a relatively short time. I moved it fast, enjoyable and unpretentious. Did anyone else see the scenes, at the end, where John Mills was stolen? The producers obviously decided to leave the screens - perhaps censorship? But notice when he sits at the window of the apartment, deep breathing is now followed by similar scenes with the car window open. The Francis Durbridge series all seemed to have the same universe, of inexplicable events, people are not what they seem and the villain is someone close to the hero / victim. A predictable universe in some respects, but one with its own rules and regulations.
