I watched it on television in 1989 and regretted not typing it. I was very interesting and exciting. It's great if the events unfold and the man's past picks him up. <br /> <br /> The play is the first time and the story is exactly what the title claims ... "distort the lot" ... but no one can run away from a life this man at the beginning of the had a movie.
