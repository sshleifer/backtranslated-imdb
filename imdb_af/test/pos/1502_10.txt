this movie gets a 10 because there are a lot of gore in it.who cares about the plot or the acting.this is an Italian horror movie people so you know you can't expect much from the acting or the plot. Everyone knows fulci took photos of other movies and added them to this one. Since I have never seen one of the movies he took from him, it didn't matter to me. Gore's Italian godfather made himself into this movie. This is one of those goriest Italian movies you'll ever see. Gore Hound should, without this movie, come into their horror movie collection.By this movie no matter what a whore dog dream come true.
