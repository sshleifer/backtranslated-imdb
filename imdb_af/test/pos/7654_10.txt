This film is a tapestry, a series of portraits of Rome communities woven by music. It is very much a musician's film, due to the lack of spoken dialogue - and what dialogue there is, is not important to the structure of the narrative. Some might expect a National Geographic story of "customs, clothing and music" or a plot line that paves some central characters. Don't look at this. <br /> <br /> This is because it is a portrait of a family of people, rather than telling a story of individuals. The plot is the story of space (India to Andalusia) and / or time (we cannot tell) of a people. No narrative is needed. You get a sense of joyful people, strongly linked to small communities where social interaction is very important. And a great sense of sadness in parts, in their rejection by society in general. <br /> <br /> It is therefore an attempt at the Rom culture, very well shot, with a wide spectrum of Rom music and a sting in the tail that is the oppression that these people face staring, and still facing.
