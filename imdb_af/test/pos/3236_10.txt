VHS - I watched it over and over and loved every minute so I now ordered the DVD. I just wanted the movie to last longer. I never worry about what other people think I prefer to put my own mind on and totally agree with the negative remarks and will not allow others to spoil my enjoyment of the movie at all. Make your own mind and don't let others leave you! I already have Jane Austen's BBC series, but this is my FAVORITE. I see there is a new Northanger Abbey that will be released in 2007, which I will buy when it comes out, but it won't stop me from watching Northanger Abbey released in the 80s.
