I have never heard of this movie before I experienced it over the shelves at a local rental shop. After watching the latest Harry Potter installment, I was intrigued by Rupert Grint and wanted to see more of his work. To read the description backwards about "an exaggerated, evangelical Christian doctor," and to identify as an evangelical Christian, I thought, "Oooh, it should be interesting." And so it was. I have Mr. Brock's story beautifully found in both words and images; and unfortunately, too well known. The contrast he has drawn between Ben's parent's interpretations of what it means to be a Christian was an interesting remark about how Christians view themselves and the impact perception has on those around them. On the one hand, we told Ben's mother, "Whatever happens behind these walls, Ben, we're God's ambassadors. We show the world a smiling face." On the other hand, Ben's father discusses the truth in his sermon at the beginning of the film. At the end of his monologue, he says: "The more a person condemns their Christianity for the benefit of others, the less I tend to claim Christianity what they demand. God tells us that true faith is the freedom for the truth choose how you express it, the way the way, the means at your disposal, these things have no effect, be you Christian or atheist, unless in your heart you are true. "If only our churches were full of Christians attributed to this latter definition of what it means to be a follower of Jesus rather than the former. What a difference it would make! As a Christian and a psychologist, I want to have an imperfect, yet authentic, belief about a perfectly polished image any day. What a tragedy? to feel that I always have a role to play when I really have to rest freely to be completely God made me. I think Mr. Brock offers a refreshing look at what this freedom looks like in Christ. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a new look at faith.
