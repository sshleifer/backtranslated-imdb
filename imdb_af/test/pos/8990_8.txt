Like most sports films, it is not surprising that people who know something about the sport can find mistakes in it. As a football referee I have another movie or TV program to get it right when I portray a game. "Forever" has good actors, but I found Sean Astin a little young to be an administrator in a juvenile prison. I was very grateful that the plot did not involve the main character of changing his fellow prisoners in rugby players and tackling Flagstaff as well as Highland. What Causes Credibility: A police group car just happens to pull up exactly when the Flagstaff bad stuff hurts Rick Penning. Although rugby is not a nationally high school sport, the team is a school-based club sport, just like the rodeo. That being said, I find it hard to believe that high school officials will allow students to play with open wounds: This is just not done in this day of Aids and Hepatitis. I don't care what the tradition and macho image is. In spite of this, it was a cool movie because teens were expected to act like adults (and sometimes actually did). Unfortunately, too many coaches like Flagstaff's - or worse.
