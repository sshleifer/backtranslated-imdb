This movie was very different from the previous movies and I had to wonder, "Where is Ralph Macchio?" He could have been involved somewhere on the plot if Myiagi's old friend, who teaches him what he already knows, can join Myiagi and add even more! Macchio could have been the love interest for July in this movie! Never mind! <br /> <br /> On a serious level, I enjoyed this movie because it addressed a teenage girl how to do Karate, and her feelings differ greatly from what Daniel was. July is much more wild than Daniel was and should be, something Myiagi finds very challenging. she is quite a troubled girl and a rude, unpleasant brat! <br /> <br /> It was very satisfying to see the transformation in July as she warmed Myiagi and understood more about Karate and her life in general. We can all learn a thing or two of Myiagi's witticisms!
