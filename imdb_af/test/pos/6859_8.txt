I would use 'The German Scream' as a summary, but it was already taken. It takes Anatomy well. Assuming you are not strange to read subtitles, Anatomy fits in with the Scream / Urban Legend suit. It is a teenage horror in a medical school where the students miss out and then arrive as experiment subjects in the dissection laboratory. Give one clear student to explore herself and discover a huge conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Provided you watch the original German language movie (I can't comment on the dub, haven't seen the English edition). Anatomy is sharply written and cleverly dotted so that the tension never really comes up. Compared to the American counterparts, the mystery is revealed much faster, which means that instead of a shooter up to the last revelation, Anatomy is being developed during the time of a slasher-come-body horror movie in a smart and exciting thriller. It's a pleasant ride from start to finish. <br /> <br /> Hats also to the actors involved. Franka Potente proves again that she is an intelligent, smart actress who can bring any role. Her central performance as Paula is a good base for building the movie. The ghostly lecturers and their teachers' pets are equally good, a real preliminary presence at all times. <br /> <br /> It's also amazing that the movie doesn't drag much. The pace is fast and sturdy, much like the earlier Urban Legend, which means there's always something going on to keep your attention high. If there is one drawback, some Anatomy may be too horrible for them, but if you persist in the first half's welcome graphic dissection rows, the last half with the exciting game earphones will reward you. I recommend Anatomy to anyone who enjoys a good teenage horror, but is a bit addicted to American action.
