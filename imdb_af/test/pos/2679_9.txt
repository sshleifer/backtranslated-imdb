I just started looking at this show. It is currently in Ireland at the Irish television station RTE1 at 12.30 in the afternoon (from 26 July 2006). <br /> <br /> This program literally makes me explain aloud and I can't boast it at most. sitcoms (except the UK's 'The Office' with Ricky Gervais in it). <br /> <br /> Today's episode of TKoQ (July 26, 2006) was the one where Carrie started a new job and sent her friends home and went off To make coffee and Doug wanted Carrie not " Outside 'friends, so he lifts her up and shows off his' stomach! 'and lick plates when he goes out for dinner! But another funny episode was the other week when the old fella (carrying father) won at the Bingo and that episode sparked me with laughter, especially when they went out and got a replacement fridge. Carries's father stood there and thought it was new. <br /> <br /> So I don't know how long it should be on Irish TV or at what stage (year) we are but I hope it doesn't end soon because I'm really enjoying it. <br /> <br /> In short, there are some good writing, some great characters and comedy acting (namely Carrie, Doug and Carries father), some good punchlines and well-delivered - a little boring and near the Mark sometimes (send the kids out of the room!) but I think this American Sitcom is a winner and very funny.
