On this day and age in which almost every other news item is accompanied by discussion of water boards, images of Abu Ghraib, or stories of forced detention in Guantanamo Bay, Gavin Hood's "Rendition" is about as timely and timely as ever from the entertainment mills of mainstream Hollywood will come. It is not a perfect film by any imagination, but it does not deserve the digestive power it has received from critics of the entire ideological and political spectrum. <br /> <br /> The term "performance" refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest any suspects of terrorist acts, secretly dropping them to a foreign country. interrogate and torture them indefinitely without any legal process. Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who has been living in the United States for twenty years. He enjoys an American woman, a young boy and a new baby. He seems a very unlikely candidate for a terrorist, but one day, without warning or explanation, Anwar is seized and taken to an unfamiliar place where he is subjected to cruel torture until he admits that he is involved in " a terrorist organization that claims nothing to Anwar. about. <br /> <br /> On the downside, "Rendition" occasionally falls into its storytelling ability, which often bites a bit more than it can visit in terms of both plot and character. The obvious focal point is Douglas Freeman, a CIA agent, who is brought in to consider Anwar's "interrogation" in the hands of Egyptian officials. The problem is that Freeman, as suggested by author Kelley Sane and Jake Gyllenhaal, seems too much of a naive "boy scout" to make for a very likely agent, and he doesn't get the screen time he needs to to fully develop. as a character. We know little about him in the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end. He "goes through the movements," but we learn valuable things about the man. So, without a strong center of gravity to keep it all together, the movie sometimes feels as if it comes apart at the seams, with story elements flying in all directions. A similar problem occurs at Anwar's depraved woman, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never know much about, except what we can see on the surface. Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon both proved themselves as good actors under other circumstances, but here they are captured by a restrictive script. They rarely make them more than a single repetitive note in their performances. <br /> <br /> What makes "Delivery an ultimately powerful movie is, however, the utmost seriousness of the subject and the way two simultaneous running lines play elegantly in each other in the movie's closing strips. make a pleasant story as we might have liked this topic, but it is Hollywood, and the film must pay some aversion for mass audience expectations if it illuminates itself green, let alone the day's light as a completed project. <br /> <br /> Two of the supporting actions are particularly compelling in the movie: Omar Metwally, which makes the horror of a man caught in a real life tangible. waking up, and Yigal Naor making a surprisingly complex character from the main investigator / torture Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their points in smaller roles. . < br /> <br /> Does the film increase the difficulty? Probably. Does it hit the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil forces of government? Definitely. (One wonders how the movie would have played if Anwar really was a terrorist). Yet, the film has a hard time moving into controversial ground. It is not afraid to ask dicey questions or risk disapproving some of the political views it takes. It openly raises the issue of just how a nation sticks to its hard-won principle of "civil liberties for all" in the face of terrorism and fear. And how much courage does it mean for people of good will to finally get up and say, "enough is enough," even the danger of being terrorist appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power? (The film also does not reject the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism). <br /> <br /> So, to reject "extradition" by hand would be to be perfect for the enemy of good. "Delivery" may not be perfect, but it is good, and it has something important to say about the world in which we are now living. And that alone makes it worthwhile to see.
