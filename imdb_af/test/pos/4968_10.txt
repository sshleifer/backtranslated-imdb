The movie Jennifer with Ida Lupino and Howard Duff is film noir magnificence.This is a mostly unknown movie that all film noir fans should see. Jennifer was filmed with the most unusual camera angles for that time, which made the film a surrealise like quality. with times. I love the hard black and white movie noir movies. The movie is not that good. The movie is excellent. The better music is nice to listen to. And Lupino is one of the best and talented actresses ever to grace the screen. I have never seen a production. She didn't love that. She was not only beautifully beautiful, she was a good actress. The first movie I remembered was Ida Lupino in Roadhouse with Richard Widmark and Cornel Wilde. I never forgot the movie, or her. I saw her latest films like Food Of The Gods and Women in Chains, and although the movies were not her usual price, she was still nice as an actress. Hope Duff is always great to watch. I recommend this masterpiece to everyone. I have this movie on VHS band.
