I actually saw the last parts of this movie when I was a kid. Thanks to the search function of plots I could find out its name. For years I have not known the name, but the movie is stuck in my mind. The end left and hopes that the main character would eventually eventually return to Earth. It was a pity that it didn't make for a series. This movie reminds me of Traveling to the Far Side of the Sun. Also known as Doppleganger. If you like this feature, the other one is worth a watch. It's done before The Stranger, but shares a similar plot. Still different. I just picked up the alien from eBay on VHS. Hope they make a DVD, but it is doubtful unless it comes to Dollar DVD. A few pilots make it on the budget DVDs and maybe this one will.
