I just went through this movie again and can only wonder if we will see more like these movies? The timeless music, the soft voices of William Holden and Jennifer Jones leave this grown-up man crying with joyful romantic scenes and I'm not one who cries very often in life. Where are we William Holden away and will they make these moving, wonderful movies more? It's sad to realize that they probably won't, but don't think about it, just try to get it out of your head. Yet they will not have Holden in it, nor will he appear on that hill again. You can just enjoy this movie and see it again.
