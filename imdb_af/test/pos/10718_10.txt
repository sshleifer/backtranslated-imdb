It's a phenomenal movie. Actually one of the best movies I've ever watched. I am a serious critic and it takes a lot to stir, but this movie has all the right combinations for "stir". The passion of the actors, without the overworking pain, the pain for all the characters involved, the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce, makes it all a movie to watch, despite the fact that it is 1970s. This is definitely not an old movie, but a classic movie. I hope you take part as I did when considering how volatile relationships of all kinds can be, if you also consider how deeply painful love can be and how to make the most difficult decisions the most painful But once it is made that the pain will decrease, but only gradually. This film certainly shows that the most volatile relationships are not necessarily poor relationships and that it is certainly not synonymous with lost / lacking love. The 'production' of this movie definitely comes from a place deep within someone's heart and mind.
