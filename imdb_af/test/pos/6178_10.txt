Centers on Czech WW2 pilots ?? the older Frantisek, the boyish impulsive Charles and in the background the silent piano player Honza. As the film opens, it is 1950, the war is over and Frantisek and Honza are captured in a former monastery. In their now Soviet-controlled nationality, they are 'enemy of the people'. Honza is severely abused by his Communist compatriots and dies. <br /> <br /> In 1939 many pilots escaped German-occupied Europe and brought them to England where they joined the RAF. Despite their high motivation and experience, they are faced with RAF unwillingness and British tight upper body. Eventually they are fighting in the Battle of Britain. However, Frantisek and Charles find their friendship tested heavily when they both fall for the same woman. <br /> <br /> In terms of the romantic subplot, it is very similar to the Hollywood production Pearl Harbor. However, given the context of the film and Frantisek's ultimate fate, it is also possible to read the English woman's treatment of the two men as symbolic of the British treatment of the Czech and Polish RAF pilots: this is easy to forget them once the war is over. br /> In addition, the movie is much less clich√© than Pearl Harbor and the characters are more fully realized. Dark Blue World also counts in terms of its beautiful lapdogs, seamlessly created using a mix of models, the real-life action filming and release of the 1969 epic The Battle of Britain. <br /> <br /> In short, Dark Blue World is a well-made, moving, mind-boggling and exciting drama that blames Pearl Harbor holders. Highly recommended.
