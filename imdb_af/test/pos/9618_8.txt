Five Fingers of Death: Although previous Shaw Martial Arts stories showed the influence of the American cowboy genre, no one gave him such a great tribute as this one, especially in the salon-fighting scene. And although Shaw Bros. films previously borrowed from the Japanese Chambara (sword fight) genre, no one has done so with such success as this one. I think it has to do with the fact that the director came from Korea and therefore brought a non-Chinese perspective on such loans, which certainly causes interesting questions about culture. but in any case, this film presented real innovations in technology and technique in Hong Kong action films. For the first time in Hong Kong, the camera has been given access to the whole of any given set, which means shots from many different angles, such as the low-angle interior that shows the ceiling of a room (the original American innovation usually credited on John Ford), or the high-angle long shot that made the visualization of a large ground area or the front tracker possible. <br /> <br /> It is true that this was not the first hand-to-hand movie movie - it remains Wang Yu's "Chinese Boxer"; but on a commercial level, Shaw Bros was right to choose 'Five Fingers' as their first major release on the West, because one can say that it is the least Chinese of their action films, it is least dependent on pure Chinese theater traditions . Although it did not make American critics right now (which has ruined the picture universally), it was not lost to American audiences, especially among African Americans, whose culture has always been an eclectic patchwork of borrowed elements and innovation. In 'Five Fingers' they were given the opportunity to discover the core of the story, in the serious young man who is forced to make the extra effort to overcome social barriers and treason to recognize his earnings. It seems to be a universal problem for Modernity, but every culture has its own way of expressing and solving it. Five Fingers presented it in a way that many Americans and Chinese could handle. <br /> <br /> So is the movie just of historical value? Certainly not. For one thing, this problem is not gone. Secondly, some of the innovations leave much of the movie today as fresh as it did on the first release. The action is also well performed, and the performances, although a bit too serious, are sharp. The movie is an excess, but the story covers a lot of ground. And there are wonderful set-ups, such as the salon conflicts, the battle on the road to the game, the strange dual finals. <br /> <br /> It certainly looks better on a theater screen, but still impressive. for home viewing: recommended.
