"The Aristocats" is classic Disney at its best. It is not considered the ultimate Disney classic alongside the best-known Disney movies, but it is a well-made and fun movie that certainly deserves a Disney classic. "Aristocats" is certainly a sure-child-pleaser, as it has all the components for a fun children's movie. I will love it very much as a child. I'm not sure if this movie is an enjoyable adult for the nostalgia to watch Disney artists, but I still enjoy it as a young adult. <br /> <br /> Storywise, "Aristocats" may not be as complicated or innovative, but it doesn't matter. This film was made at that time where the filmmakers followed the motto that the characters were versed in the story, which "Aristocats" definitely did. The characters make the movie; they are all fun, fun, have good lines and have a good interaction with each other. The voice actors also play a role in making the characters so compelling (Eva Gabor as Duchess, Phil Harris as Thomas O'Malley and so on). A misconception could have been the dogs Napoleon and Lafayette, as they are showstoppers and do not have much to do with the real story, but fortunately it is fun and amusing characters and the scenes with them are pure gold. <Br /> <br /> "Aristocats" are both entertaining and cute, but it is also a very funny cartoon. The animation style and look fit perfectly for the French environment of the film (especially the city of Paris looks great). The character animation and design is wonderful. And the songs are also very striking. My favorite is "Scale and Arpeggios", but the title song is a cute song, along with "Thomas O'Malley Cat" and the memorable show stop "Everybody's Want To Be A Cat". And the George Burns score is a perfect fit for the movie's funny and emotional situations. Overall, "Aristocats" is, in my opinion, the best Disney cartoon of the 70's and it is a movie that has both been seen and remembered. So what are you waiting for? Do yourself a favor and share this Disney classic with your kids. It deserves in their memories.
