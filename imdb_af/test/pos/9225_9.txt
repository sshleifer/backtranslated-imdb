RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEELER, in my opinion, is an excellent masterpiece. I felt warm and at the same time when Rainbow Brite (voice of Bettina) and Krys (voice of David Mendenhall) received revenge on the princess (voice of Rhonad Aldrich). If you ask me, the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical. For me, she deserved to take Rainbow Brite and Krys revenge. However, I also kept her castle and the rest of the area. In addition, I thought Lurky (pat. Of Fraley) and Murky (Peter Cullen's) were diabolical. Before I upload it, I'd like to say everyone was thrown perfectly, the direction was flawless and Disney made a big hit. Finally, I recommend this excellent masterpiece to anyone who hasn't seen it, especially the hard-core TV show fans. I guarantee you will enjoy it.
