SHOWTIME is a mess, but it's an entertaining mess. The plot is forgotten, the satire is lightweight and the action ranges, although well-behaved, are not so exciting. But I laughed. Very. Credit goes to the inspired mating of De Niro and Murphy. They have good chemistry. Murphy delivers the one-liners, De Niro cracks us with a can or grimace. This movie gets a RUSH HOUR-like reception from the critics. Don't listen to them. If you're a fan of De Niro or Murphy, you're going to enjoy this movie.
