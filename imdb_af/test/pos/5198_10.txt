Stalingrad is a terrific film, well behaved and directed, and rather on earth in the approach to the various bizarre aspects of warfare and that is politics. It's with Das Boot one of the best war videos (along with the Finnish "Winter War", in English, I believe)). It illustrates the trials of some of the German soldiers who fought --- and died --- in and around Stalingrad during World War II. No big time heroism, no more about emotional ambiguity, but the fear of every day death in the war. The mood of the movie is similar to the one in "Das Boot", and it should give you tips on what to expect, I think. So, if you enjoy realistic, non-Hollywood, war movies: rent it, buy it, make sure you see it! Finally, a movie buff note: for some of the previous judges' information I just want to add that "Stalingrad" is not by Wolfgang Petersen (who made Das Boot)!
