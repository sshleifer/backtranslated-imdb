This show is great for many reasons. The father and mother can communicate with their children today with their children. It is so nice to see a real family rather than a stuffy family. I watched this once and became gate. It is so nice to see a black family on TV that is worth watching. This show left too soon, but on the way it was pregnant, sexy, drugs, bad dates, dead, etc. The best thing about the show was that it was handled in a real, humorous way. Great show for the family. I can't tell you how many times I sat down, I watched late at night and laughed at my head. Great pg 13 rated show.I loved every bit of this show.
