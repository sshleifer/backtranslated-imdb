I loved this movie when I was younger, and I actually searched it again! I'd love to see it again! The information is all correct, but the cover doesn't seem to match. But I can't say for sure. From what I remember, the movie about these kids (Alyssa Milano, Tina Yothers, etc.) was in a management class, and it also shows the calamity they get out of class. Edie McClurg was Alyssa Milan's mother in the movie. I remember really liked it if someone knew where I could get a copy (preferably DVD) of the above movie (with the stars in it), I would like to know. Thank you :)
