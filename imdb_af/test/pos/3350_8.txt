What could you say? This is the uncut hardcore, musical Alice! It also works with a huge energetic cast that apparently enjoys the hilt and while one might want a revised version, I think we're lucky to even have this video transfer. Almost a pleasure. There are a few slight moments, but it could have been embarrassing for a long time and it certainly isn't. It could have been and it would have been to-day. No, a very good effort that is amusing, tune and just sexy enough. Fine performs especially the Kristine DeBell in the lead and was it an uncredited Richard Prior if the inclined knight is driven (if strategically)?
