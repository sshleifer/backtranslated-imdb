As a teenager, I watched this movie every time it was on TV (and it was on a LOT) because of its witty, attractive-to-teen humor. It may not be what critics consider to watch 4 stars, but I love what it is - a fun comedy designed to please the audience. The teenage actors are of my generation (probably why I like so much of the movie) and were like a fantasy shot of everyone's favorite TV shows of the early 90's - Full House, Family Matters, Prince of Honor - All the representations were represented and the result was probably the best teen movie of the 90's. Although it does not include the high rates of nudity and violence that so many teenage movie writers are essential for youth demographic success (or perhaps because of his absence), I strongly recommend being everywhere in front of teens and teenagers.
