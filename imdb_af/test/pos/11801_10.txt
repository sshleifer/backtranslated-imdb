Let me start with the fact that I was very surprised at the production value of this movie. I managed to catch an early show and I have to say it's the best (if not just) Christian movie to hit theaters since The Passion. <br /> <br /> Don't let the PG-13 rating scare you. , the rating is appropriate due to the serious problems being treated in this film (divorce, teenage pregnancy, drug use and suicide), but nothing in the film is free. It's definitely a movie that a Junior Higher Youth Group can see without upsetting most parents, and the message is wonderful. The best part is it's not a movie for Christians, it's a family movie without the cheesy 7th Heaven feeling. <br /> <br /> The laugh is there and several times in the theater everyone laughs; Teenagers and young adults, both religious and otherwise, will be able to identify with many or not all the characters in the film, and I was surprised to see such issues in this kind of movie. The plot is by no means predictable, and by the end it gets closer to home than many will admit. Fortunately, Christians are not shown, because all powerful know it is all about the Word, but people just try to understand life. People make mistakes and nobody is perfect, even in this movie. Not by a long shot. <br /> <br /> The play is at the top, the writing place, and you are not over the head with all the preachers Christian rhetoric. This is a good movie that will make you and your teens think, talk and maybe question their own morality (or lack thereof). If you want to see a quality family movie in January, go to your local listings for this movie and learn something about yourself. <br /> <br /> And I'm a 25 year old man who is just a free movie.
