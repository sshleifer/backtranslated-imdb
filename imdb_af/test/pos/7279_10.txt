Wow, I loved this movie, this movie is filled with plot twists, good acting, good story and a surprising ending. To be completely honest, this movie was not excessive, it did contain a bit, but was more on the psychological side. I read it on the internet: the movie costs $ 3,000 and is shot in 8 days. Amazing !!! It is for someone who makes a good movie and wants to love. What starts out as a terrorist thriller is slowly turning into something that is more twisted, even a little more sinister. Not much I can say without just giving away plot points, but this movie was beyond my expectations
