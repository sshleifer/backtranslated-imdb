Having seen the Lost Child several times since his release in 1995, and after reading the reader's comments (mostly about Jane Tennison's background and Helen Mirren's excellent role in it), it strikes me more than ever that no comment is made on the brilliant role of Robert Glenister as Chris Hughes. Even after 10 years, it is still one of the most credible ways to portray the complex personality of a child abuser. The weight of his own past is borne by the episode for the full one and a half hours. and hate for this man, in which the hatred prevails because of the gravity of his actions. I have seen more brilliant roles of my favorite actor, but this one never makes the greatest impression to me. Helen Mirren will never shine without her wonderful actors next to her. Price for Robert Glenister!
