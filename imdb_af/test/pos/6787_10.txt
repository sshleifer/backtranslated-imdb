Wow! What a beautiful, warm rural movie! The story focuses on Mi Taylor (Mickey Rooney), a young male walker, whose journey takes him to a quiet, rural coastal town. There he lives with the Brown family. Velvet (Liz Taylor), their youngest daughter, who is a friend of Mi, has a passion for horses and wins one at auction. This horse is a beautiful, maroon stallion; referred by his previous owner as a 'murderous pirate', but Velvet calls him Pie again. Not long ago, Velvet proposes to enter the Grand National race. Mi and her family are against the idea, but come along soon and Velvet and Mi started to lead Britain's best-known horse race? This film is a beautiful example of how British movies are. I remember first seeing it when I was eight and on my summer vacation. My parents tied it off the TV and I warmed it up right away? watch it most days instead of the big collection of Disney movies I own. <br /> <br /> I believe it was one of Liz Taylor's first movies and a great one! Her character is naive, but sweet? Her play is extremely convincing, especially if she portrays her love for horses. It's also a good chance to see Angela Lansbury in one of her early roles; who co-stars as Velvet's older sister, who spends most of her time in the movie hit with a boy in town! I must say she was a beautiful woman when she was younger. Beautiful blonde hair and a rosy face. Although she doesn't play a big part in the movie, his dose has a number of scenes - don't disappoint her fans! Parents read it, I need to emphasize ?? if you can get a copy of this, please do! If you are kids, love animals? I strongly suggest that you show it to them! They may find some scenes boring, but you see Flirting the horse on several occasions through the movie and will entertain children very challenging! A lovely and nostalgic movie. I can just leave and turn it on!
