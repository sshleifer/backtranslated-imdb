The cover of the VHS says it all: "Without a doubt, the most powerful film of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre". I'm a big fan of the 70's and 80's, and I have to say, I agree 100%. The characters are credible, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the ranger). There is the twisted atmosphere, which has only TCM, an astonishing soundtrack to reflect the emotions and filming places that are most beautiful in the history of horror. It must be one of the most beautiful shot horror movies of all time! Jeff Lieberman as director of this 1981 low-budget film and excellent work and added with his other works (Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn), has to be one of the most underrated film directors today.
