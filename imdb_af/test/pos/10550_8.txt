It's a funny movie, not many of them. OK, the plot is a bit disturbing, but very original. A teenager is trying to get even with dad, because he was not around and almost sent him to jail because she wants to impress an older boy, how can it not be funny? Plus it's not the typical movie with teens. First recovery I saw, it's better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor it would be a perfect 10 because he plays all roles in the same way, sucks. Another problem it is all the women who are melting over it, it is not remotely credible, it is not attractive! You have a rubber roll that looks better than him, come on!
