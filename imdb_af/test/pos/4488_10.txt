There are two types of people in the world: those who think "Five Characters" is one of the best episodes in the series, and those who are so cool that they know it sucked because they were so smart and already the "lame" turns to the end (which is apparently in their small minds is the only reason why the Twilight zone exists: to turn). <br /> <br /> There are many lame episodes in the series and I am not one to rate all TZ episodes ten. But this one is definitely one of those who deserve such a rating. This is claustrophobic and colorful. The tension is built up and we cannot wait for the disclosure of the secret to the end. But whatever that is, these people do not matter. Most of the beauty of the episode is to lead it. It will be just as strong if we never find out what these strangers really are in a strange place.
