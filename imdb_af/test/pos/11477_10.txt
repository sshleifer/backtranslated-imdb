It's probably one of the best Portuguese movies I've ever seen. I absolutely enjoyed the plot, because in the way the story evolved, you would become more involved in how their world was really upside down. There is only one part that doesn't really fit in the movie, it's the girl slip ... It doesn't add anything to the story, it looks like it's just for a entertaining man. The end is a bit unexpected, though, at the same time, a little expected. If you don't understand it, follow me: after so many strange incidents, the viewer is so accustomed to peculiarities, ending the movie with totally unexpected relationships (like Mimoso and Susana), sounds quite natural after the rest of the movie seen. But most of all, Black Nula is a movie that makes you think of solving the mysterious events, solving your head with their unhappy lives and messing with your perception of what can happen in a few minutes. back from something ... for everything, I rate it 8/10
