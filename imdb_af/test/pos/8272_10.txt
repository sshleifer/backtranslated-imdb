I'm so lucky that I recorded it on VHS band when it appeared on Masterpiece Theater. It's a movie I can watch again. Living in England in the early 1800s, it's not hard enough, Prue was born with a "hair lip" and was wiped out of birth. The people in her town accept her somewhat, but always fear that she is "of the devil's forge" and quickly turns on her. Especially when a lot of accidents overtake her family. She is strong and courageous, but away from Kester Woodseaves, a travel weaver who catches her eye. Partly because she is afraid of anxiety and also because she thinks he is so virile that he should have a woman who is as nice as a lily. Kester is a modern man who does not believe in the superstitions of the time and he speaks his mind and follows his heart. The movie remains true to the original story by Mary Webb and is busy from start to finish.
