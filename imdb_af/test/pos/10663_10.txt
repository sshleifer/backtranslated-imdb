Originally supposed to just be part of a great epic The 1905 Revolution depicting the Revolution of 1905, Potemkin is the story of the mutiny of the Potemkin's crew in the port of Odessa. The film is opened with the crew protesting magic meat and the captain ordering the execution of the dissidents. An uprising takes place during which the revolutionary leader is murdered. This crew member is taken to the shore to lay in the state. When the townspeople take a large flight of steps looking out over the harbor, saristic troops appear and march the steps the crowds break. A navy shade is sent to take back the Potemkin, but at the moment the ships arrive in the series, their teams make the mutants possible to go through. Eisenstein's non-historically accurate end is open, indicating that it was the seed of the later Bolshevik revolution that would flourish in Russia. The film is divided into five parts: Men and Maggots, Drama on the Quartedeck, an Apple of Death, the Odessa Steps and the Squadron. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein was a revolutionary artist, but on the brilliant level. Eisenstein did not want to make a historical drama, but used visual texture to give the film a news rule so that the viewer felt that he was tapping on an exciting and politically revolutionary story. This technique is used by Pontecorvo's Battle of Algeria. <br /> <br /> In contrast to Pontecorvo, Eisenstein relied on types or the decisive of non-professionals who had striking physical appearance. The extraordinary faces of the cast are what one remembers of Potemkin. This technique is later described by Frank Capra in Mr. Deeds Goes to Town uses and meets John Doe. But in Potemkin no one is cast as a hero or heroine. The story is told by a series of scenes combined into a special effect known as montage - the editing and selection of short segments to produce a desired effect on the viewer. D. Griffith also used the assembly, but no one mastered it as well as Eisenstein. <br /> <br /> The graceful filming of the crew members in their hammock is complemented by the graceful swing of tables hanging from chains in the kitchen. In contrast, the confrontation between the crew and their officers is burdened with electricity and the clenched fists of the masses show their anger at injustice. <br /> <br /> Eisenstein showed the technique of action and repeated, but from a slightly different angle to demonstrate intensity. Breaking a board with the words "Give us this day our daily bread" indicates the beginning of the end. This technique was used at Marienbad last year. Also, when the ship's surgeon is thrown over the side, she descends the pince-nez. It was these glasses that the officer used to inspect and pass the seasoned meat. This sequence commits punishment to the corruption of the Tsarist era. <br /> <br /> The best-known sequence in the movie, and perhaps in all film history, is The Odessa Steps. The wide expanse of the stairs is filled with hundreds of extras. Rapid and dramatic violence is always presented and not explicit, but the visual images of the death of a few will be in the minds of the viewer forever. <br /> <br /> The corner shots of marching boots and legs laying the steps are cleverly emphasized with long-threatening shadows of a sun on top of the stairs. The pace of the sequence is deliberately varied between the march soldiers and a few civilians who call for them to stop. A poem of a woman's face frozen in fear after being hit by a soldier's sword is the direct predecessor of the Bonnie bank in Clyde and gives a lasting impression of the terror of the Tsarist regime. <br /> <br /> The death of a young mother leads to a baby buggy taking care of the steps in a sequence copied by Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent, by Terry Gilliam in Brazil, and Brian DePalma in The Untouchables is. This sequence is repeatedly shown from different angles, indicating what was probably only a five second event. <br /> <br /> Potemkin is a film that makes the revolutionary spirit immortal, celebrating it for those who are already dedicated and propagating it to the unconverted. It sees fire and roar with the senseless injustices of the decadent saristic regime. Its biggest impact was on film students who had borrowed and only slightly improved on techniques invented in Russia several generations ago.
