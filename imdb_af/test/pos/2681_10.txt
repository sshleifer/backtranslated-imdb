If you set aside Seinfeld, this is the best comedy ever, no doubt! Just great! <br /> <br /> "The King of Queens" just ended his eighth season of inland happiness. In the working class suburb of Queens, New York, show Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), a friendly deliveryman, and his wife, the legal secretary of the bullfight Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), while facing the everyday challenges of love investigation, life, family and marriage. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie deal with daily household realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves. Their love for each other eventually carries them through every dilemma they face, or it's Doug's fixation with food or Carrie's obsession with expensive clothes. <br /> <br /> Doug and Carrie must also live in the basement with the third, high maintenance member of the Heffernan household, Carrie's dual widow, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller). His ongoing presence and often bizarre behavior contribute to their daily adventures. Doug and Carrie stumbled upon an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and happily hold Arthur's regular outings with gullible dog Walker Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Doug's friends, Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) round off their role of "old" humor and diverse perspectives. <br /> <br /> In a way called "The Honeymooners", THE KING OF QUEENS finds inspiration in everyday life situations. Last season alone, Doug Carrie hired for a relentless Deacon for help with a Thanksgiving dinner. the Heffernans suffer from the annoyance and financial damage they cause to their home; and Doug and Carrie attempt to copy a couple whose photos of a more adventurous life than Doug and Carrie's accidentally took them home. We also watched Arthur become jealous of a new dog that Holly added to her route, and Doug found out that his overprotective parents had replaced his childhood Rocky three times behind his back. During the series, James's incredible physical comedy, Remini's stubborn white, and Stiller's unique comic presence are featured. <br /> <br /> You can't ... Don't miss it!
