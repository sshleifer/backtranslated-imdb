Just ingenious enough to be plausible and still fun, it's a pure cut of the 1970s (even the police need bad finish!). Shoot in and around London, the plot of the American ex-con that goes straight, but sent him as an electrician to a bank in Mayfair, and then the screws tackled the crime chief David Niven and found the crime of the century is well handled. <br /> <br /> I like its simplicity and even innocence, it returns to a time when capers were just not, a caper and violence were not part of the deal. . <br /> <br /> All in all, you can do much worse than seeing it: it has enough twists and turns to give it an oomph and a throw that of course had fun doing it. <br /> <br /> Beautiful and viewable.
