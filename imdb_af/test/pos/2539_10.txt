The violent death of Fernando Ramos Da Silva only eight years after completing this film only adds to the concern of animal scientist BAbenco's powerful message. The film is divided into two halves - the first in a reformation where a group of young people are abused and violated by violent law enforcement officers and guardians. The second background is the city where they are instead limited by their own actions and morality. This includes the attacks, pimping and killing of different characters entering their lives. <br /> <br /> The different sexes and sexual roles in the movie allow for constant changes in the characters while communicating with other people. Especially interesting is the character of Lalica, a transvestite who is mother and love for some of the children. Her reaction to the arrival of Sueli, a prostitute, is both sad and tragic. <br /> <br /> There is no happy ending to this story and I advise to watch it carefully, as there are many awkward scenes to watch especially in the opening of twenty minutes. But while it is being watched, it's important to remember that it's not just a fictional story. The actors are not trained professionals, but instead of boys chosen from the streets of Sao Paulo. They actually lived this life that was portrayed on the screen, and in the case of Da Silva was killed in the hands of the police so brutally portrayed. A Documentary? A fiction. It borders on both, but it definitely makes heartbreaking material and is a movie that actually leaves you breathless and long after watching it. <br /> <br /> 10/10
