Throwing Momma is not dated at all, it's as funny as when it was released. A really eccentric comedy, it's not too hard to love and is better off, full of memorable, highly charged lines. Even small characters are well written and beautifully played, such as Billy Crystal's best friend's girlfriend, and a beautiful cameo by Rob Reiner as Crystal's agent. A little crazy and very funny.
