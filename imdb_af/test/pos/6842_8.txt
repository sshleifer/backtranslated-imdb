Arrived over this movie recently after hearing it for so long. It is an excellent, non-pretentious movie for people who love film noir literature and movies. Not "camp", but humorous. <br /> <br /> GREAT WASTE! From beautiful Carla Gugino and Emma Thompson to German superstar Til Schweiger, this movie is a feast for the eyes. Alan Rickman is very funny as a gang leader. Want to see how the film is filmed with this character, and Emma Thompson solves the case and arguments between them all the time (such as Tracy and Hepburn, etc.). Intelligent story, fine twists and size photography (don't look unless it's scope because compositions are very rich.) Sexy sexy sexy and very fun time. <br /> <br /> Best Use of Just Like Heaven at The Cure Ever (Must See to Believe!) <br /> <br /> ********
