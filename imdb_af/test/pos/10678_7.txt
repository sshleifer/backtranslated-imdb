One of my favorite movies, though, though, though I admit it once missed out on Foxtel last year. <br /> <br /> In spite of the age of the movie it doesn't look like that and the story, though done a thousand times before it was still entertaining. There were one or two little niggles for me in the story, but I looked past them and just enjoyed the movie for what it was. <br /> Overall, I give it a 7/10
