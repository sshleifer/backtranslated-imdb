I saw this movie about 12 years ago and I still remember it as if I saw it recently. That's how much this movie has affected me. <br /> <br /> Considering this is a movie from the 50's that I think it was before his time. This surprised me as to how it maintains its integrity in this subject. Very realistic to show the turbulent and heartbreaking journey that an addict chooses. One can only imagine how the audiences are affected by the realism of this movie back in those days. <br /> <br /> I think personally, was one of Frank Sinatra's top five appearances in the big screen. <br /> <br /> When discussing other issues of mental illness and / or addiction, I always recommend the man with the golden arm as one of the top five to watch.
