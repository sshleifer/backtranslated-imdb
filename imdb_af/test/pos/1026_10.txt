Just like a reminder of anyone who has just commented on this excellent BBC mini series, published in 1981, it was not available on DVD until the last few years. Since then it has become available, but initially only in the British format (for which I bought an "international" DVD player that you should hack - illegally, I suspect it), but the series is now available. by amazon.com - 3 discs - no hacking for between $ 19-21 on DVD in the American format. There were 41 reviews, averaging 5 stars. This mini-series is one of the very best on Oppenheimer, or the Manhattan project, or virtually anything produced by the BBC.
