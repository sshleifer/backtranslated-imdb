Fat Man And Little Boy were the code names of the two atomic bombs that fell in reverse order on Nagasaki and Hiroshina. How it happened and came in American hands is the story of this movie. <br /> <br /> The terms include the code of two bombs fired with plutonium and uranium. Fat Man was the plutonium bomb and that one was dropped on Nagasaki and Little Boy was the one used on Hiroshima. <br /> <br /> The movie is mainly a genre conflict. Leslie R. Groves of US Army and Physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer who led the team of scientists who developed the bomb under Groves' direction. With two men from as widely diverse backgrounds as they were, conflict was inevitable. <br /> <br /> Paul Newman, who has been a disarmament activist for all his life, plays General Groves. To his credit, Newman does not play a man whose views he has very little in common with any kind of caricature. Groves is a military man in the first place with an engineering background. He wanted a battle order, as trained military professionals naturally want these wars. But due to his background in engineering, Groves got the Manhattan project, which was worth mentioning code. So, Newman is determined to make his contribution to the war effort. <br /> <br /> Most of us first did Dwight Schultz from the A team as H.M. made known. Murdoch the pilot whose grip on reality at best is unwavering. If you just got to know the A team, one might think that Schultz had a good future in comic roles. <br /> <br /> Instead, Dwight Schultz has been one of the best actors in the English-speaking world with an astounding range of dramatic parts since he left the television series. J. Robert Oppenheimer in life was a complex man who recognized the dangers and benefits of atomic energy. The challenge of the problem also impressed him. Later, Oppenheimer became a real bond because of his leftist political views and associates who all knew to go into the Manhattan project. <br /> <br /> Some of the smaller roles that stand out are Bonnie Bedelia like Mrs. Oppenheimer, Natasha Richardson as Oppenheimer's Communist mistress, whose relationship with Oppenheimer later had him in such a jackpot and Laura Dern as nurse at the Los Alamos yard. <br /> <br /> But best of all is John Cusack, who, as Michael Merriman, is a compilation of some real scientists who may be considered the first victims of the atomic era. His plays with Laura Dern, especially with what happens to him, take a real poignancy. <br /> <br /> The debate on the bombs like the use that is being made is still a matter of furious debate. Fat Man And Little Boy Present The Facts And Decide What Happened If An Alternative Use Of Them Was Taken.
