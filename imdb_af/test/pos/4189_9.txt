I can't believe it's not a big cult hit. Perhaps people in 1968, thinking of the Monkees as a foolish factory-made pop band rip-off of the Beatles, refused to see it. That cynicism has probably covered it since then. Don't make this mistake. _Head_ is an amazing movie that will appreciate most open-minded people. It is very funny and very intelligent (and very trippy).
