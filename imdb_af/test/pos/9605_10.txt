After I received a copy of Bostocks Cup, I have to confess. It's not as funny as I originally thought !! THIS IS BETTER !!!!! Charlie Williams ... eat your heart. Match fixing ???? Never! Slope at 45%? Ronnie and Reggie Kay? George Best? The bus driver who thinks Pontefract is in South Wales (that's all Ponty it and Ponty that) Bertie Masson's (Tim Healey's) lucky Cup hat !! (not that he is in gimmicks) Sugar plum tea ????? Confused???? See it again. The innovative use of actual footage with Bostock players was brilliant and the producer must be proud of our MASTERPIECE. Come on ITV do the viewers and yourself a favor - show it again !!! Please>
