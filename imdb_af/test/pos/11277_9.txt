I love this movie a lot. It's not very entertaining, but it's a bizarre and beautiful festival! There is no dialogue, only a few background sounds and sounds. If you are in something completely different and original, and enjoy the dark and bizarre ... then you might like this artwork. I look like a movie made with the very first camera ever made, at a time when strange human beings live and perform their bizarre habits. God killed himself with a razor and gave mother tongue. Mother Earth satisfied herself with God's semen after an act of fellatio, and gave birth to a son "Meat on Bone". What follows is inhuman acts of ritualistic torture, rape and murder for purposes we do not know ... or do we?
