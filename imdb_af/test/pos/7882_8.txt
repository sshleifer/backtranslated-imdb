Dennis Patrick plays a man who accidentally kills his daughter's boyfriend and then reveals his secret to a local bar. Joe (Peter Boyle), a bigot who gets drunk there, first takes it as a joke, but then the story is confirmed on the evening news. Instead of calling the police or the kind, Joe decides that since the man killed a hippie, they must be spirits! He swallowed the man to become his mate. Initially, the film was hard and judicious, but as it has revealed, it has become a complex portrait of today's society. Yes, I think it exaggerates a bit, but in amusing ways that do not really detract from the power of his messages. Susan Sarandon debuted in this movie, and it's a shock to see how beautiful she was about 23. It's good to see.
