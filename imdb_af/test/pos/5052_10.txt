As Czech, I am very happy when I read this comment here. I'm absolutely sure this movie is great. And what you may not know is that the story is special for Mr. Brodsk√Ω was written. The man you can see is he and his typical attitude - to live and resist death. He was one of the great actors and we are very happy that he made so many beautiful films in his life. You're happy to see at least one of them. Enjoy.
