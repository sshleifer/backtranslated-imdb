The reason is that the previous review was written by someone who left this movie, not even halfway. Unfortunately, he missed out on a movie of immense beauty. Matching the movie was very slow to start, in fact, the friend I was with fell asleep briefly. I woke him up before she disturbed the rest of the audience. Fortunately, the film evolved into a story of love, drugs and how it was to be young and free in the experimental 60s. Fantastic performances of the two lead and a good look at the film that gave it a true authentic feel. Be patient, like great movies, it's worth waiting for, and definitely a movie I will look forward to seeing! 8/10
