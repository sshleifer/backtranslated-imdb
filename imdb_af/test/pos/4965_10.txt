This is a video version of a stage production, with extra shooting for the video release. The result is both the drama of the stage with the impact of well-crafted film. The set by George Tsypin, with sculptures and masks by Julie Taymor, is wonderful. <br /> <br /> Jessye Norman is fantastic and the young Bryn Terfel hears and sees. This production is beautiful, emotional and majestic. If you don't see it, you've missed it.
