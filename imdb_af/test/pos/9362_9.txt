It was a very gritty film about anti-Semitism. Unlike GENTLEMEN'S AGREEMENT (which also deals with anti-Semitism), the movie is aging well and doesn't look heavy-handed. In other words, it deals with the subject without being preaching or foolish according to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Robert Ryan plays one of the most dirty characters, killing a man just because he is Jewish. Robert Mitchum plays the investigator trying to get the bottom of this crime. <br /> <br /> I give the movie kudos for its eager and infallible look at hate. This is in many ways an example of Film Noir - although the subject does not deal with ordinary gangsters or robbers.
