As a huge fan of the Hammer Studios and enthusiastic viewer of their Gothic Horror films, I wonder what took me so long to start watching their TV series "Hammer House of Horror", which only ran for one season in 1980 . Now that I've seen the first four episodes of the show, I can say that it has met my expectations so far. While this first episode "Witching Time" may not be the most imaginative Horror story ever to be told, and not the wonderful Gothic atmosphere that I keep from Hamer's 50's to 70's films, it undoubtedly makes it a Surprising surprise spooky story and create within half an hour some nice creepiness. The film composer David Winter (Jon Finch) is tormented by the 17th-century witch Lucinda (Patricia Quinn). While it can be easy, but for a running time of less than an hour, it is effective and provides very creepy moments. Northern Irish actress Patricia Quinn, probably best known for her role in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), as well as the fantastic Monty Python comedy "Monty Python's Meaning of Life" (1983), is wonderfully malicious in her role. which suits her like a glove. Jon Finch is also very good like David, and while Prunella Gee, who plays his adulterous actress, may not be the best actress ever, she is definitely looking forward to it. The episode is accompanied by a good score that plays well with the atmosphere. Overall, "Witching Time" is a very entertaining episode with several really flu moments, and decent opener for the series.
