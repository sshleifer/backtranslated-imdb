There are several ways to misunderstand this movie and some of them have been shown in some of the previous comments. It is a movie that is analyzed as a free recreation of a well-known topic and is therefore not compared to the opera, book or other Carmen movies previously seen. It's just for himself and I have to say that this Carmen is doing very well. It is a mistake to compare, as it is the first step in giving films the chance to be autonomous creative artworks. Vicente Aranda is a master of atmosphere and the arts, costumes and photography are extremely well crafted to achieve a pleasurable aesthetic experience. Let's take it as it is. <br /> <br /> And that brings us to the next misunderstanding. Someone complains about the typical Spanish cliches in the movie. Well, the film has historically been very well researched and you can see the results of that very serious work in every scene. Not only is it an accurate portrait of the "black Spain" of knife and espadrille that portrays Goya so vividly, but it is also of that part of history as seen by a stranger fascinated with the folklore of the society. First, anyone who does not want to see a cliché about Spain should not buy a ticket to see Carmen, but in this case the clichés are presented before they become one and the way they see is to get from us. get rid of your own prejudices. <br /> <br /> Another important requirement to understand this movie properly is to speak the language. It is not acceptable to criticize any actor performance because they did not understand his or her lines. If the rest of the audience did this, the problem probably lies somewhere else. Paz Vega has an impeccable diction with her Andalusian accent and everything she says is understandable and credible. Her Argentine partner, Leonardo Sbaraglia, also gives a convincing portrait of the Basque officer who has become a "bandolero", and her accent is very well learned. <br /> <br /> No less important is a minimal open approach to the material. To say that Paz Vega is "awful" indicates that the author of the phrase entered the theater for the wrong reasons. We already had a critic in Spain in one of the most sought-after newspapers that recommended our images that were homosexual, without mentioning it explicitly. And it wasn't quite fair for the rest of us, especially for those who didn't realize the man was writing with parts of his anatomy that many readers didn't necessarily have to care for. I do not suggest that the reviewer had the same motivation, but the expectations had to be different, since those of us including a talented and beautiful actress will play an almost classic role because that is what we have . Paz Vega IS Carmen, and an excellent one in Vicente Aranda's movie.
