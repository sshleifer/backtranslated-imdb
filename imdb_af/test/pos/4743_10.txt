Things that are just "news" are taken as a given in this shocking documentary. I fear that the producers of this movie will defend in the spades. <br /> <br /> The producers show us the Davidians, the government agents, the investigators, with all their mistakes and all their humanity. Nothing that a reviewer can say can approach the impact of watching and listening to yourself. Pieces of evidence - Congress evidence, 911 tapes, news footage, expert commentary, interviews, photos and home videos - are seamlessly woven together and tell a disturbing story. <br /> <br /> Don't wait. See this movie and tell your friends.
