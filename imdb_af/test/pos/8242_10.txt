As a child growing up in the Sydney of the 1950s, I can easily identify with the contents of this fine movie. Every week I visited the Wynyard Newsreel Theater on George Street to watch the Cinesound (and usually 3 Stooges) shorts. There has never been a better blend of B / W and color a movie. Impeccable production values ​​round off a forgotten film experience.
