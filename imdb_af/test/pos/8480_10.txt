I am so glad to see the (Ray) movie for the 21st-century Sidney pot (Jamie Foxx) who played this role as evidence of his brilliant ability to put his position alongside big actors in Hollywood by his golden support for the strong abilities of African-American actors over the times and periods by his eternal work as evidence of the eternity of Ray Charles as a great proof of their legend appearance at any time by them success for the Oscar prize. as (best actor for leading role) a (best mix sound) between fact and movie scenes on Ray and Jamie as a blend of two copies of Ray (ray of the past) and (ray of 2004 in the person of Jamie Foxx). It was nice of the director to pick those songs that would be adapted to dramatic scenes in the accidents of the movie to enter the sphere of success in legendary movies with legendary Hollywood movies since 1893 until now and his cunning about Sharon Warrne to choose. He played the role of Ray's mother that she succeeded in brilliant analysis for the essence of her character that Ray's mother was the turning point for him, resurrected to be self-reliant to take his place in this world and an icon in his talent as (Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington) and at the end of this film by receiving his noble report of Gerogia and deciding to take his song (Georgia in my mind) the anthem for this says he made his promise that his mother has been alive through his legendary songs and brilliant life to date.
