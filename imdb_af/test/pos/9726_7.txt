I didn't know what I was going to watch from this old movie from 1940. However, I always enjoy seeing Laraine Day (Katie Lattimer) playing the role of younger sister to Jean Muir (Helen Lattimer) and also their mother, Billie Burke (Mrs Julia Lattimer). I thought I would be bored with the story of two sisters and a mother who was excessively protected from her daughters, until they met Robert Cummings (Ridley Crane), who has the reputation of being a millionaire star who has many gals is a heavy drinker who makes parties all the time. One night, Helen Lattimer goes on a date with Ridley and he continues to bombard his head and can't drive his car. It is at this point in the movie when it becomes a drama and changes the direction of this movie, which will definitely keep your attention right until the end of the film.
