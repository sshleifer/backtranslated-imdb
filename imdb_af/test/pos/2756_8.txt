This is a "revised" Riverdance presentation, hosted at the New York City Radio City Music Hall. Of the three Irish dance music that I am in mid to late 90's (including the first "Riverdance" and "Lord of the Dance"), I liked this one the best. <br /> <br /> I thought it was better than the original, which was held in Dublin, Ireland, because it contains segments that are mostly good. It has a more varied and colorful stage setting, and it eliminated two points from the original. It wasn't good to start. It is just a very solid display with few weak spots. To be sure, there are a few songs / dances that are just "fair", but nobody who is poor is incredible because there are 20 numbers in everyone. <br /> <br /> The casting is similar to the first Riverdance with the main exception to Colin Dunne replacing Michael Flatley as the leading dancer. Both are very talented. The big difference can be in their eyes with Dunne, a little black-haired man, while Flatley is the cut-off blonde. I prefer Dunne because Flatley's ego is so big he sometimes gets annoying. Fortunately, the female head, Jean Butler, is there and is great to look at: what a graceful beauty and talent! Butler and the rest of these women have the biggest bones I've seen on dancers. I also enjoyed the dance of Maria Pages, a Spanish flamenco performer, and two guys: Daniel B. Wooten and Ivan Thomas. One number - with two pairings against Dunne and two other dancers -0 is known as "Trading Taps" and is great fun to watch, perhaps the highlight of the whole show. I also have no complaints about violinist Eileen Ivers. <br /> <br /> The "fast" Irish songs addressed me the most. I appreciated that the audience didn't get in the way of the performances, either shouting and screaming like the women in the "Lord Of The Dance" video do.
