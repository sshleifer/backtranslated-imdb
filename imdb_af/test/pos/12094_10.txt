Turkish culture is complete with many different cultures. different cultures have different styles of music. Istanbul is like the mix of turkey. it usually has the same language, but different dialects. This documentary shows us these different kinds of music with different dialects and different instruments. You can see reports with singers and groups, their performances, their daily lives and their thoughts of music. The film not only includes the music of Istanbul, but life in Istanbul, how people communicate and what they eat and drink. The surprising part is though I live in Istanbul, I learned a lot from this movie.
