Well ... this is 2005 and when you finally go and watch this movie, you'll probably call it dated. But here's the thing, the script was bold, the exposure of the music industry was so bold at the time ... and it took time to get music created by African Americans to be promoted at the same level. like white deeds. In some cases it is still - but back in the 70's this film called some of the "background" that many never knew. Now we have 'American Idol' - 'Pop Idol' and other things we allow in the minds of the 'record performances' and how they think they should sell something that doesn't sell. <br /> <When I was a kid, I loved the Earth, Wind and Fire release of "That's the Way of the World", containing some of their greatest hits: "Shining Star", "Redes", "Yeanin", Learnin '"and the title. Little did I know it was a SOUNDTRACK of a movie ... until I moved to Los Angeles and got the wonderful Z channel. <br /> <br /> The Z-channel has retrospective this movie as part of a "Harvey Keitel", give me no idea Harvey Keitel had so many movies - and when I saw this one, I was amazed. A masterpiece, but deserving more than it has, it's a nice little movie, more than a "vanity piece" for Earth, Wind and Fire, Harvey Keitel does a good job as a ripped record executive trying To combat the system, there are many lessons to be learned from this, and a lot of "insider" deals that are exposed. <br /> <br /> If you find this unhealthy, it's worth it.
