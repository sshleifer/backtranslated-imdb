I was recently at a deceased birthday party with five other girls, all my ages (eleven.) We all think it would be a harmless little movie, as Jaws decided to rent it with Rat Race. (We watched Rat Race When a stranger calls to relieve our fears.) At 11:00 am we put the movie into the night and lie in our sleeping bags that hide most behind the scenes. I shouted five times that is unusual to me, as I get scared in movies, but never scared enough to actually shout. <br /> <br /> We were all scared to even leave the bedroom because we were all positive. The Stalker (Jenkins as we called him for some reason) would get us. I played an average trick; one of them was all beaten to death. Ratras was over, I hid under my sleeping bag and quietly and humbly said, "HAVE YOU CHECKING THE CHILDREN?" They all scorched like nuts and were so scared. All in all, I will rate this movie a 9. The only thing I didn't like was that 1. There were too many false alarms when Jill thinks the Stalker is there and 2. The kids never woke up during the whole thing until Jenkins kidnap them and hide them in the cupboard, during which everything they did cries like babies. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller. But one thing: I DON'T GET IT AT 9:00 EVERYONE EVER 1!
