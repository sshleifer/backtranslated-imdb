I honestly don't know why so many people hate this movie, I've always thought it's one of my absolute faves. The battle with the tiger and his men smelled, the battle with the pirates with the axes being ripped, the whole shit with everyone trying to avoid each other in the house, is pure genius ... ok, so it does not have the necessary kicking leg, but eventually confrontation. the manchus was pretty good. I give it an 8/10.
