First I remember coming back in this zaniness of the Zucker brothers and Jim Abrahams in the early days at Comedy Central. Back in those days (the 90's), their programming consisted of Benny Hill reruns and the original MST3k, complete with beard server. <br /> <br /> Capt. Frank Drebin (played by Leslie Nielson, the rock face), is a process first created by the merger of several stereotypical police television centers (think Dragnet meets Starsky & Hutch the Show), boiled in a bottle of well-known police channel programming and scenarios . It is distilled, 3 times to produce the purest policeman each made. Forget Simon Pegg in Hot Fuzz (for now. Save it for later). Frank Drebin is at most times clueless, a terrible driver, a horrible shot, macho, but sensitive and vulnerable. He is a master of police investigative methodology (aa - ask Johnny the Leathery Old Shoe-Shine Boy). It doesn't make him a bad policeman. Police are also happy. Capt Drebin (see he is a Captain here) made it perfect. Together with his partner, Nordberg, and the rest of the force, the police parody drama in the course of 6 golden episodes. <br /> <br /> The show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialogue and quotas. Most of the eyes gags are a bit dated and stupid. However, the magic never came out of the sight gates. At its core was an uncomfortable and straightforward conversation and activities in the foreground, with crazy things occurring in the background. The movies can best be described as 90 minute combinations of the best gags from this series. Think of Monty Python's and now for something completely different ..... <br /> <br /> If you like Airplane 1 & 2, Naked Gun 1,2,3, or Top Secret, you'll definitely love it. <br /> <br /> I always liked the series better than the movies, although I saw the movies first. Why? 2 words: No O.J.
