I barely gave this treasure to me 10 stars. <br /> <br /> When I first watched and realized that it would not be a movie with a strong plot line, I almost switched it off. I'm very glad I didn't. <br /> <br /> It's a character-driven movie, a true story, which is mainly about the life of Rachel "Nanny" Crosby, a strong, beautiful (inside and out) Black woman and how she's the life of so much in the community of Lackawanna. <br /> <br /> Very interesting, not only its strong characterization of Nanny and the people who lived in her boarding house, but it also gives us a glimpse into what life and community of African Americans in the 1950s was for integration and the good and bad parties of segregation and how it eventually influenced and changed the black community. <br /> <br /> In addition to excellent performances by all the cast members, there are some good singing and dancing from that era.
