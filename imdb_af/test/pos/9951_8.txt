What can I say? The inside of the little one has always had great feelings for the following ... giant robots, giant monsters and a giggling, megalomanic pilot villain and this movie delivers on all points. As an adult, it is easy to show the many mistakes in this movie and to say hey it is really just a lot of episodes taken from a children's TV series. Despite this, I find the end moving very much and the content surprisingly mature in nature. Great fun as a little indifferent at times.
