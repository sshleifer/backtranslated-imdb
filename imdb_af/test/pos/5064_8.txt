Is torture ever right? No The answer is simple and absolutely with no qualifications possible. The reason for this film is the effect of torture on a society. The values ​​that have worked hard in Western society over the centuries of revolution and struggle are that ALL men and women must be allowed to live in a free and open society. One where individuals are treated equally and with regard to their essential rights as people. To protect this society, institutions have been developed to deal openly, fairly and honestly with injustices. These settings are customized and created by generations of hard work. One can argue that this is the true foundation of democracy, since they all belong to us, let us all be heard. If we allow undemocratic, inhuman acts to be committed in our name, if we divide our society into those who have rights and those who do not, we destroy the work of our ancestors. In addition, we are all accomplices and all guilty and infected. Whether those who accuse us are guilty or not is of no importance. We are determined by our attitudes and responses.
