Excellent story with dinner performed by all the role-players. The warmth and insight into what Jew represents is moving from the screen and into the heart of this viewer. The frustration and determination of Mother Madalyn in her pursuit of his work to her last breath was also done with excellence by Barbara Hershey. The entanglement of the personalities of Jew and Mother Madalyn has grown throughout the storyline with a breathtaking crescendo in the final scene.
