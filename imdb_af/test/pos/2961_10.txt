When I was in the States, I was about 7 or 8, I always woke up early, just to see it, along with a lot of other cartoons like HootKloot, The Road Runner Show, The Pink Panther. But it was perhaps one of the most memorable and funniest animated works there, and I find it quite funny today. I will never forget the episodes, like the one where two earthquakes fought over the can of chocolate ant pudding? or the one where the piggy bank is trying to reach the island where all the ants are close, and my personal favorite, the one where the ant, the pig and the dog end up in an animal hospital, which later becomes the basis of a similar looney Show cartoon with Sylvester, Tweety and the bulldog. This is one of the most memorable cartoons out there, after which someone would love to go again, I would. An excellent range.
