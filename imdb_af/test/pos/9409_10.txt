I heard of the case, but didn't really pay attention to the whole hoopla of Fuhrman, the book written, Call is arrested, etc. However, this movie did an excellent job of Martha, the brothers of the Link, the murder, Mark Fuhrman's involvement and the results of his investigation. I especially spoke about the flashback scenes with Martha about her last summer. The actress who played her literally believed in glowing life and made it even more gripping that the true Martha was probably like that. This made Martha look like a real person rather than a victim. I would definitely recommend watching it.
