The brilliance of this film does not lie in the film processing process, it is a conventional but executed, intertwining story of the lies of three servicemen after World War II, but in the fact that this story was told plainly. Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for the fact that the chutzpah is being printed by a film that has a disabled veterinarian for hand, alcoholic and under-educated.
