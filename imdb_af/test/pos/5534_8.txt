Strange but acceptable mob comedy that has an interrupting FBI agent (Matthew Modine), flirting with a protested widow (Michelle Pfeffier) ​​to tie two murders of an elusive mobster (Dean Stockwell). <br /> <br /> The movie shows it doesn't have to be top notch, just to be funny and director Jonathan Demme ("The Silence of the Lambs", "Philadelphia") keeps the movie out to see if it is held. It's good and it also avoids predictability.
