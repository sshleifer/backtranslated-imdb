I like "Hack." Think the "Lone Ranger" was reincarnated as a 2000 manager, a decent but flawed man, in Philadelphia doing his best while trying to work out issues from a turbulent past and you have the synopsis. David Morse is almost perfect like Olshansky. He helps people, but instead of driving Silver in the old west, he drives a taxi through the average streets of contemporary Philly, without spreading silver dots. The supporting role is first class and well above average. Sometimes the dialogue dialogue almost reaches the level of the 70-year-old classic series, "The Rockford Files." This performance earns a return, hopefully in a better time slot than 9:00 on Friday (Eastern).
