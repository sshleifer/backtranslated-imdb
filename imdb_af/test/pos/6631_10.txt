I must no longer be surprised if critics miss the most obvious things in artworks, because they are people, and the vast majority of people are lazy in nature. It is the simplistic idea that Ingmar Bergman's great 1968 film Shame (or Shame) is merely an anti-war film, damaging the reputation of this very complex and highly nuanced film. Compared to his more filmy showoffy predecessors, Persona and Hour Of The Wolf, Shame is apparently a more classic film, in terms of narration. But the keyword is apparently because, while missing the bravura puppet psychologization of Persona and the gaudy horror movie homework of Hour Of The Wolf, it is one of the best films ever made about war - and not as an anti-war movie . , or a pre-war movie. As such, it should be with Wild Strawberries as one of its best films, as well as one of its best screens, if not the best. <br /> <br /> While apparently a more out-of-the-box psychological movie, it really says far more realistic things about the human psyche and the will to survive. In it, Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullman play Jan and Eva Rosenberg (perhaps a wink at the notorious American spies, who felt many European intellectuals innocent), two musicians who played before the local Philharmonic band before a war broke out, and they retired to live on a small piece of land on an island, which had content to work in a greenhouse. The country in which they live is nameless, as well as the island where they live, although the film was made on Bergman's small island Farö, just outside the north of the Swedish island of Göttland. It appears that their nation has been in war with an invading country for many years, or was involved in a civil war with rebels from another province. It's all left unconscious, because this war is meant to symbolize all wars. This is enhanced if the movie starts with various screen quotes, such as the credits role. These include quotes from Hitler to Vietnam-American military figures. After early scenes depicting the prosaic nature of their rural life, then the advent of war, where even old men are waiting, an air raid destroys the land of the Rosenberg, as hostile jets fly, drop bombs, and appear chemically. be weapons of an agent orange like nature. One plane hit, and a skydiver jumped out and ended up hanging in a tree. Jan, who starts the movie as a cowardly coward, refuses to help, so Eva goes alone. Jan joins her and they find the pilot shot. It seems he is indeed part of the invasive, or possibly rebel, power. A bunch of government soldiers soon stop at their home and ask questions about the dead pilot, then advise the couple to leave their home, as the invaders are near. There are the wrong interpretations of the film on a micro level, such as that of Bergman writer Marc Gervais, who delivers the movie commentary on the DVD of the film. Like many other critics, he claims Jacobi is a Quisling who worked with the Invaders. But it's clear and demonstrably wrong, because Jacobi is at the original Fascist government. As evidence, the Invaders were only fired after invading the Rosenbergs land and shooting their agitator. We know this, because the government they are later asking for the faxed interview, and words in Eva's mouth, see the film as supposed proof of their betrayal, and Jacobi works clearly with them, the Fascist Big Brother statisticians. Secondly, Jacobi is in charge of deciding which of the townspeople are sent to concentration camps, to work with the intruders, and the Rosenbergs are again among those spared. Thirdly, in his seduction of Eva, Jacobi tells that his son is on leave of the army. And if he was an intruder, he wouldn't talk so happily that his son was serving the state. Also, rebel forces are not official armies, and do not give official leave. Finally, Philip is clear with the rebels, or intruders of the organization, and why would he have killed a colleague? <br /> <br /> That Gervais and other critics misinterpreted and shattered so blatantly and improperly, misses such a key and the clear point of this film disputes their ability to discern any and all aspects of all Bergman's films. It is a great and good movie, and very high in the Berman canon, but it is disappointing to read how few critics and viewers really understand its complex message, rather than finding out for the cheap, lazy and easy demand from his being just anti-war, and a fairly simple movie compared to his two front-viewers. And it is the shame of Shame in the long run.
