I recently received the SEVEN UPS video and I must say it was a very enjoyable movie. Roy Scheider and Tony Lo Bianco are respectively the policeman and the scoundrel and a young Richard Lynch is wonderful as the psychic henchman Moon. The late Bill Hickman is pretty good as his associate Bo and sets up a brilliant car chase that will keep you on the edge of your seats. The other three members of the Seven-Ups team are pretty vague, but that's just to be expected. <br /> <br /> I'm happy that many people on this site supported this movie. I think it should be a movie to be released on DVD and not just forget it. I enjoy it every minute. The final scene between the two leads is excellent, as the bad man must face the consequences of his actions. THE SEVEN UPS does not disappoint.
