A very intelligent and exciting thriller that doesn't rely on action, but on situation, which is still scarce today. I would compare this movie to The Day of the Jackal, another film about the pursuit of a dangerous international criminal. The play across the board is superlative - Aidan Quinn has a difficult dual role as the evil terrorist Carlos and as the naval man who embodies him. Donald Sutherland plays the amoral CIA agent who hires him. Ben Kingsley plays the Israeli officer who is helping in the plan. It's a very tense and effective movie, and it's remarkable considering how little action there is in it. The first half of the film was all set up, as the navy prepared him to personalize Carlos. The second half is a breathing action, the action that comes out of the characters and their situations makes it increasingly gripping. A very tight film that should not be overlooked.
