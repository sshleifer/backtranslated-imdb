Not sure why the other comments on this movie were so negative, but I loved this movie. I am a student of Asian art with a particular love of Korean art, culture and history. I thought this movie has a very controversial and interesting character for life. Jang Seung-up is one of the (perhaps the most) famous Korean artist and is still honored as master. Given the turmoil of the time in which he painted and his own conflicting nature, it is incredible that he has produced so much work in so many styles and with such skill. This movie honors his talent while looking directly at his erratic and somewhat self-destructive personality. The cinematography in MY opinion was beautiful, many of the outdoor panoramic shots looked like Korean landscapes (which I found a beautiful imagination rather than "too much arty") and I think Choi Min-sik has Jang Son-up with " depicted a necessary intensity. and unpredictability. I would highly recommend this movie for art lovers and movie lovers.
