Apart from portraying a lesbian love story, Fire is also a comic satire of middle class (?) Indian culture. I find it is a quality that is appreciated little about the movie. These two genres (such as a deeply meaningful alternative love story and comic satire) usually mix as well as oil and water, but Mehta (somehow) manages the balance to almost perfection. The servant Jatin's behavior, the family's treatment of him, the servant grandmother's inevitable presence, Ashok's obsession with swami's teachings: come from a culture like India, these are things I can immediately identify as typical. They cried to be noticed and mocked. As she develops her primary subject, Mehta manages to accomplish this secondary theme skillfully. In fact, much of the humor in the film that provides essential relief from the heavy subjects of taboo-lesbian love and gender issues, echoes this satire of the seemingly ordinary. The film flows from the cartoon to the gravity with great subtlety. <br /> <br /> Overall, brilliant use of symbolic devices (Radha compare to Sita of legend and come out of the fire harmless and thus pure, the lifelong desire of the young Radha to see that the ocean is eventually reached as she get freedom). Kudos to Shabana Azmi (Radha), the lighting staff and Deepa Mehta; their many un-Hollywood (and un-Bollywood-like!) talents made this movie special. One criticism: the first screens have let me down by not flowing very well together. <br /> <br /> The verdict: 9 on 10. Nothing less for a movie with scenes so burned.
