"The next Karate Kid" is an excellent movie full of adventure and new surprises. It has a wonderful plot and morale that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an amazing job of reaching Julie's role. I saw the actor Miagee plays and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The movie is funny and beautiful and I can't boast enough about how interesting the movie is. I'm definitely going to make this movie a 10 out of 10. I suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie.
