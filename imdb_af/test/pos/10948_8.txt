Like a very expensive Buffy episode, peppered with humor. Many thread and stunt kung fu. The Twins effect goes on the list of classics, should see HC movies. The vampires have a cool blend of ghostly ghost and beautiful European style. If you get the opportunity to see this one in the theater, it's worth a 30-minute drive, otherwise buy the import DVD before someone screws it up by giving it a bad copy.
