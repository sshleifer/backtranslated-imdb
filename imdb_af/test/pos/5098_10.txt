I love this movie because every element of it is nothing short of excellent. I'll quickly rate some of them. Peter O'Toole gives us one of his great performances, as he is the definitive Mr. Chips become. Petula Clark has a beautiful voice and is perfect like Katharine. The director could bring the story to the screen in a fresh new way. Combine this with the fantastic and creative cinematography, editing, writing, etc., and you have a movie that shows the fine quality of its production. I can't afford enough of the well-planned camera enough, it moves us up and down, in and out, giving us the best views and being part of the scene. Petula Clark's last song 'YOU AND I' are just 3 beautifully composed long tasks, and in these 2 seconds I appreciate the extra care everyone has to get the long scenes perfect. The music is great, and the songs move the story just as they should. Leslie Bricusse is one of my favorite composers. Listen to these songs, how can anyone not like them? It is a very romantic story between two people who reach the middle age who find each other, bring out the best in each other, and it lasts until the end of their lives. Excellent production values, acting, camera work and music make this movie worth watching.
