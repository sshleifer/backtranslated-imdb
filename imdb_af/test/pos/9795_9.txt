The "Radio Flyer" is one of my favorite American movies. <br /> <br /> The work of two boys, Joe Mazzello and Elija Wood, is really good (despite the terrible performance of T.Hanks at the beginning and end ...) with wonderful writing by DMEvans and powerful and emotional director of R.Donner plus Absolutely Incredibly Peerless Music Score by H. Zimmer allowed the "Radio Flyer" to win one of the first places in my family's review of movies. <br /> <br /> It is a pity that the movie was underestimated by some critics. <br /> <br /> I just can't wait to see it on DVD.
