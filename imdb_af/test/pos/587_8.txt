I really enjoyed the MOPPET MOVIE. It was the first of the Muppet movies and is by far the best because it is so creative and fresh. With later movies, the ideas did not look just as original. But here we see Kermit and Miss Piggy cyclists (an incredibly difficult scene), an excellent ensemble throw and just a lot of fun. I loved every minute that the Muppets were acting and I would have rated the film much higher, except for one serious problem. In these and subsequent Muppet films, there are certain powers that are felt there, and it is necessary to include many non-Muppets. Some worked well (like Charles Durning's), but many just look irrelevant and slow the picture to a halt. Probably the worst of them was with Edgar Bergan. Yes, he was a wonderful man who inspired Jim Henson and the rest of his crew, but the small scene he lived in was also unnecessary, and most of the cameos. Yet, despite this great complaint, it's a good movie for the whole family - from the kids to even the most demanding adults.
