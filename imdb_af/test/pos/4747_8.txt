It's a good movie and you probably won't be disappointed, but again Roy Scheider played a policeman named Buddy just after playing French Connection. They also use the same memorable cyclist of "Bullitt". Initially, you'd think you'd rather see the car hunt if you still have your face in your memory. The car hunt is a good one, but as in many motorcycle screens, it has technical and editing errors. Check 'Puppets on a Chain' and 'French Connection II' for other good, long, intense chases.
