So it can't be quite historically accurate. And there is little or no real character development. But for Jake (son of Ridley) Scott's first attempt, it's worth the ticket price. <br /> <br /> Captain James MaCleane (Jonny Lee Miller looks as good as ever) can be a gentleman, but he didn't have the money or the clothes to prove it. Plunkett (Robert Carlyle with all his clothes on) is a pharmacist bond. The circumstances of their strange encounter involve a dead body, a ruby, and finally a partnership as the gentleman chiefs. As the tagline says, "they rob the rich ... and that's it." There is not much background or even in-depth development, but the object seems to be relieving the aristocracy of enough money and jewels to pay for the two chiefs' transition to America. One small problem: MaCleane is in love. With the Chief Justice's Ward, Rebecca (Liv Tyler). The plot is original enough, the casting is excellent (especially Alan Cumming as the drag queenish Lord Rochester, Carlyle and Miller - also in Trainspotting, they haven't lost their dynamic), the costume is fantastic, the makeup is outrageous, and the music is a hard-core techno with a strange classic undertone. Jake Scott has an eye for light and shade, a good balance between spectacle and plot. He is not showing London the more unpleasant side of the 17th century. And happy for us, he likes faces, especially eyes. Jonny Lee Miller's eyes. And Liv Tyler's also, but hey, who's this movie about? Rebecca? No. Plunkett a MaCleane. But there is more to this movie than just pretty faces. With the risk of sounding clicks, it's a fast, furious and sometimes frustrating ride with the most noble freeways since Robin Hood. Decadent, sloppy and violent, Scott's debut film makes an entertaining evening at the movie. <br /> <br /> As MaCleane says, "I was fantastic, and it was a bloody good laugh!"
