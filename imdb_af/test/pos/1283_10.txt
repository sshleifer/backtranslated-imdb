Christopher Nolan set his goals in a very close direction, and in that direction he pulled something that reminded me of the kind of little poverty-rivals like Ullmer's in the 40's. Only this time, he is able to adapt with tribute-like things like black and white photography (a given because of the shoe-line budget, but also essential for the dark slits occupied by these characters) and decisive role-players (the John Doe chief , the smooth male counterpart and the beautiful-in-a-gritty way femme fatale) - while being held in the 90s underground kingdom indie, where for a few thousand dollars and specific choices in places and music and something possible would be. This, and also in the film-noir mood, also puts Nolan together a cunning web of a plot, perhaps even more so than Memento. While the latter was a work of psychology enriched by a plot, exploring the non-linear structure, looking at how far someone like Bill could go as dark as Cobb, just in an environment where It stays on your toes is not for someone who is not really distorted and is in the deeper mind games Cobb. <br /> <br /> Of course, the whole act of following someone is the main point of the story, and by that I wasn't even sure where it would lead, if it were a kind of Slacker consciousness where Nolan his character would lead to one urban British person after another. But the creation of Bill to Cobb's tires is done in a quick and excellent way. As we see right when Cobb Bill arrives at the cafe to ask what he's doing, he follows almost everything we need to know about both. He brings the first robbery together. What seems to be a good score on the horizon soon, is actually one big rally by Cobb and his lady (just called the blonde, perhaps an obvious tribute to noir, but why carp). But it is revealed in a way that really guesses me, since the manipulation of the narrative has increasingly worked to make questions not so much about why, but how. The density is increasing as a result of the actors' understanding of their essential points as characters. Alex Haw is brilliant as a true sociopath who can hardly soften his "deep" ideas about what it really pleases in a burglary, and Theobald with that attitude of someone who can never be as smart as he is in what he really does but is more intelligent in that naive way that is not a chance in the thanksgiving environment like this; Russell makes it almost too easy, even with a face that Ana Savage will send to shake her head. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Nolan is also on the ball with his style as a cameraman and holds nothing in it. Add to ambience and excitement, with the fade-in / fade-outs not too quick to give a lasting impression, but enough to add to the 'this can-lead-anywhere' logic of writing. He follows it in hand shape as if he knew where his limitations were, and yet it was fantastic to keep the necessities: close-ups when needed (one I loved was Russell's face in a small mirror) and a reasonable simple techno track that never detracts. Sometimes it's, as mentioned above, sometimes never quite clear what the line between something in 'contemporary' is and seeing something that is eternal as a solid pulp story of low-level criminals with thought games and moral ambiguity in its darkness. way. Simply put, it's one of the great phone cards I've seen from a film maker over the past year, and hopefully should be something that future Nolan fans can look forward to. Or even for those who think the noir has gone to the fast mainstream editing and large-scale fire dogs (even in independent films), it's a bright 71 minutes.
