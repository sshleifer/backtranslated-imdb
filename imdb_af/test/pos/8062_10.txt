As good as the Schindler list, I found this movie much more powerful because it is a documentary and based on real life. It describes the story of the Frank family, and especially Anne. Although it only moves slowly (describing their family life before the war); It becomes very powerful. <br /> <br /> Due to some of the materials and photos of the camps, I would not recommend it for children, but for adults it illustrates the horror of the Holocaust by one young girl. Highly recommended.
