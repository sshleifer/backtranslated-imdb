This is a pretty good documentary. I'm not a skateboarder, I don't particularly like skateboarding or skateboarding. But somehow for about 2 hours this movie was interested in the subject. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't call it the most intriguing movie of all time, but for some reason the guys talk about how they started their skateboard clubs and were skating in those empty South California pools, I was interested. <br /> <br /> I should also add that the music in this movie was also pretty good. I no longer sit to hear more 70's rock bands, but it was suitable for what they were talking about.
