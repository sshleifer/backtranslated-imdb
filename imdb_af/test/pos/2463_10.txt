One of my desires is to be a movie maker, and I just have to say I can't compete with the powerful drama The War at Home. The reason is because the play is perfect, and when you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. All I can imagine, look at it, I got involved and was very impressed. <br /> <br /> Estevez and Sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely wonderful. <br /> <br /> And so was his relationship with his mother (Kathy Bates). Some of the best scenes include these two. <br /> <br /> As well as the relationship between Sheen and his daughter, Estevez's sister in the film. <br /> <br /> 10/10, and definitely in my top 10. I want the DVD!
