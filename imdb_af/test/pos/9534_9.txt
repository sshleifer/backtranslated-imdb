What is nice to look at random movies at random is that you never know what to expect or where the next big movie will appear. Recently, my performance took the form of clipped classics such as "Raging Bull" or "Raiders of the Lost Ark", but this time my video recorder turned me off from modern amenities and placed me right in front of Lionel Jeffries's "The Railway Kids". It is a skillful film about three youthful children, a mysterious event with their father, relocation to the open field of England, and ultimately the rewards inherited by just blowing at trains. At first glance, this seemingly simple child movie doesn't seem to be as hopeful as it has been for some time on VHS rarity, but within the first fifteen minutes of this movie one realizes it's more than just your usual place for children's movies . ?? "Railroad children" were created at a time when purity was more than just saying no, when the family had everything and adventure was ready for each track of each railroad track. It's more than a beautiful movie, it has great movie techniques. It holds the regular viewer to the screen with unanswered questions and gives three perfect companions to follow this 110 minute journey. "Railway children" is a lost treasure to be seen by families and movie lovers. <br /> <br /> There are several moments that stand proudly in "Railroad Children" that change it from mediocrity to excellence? one is our three children; Bobby, Phyllis and Peter. Modern theater assures us that these three children cannot provide enough darkness, laughter and insight into the world around them, but Jeffries's children prove otherwise. From intelligent spoken lines (both from acting and scripts), to sincere friendliness and dedication to this small town, stop at the final meeting at that train; These children are more than just child stars who progress a story, they lead us with emotion, persuasion, and a realism that our children don't see today. There is more imagination in this small VHS package than I've seen in film for years. A favorite scene that could be handled generously, of which I saw other films, was Bobby's birthday scene. The way Jeffries drives her between guests and gifts was exciting and refreshing, keeping our eyes excited about every scene as well as our minds. Another scene that caught my attention was when the kids worked on gifts for Perks, when Jeffries only asked for a gift, Jeffries just said, "No, I won't. I don't like Perks. no. " The children's response is hilarious ?? offers moments for both children and adults to enjoy throughout. Filmed in the 1970s, this small feature offers true laughter as most modern comedies. It's a creative film along with good choreography and direction. <br /> <br /> That is, as much as I loved this movie, it wasn't perfect. Jeffries does a good job of guessing what happened to father, but it felt like the event was happening, the kids were in the dark and it suddenly came to an end. More detail to father, not much more, would have strengthened his character and given us the opportunity to see more of the children's response. There is also one play in this movie, one of the grandiose wide screenshots of the English countryside that is just breathtaking, but if you look a little closer, you'll see cars in the background. It helped me out, but didn't derive too much from the overall picture. Cinema like this is very much missed today, and oddly, it seems that only the British have the rubber to produce it. Movies like "Love, Actually" or "Vicar of Dibley" demonstrate the power and excitement of community villages, places where everyone knows everyone and we are not afraid to be closest. It's more of a theme that American audiences can have more of? more understanding of what's happening outside instead of staying separate for your own events. <br /> <br /> Overall, I loved "Railway Children". I didn't know what to expect when I first put it in the VHS player, but from the opening scene to the explosive train set, to Perks's birthday, Jeffries proved he could comfortably handle the most child-friendly story. His ability to make the child feel actors feels like real characters, to engage the adults less, and to engage the children as if they were adults, was excellent. This is a movie that has to be seen as a strong alternative to any Disney edition. The ever-prevailing themes of friendship, friendliness to strangers and forgiveness blow through the TV with grace and strength. "Railway Children" is more than just a child's movie; It is a feature that must be a staple for modern hearing. Not only does it provide good visuals in the English countryside, it also teaches (and shows) how life would be greater with the emphasis on imagination and courage, instead of fighting any CGI bad guys. <br /> <br /> Degree: **** Â½ from *****
