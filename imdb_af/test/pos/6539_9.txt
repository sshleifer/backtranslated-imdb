If Monte Hellman's legendary early 70's movie masterpiece "Two-Lane Blacktop" was done more than a sturdy, stripped, sturdy, stiff and straight, brimming mood that, through that clear average, became a "rough", a lot of rough and turbulent macho-Australian mentality and equipped with a golden sprinkling of dour, despair, no hope, anyway, the end of the road-punk nihilism, it will undoubtedly be much the same as this extremely dark and atmospheric knockout. </ p> <p> </ p> <p> </ p> <p> Deborah Conway away from him. Mike and Fox are joining with increasingly lethal games in which the game gets higher and higher with each consecutive game, which ultimately results in a remarkable pulse-clashing all-or-nothing race with only one true winner allowed. Mike, assisted by his worried but loyal Italian mechanic team Tony (a wonderful smooth twist by Vangelis Mourikis) and led by a blind, completely hip-up physical rebel (wonderfully set up with maximum coolness by Max Cullen), Set his life on the line for the sake of his reputation, the love of his old lady, the money and, above all, the chance to drop the haughty Fox out of his gloating. Targeted with the greatest gravity and intensity by John Clark, written by Barry Tomblim laconically upright perfection, with a quarrel, flesh-creeping synthesizer score by Peter Crosbie and saving, unadorned cinematography by David Gribble, this authentic gnarly early 80s is the concept of racing cars as not only a funky alternative lifestyle, but also a special obsession and reason for life (this is the only thing that most characters of the movie are really passionate about) with a remarkable, spectacular eye . Complete with an extremely cunning ending and relentlessly grim central message about the bitter price one pays to be top dog. This alternate depiction of a dead end as an extraordinary film performance.
