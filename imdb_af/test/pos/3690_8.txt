But a good role! Jonathan Pryce, Kathy Bates, Rupert Everett, Lynne Redgrave, Julie Andrews and Dan Aykroyd! And that's just the beginning. <br /> <br /> I'm not entirely sure any description of the movie and plot will seduce you to look at this one. Suffice it to say that it has something for almost everyone: death, singing, a spark pack, cell phones, a small person (pretty woman, actually), a bridge bridge (modern, not medieval), a boombox and " a crossbow. Oh, and a psychotic. And Barry Manilow. <br /> <br /> You should trust me when I say that 50% of you out there will hate this movie due to the lack of Absurd Gene in your DNA makeup. It is not your fault; it is hereditary. The other 50% of you will probably want to change the channel after 20 minutes, but you have to watch. <br /> <br /> Even at that end you may wonder why you looked ... but keep in mind that absurdity matters. It must grow on you. It's a test.
