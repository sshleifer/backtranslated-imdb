living in Romania, I was almost amazed at the very realistic environment for the scenes and the great care that the director paid for local details. The performance of Anthony Queen is absolutely amazing, and the rest of the actor does a good job of supporting him. The film takes a little knowledge of the Eastern European context to fully enjoy it, but it otherwise remains a good performance with a few memorable lines. The end may be a bit too melodramatic, but it's actually the way people are in this part of the world. I believe the script is wonderful because it represents the horrors of the 2nd WW in the most original way - no blood, no battlefields. Still, lives are ruined, and the smiles you occasionally get through the movie are quickly killed by the war realities affecting the characters.
