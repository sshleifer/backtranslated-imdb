I absolutely loved this movie! This is my number one favorite. Although there were some flaws (which movie has no flaws?), This movie was written, directed and manufactured very well. The characters in this movie are very real and credible. They fit all the characters into a specific role. I think the most likely thing about "Lord On Earth" was the love triangle, as well as the other emotional situations included in the movie. It's not one of those movies where you just can't tolerate anything, because there are situations that everyone is or was. There are so many different things going on in this movie that it is difficult not to relate to It. I'm just 18 years old and I can even connect to it. It was heartwarming and torn at the same time. "Here on Earth" will make you laugh, cry and sometimes be angry. I give this movie an excellent review and recommend it to anyone who loves romance and passion!
