The Venice Dealer 8/10 <br /> <br /> (This review assumes a basic knowledge of the story and it can therefore be thought that it contains spoilers to anyone unfamiliar with the plot.) <Br / > <br /> As a movie version of the well-known Shakespeare game, Venice trader, who has made little adjustments since Polanski's pretty eager Macbeth, does the spirit of the play and doesn't bring it as well, but better than the play could only be reached. <br /> <br /> The owner of the ring director, Peter Jackson, argued that when adjusting a book or game there are three options: try to repeat the original as perfectly as possible, using the original idea as " An inspiration, but take full license for movie change, or (the one he preferred) at the original, as much as the movie is viable, but make the changes needed for the movie and while staying true to the intention or spirit of the original. /> <br /> In Macbeth, Polanski uses the rainfall beaches and realistic rapes and murders to carry a bloody and horrific period in which the play is set in order to keep in mind the terrible context in which the characters make such sick. advised decisions. It differs from (say) Branagh's Hamlet, which has achieved new heights of faithful release, but otherwise slightly new. Macbeth, on the other hand, may have helped audiences to freshen Shakespeare to appreciate the drama's fullness without extensive study; Similarly, more well-known audiences may find a greater depth than the unfinished stage performance can achieve. Such an interpretation plays an important role as audiences become fully involved, not only intellectually, but also emotionally, with the points Shakespeare wanted to make. <br /> <br /> Radford's adaptation of Merchant or Venice does just that. It takes essential moral dilemmas involving religious or persistent promises, and with minimal beating of the Bard's sacred toms, they faithfully bring in the spirit of the original story. <br /> <br /> The first of these religious dwarfs gives meaning to Shylock's otherwise outlandish behavior. We see that the Jews of the period have fallen to a walled ghetto, allowed only as an identifying red cap. Not being allowed to own property is one of the few ways in which they can earn through money loans. This makes them both useful to their Christian oppressors and at the same time the object of their misconduct. The idea behind (both old and new wills) Biblical prohibitions at interest is probably the result of not making a profit by helping one's friends. It is extended by the cursed Christians to curse those who spit them (we see that Shylock not only spits, but casts fellow Jews into the waterways for sport - in an atmosphere that can only be described as threatening). <br /> <br /> The actuality of the film is inquisitive, as the crossbeam of right-wing Christianity (as embodied by the Americans of the Bush Americans) has become the full circle, as they are now the main supporters of the Zionism is. The Jewish political leaders bite their Palestinian neighbors much as Shylock tries to bite Antonio (as soon as he thinks the law gives him the power to do so). Psychology is obvious - kick a dog repeatedly and it will get angry. The circle continues easily, as victims of repression lose their sense of moral values ​​and become oppressors. <br /> <br /> The rigorous horror that disguised Portia uses to save Antonio has a bit of merit, both as a clever interpretation of the unsophisticated law that the Venetians of the play so wield and as a moral pointer . Shylock may have a pound of meat, according to his contract, but may not have blood. An easy analogy can be made as far as warfare and terrorism are concerned. It is much easier to fight under fighters or attacks that are bad if soldiers or savages are the only victims - when there is massive collateral damage, such as when innocent civilians, including women and children, are killed in their hundreds, the arguments of the warmthers (whether these hot dogs Israel, Palestinian or American Americans) support much less popular support. <br /> <br /> For a long time there has been much argument whether Shakespeare was anti-Semitic in this story. One wonders if he had to adjust to a great Christian audience who had little trade with Jewish people. Far from teaching him more good, the end ends Christianity and humiliation on Shylock - a course that is likely to endure a rebellious resentment. Both camps look just as bad - one holds more power than the other. The slight relief of judgment simply gives Christian judges a better public image, or as Bassanio so sharp (see when the boxes are selected and solve the puzzles to win Portia's hand): <br /> <br /> In religion, What damn wrong, but some sober appearance will bless it and approve it with a text, hiding the coarseness with a fair decoration? There is no such problem, but takes some virtue on its outer parts. <br /> <br /> Of course, the bigotry is applicable to organized religion (rather than spirituality), especially when organized for political purposes, but one that easily goads ordinary godly people who are not in the habit of separating hair no. The kindness, grace ("Chesed") of Judaism, which is so fundamental to true Christianity, is also practically practiced in Judaism as in most creeds. The Jewish faith distinguishes between charity and charity, ways to practice both effectively, and ways to make it part of one's being rather than just an outward performance. Both Shylock and Antonio were raised and used their respective beliefs to abuse those of another faith. While Shakespeare prompted the divide between the goodness prescribed by various religions and his absence in practice, the film greatly diminishes the window of interpretation of anti-Semitism and brings a greater degree of realism to the psychological causes. <br /> <br /> Keeping promises (the men to their wives) is less well handled, just like the comic elements inherent in the cross-band subplots. Bassanio, however, strong love for Antonio (there are gay elements there?) Can't make good moral judgments if he gives his thanks to the 'judge' and thus breaks his promise (for which Portia forgives him, shows a triumphant character for women not just as highly intelligent and spiritual, but also as more truly compassionate and considerate of others than her excited male counterparts, including her husband.) <br /> <br /> Some of the plays are a bit quiet and there is too much regional (English) accent, but generally Venice trader produces a fresh and rewarding rework of Shakespeare. I enjoyed the acting, and also the very beautiful soundtrack of Hayley Westenra and others, singing ballads written by Shakespeare and Edgar Allen Poe. All in all, Venice's merchant is an inconsiderate performance of the British (as far as a film of a particular nationality can be) nowadays.
