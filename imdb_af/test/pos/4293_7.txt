Another popular show for a British picture at Coalville's Century Theater. A well-crafted, solid drama with an ever-evolving plot and continuous 'twist in the story' ... as the lies are piled up! A masterpiece of acting through a flawless throw, well smuggled by first-time director Julian Fellowes. Outstanding performance, as usual, by Tom Wilkinson, but good innings by all those involved, including supporting actors Linda Bassett and John Neville. Our audience was captivated by this film, which includes a few shock incidents that really make you jump. A good production in about 80 minutes, probably on a very limited budget, but a success that Fellowes has to regulate for the big screen again. Some publicity for the film predicted that it was set in the fifties (as in Nigel Balchin's novel), but of course this is not the case. Recommended display.
