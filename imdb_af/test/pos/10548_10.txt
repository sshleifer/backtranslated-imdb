this is one of my favorite movies. It's one of those movies where I know each line, but can still look it repeatedly without losing interest. I'm always throwing this movie on vacation, or if I don't want to go to the gym, just to see Nikki's beautiful body, I'll give the motivation I need. It's an easy movie that always makes me smile, but I know it won't be everybody's cup of tea, but if I love you, you like movies that are beautifully shot and are comedy, romance and an interesting plot, you will like it. It's full of great characters and Ben and Nikki are both beautiful so everyone can look at something attractive. BOTTOM LINE ...... YOU MUST GIVE IT A PRIE! One day I watched it on TV and loved that I had to go and find out what took time and I could see it every day. MY FATHER THE HERO I love you !!!
