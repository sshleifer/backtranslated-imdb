A 2006 record of Japan's top 100 favorite animated TV series of all time, led by TV Asahi, placed the series in fourth place. It tells you everything you need to know. So go look .;) I won't comment on the story, just because I don't want to ruin anything. Just ask you to watch after the first episode. The Animation is really good and above the TV average. The best thing about this series is that there is something new in the end. I mean it's not groundbreaking, but still offers a fresh new idea and similar characters. You won't regret entering Suzumiya Haruhi's world. <br /> <br /> And the best thing a movie will come soon
