It is now clear that the true golden age of American film was from the mid-60s until just before the launch of Star Wars. Previously there were too many Hays code-complicated porridge. With Star Wars, the green light was relieved for most of the films aimed at children and morons, a practice that continues to this day. The SEVEN UPS, the truth is told, contains some hackneyed lines of dialogue - "We can do it the easy way, or we can do it hard" is one - but I'm damned if I can find something else it's wrong. (The rule may not even be surprised when this film was made.) The SEVEN UPS demonstrates everything that was right with the best films of the golden era: sparse dialogue, realistic acting, real places (winter in a dirty New York) never looked better / worse, propulsive stories, and yes, the best car hunt ever filmed. Bill Hickman is the driver who pursues Scheider (you will recognize him from Bullitt), and the structure of the chase is pretty similar to the McQueen but I prefer the faciality of Scheider here, the pacing, the tremendous proximity of the schoolchildren, and the crushing conclusion. (That the VW bug goes about 2km / h, always bother me in the Bullitt hunt.) " A tough, scary count of Don Ellis sets the perfect mood: THE SEVEN UPS: grieved, grim, action-oriented, mature, a movie that cannot be made today, there is no "gimmick" for the kiddies or provisional end, thanks, Philip D'Antoni, Roy Sche Id and Tony Lo Bianco: As long as the movies are watched, THE SEVEN UPS and its 1970s brothers (eg. THE WOMAN CONNECTION) sets the default.
