When the noble Hanabusa clan is decided by the Samanosuke clan, the loyal emperor Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki) escapes with his master's eight-year-old son, Tadafumi, and his daughter, Kozasa. They are protected by priestess Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), who serves the Hanabusa clan's god Majin, a vengeful spirit trapped in the huge stature in the side of a local mountain. Ten years later, Kogenta and Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) seek revenge against Lord Samanosuke (Yutaro Gomi), but are captured and condemned to die. Priestess Shinobu, who urgently tries to save her master, threatens Samanosuke with the displeasure of the god, just to be beaten to death for her efforts. Samanosuke, a vain, cruel, narrow man, commands Majin's image to be destroyed, breaking any last remnants of hope among the remaining Hanabusa loyalists. But the god Majin, who has so far become relentless, has other ideas ... <br /> <br /> Daimajin is an engaging, timeless, deep-moving fairy tale. Excessive to a respected budget, it is a film about values: the values ​​of nobility, justice, decency, loyalty, self-sacrifice and love. It's about the hierarchy and rule and the consequences of not fulfilling the responsibility of the rule. These are things not talked about in our demotic times, except by writing paths like William Bennet, but are relevant, and Daimajin shows us why. <br /> <br /> Daimajin is a perfect example of why the Japanese theater is so delicious. The values ​​listed above have tangible relevance for those involved in this movie, as they do for many a Japanese filmmaker. There is no lip service, no condemnation, no irony here. Instead, there is an authentic effort to preserve a world where these values ​​can have life again, and to show what happens when they are abandoned. Just compare Daimajin, or the Lone Wolf and Cub series, or any Kurosawa movie to the eternal Tarantino's nihilistic Kill Bill b * llshit, to see what I mean. <br /> <br /> In a film whose contributing talent is so uniformly excellent, I just want to show the master Akira Ifikuba's majestic score, the talent and beauty of actors Jun Fujimaki, Yoshihiko Aoyama and Miwi Takada; and the beautiful depiction of Otome Tsukimiya. Her death scene is one of the most moving and meaningful things I've ever seen.
