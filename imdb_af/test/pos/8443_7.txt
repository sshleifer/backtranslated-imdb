It's been a few years since I've seen this movie, so forget most of the details. I loved it at the time and found the plot to be intense, stopping the climax heart. I remember literally on the side of my seat at the theater in 1979. <br /> <br /> Jane Fonda plays a Los Angeles reporter, Kimberley, who stumbles on a local nuclear power plant. She wants to go public with the story, with the help of her hippie cameraman (Michael Douglas) who photographed the event, but a sinister conspiracy tries to cover it all. Jack Lemmon is absolutely delighted in the role of the core manager's confronted middle manager, torn between loyalty to his company and "doing the right thing" by reporting the dangerous situation. His facial expressions speak volumes here. <br /> <br /> Apart from the impressive plot and sounding tension, this film is about Jack Lemmon, his character and his excellent acting. As for Jane Fonda (I was a big fan of her at that time), I suspect she had just attacked her anti-war protest to accept the nuclear industry. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like a heartbreaking tactic. Chernobyl and Three Mile Island (they are different types of reactors), our Canadian CANDU reactor is safe and respected in the world. I won't hesitate to live near the nuclear power station, about an hour's drive away, where my friend is a very skilled engineer. Apparently, they ended for every teenage problem, regardless of the financial loss. I really doubt there are conspiracies there. One can imagine almost any of the drivers or highly trained operators willing to take any kind of crash or whatever ... this is an absolute tomfoolery. Of course, the moral here is to save no cost or effort, either in building the facility or ensuring its continued security. <br /> <br /> If we want our Western lifestyle, we need to get some energy somewhere. For those who claim nuclear power, they can never be completely safe (of course), maybe they as a coal miner should be voluntary or else return to the electricity horse and buggy days. <br /> <br /> Anyway, enjoy this entertaining and highly exciting movie, apparently based (loosely? decorating) on ​​a real story. It's a real cooler, an excitement, and maybe (?) Even a killer, but please, don't get your attitude about the operation and safety of nuclear power plants from it.
