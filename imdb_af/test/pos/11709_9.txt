Sharky's Machine is easily one of Burt Reynolds best efforts. It is also one of the best contemporary crime dramas. Erotic and violent, the film distinguishes itself by setting the story in Atlanta and giving a chaotic detective case to you (the viewer) on a silver board. Dedicated and determined, Sharky must stop the murder of Dominoe, a lovely lady of the night, whose clients are anything but ordinary. Before long, Sharky's crime fighting machine exposes a high-order conspiracy threatening the inner body of Atlanta. As a Metro Atlanta resident, I remember the excitement of the town during the film's production. Sharky's Machine is doing very well to give an accurate representation of Atlanta. Twenty years later and 2,000,000 people later, the film is the test of time. Trust me, Atlanta hasn't changed. One of the highlights of the movie is Dar Robinson's bold stunt (a classic, symbolic ending). It was even known on That's Incredible, ABC's reality program of the period. It's just bad that Hollywood doesn't make enough movies like this one. Kick back, each your popcorn, and watch sterling silver theater action.
