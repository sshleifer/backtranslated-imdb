A few years ago I saw this film, without captions, on television and despite the fact that I didn't understand a word of what the characters say, I still have the general idea and the mood of the movie has me nothing associated with. <br /> Finally, I saw it again a few weeks ago. my heart skipped when I saw the picture in the television guide and for 8 days until the movie really showed, I told everyone I knew to see it. the story reminded me of alfred hitchcock's vertigo. a slow film about a man who one day believes he saw the girl disappeared years ago. Following is a wild roller coaster ride of flashbacks, changing perspectives and really ingenious twists in the plot, and at the end of the film I left breathless. I definitely don't have what I expected (and I've already seen the movie!). be ready to be confused. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10
