I own a copy of this movie and have always loved it. I come here, however, because I saw the PBS presentation of a concert version of Sweeney Todd earlier this week. That production was used by the San Francisco Opera and played George Hearn and Patti LuPone. In the early 80's Hearn replaced Len Cariou as Sweeney (Cariou won the Tony for his performance). I did Hearn and Angela Lansbury (who also won Tony for her acting as Lovett) Sweeney on Broadway. They had to make the movie about the time I saw the show. To this day, the most moving moment I ever remembered in the theater happened when Hearn sang, "These are my friends." ("These are my friends, watch them glitter." "My arm is over again!") <br /> <br /> Hearn's performance in the San Francisco opera production convinced me that in the almost twenty have lost nothing since I first saw him on Broadway and later in the film. What a talent! He is sympathetic, funny and frightening - all at once; and he can sing, he can sing. It reminded me how great the movie is. Highly recommended. Ten out of ten.
