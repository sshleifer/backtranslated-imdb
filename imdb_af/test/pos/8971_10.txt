Charlie Wilson's war is an excellent example of how films should be made. This movie is of the highest quality and is perfectly thrown. Tom Hanks plays the lead role and delivers an exceptional performance. In addition, Tom Hanks is complimented by the unparalleled acting ability of the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. I've never seen him in a role that suits him so perfectly. <br /> <br /> The movie is witty, intelligent and well written. Julia Roberts also starred in this movie but is easily overshadowed by the other two leading. <br /> <br /> I rated this movie 10/10 and am pleased to recommend this movie to anyone interested in quality cinema.
