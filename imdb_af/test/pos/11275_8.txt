First of all, it's an art movie and a good one. I loved the presentation and the way it was shot. Very cool. Certain scenes were of the more graphic horror sequence I've ever seen. This movie made me scared, not because of tension or shock, but because I was silent that I would soon see something really terrible. It happened in a few places, but mostly at the beginning. This movie also dragged on and the 74 minutes was long. However, if you are in movie, you should see it. To date, I have seen nothing of it. 8/10
