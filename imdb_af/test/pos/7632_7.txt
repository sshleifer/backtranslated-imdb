Surprisingly good film made in the aftermath of the Eksorcist about a young woman who is spirit-possessed after going to a desecrated church to restore a life size and life like the crucified man. The piece was Christ and the two thieves, but Christ has long been sold. Trouble begins as soon as the figure is removed from the cross and the woman seems to come to life. From that time on, it becomes a struggle for the girls' soul. Creepy, scary and much better than you think the movie works, because its role-playing sells events that are definitely mature. It helps to be real people who are flawed so that they are more easily related to them. I loved this movie very much, and I saw it for the first time in at least a decade. I was shocked at how good it was. Definitely better than any of its spectacular titles, it seems.
