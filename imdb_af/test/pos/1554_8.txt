I also saw this film at a film festival, but unlike the previous poster I found it interesting and original. In a sea of ​​terrible traits, shorts are often twice as bad, doing so on small budgets and poor acting. A.W.O.L, however, is a solid little excitement returning to "The Outer Limits". The performances are solid, unlike Morse or McGinley, and the direction is sharp and on the money. I personally find it difficult to reconcile the comments of the previous poster with the movie I saw. A.W.O.L is well-written by Shane Black, who, as usual, plays the game with the genre, both paying tribute to the stories of pulp sensitivity while blinking at the audience and never taking himself seriously. All in all, A.W.O.L proves an extremely well-executed and fun movie.
