Although, this episode was offensive to the Tourette Syndrome, others thought it was funny, while others thought it was a bad way to start the new season. <br /> <br /> This episode was funny and just shocking. South Park has made history as their first episode with the most cuss words, unless you see the movie as an episode. <br /> <br /> I enjoyed how they made fun of Chris Hansen and his television program, a predator. I didn't have the idea of ​​how they thought Chris Hansen would do a show on tourneys and let a boy talk and bash the Jews. <br /> <br /> One thing I didn't like is how South Park thought people with tourettes syndrome would just as badly blow out language. I saw people on television with Tourette's syndrome and they didn't just make bad words. Unless I'm wrong.
