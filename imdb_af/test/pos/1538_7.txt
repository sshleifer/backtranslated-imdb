Acting of course! Think about it, Closet Land could easily have turned out so terribly - a whole movie filmed in just one room with just two people is better off having some interesting things to talk about. <br /> <br /> But it didn't turn out terribly. On the contrary, due to incredible portrayals by both Stoves and Rickman, Closet Land is a masterpiece in its own right. <br /> <br /> That's not to say it's for everyone. People who have had their attention drawn through glittering sex scenes and random firearm have problems with digestion of Closet Land. However, those who can appreciate a good storytelling without explosions should look at it (no matter how many video stores you need to call to find someone in stock).
