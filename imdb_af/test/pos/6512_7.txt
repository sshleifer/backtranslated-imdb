I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating. It makes more money! Sure, it's totally ridiculous, but that's what it was supposed to be. Don't expect a movie review of a beauty contest movie on a Caribbean island! What you should expect is a great spoof of pretty much every relevant sci-fi, fantasy and block film in movie history, and even references to other spoofers. All too exaggerated and sometimes completely unnecessary, but that's exactly what this movie stands out for. If you like parodies, and enjoy saying, Leslie Nielsen or Mike Myers, you'll love it. I sure did!
