Crackerjack is a simple but worthy movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is requested by both sides. <br /> <br /> The combination of the central character that Mick Malloy played. And the central environment of local grasshopper clubs has drawn an unusually wide crowd, ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of senior citizens - and everyone laughed at the comedy. <br /> <br /> As expected from a movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy, there was quite a curse, but it wasn't overdoing and the audience I was sitting on was definitely enjoying it! <br /> <br /> Mick Malloy did a good job as the lazy block at the bakery club (three times), just to get parking spaces (one for himself and two for renting another at a premium) but who has dropped everything on him when he has to play or lose his membership. <br /> <br /> Judith Lucy does a good job as his local journalist / love affair and there are fabulous pe <br /> <br /> John Clarke's reel role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest, but he gives a solid performance. <br /> <br /> The not so subtle pokies in pokies give a bit of a serious note to this otherwise lightweight comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm sure those who enjoy The Castle and The Dish will also enjoy this movie. .
