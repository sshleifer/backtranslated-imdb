The movie was a bit slow at first. But it picked up speed and came right to the point. It showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons for the "gadget". I enjoyed it. It is very close to reality as any movie about the Atomic Bomb dropped on Japan. I recommended this to friends. I was especially pleased with the acting ability of Dwight Schultz.
