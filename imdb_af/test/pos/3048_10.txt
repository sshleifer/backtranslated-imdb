All I can say is that every time I see CONRACK, you. Martin Ritt, DP. John Alonzo, I feel an extreme sense of inspiration and relief in the power of the theater in such a simple movie. <br /> <br /> The film Conrack was founded in 1969. It is based on a true story. . It's a story about a white man (Jon Voight) who teaches a group of young black children how amazing the world is outside their small South Carolina island. <br /> <br /> The story places the work of a teacher as a noble cause in changing children's lives. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend it.
