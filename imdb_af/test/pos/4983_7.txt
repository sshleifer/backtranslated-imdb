A Western door and door. As the title character portrayed by Glenn Ford says, "No, I don't want to fight, but I'll be forced to do that if I do." This movie is about intelligence, strong and fighting for one's beliefs. Never stop with courage to strive for what you feel right. Great action and mostly fast pace. Good to see Brian Keith in this role and Edward G. Robinson as an older Western man. Glenn Ford lives up to his western image. Thoroughly pleasing film includes strategic non-military warfare. Of course, it is violent, as the title says, but not too graphically as in computer-generated movie films. It's mostly about strong personality clashes.
