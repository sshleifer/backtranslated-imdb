Director Peter Chan, Maria Maggent's script. <br /> <br /> Based on the novel "The Love Letter" by Cathleen Schine, director of Peter Chan's film release, released in 1999, was not a big draw, even for a romantic movie with some comedy elements. Although not as popular in the theaters, it soon became a popular movie on cable television and on VHS / DVD. Set in a harbor town in the good old US (I forget the exact location), this is the story of a mysterious, passionate written love letter that strikes emotions and confusion among the main characters. Everyone who thinks the letter is personally addressed to them. . By the end of the film we do not know who the lover or loved one is, but the power of the letter changed the lives of almost everyone in the village. The film is made up of wonderful actors who performed well on television and film, including Kate Capshaw starring middle-aged beauty. Helen, a bookshop owner, comedienne Ellen DeGeneres as her friend / employee Janet Hall, young hottie Tom Everett Scott as Johnny, the young 20 something old that falls to the older Hellen and a parent Tom Selleck as firefighter George Matthias who Johnny must compete for Helen's love. There is a film by former Hollywood actress Gloria Stuart, best known in modern audiences as elderly Rose in "Titanic" (1997) and a comedy by Kate Capshaw's own daughter, Jessica Capshaw, with the man Steven Spielberg. The love triangle is between a middle-aged woman, an elderly man and a young man, who each feel Helen as passionate as the author of the mysterious letter. The conflict lies in Helen's uncertainty. Will she choose the right person? Which man has the most to offer her? Johnny is in a relationship with a girl who is obviously fond of him, and is actually a reminder of what Helen was at her age. George is separating his wife and living a worldly and eventful life. A cultured intellectual, he takes Helen on an opera date, where the tragic death of Puccini's ultra-Italian heroine Tosca Helen for explosive tears. There are many beautiful views of the beautiful coastal town, beautifully cinematographed by Tami Reiker. The score is a paradise of romantic and sweet songs - "I never fell in love", "I'm in the mood for love" and "Only the lonely". Ellen DeGeneres as Janet Hall, who is consistently late with her work at Helen's bookshop, who can find endless men right away without the right guy, is just wonderful. She did not lose her comic flair, although at this stage in her career she did not appear much on television or film, because just two years before her in the middle of the 90-year-old TV series Ellen was canceled because she " come out "like a lesbian and the new lesbian subject of the show. Here you can even find comedian Jack Black, long before he made it big, in the part of a fisherman. It is a moving film about human emotions and decisions that are meaningful, about man's need for a passionate consuming love and the general love of escapism not only by books, letters and music, but by a real loving and safe relationship. It's a wonderful movie with wonderful moments and an infectious romantic spirit.
