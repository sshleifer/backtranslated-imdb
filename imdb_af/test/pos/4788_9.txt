I saw it when I was twelve. It was the movie that made me understand what was a good secret. I read the whole Happy Hollisters riddle series and they were about a family of child murders who always got their husband. But we were unable to read the riddle with them. This movie showed me that a good mystery is what the viewer / reader says to the end: "OH !!!!! OF COURSE !!!!!!!"
