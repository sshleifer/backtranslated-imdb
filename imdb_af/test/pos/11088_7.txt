"The Falcon and Snowman" is the story of two young men, a CIA employee and a drug dealer, who are disillusioned with the foreign policy of the United States and selling state secrets to the Soviet Union. The events of the film are based on a true story. <br /> <br /> Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn are convincing in the major parts and develop interesting features. The supporting role also plays well, especially with a show by David Suchet of Hercule Poirot celebrity as a seasoned Soviet agent. <br /> <br /> In general, the film is effective in highlighting its development and developing it and giving a sense of Two boys caught something they didn't understand properly. However, it looks clumsy and cumbersome at points in the middle. However, the end is tense, stunning and effective. There are some catchy rock songs included in the soundtrack, but unfortunately a repeated soft synthesizer track that doesn't fit a spy story. There are other spy films worth trying out as "The Falcon and the Snowman", but it's a decent movie.
