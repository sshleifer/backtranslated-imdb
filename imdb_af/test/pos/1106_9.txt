Received this DVD from the ACCENT series, which is a label specializing in home cinema movies, released Irreversible and a series of Bergman's opus. <br /> <br /> The thing that struck me about Alex Frayne's funny movie. MODERN LOVE is that it is an impeccable film that breathes with perfection and vision, a film we think in the minds of Mr. Joe Average, full of voices in the head, visions and madness. It's in rural Redneck Australia, the movie doesn't trivialize or praise people like so many Australian films. ie our movies are full of "dear villains" or people with "hearts of gold" etc. etc. <br /> <br /> Not in this movie. Stanley Kubrick's spirit is great here, it's not flawless, but has an enchanting attention to detail, a romantic streak and a sturdy, non-embracing mood. <br /> <br /> Less doubt ... the transfer seems to be erroneous credits cut, they don't fit in the frame. <br /> <br /> Also one of the short films is corrupt, it stops halfway.
