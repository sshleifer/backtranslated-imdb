NBC did a very good product when this series came out, but none got it for viewers. At least, according to their wise executives, good performances such as Star Trek & My World & Welcome came to This because of low ratings. NBC's advertisers got a bargain from NBC's ignorance. <br /> <br /> This show comes out as the only time James Garner was not enough to get viewers. This is a pity, as this show played an excellent supporting role for Stuart Margolin (later Angel in the Rockford files), for Neva Patterson after Margot Kidder. <br /> <br /> It was in a 1900-Western village. Garner was playing a sheriff who did not want to use force to perform his duties. It was small town stuff, but it was excellent. It was not long after Jim Rockford Garner returned to success, but for my money this show was good enough, it just wasn't at the right time, right place or given the right opportunity. <br /> <br /> The show was so good that most of the people working on it also worked at Rockford.
