I didn't intend to see this movie, but I wasn't disappointed when a friend dragged me. Although there are no real surprises here, the guys are doing pretty well with their obviously modest budget. <br /> <br /> If you saw the trailer, you probably know what to expect from this type of movie and there is a fairly constant stream of jokes here, with a few classic moments, with the high point probably a excellent jump-back that the guys were in the 1980s. I also read elsewhere that the end was a disappointment, but I was refreshingly different from what I expected from this genre. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie will not change your life, but it has enough fun to entertain you all the time.
