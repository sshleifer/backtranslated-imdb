You got it right! Bobby was Mike's imaginary friend throughout the movie, even though he was on his way to California. His mother knew about Bobby and didn't discourage Mike from leaning on Bobby, as imaginary friends are common with young children. <br /> <br /> So they both have stomach ache at the same time. That's why the boys were so close. <br /> <br /> In the end, Mike let Bobby go. The "King" was arrested. Mike can continue without Bobby. That's also why Mike's mom didn't get disturbed when Mike received the postcard (Mike wrote and sent) from Bobby the Ol 'West tourist spot and the other postcards from around the world. You noticed that Mike's mother left the first card and looked at the postcard. What a good mom does the best she could in the late sixties. <br /> <br /> A 9 out of 10 for me. Retaining memories ...
