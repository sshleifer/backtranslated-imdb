Key West, for a short time, was "appointment TV" for my family. I'll stop at Red Lobster and pick up a party box for the evening. The irony of the situation was that at the time I was a Fox affiliate and everyone at the station was prohibited from renewing the show. Everyone in that role was excellent. Fisher Stevens ... perfect. Who can't fail to identify with an "allman" who dreams of being a writer in Key West? Jennifer Tilly was always remarkable (and she's one HECK of a Texas Hold'em Player). You can still find the pilot section on YouTube. Wish they want to place the hurricane. This episode alone had to have won an Emmy, as well as the rest of the movie.
