The movie forever will never be nominated for an Oscar, it will never be nominated for the best acting, for the best film. But this movie does have things other movies don't do. In a nation with so much scandal, so many problems, movies being poured out with little thought into the morale of society, at least this movie promotes good. What is wrong to stand behind something that promotes happiness? We need to support movies telling our American teenagers that there is more to life than sex drugs and alcohol. As for this Haka debate as mentioned earlier, the Hakka is not exclusive to the New Zealand All Blacks, several Utah soccer teams and colleges perform this ritual before games. Including Hawaii, BYU, etc.
