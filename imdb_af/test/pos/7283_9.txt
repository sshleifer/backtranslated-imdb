Good movie, all elements of a good movie were there, story, actors, writing and direction. I was always on the edge of my seat. <br /> <br /> There is no doubt about it, it's a low budget movie, but I liked it more than big budget movies. <br /> <br /> Andres Bagg plays Martin Sanders, who deals with his unfaithful wife. Then a voice in the phone and then just fear. <br /> <br /> Virginia Lustig is beautiful and brings a powerful display. She is an excellent part of the movie. <br /> <br /> I kept the increasing ambiguity near the end, even though we know the main character may be involved, we continued to see everything from its point of view and ask: Who is the killer?
