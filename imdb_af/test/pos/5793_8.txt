There was a lot about Little Vera that was strange to me. All in all, I enjoyed this movie, but much of the way the characters behaved was not what I was used to. For example, the environment in which Vera's family lived was very tense. Almost every time the family gathered, they drank, fought or shouted. It was often a combination of the three. After watching the movie, I felt tense because of all the confrontation that took place. However, I was very interested in the story of this middle-class Russian family. Throughout the film, we are reminded of the industrialized state of Russia because of the repeated shots of a train passing the screen. This gave the viewer a sense of mechanical life. The characters focused on the lives of their lives through work and drinking after work. There was no sense of happiness throughout the film. The only time a character did not shout was when Vera first fell in love with her fiance Sergei. It was very short-lived because the viewer later discovered (after Sergei Vera's father locked in a bathroom and Vera let him go, after which the father Sergei stabbed) that he was offensive. Once again Vera is told that the only reason she was born, so the family could get a bigger apartment. It is very interesting to see how both Vera and the family could handle each other's behavior. The film was definitely worth watching because of its portrayal of life in areas of Russia.
