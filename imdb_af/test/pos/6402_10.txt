Agree that it was one of the best episodes of this show. I remember the series and I was in the Florida Keys when the show had its debut. I watched through old videotapes that were "guards" and came across two that had about eight episodes. I finally spent a part of Christmas night (and the next) watching these shows. The singer was Bankie Banx - seeing his name coming on the credits. He is from Anguilla and owns a beach bar called The Dune Preserve. He is a longtime friend of Jimmy Buffett and Bankie's classic song "Still In Paradise" featured on the latest Buffett CD / DVD combo called Live In Anguilla. This is track # 12 on CD 1 and # 8 on the CD. One day I want to see this short-lived series coming to DVD. Keep faith!
