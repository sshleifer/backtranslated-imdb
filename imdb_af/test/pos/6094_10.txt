In a style reminiscent of the best of David Lean, this romantic love story moves across the screen with epic relationships similar to the vast desert regions it sets out. It is a film that indicates that one does not choose love, but rather that it is love that makes the choice, no matter who, where or when; and further that it is a matter of heart that often depends on prevailing circumstances and circumstances. And so is the situation in `The English Patient ', led by Anthony Minghella, the story of two people who discover passion and true love in the most indifferent places and times. It proves that when love is preceded, love finds a way. <br /> <br /> This is World War II; flying above the African desert, Hungarian count Laszlo de Almasy (Ralph Fiennes) is being shot down, his biplane wrong for an enemy plane. And although he survived the accident, he was severely burned. However, to his great fortune, he is saved by a tribal nomads and winds in a hospital. But existing conditions are controlled by war conditions and Almasy soon becomes one of many patients being transported by a convoy to another facility. After reaching Italy, he is too weak and ill to continue, and a Canadian nurse, Hana (Juliette Binoche), will remain with volunteers at a deserted monastery. <br /> <br /> Hana soon discovers that her charge is something of a man of mystery, as Almasy doesn't remember his past, and not even his own name. Considering English, the only clues that show who he is are contained in a book found after his accident, but even as cryptic as Hana's patient. Slowly, however, under the guidance of Hana, Almasy began to remember bits of his life and unfold his story. And his memory is even more helped by the appearance of a mysterious stranger, Caravaggio (Willem Dafoe), who suspects Almasy is the man he was looking for. A man with whom he wants to score. But, Almasy may or may not be the man. Meanwhile, Almasy's memories remain on the surface; memories of a woman he loved, Katherine Clifton (Kristin Scott Thomas) - as well as memories of Katherine's husband, Geoffrey (Colin Firth). And in the mind and body like him, those memories are the only ones he can cling to with any hope, even though she lives with every passing moment. <br /> <br /> In addition to directing, Anthony Minghella also wrote the script for this film, which he adapted from the novel by Michael Ondaatje. The result is an epic saga presented in the tradition of Lean's "Doctor Zhivago" and "Lawrence of Arabia"; A wonderful movie that fills the screen and the senses with unprecedented grandeur and beauty. Simply put, Minghella's film is genius aware; produce and deliver with a poetic perfection, and see what it looks like to see a Monet come alive. From the opening frames, Minghella throws a hypnotic play about his audience that is binding and transported. With a story that has an emotional beauty that is similar to the impressive, beautiful and vibrant images brought to life by John Seale's remarkable cinematography; images that almost fill the screen as well as the soul of the viewer. In every sense, it is a film of rare eloquence, with a remarkable emotional capacity that facilitates a truly transcendental experience. Nominate in twelve categories, it receives a total of nine Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Supporting Actress (Binoche) and Cinematography. <br /> <br /> If one had to choose a single word for the essence of this movie it would be "excellence". However, even an extraordinary film does not receive nine Oscars with no extraordinary performances; and the performances of Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas exceed the term "Oscar worthy". Nomination for best actor for his portrayal of Almasy (Geoffrey Rush got the gold for Shine), Fiennes has never been better, and has reached an emotional depth with his character almost tangible. Private and introspective, Almasy is not, of course, an individual for whom the audience can form an intimate connection; However, Fiennes finds a way to make that emotional just enough to let you in, so you can entertain the honest passion in his heart. And it works. Almasy does not seek your friendship; He will also receive your compassion. <br /> <br /> Kristen Scott Thomas also received an Oscar Best Actress nomination (Frances McDormand received the "Fargo" award for her depiction of Katherine, a woman whose Stoic presence masks the emotional her devastated conflict, born of the forbidden passion that enslaved her and gave her voluntarily, cast off her suppression chains to embrace a love so strongly that it threatened to eat. The reserve Katherine must maintain the empathy of the audience because Scott Thomas successfully exploits the emotional depths of her character with the greatest possible effect. It is the kind of show that attracts you and holds you, and takes you as it does above the curtain of hypocrisy that dictates just to be for the sake of appearances, and lets you experience a true sense of unbridled passion. Binoche gives a beautiful, influential performance, as well as the sad nurse, Hana; it is her humanity, in fact, that defines love in its purest sense and offers a balanced perspective within the context of the film. Her relationship with Kip (Naveen Andrews) gives us a look at passion of a different kind, which effectively contrasts with its intensity between Almasy and Katherine. "The English Patient" is a movie that will move you and fill you emotionally; one that you do not want to see. 10/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
