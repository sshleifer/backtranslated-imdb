Thanks for this movie. It is a document of talent that has appeared even more unique and rare in retrospect three decades later. <br /> <br /> The music is just extraordinary, with so much talent in writing, execution, arrangement and production that it is absolute. contagious. The lyrics and vocal arrangements are incredible. The performances by undervalued talents like Nell Carter and Ren Woods increase my mind every time I hear it. While the movie may be different from the stage version, I prefer the soundtrack to the movie, which I find really rarer and underdeveloped. Here, the arrangements are completed and extended to dynamic pieces that could not be produced in a stage environment. <br /> <br /> But the music is not the only thing exceptional about this movie. The compilation of almost hyper-realistic dialogue scenes (reminds me of Altman movies) with exuberant musical and dance numbers really works. All the talent in this movie - directing, writing, photography, editing, music, choreography, casting, acting, costumes, artistic direction - perfectly blend in to one of the best music movies I've seen. <br /> <br /> I think it's amazing how much we know about the characters in "Hair" based on very little information or intrigue. They are not signed as caricatures, but as realistic and many human beings. We see some screens from where they come from, but the portrait is completed by vignettes drawing the characters on the surface through acting, directing and editing. There is an underlying theme of the misogyny of Berger and Hud clinging their characters by exposing their reckless macho-hippie ideology. The scene of Berger's home life reveals important details about his psychology, and the brief look of Claude's home tells us volumes about his background through the simple, realistic and true interaction between Claude and (presumably) his father. <br /> <br /> I like fashion in this movie. It combines sixties ideas with about 70's. (One must overlook the hair extensions of Treat Williams ...). This is a document of how chic many of the late seventies were, as opposed to the conventional wisdom that the era was all about bad taste. Claude's beige knit tie was a hot trend in 1979, and the hair and clothes of the singers and dancers (especially those in the white in the Central Park scene) mixed the decades in a way that timelessly the musical themes proposal. These elements coincide with Twyla Tharpe's extraordinary, state-of-the-art choreography in a way that enriches both the artistry. <br /> <br /> "Hair" is not a film that rewards cynicism. If you come up with expectations, you will probably be held captive by artists who are not bound by your rules. For me, it opened my eyes and ears and mind for an insightful and passionate musical dialogue about war, friendship and family that exceeded its time and still meaningful and relevant to me to this day.
