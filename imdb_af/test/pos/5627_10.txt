The subject of this movie may be depressed: a man of thirty, without work, little education, three children of a failed relationship, living in his parents' home, but with a dream of directing films. But about half an hour in the movie you realize that Mark Borchardt has a bottomless supply of drive and ambition - it's just that it's all in his need to direct movies, and nothing else will make him happy. The movie is jumping over the emotional spectrum, but eventually you get away happy because you just got some wonderful people. Go see it - you will eventually want it to be longer.
