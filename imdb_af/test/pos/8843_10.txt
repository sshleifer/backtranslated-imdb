It's one of the most outstanding horror movies I've ever seen in my life. Forget the exorcist and all the other hype horror movies out there. John Carpenter made a tour-the-force horror epic with great special effects great performances by Kurt Russell and fellow and a good soundtrack that will haunt you forever! The biggest thing about this movie after 17 years is that it's not dated, it looks fresh and new and you don't get as many movies as this. In 1982, it was against E.T. and of course it broke and was a boxing bomb. Over the years, the thing has followed a cult of video and t.v sales and so many new fans. In the end, this movie kicks ass and for me it's never a loss, it's the edge to scare your pants and make me a horror movie. Long live John Carpenter !!
