Andaz Apna Apna is a movie I estimate and its one movie, I don't mind seeing at any time ... almost anytime! This movie is simply wonderful and I think the funniest movie I've ever seen! And yes, I'm talking about Hera Pheri ... reason? Hera Pheri has scenes you will see, but Andaz Apna Apna? Impossible! Simple because every scene is a scene you need to watch! Aamir & Salman shares great chemistry and is perfect in their shoes, but I will place the characters in order of favorite: <br /> <br /> Rank # 1. Crime Master Gogo (Shakti Kapoor's best performance to date and yes, Gogo is an innocent character who is part of the famous Mogambo family (India's fame) Crime Master Gogo is actually Mogambo's cousin, but for Mogambo he is more than a responsible, attractive, charismatic, sweet boy Gogo, making the biggest mistake of life by issuing 36,000 rupees to Teja (which is like Balla once said, "A Fraud and a Cheat!") Now Gogo's only goal is to return get what he is and in his journey to recover his lost money, Gogo realizes that there are more than 36,000 he has to reach and thus begins ... Gogo's fight against the sinner world. /> <br /> Rank # 2. Teja (Teja Main Hoon, Mark Idhar Hai!): Teja is an evil character who is Ram Gopal's Bajaj's twin, originally named Shyam Gopal Bajaj, ki es Teja his name to adjust his personality. Teja, as a child, has already impressed his brother and then one day things got worse when his father gave Ram all his wealth. Teja decided to kill his father, but in the darkness of the night, Munshi killed Harish Chandra (Raveena's father) instead, but Teja did not boast. Teja's only mission now is to somehow get his property back and start his own Poultry & Bakery Farm. Teja must also repay the loan back to Gogo (but has no intention of doing so). To achieve his evil goals, Teja has two people: Robert (Vijay Khote, who is very good at striving) and Balla (Shahzad Khan, Ajit's clone and son ... who is a very clever boy!) <Br /> <br /> Rank # 3. Amar (Aamir Khan): To marry the rich heiress Raveena, he sells his father's inexpensive salon and goes out to Mumbai. Amar has no problem caring for the big business that Raveena's father will hand over to their wedding and is willing to give his luck and move to London. <br /> <br /> Rank # 4. Prem Salman Khan): After Gogo, Prem is the second most innocent character to appear in the movie, and the way Amar tries to use him in the mask of a friend, is tragic. <br /> <br /> I have "I reveal more characters because Jesus Christ! I just didn't want to stop typing! That movie is amazing! Get the DVD now and watch out for the cheap VCDs, as they have omitted very good scenes from the movie. <br /> <br /> The background music is stud and the action is better than the Matrix, especially the final between Prem and Crime Master Gogo (watch out for it), it seems in the climax. Andaz Apna Apna is also a drama with many negative and positive characters and teaches us a lot about life and values ​​and ethics. It teaches us bravery (why would Amar ask Prem to stay back when they meet the kidnapper, even though Prem complained he should go to the toilet?). Andaz Apna Apna is also a tragedy, especially the screens where Salman is targeted by Aamir and overdose of gastrointestinal pills. The part where Teja reveals his sad feelings about why he couldn't go to London and the part where Gogo was arrested in the end, without even getting his 36 000 back. Andaz Apna Apna is generally a complete package .... sit back and enjoy the ride! There will then be a second ride, and then a third! <br /> <br /> The movie was once again considered a flop and I'm sure no one likes it, but is playing the game! This movie is a big hit! Even if it didn't have enough people to come to the cinema, the movie is one of the top selling DVDs and one of the most movies on most channels, so producers have been laughing back to the shore!
