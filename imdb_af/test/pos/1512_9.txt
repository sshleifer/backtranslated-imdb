Fulci is one of my all-time favorite Italian striker directors. He is also a very good storyteller who blends horror, supernatural and psychedelic themes. This film was really his last big story before addressing such disappointments as "Voices From Beyond". The story is simple because Fulci plays himself, a horror director. After years of filming, splashing and filthy movies, Fulci seems to be starting a breakdown in which he begins to sneak over people slaughtered. He decides to see a psychiatrist who only worsens things if he convinces Fulci that he is killing people. <br /> <br /> Fulci uses many screens from several photos around the same time. These movies believe I didn't aim, but definitely produced. Some of these movies are "Massacre" directed by Andrea Bianchi (Cemetery), "Touch of Death" by Fulci, "The Murders Secret" and I can't remember the rest of the movies. <br /> <br /> Nightmare Concert is a very underrated movie, even by Fulci fans. But I loved this movie and have watched it many times. It's sad that Fulci didn't get the chance to win this after, but it's a good movie and I recommend it to any Fulci fan, whether you like it or not. 9/10 stars
