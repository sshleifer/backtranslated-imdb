The outsiders are undoubtedly a classic Australian TV series. Well-defined characters, sturdy scripts, varied and interesting places, great guest stars and a cinematic atmosphere all combined to make this series a special one. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Andrew Keir has succeeded & & Sascha Hehn from Germany does not appear (unfortunately) to enjoy small screen success in his native country. The ABC repeated the series many times, but a DVD edition doesn't yet have to happen. <br /> <br /> The series is one that is timeless. It's so likely today to make a resonant chord with viewers as it did in its own day. Come on ABC ... release the outsiders to DVD !!!!!
