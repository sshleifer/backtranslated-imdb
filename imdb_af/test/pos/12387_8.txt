I suppose this movie is not your typical Spanish thriller, because it is based on a true story that happened abroad. The film is based on the true story of French man Jean-Claude Romand, and the real thing is much more dirty and frightening than the movie. In the true story of Mr. Romand did not escape the family. After years of lying he decided to end it all by killing his wife, two children, parents and dogs. Although he tried to kill himself, he didn't seem to be "I try very hard as he survived. I talked to me about the movie how it could never happen in real life, that all these lies were unnoticed, I laughed while I read the book about Mr. Romand read and knew it had happened. I like Jos√© Coronado in this movie and offer us a good performance, like the rest of the crew.
