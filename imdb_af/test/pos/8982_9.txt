Mike Nichols in the best shape. I was not a fan of 'Closer', so it is refreshing to see him right back with this comedy in the darkest of circumstances. Only one slip in the scene could have ruined this compelling picture, but Nichols and his strong A list never made a mistake in this biopic of a deeply defective but totally compelling congressman. <br /> <br /> Philip Seymour Hoffman as usual is brilliant and brilliant - here is a damaged but ultra-smart CIA manipulator, and it is in the exchange between Hanks and Hoffman's characters where the comedy is rising. Rare is movie humor very hard and clever. It mocks at times with a biting satirical edge that makes you both laugh and weep in the state of the world (often simultaneously). <br /> <br /> Another big plus is the length of the picture. The film is based on George Crile's thick book of the same title. The temptation for screenwriter Aaron Sorkin (his demand for fame is "The West Wing") should have been to make a fat movie, but what we get is a breathtaking 90 odd minutes of a big story with great implications. <br /> <br /> This movie deserves to be seen and recognized for finding an extraordinary balance between the darkest of the dark subject and the light touch of its sparkling, scary writing - even if it is obvious link between the help provided by Herring and Wilson and the ultimate consequences (9/11).
