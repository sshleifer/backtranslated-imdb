This movie is excellent. Not because it does something special or new, but because it's consistently big in all its parts. No part is a groundbreaking or a star, but all parts are far above mediocre and it makes me an excellent movie. <br /> <br /> I own several copies of this movie, and can one day get it on collectors DVD or Blu-Ray (now, because of high blu-ray prices, and of course the face I don't have, a blu-ray player ... but this is the point of this review). <br /> <br /> It's kind of ordinary, but quickly turns into a drama full of excitement, action, strong characters, and a good overall plot that interests you until the very end. <br /> <br /> Wait, no, it doesn't start normal. <br /> <br /> It starts like a Qun. Tar. movie wants to be. With a wonderful scene where an attempt to buy coffee and donuts goes ... very, very wrong. <br /> <br /> By the end of the movie there was nothing like it, and some people were dead, and a few people were very rich. I won't tell you who ... look and enjoy! Overall Rating: 10/10, A **, Excellent!
