It's the first movie I've ever seen in Singapore and it's great. If you don't know much about Asia, its languages ​​and its culture, then this movie may be a bit confusing to the uninformed people. As an Asian American, who has doubled in two Asian languages ​​(one of them Mandarin) and has taken some Asian American Studies classes, this movie was easier to understand, but even without that kind of knowledge, I believe This movie is still accessible to its foreign audiences as long as you keep in mind that it's a kind of coming age. The movie is definitely worth seeing just so you get the chance to see what kind of problems Singapore's young teenage struggle and has to deal with. It's a great movie that comes of age but filmed and shown in a more artistic and original way. The actors are outstanding.
