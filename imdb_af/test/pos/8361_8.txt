Like a lot of twilight zone episodes, one of my favorite parts of this one was the overt social comment Serling made with the story. As was the case with a recent episode "The Howling Man", I was reminded of my long suspicion that, for example, if Jesus were to come to earth to bring His followers to Heaven, He would immediately be spirit and probably cast. in an asylum. Our main character in this episode meets a similar problem when we try to convince the 1860s Americans that he is from the future and that President Lincoln is about to be murdered. The episode claims wrong that this means that some parts of the past can be changed while others cannot, but it's a fun time to travel. Nonetheless, we do not know for a fact whether history can be changed by time travel, because time travel has never been reached and will never be. But it seems logical to me that if you could physically put yourself in a time of the past, you could physically prevent something, as long as you didn't walk like a crazy murder cry. <br /> <br /> One of the consistently interesting things about time series movies and TV shows, in my opinion, is the method by which time travel takes place. There is really no method here, our main character has a talk about time travel at a fine gentlemen's club and then walks outside and in a solution from the early 1960s to the middle of the 1860s, but doesn't matter. The twilight zone has so far not hit me for its complex sets or high production values. <br /> <br /> Russell Johnson plays part of Peter Corrigan, the timekeeper, and after discovering that he has somehow been transported back to The exact day of Lincoln's assassination, he controls himself in jail but, fortunately for him, John Wilkes Booth, for one reason or another, only hanged at the police station and heard that the madman Corrigan was urgently trying to describe the assassination. That Booth was planning that night. <br /> <br /> Booth oversees Corrigan for some psychiatric experiments, and the police officer sees nothing wrong with overseeing this man. He did have a business card, how bad could he be? <br /> <br /> The show turns out that you can change people's lives by changing past events through time travel, and while I'm not willing to accept that time, such restrictions would include it is still a fun episode that really makes you think, which is one of my favorite features of good dusk sunshine ...
