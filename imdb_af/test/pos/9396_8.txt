I'm not sure what I can add that has not yet been said in some of this other fine, and rather hilarious, comments, but I try. <br /> <br /> So you know the plot: there is a bed owned by a devil who "absorbs" and selectively disintegrates the bodies of (or whatever) on it, with his orange soda-filled body . We've got the guy, in some scenes, looking carelessly like Robert Smith or The Cure, hanging inside the wall, and we're having different victims who can withstand the ease of this mystical bed. <br /> <br /> It's no ordinary bed. No sirree Bob! Not only do they eat people, but clean it up themselves, pull back the lids, and even make them. Who doesn't want such a bed? It can even use its sheets as a rudimentary "lasso" to use the refugee victims, especially if they take half the film to escape. <br /> <br /> Our "main" story (if you can name it) is about these three girls going to this remote area to sit home. I don't remember exactly, but it doesn't really matter, because there are many things that defend the convention you just have to give and accept. The dialogue in the movie is like no other; The characters seem to talk to each other through telepathy, as their mouths never seem to move and there is a constant echo. One of our girls believes she does not like the rest of the "gang" and makes sure we tell all her feelings about it through an echo over us, but we don't care. character development has been thrown out of the window a long time before in this movie so why start now? There are scenes when the bed is laughing, snoring, crunches, and several other sounds that we suppose to judge by our favor's non-response to these sounds cannot be heard. This and the telepathy make the issue of the mind very difficult to determine ... but it's OK .... it's Deadbed: The Bed that eats, and it defends all logic so it's good. It makes a lively, dream quality for this most bizarre movie. If you buy (he buys ... I said, buy?) This DVD, make sure the director investigates its introduction. He stated that the filming of this "flick" started in 1972, did not apply until 1977. He has sold it for a few years with no success, and then quickly forward 26 years to 2003 it is released on DVD. There is supposedly someone pushing somewhere in another country here, and it started after a bootleg and it was by chance, on a message board, no less, that our director showed evidence that people knew and grab! cares about his little-known movie. It is from then on that he decided to give it a shot and release it. I'm glad he did. If you even heard the title of this movie, you should see it. I'll buy one of these, and I'm going to preach his gospel over the world ... start with this comment
