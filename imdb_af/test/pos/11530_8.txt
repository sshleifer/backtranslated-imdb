It was 1969. Phoebe (Camilla Belle) is an 11-year-old girl who grows up with an idealized vision of her 19-year-old sister Faith (Cameron Diaz). Faith is the doer, the seeker of truth, the looser of all the iniquities in the world. Then Phoebe and her mother Gail (Blythe Danner) one day received word that Faith is dead. Faith has killed herself. Both Phoebe and Gail are overwhelmed by this news and, though sad, Gail grieves. Phoebe can't let it go. Phoebe decides to go to Europe and find out what happened. <br /> <br /> It is now 1977. Phoebe (Jordana Brewster) is 18 and decides to go to Europe about her mother's objections to discover the truth. When he lived, faith was inseparable from a man who called his "Wolf" (Christopher Eccleston). Although Wolf claimed to know nothing of Faith's last days, Phoebe persuaded him to tell her everything. Within a few days, Wolf realized that he had not left the past and joined Phoebe during her pilgrimage to Portugal. <br /> <br /> In the end, Wolf can tell of Faith's proper drug abuse and his own fault not to prevent suicide. Although angry, Phoebe finally realized how human and fragile faith really was. <br /> <br /> I like this movie. I'm old enough to remember the bank robberies of the Red Army and I was 10 in 1969. This story was known to me. I can still remember that young men are trying to decide whether to go to Canada or not to avoid the concept. <br /> <br /> The story is simple, but has probably happened several times in real life. Camilla Belle was fun and fun to watch as she portrays the young adorable sister who was excited about what was happening around her. Jordana Brewster easily went into the role of parent Phoebe. Blythe Danner was unfortunately the ever-supporting mother, a role she's already known to American TV. I'd love to see her with stronger material to work with. Cameron Diaz played the immature anarchist perfectly. Although his actions of a 1960s activist at times were a news role. Of all the characters, it was Christopher Eccleston's Wolf, who made the most growth. When we are introduced to the character at the beginning of the film, we can see that he is a worldly person. He is a patient and friendly man who is angry with the world's iniquities. In the end, he realizes the direction that he and Faith have undergone, is wrong and begins to grow up and decides that he must fight his own fight against injustice. Faith refuses to join him and it eventually leads to her death. Eccleston's Wolf is the best of all characters. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie. It was pleasant and thought-provoking. "The invisible circus" has been named TV-MA, but there is very little curse, sex or violence in it. The subject of the movie is the reason for the rating.
