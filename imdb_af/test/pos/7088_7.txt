The DVD jacket in which this movie came, describes it as "fuss and humorous." It's not the words I would have chosen - not long. I would choose a word like "gloomy", sometimes even "depressed". It is not to say that it is a bad movie. It is actually a pretty good movie, with good performances of the lead, with enough uncertainty about everything going on at the end you keep watching. The uncertainty comes from the structure of the movie - it seems as if Ellen's memories of her mother's slow death of cancer are being questioned by the DA. So, we know from the beginning that something has become suspicious in the end - the questions are "what?" and "who?" <br /> <br /> Renee Zellweger was very good like Ellen - the somewhat furious daughter who had to stop her life and work in New York from returning to her sick mother. Ellen developed through the film - moreso as any other character - as she learns to handle the strengths and weaknesses of her parents. Her relationship with her father (William Hurt) is very interesting. My initial impression was that they were very close, but the warts in the relationship started after a while. Hurt was effective as the freestanding man - did not detach in an unpleasant way, but in the sense that he could not handle what happened to his wife and escaped in different ways. Eventually, Meryl Streep, as the cancer-related Kate, was very convincing in trying to live out what the remains of her life were in the most fulfilling way possible, and then dealing with the rage she felt at her increasing weakening. Somehow, I saw a little "Ordinary People", a family action with these kinds of crises, although this movie was much less emotionally intense. So, not "exciting and humorous" (with all the respect for who wrote the synopsis on the DVD jacket) but very well in his own way. 10/07
