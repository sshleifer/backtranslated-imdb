The creative team of Jim Abrahams, David Zucker and Jerry Zucker had their roots in improvisational theater in Madison, Wisconsin. I believe it was. They had a group called "Kentucky Fried Theater" (or something similar). They put a lot of their pieces on celluloid as "KENTUCKY FRIED MOVIE" (1977), which was long, relentless, sophomoric and very funny. <Br /> <br /> They followed up with the very popular, AIRPLANE! (1980), which they really put on the map. In it, they took a few well-known veteran actors in Robert Stack and especially Leslie Nielsen and placed them in prominent roles. They have begun to parody every click of each aviation film since the days of John Wayne's (Batjac) Production of the HOW AND THE POWER (1954). * Bags filled with cash and now noticed, the trio made an agreement with Pramount Television and the US broadcasting television network to show a half-hour comedy spoof of the almost innumerable Police Crime drama that has over the years and went back to our television screens. Remember the fine work Mr. Leslie Nielsen used AIRPLANE !, he was thrown in the lead. <br /> <br /> As Sgt / Lt. / Captain Frank Drebbin (the rankings switch is one of their comic bits), he presented a large series of consecutive word games, siggats, non-successors and remaining police / crime cliches. All of these are merged with some, seemingly standard scripts. In addition, exaggerated dramatic opening narration is expressed on information that contradicts the visual printed information. They always used it to give the title of the episode titles, where voice and print titles never match. <br /> <br /> They had a good musical score, which would have been somewhat exaggerated, would have passed by theme and coincidence. music in a straight drama. The musical score, the opening titles and the format of the episodes included in Law I, Law II, Epilogue, etc. divided, were all part of obvious, but loving, ribbing of QM (Quinn Martin) Productions. (They even had the same presenter as the real Q.M.'s.) <br /> <br /> One thing that this short of a series didn't have was a technically increased audience. And, boy, they probably don't need a fake channel. The nature of the spoof was such that it required the viewer's close, almost undivided attention, and that was the ultimate reason for the downfall of POLICE SQUAD. <br /> <br /> With regard to the series of cancellations, an ABC management explained. that the episodes "... attracted too much attention from the viewer." So, isn't that what you want? <br /> <br /> So, after just 6 wonderful, hilarious episodes, the POLIS has SQUAD! After the aftermath of the series's cancellation, only to be born again in the NAKED GUN. trilogy, made for the big screen in movie houses. Once again, they did well at the Box Office. Oh yes, TV's loss is Cinema's profit, thanks to your Mr. Idiot TV Exec! <br /> <br /> * THE HEIGHT AND POWER was produced by the Duke's own Batjac Productions and released by Warner Brothers. It was unavailable for a number of years and eventually Mr. Wayne's family made arrangements to drop it on television and video.
