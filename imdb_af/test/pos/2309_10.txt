especially when you look at the amount of crap it has made on DVD. I found this movie very funny. Rip Torn is classic with its hair; Rob Schneider as hilariously annoying as the over-compensating Ensign; Bruce Dern makes a big "villain". The whole belt has an explosion, and it is not at the expense of the audience. If you just want a fun comedy and don't look too deep in meaning, just fall in love with this one.
