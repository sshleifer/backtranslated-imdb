Sorry to repeat myself over and over, but here's another good Columbo episode. I think that's why I'm such a fan - most episodes are really great! The best episodes have always been a striking feature, and in this case the killer and his accomplice may be the latest ever Columbo villains. Having watched many episodes where Columbo and his opponent performed good friends, it is nice to see an episode where tempo and bad feelings rise to the surface. It just gives an episode a little more drama and bite. Columbo is quick on the fact that the two students claiming to help him do not laugh at him secretly and give him false clues. He plays happily together, intentionally turning the bumbling in front of them to underestimate them! But of course he knows right away when they talk. <br /> <br /> The murder itself is another complicated one, according to the Bye Bye Sky High IQ episode, with a sophisticated chain reaction of events that succeed in killing the intended target while the assassins with apparent waterproofing alibi is provided. In the intervening years between 1978 and 1990, the technology of record players and firecrackers shifted to adjustable car locking systems and hidden cameras. <br /> <br /> Stephen Caffrey puts in a good performance as Justin Rowe, the unpleasant, spoiled student. Gary Hershberger is a low key, but good as his "yes man" friend Cooper Redman. And it's nice to see Robert Culp as Mr. Rowe, Justin's dad. <br /> <br /> A very satisfying episode in every way.
