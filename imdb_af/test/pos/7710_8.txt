The detective story is not typical of the Matrix universe. It is a film-noir-like private eye story, with a strong narrator and a very rich feel. Rich, in terms of his visual appeal. The snow screens, the grainyiness, bump it all. <br /> <br /> But what about the story? It's interesting, even if it feels a bit out of place. The agents hire a private detective to find Trinity. He found out that they had tried the approach before, but with dangerous consequences for the rented detectives. Yet he tries to find her and eventually succeed, through Alice in Wonderland references and hackers and classrooms. Then things get interesting. <br /> <br /> All in all, it's a perfect, short, animated movie. <br /> <br /> 8/10
