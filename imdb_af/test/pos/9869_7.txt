Although I accidentally brought this movie (I thought it was the original Halloween (stupid eh!)) I was surprised at how good it was, many persecutors just kept the events of the previous movies. However, it tried and managed to explain the events of the prequels, why Michael Myers killed people and how he seems to have supernatural abilities. I thought it was a top horror movie full of action, excitement and surprises, I'm very glad I brought it. I gave it 9 out of 10.
