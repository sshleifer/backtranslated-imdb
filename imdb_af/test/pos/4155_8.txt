"Nuovomondo (2006)" (shown in the US as "The Golden Door") was written and directed by Emanuele Crialese. This film is different - and I think better - than most movies about impoverished people leaving Europe and coming to the United States. <br /> <br /> The film begins with scenes in a poor, rural region of Sicily. We always hear that Sicily is a rocky island, but you won't really understand the implications of that phrase until you see the first half of the "Golden Door". <br /> <br /> The middle part of the film is dedicated to the long journey to the US. Most immigration films show us ten minutes of people in the third-class section getting seasick and then showing us the Statue of Liberty. Not this movie - we get a feel for life under the covers, and it's not charming. (We don't actually see the Statue of Liberty either.) Finally, the typical movie will give us another ten minutes from Ellis Island, and then the immigrants will pass through the Lower East Side of New York. Not here - the experience of Ellis Island is about one third of the footage. <br /> <br /> Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as Salvatore Mancuso, bringing his two sons and his mother to the new world. Charlotte Gainsbourg is as good as Lucy Reed, a mysterious English woman who also speaks fluent Italian. <br /> <br /> There are some strange touches in the movie, especially the soundtrack with songs by Nina Simone. There must be some symbolism, but I couldn't make sense. <br /> <br /> Another reviewer has already pointed out that this movie would look better in a theater rather than on DVD. Yet, big screen or small screen, it's worth looking out for.
