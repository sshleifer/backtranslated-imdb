The plot is somewhat original, and all the actors did their job well. There is also a lot of comic relief. Some things don't make much sense (eg, the first "chase" scene, why wouldn't the heroine just hide somewhere and wait for the bad things to leave?). The Russians actually speak Russian without accent, but the cars are extremely strange, with models stretching like 50 years, and so the place looks strange. Overall, if you like thrillers, you'll probably also like this one.
