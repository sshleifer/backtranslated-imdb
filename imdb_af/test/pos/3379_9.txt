GREAT, Chris Diamantopoulos has to be the best Robim Williams I've ever seen. He does it perfectly. It was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and was. It almost made me cry to see him. <br /> <br /> I didn't know Robin was so close to a friend like John Belushi. The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could be almost on its own merits. Very sad, what did they both go through. <br /> <br /> I really felt for Val and Robin during his difficult times. I'm glad they ended up in a high note. <br /> <br /> I hope Robin puts a $ 100 account in this man's hat! <br /> <br /> And it was great that it was filmed in Vancouver!
