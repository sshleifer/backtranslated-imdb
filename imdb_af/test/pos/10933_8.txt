8 points for starting probably, which is really good, maybe, the more it was. American Indians probably more saved than killed. Who really knows? Much slower, strange pursuit means it's a fit and ... interesting and unique. Fortunately, there are no other thoughts. I thought it would suck first, I turned up to be wrapped up ... nice treasure ... good work! I hope nobody is dissecting this movie. When the whole movie unfolds, you have very unique twists, impossible to determine what will be next. The characters are human and have either honor or not ... passion or not ... forgiveness or not. Acquired with the love of the White Horse, the Indian, Sheen, even the ruined desert. All good.
