I'm so glad I tied this movie when it came to the BBC last month! It always blew me, so tired and real. David Tennant is absolutely fantastic in this, though his character is not always easy to hold or identify. The final scene where he plays the song just broke my heart, those eyes. <br /> <br /> I guess he made this movie between the Dr. Who made that, and it makes it even more of a performance for me. I just love dr. Who and what I saw absolutely nothing of him in Mr. Tennant's portrayal of this man who knows he is changing and struggling to create a kind of new identity and life. <br /> <br /> Great little intense drama!
