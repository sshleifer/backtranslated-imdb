Many experienced and excellent actors blended each other in an ongoing plot of an unprecedented part of World War II on the eastern side. Characters well portrayed and memorable. One episode leaves your wish for the next. Note the closing credits where the thousands of Shtrafbat battalions are listed. An unprecedented story involving hundreds of thousands of individuals. Sometimes brutal, sometimes romantic, always filled with real people and dialogue. Produced with excellent sets and camera work. Heroes and villains, criminals and priests, patriots and traitors. Portrait of people struggling to survive and overcome awful time. I want to buy a copy for my own collection so I can enjoy the series repeatedly.
