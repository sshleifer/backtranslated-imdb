Should you never miss the good old days if Disney actually made movies that really moved you? Growing up with Disney I always caught myself by the characters. Each one was really talented and knew how to act through a movie. I remember on Friday night and running to switch on the TV just to watch their latest movies. Susie Q was one of my all-time favorites. I never forgot this movie. Even today, when you call the song "Susie Q", I always remember the movie. If someone thinks of this movie I promise you, you will fall in love with it. I don't think I'll ever forget it. You won't regret seeing it. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, it is sad to see Disney movies like "The Hannah Montana Movie". What ever happened to Disney?
