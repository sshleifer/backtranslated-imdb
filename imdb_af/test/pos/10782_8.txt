Oliver Stone, always ready to make political-themed films, make another one here. "Talk Radio" is loosely based on the career of Alan Berg, a radio talk show host in Denver murdered by white supremacists. In this case, the character Barry Champlain (Eric Bogosian), an outspoken talk show host in Dallas, loves nothing more than irritating the people who call. As it is, most people calling are a bunch of pig racists. And things can be heated more than anyone realizes. <br /> <br /> Bogosic's performance brings a light comical tone to an otherwise serious movie. I really like the scene where he calls on a redhead calling. I won't ever mention this Oliver Stone's best movie, but it's a good reference in an era when media is increasingly concentrated. Good performances by Ellen Greene and Alec Baldwin also help.
