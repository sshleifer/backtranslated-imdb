I was captivated by Niami's debut. I hope we'll see more of his work soon. I was fortunate enough to catch the movie during his short NYC race and it has made me a worthy successor to such downtown 80's flicks like Desperately Seeking Susan and After Hours, but with a gentle European whimsey that made it fresh and fun has. A strong ensemble game that mostly plays against type was a pleasure. And I thought the complex inter-threaded plots were just right. Sandra Bernhard is in her best performance since King of Comedy, while Peter Stormare is hilarious and touching Ling Bai. See it.
