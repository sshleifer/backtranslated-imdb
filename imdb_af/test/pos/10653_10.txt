the movie touches the soul of the audience, a play in the movie is finally and tears come out automatically. I am surprised to see this movie that any director can direct this type of film in the year 1925. As a student of cinema I can say this movie helps a lot to understand the use of montage. first time our teacher told us about this movie, genre of this movie, we thought there could be nothing in this movie to understand, but eventually when sir explained it, we came to know how well this movie is. Lastly, I can say it helps a lot to understand movies. And as a film student, I can see the viewers watching this movie.
