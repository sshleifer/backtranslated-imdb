I saw the Sea Within today and I loved it. The actors of the movie are wonderful (especially Javier Bardem, of course), but I thought Beléne Rueda would play a better role. Lola Dueñas, Clara Segura and especially Mabel Rivera make excellent interpretations. And I can't forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau (brother and father of the protagonist). <br /> <br /> There are two technical aspects that I love: Aguirresarobe's photography and the Amenábar score. I liked Luz Casal's song "Negra sombra" ("Dark Shadow") with music by Carlos Núñez. <br /> <br /> In short, I think the Spanish Academy should choose The Sea Within. To compete in the Academy Awards. I like other Spanish productions, such as Almodóvar's Bad Education, but Amenábar's film is much better than them. "The sea inside" deserves all the awards.
