After watching John, I presented this one of a kind show. I had to share it ..... It was really something to watch a grown man portraying himself as a child. I like the fact that with every character he has become, you can give a picture of what it looks like. It is more entertaining when you can understand the individual. "Freak" is what the right "stand up" should be. John is really talent.
