I saw the first one when it was first shown, so I'm not too objective about it. It really got me done, partly because it was so late at night, but partly because of the whole feeling of a video tracking story (the same thing that Dark Shadows helped himself). And the throw was so right. I hardly know Shane Briant of anything else, so it may not be the case to throw HIM well, but to me he is Dorian Gray. And as far as the other male actors, the one who fits so well was Nigel Davenport (who is so good for "bigger than life" characters) than Sir Henry. And John Karlen, a kind of Dan Curtis repertoire player, then, due to Dark Shadows. As one poster shows, this version can include the involvement of men in a fairly subtle way. The scene where Dorian repeated a list of men's names to John Karlen's character, as a way to humiliate him, and the appearance of Karlen's face, was very well done. (If the scene is done now, it will probably be done in a FOLLOWING way, and badly compared.) I saw it when Dorian Gray was almost a name for me, let alone more so even more as the famous 1945 version (which is rightly known), this is the version for me.
