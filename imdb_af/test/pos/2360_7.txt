Black Day Blue Night was actually a good modern noir. Three young nomadis who are off their own lives make something of a road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere (like most modern noirs). One woman finds her husband cheating on her and after finding himself in a hotel room, decides to go down and start again. Strangely, she travels with her husband's mistress, who can be forgiven, since the sleazebag never told her he was married. And together, as they drive into the rainfall, they meet a third, very mysterious young man with a suitcase of secrets. While they are deceitful and free and all suspicious, the policemen were returned to the town as suspects in the death of a policeman. <br /> <br /> Black Day Blue Night begins with immediate confrontation, and throws in a pretty good story with all its twists meant to deceive your suspicions from one character to another, leading to a very unusual ending . The film begins with immediate action confrontation. And as soon as you think the story is resolved, you are immediately pushed into the plot, which is just a little more predictable than you expected before the movie is over. <br /> <br /> But as some viewers wrote, the end is slightly confusing and a bit of a deviation. The killer is not what you would expect right away, and as soon as it is revealed, it becomes somewhat confusing because of a fairly thin explained jump that reveals all the motives needed to solve the puzzle. But actually there is a final above it, which I think is the most interesting of the movie. Because modern noir always involves a circle of criminal suspects, almost always everyone is guilty of something, it is also a genre that always involves money. And so the question in these movies is always - how far are the characters willing to go for money? <br /> <br /> If you want this version of modern film noir, I suggest watching Red Rock West (it's also JT Walsh and some going-we exploded in the desert)!
