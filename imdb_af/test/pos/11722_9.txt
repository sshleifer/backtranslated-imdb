This is Burt Reynolds' "Citizen Kane". Tragically, nothing else was ever involved. He came near Sharkey's machine. It seemed to me that he had everything he had in it. This is a movie movie with movies. The opening sequence where detective Sharkey saves a busload of hostages one by one is an extremely exciting piece of cinema. Everything moves as fast as it gets wrong, and it looks like it's a life of its own, a brilliant effect. It looks cold, tense and dangerous on Mr. Reynolds streets. The house looks dirty and tired, full of desperate people on both sides of the law, screams, curses, tries to trade or just lives alive. In this underworld, the recently demolished Sharkey is being repulsed - a reward for a bungled drug bust caused by a corrupt policeman - he and his team are part of the subgroup. Information emerging about a crooked politician leads them to the world of high-class call girls and relentless drug barons. Sharkey falls in love with her portrait on the wall (I know, I know) and when a woman's body is found with his face shot in one of the rooms, he thinks it's her. (Well, I said it was a movie that loved movies). The scene she comes in works beautifully, even if you have seen the original. The movie is very good, I especially like Charles Durning's war story, acted subtly and shot in sharp contrast with Sharkey's kidnapping and torture, which is quite loud and brutal. I must call Vittorio Gassman and Henry Silva as two diverse but equally evil brothers with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. They are "full of" every time they are on the screen and when they are time, no loss to society, Mr. Silva's end is indeed extra special. As already mentioned, it is a Clint Eastwood movie that Clint never made. The biggest compliment I can pay for Sharkey's Machine is to point out that Clint Eastwood, I believe, couldn't do better. The soundtrack is of an equally high standard, with Sarah Vaughan, Joe Williams, Julie London, Chet Baker and other top class artists. Randy Crawford's "Street Life" plays behind the title sequence and I can never hear it without seeing in my mind that Sharkey is fighting along the pavement. Like other correspondents, I have never understood why this movie was a little flop. I hope this is due to a critical review, especially in a time when so many cop movies and without a quarter of its energy, freshness and pure joie de Vivre are praised from the rooftops. If you're ever tempted to think of Burt Reynolds as a hidden one trick trick, place "Sharkey's Machine" in your video machine. I promise you won't be disappointed.
