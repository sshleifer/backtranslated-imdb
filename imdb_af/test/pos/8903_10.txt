Wow! it's even better than I expected! the best animated Astérix movie ever! and it feels so good to hear that Roger Carel does the voice of Astérix again! I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves the Astérix comic books! but I suggest you see the French version because it is definitely the best and you hear the original cast! Did you know that Roger Carel had been playing Astérix for nearly forty years? I think he did a wonderful job! and the Céline Dion song at the end fit rally well at the end credits! the music is good, the drawings are good, the actors are great ... in a word: a masterpiece! will see it! You won't regret it!
