Looking at a short one like Boy-Next-Door, I find a kind of bittersweet feeling. On the one hand, I'm happy. I look at something that is well thought out, seamlessly executed and just brave enough to be interesting. On the other hand, I find that I regret the level of comedy that is commonly produced. TV and movies are so consistently packed with easy, condescending shit that we find our excellence within a scale of mediocrity. Then you see someone like Davis, who, without the "benefit" of studio notes or substantial budget; can create a very cool, small comic gem. Producers and network packs have to go to Travis Davis to go there for stuff and stop offering people to merely because their CV or agent may claim them. Hopefully Boy-Next-Door got the attention of the real people to make Davis more work easier. It's really fun and well done!
