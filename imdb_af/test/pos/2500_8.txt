This movie was a sick, sweet, nice romantic comedy, just the kind of movie I don't usually like, but this one was just cute enough to interest me. It was really funny in one moment (probably why I liked it) and then just as serious in the next. Plus, it had Ellen in it and I always had a soft spot for her. <br /> <br /> Basically, the owner of a bookshop, Helen (Kate Capshaw) finds a love letter in one of the old couches in her shop. She thinks it's for her and is crazy to try to find out who sent it. She's kind of shut herself out of the world, so it really throws her out of the loop. Eventually, almost everyone associated with her gets this letter and they all become mixed signals that create some very funny moments. <br /> <br /> As I said, I'm usually not one for this type of movie, but I really did enjoy it and highly recommend it.
