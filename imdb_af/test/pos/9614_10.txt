Released as KING BOXER in the UK <br /> <br /> This movie was essentially the FIRST kung fu movie to generally release in the UK. Many of us have been through Kurosawa's amazing gritty and dramas and have gotten accustomed to shot and lit oriental film, with somewhat limited stimulation, all like moving through an album of very nice photos that just happened. <br /> <br /> Together Run Run Shaw comes along. with their widescreen "home movie" production values, and amazing ripe-for-parody dubbing and all the rules changed. Kung Boxer was the first in the door, and had a clearly marked route for others to follow with their feet planted firmly on the footsteps. <br /> <br /> In spite of hokey plots, pantomime acting, cheese platter cuts and spaghetti western style snap-stepped zooms, this movie was wonderful. Beautiful without being abundant and with the most brilliant combat choreography ever to grace a screen. We loved the sickening violence, the anxiety, the testosterone. The martial artists among us have some of the techniques fascinating, as flamboyant and often silly. It was so much different from the Japanese stuff we all knew, and it has a beautiful acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the sickening violence and blood-stained floors. Delightful. <br /> <br /> At that time, the "Kung Lear" scene was quite a milestone in the shock. "You cruel bastards. My **** !!" Now it's quite less shocking, but still a bit of a gut. <br /> <br /> We didn't realize that any female in sight was absolutely one-dimensional. After seeing more movies from the genre, it now looks like a sore thumb, but at that time it didn't matter <br /> <br /> This movie defined what would quickly click the kung-fu movie. All of them. Look at it and remember that until it bursts on the western screens, there was no genre to include it. It was unique and wonderful. It was the first Kung Fu movie and it is still the best for me and many others.
