It's one of the better Marion Davies talkies - and one of the few to enable her to show off her skill as a physical comedian, which was so special in her silent films. OK, so she does a lot of button number, but even Ruby Keeler's dance from the era doesn't stop for younger generations. The problem here is the writing. The story falls into incredible melodrama in the last line. These are pretty stages and are obviously adapted from a play ... but not good enough. Still, there are some snappy dialogue and slapstick door. A look was made.
