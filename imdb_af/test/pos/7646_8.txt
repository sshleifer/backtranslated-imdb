I like that Armand Assante and my cable company summary was interesting, so I've been watching it twice, and probably again. <br /> <br /> The early part is difficult to follow, but later it becomes clear. I believe the author has done a good job of binding the loose points. <br /> <br /> Some of the plays are unconvincing, but maybe that's because I'm always expecting a kind of double cross. In that case, poor acting people will interact with the infinity of the characters. So it's very good. <br /> <br /> The key theme is the carnival owner (Assante) is laundering for a local casino & his snake-charmer wife (Dagmara Dominczyk) wants to steal it. She complains of "Archie" (Reedus) how terrible her life is, and how he can help her get out of there. <br /> <br /> There are 3 or 4 plots (probably the reason for all those loose points), and just when you think you've solved the riddle, something else will happen. <br /> <br /> My 8/10 score is mostly for the plot. <br /> <br /> I won I say no more, I don't like spoilers, so I don't want to be one, but I believe this movie is worth your time.
