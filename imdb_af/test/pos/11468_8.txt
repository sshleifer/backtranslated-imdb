I found this movie to be enjoyable and acting to watch, and I'm surprised it is so low. Actually, I can see why it is; I think it's the fans of Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano who gave the most of the 1's and 2's, because if you put the tape in the machine expecting you to enjoy watching one or both of these, you may rather be disappointed. Eric appeared for about half an hour at the end of the movie, and Alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half. In those she says little and carries less (although never nude if that's what you're looking for, stick to the embrace of the vampire). Although they are always a pleasure, it's a pity she or Eric doesn't get much screen time, but still gives it a 8. <br /> <br />
