I watched 9 souls in Athens' 12th International Film Festival (September 2006), where Toshiaki Toyoda, the film's director, was also present and answered many questions from the audience. This road movie is about 9 refugees, many different characters from each other. They decide to stay together with their red delivery van over Japan. Every time the bus stops, we see these 9 refugees trying to escape from their past to build a new life or dream. It doesn't matter how hard they try, it seems impossible and their violent past comes after them and leads them to their final destruction. <br /> <br /> Although it's a very pessimistic movie, it's not a dark movie. On the contrary, it is full of beautiful pictures, surreal elements and elegant humor. Toyoda's heroes cannot escape their "prison" and they have a divine (?) Punishment for their "crimes". They are tiny pieces of a beautiful painting, depicting the tower of Tokyo as a big knife turned upside down!
