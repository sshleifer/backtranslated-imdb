I caught the movie on one of the movie channels the other night and I didn't laugh so hard for a long time. This movie was so funny, I went out and bought the next day. I love this kind of comedy. It was just as real as the actors responding to the different situations. I was Rollin. I have never heard of it and just started watching because of the title "Seeing Others People". The title made me shoot and I'm glad I did. I laughed so loudly that it hurt. Now it's part of my collection. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a clever type of comedy. I'll watch this one over and over.
