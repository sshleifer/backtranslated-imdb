Well, I've been watching this movie for more than 25 years and it's still as interesting as when I first saw it. It's definitely one of the most unique movies ever made. <br /> <br /> I still think Martin Sheen also has big time in the bill "dissed". He dominates the movie, but gets less billing than Marlon Brando, who only appears in the last 30 minutes of this 2-hour, 17-minute movie (theater version). How unfair is it? <br /> <br /> Sheen is fantastic here, especially his narrative, which runs throughout. This is one of the best stories, if not the best, I've ever heard in a movie. His voice just as he tells his thoughts about this amazing nightmare adventure. I can never appreciate his work in this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing about the movie over the years is the number of unforgettable scenes I've never forgotten, such as .... <br /> <br /> Sheen lost it in his hotel room in the film's first scene; Robert Duvall and the out-of-the-way surfing scenes and then the subsequent attack with Wagner's dramatic classical music exceling from the helicopters; The Playboy bunny entertaining the troops; Frederic Forrest is provoked to see a tiger close in the jungle; the strange scenes on the long riverboat ride; The appearance of hippie journalist Dennis Hopper greets the crew in Cambodia and then Brando's bizarre character. It continues with strange scenes. <br /> <br /> That's not to say I enjoyed everything. No, there are some very unpleasant scenes, such as the one in which an ox is cut in half (can't see it anymore), an innocent family is slaughtered on a small boat by Sheen's young dotted crew and the crew is sometimes a bit too goofy. Then there is the large amount of curse, which led to too many f-words. <br /> <br /> So, there are very good and bad things in this movie for almost everyone who sees it One thing for sure: this is a movie you will remember!
