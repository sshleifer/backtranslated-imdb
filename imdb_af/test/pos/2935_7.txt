After turning into the modeling industry (like a model), I see this view with a slightly different view than most power. While acknowledging that ANTM can be a fun and entertaining show, it seems that the seasons continue to drift away from any reality. <br /> <br /> The show seems to be virtually pure publicity for its participants, as it made none of the show's winners (or fellow contestants) much of a name for themselves under the show's umbrella . Perhaps this is because the truth is that any girl with the right potential to be a fashion model shouldn't have too much trouble sending to agencies (you can email or slaughter it if you stop remotely) to attend an agency's call). sign up for an agency, and start a modeling career. Yes, the process does not guarantee success, but apparently ANTM does not. And to participate in a reality program, looks less of the boost in the modeling business, than to sign up for a top or decent agency (which only guarantees one participant to each cycle in each case). <br /> <br /> Yet, the show can't hurt, can definitely be amusing and has some kind of magic that works especially for teenage girls, which I found. Although I have to add, ANTM can get a little tired and boring after looking at several cycles, as it happened to me. And besides some unrealistic situations (each more disgraceful than the last) the only other annoyance is the over-exploitation of "Tyra, Tyra, Tyra!" Tyra really wants to lead these girls to success, but it is necessary that each of the models' temporary digs in Tyra photos be covered; for virtually every panel and challenge to include a story or scenario that "Tyra" experienced and conquered? I don't think so. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, take a little Tyra, sit back in a little more reality, and ANTM can be a 10-star show instead of a 7.
