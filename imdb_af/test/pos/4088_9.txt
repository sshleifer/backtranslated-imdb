Like some people I know, I arrived late at "Stingers"; not until 2000. Three years later there is no way to miss an episode. The show is really as good and, for a better word, for example, retains its integrity, as opposed to Blue Heelers. The crime is the thing; personal lives have just been rolled out when an investigation is made! When Gary Sweet was brought in, there were some worried people, but he was really well equipped, which didn't surprise me. Gary can measure a similar series to any British or American actor. The role sometimes changes, but every change brings something new and fresh. With the possibility of Australia's best team behind the scenes, "Stingers" will remain a leading drama series.
