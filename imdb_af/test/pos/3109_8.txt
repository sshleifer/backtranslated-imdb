Gosh, I learn very quickly that sometimes when you see a movie as a youngster and then again 20 years later, you get a different view - mainly because you learn more in 20 years. For example, I didn't know who George Cukor was - how big a director was and how many of them made this movie. All I can say is .. I loved this movie very much because it touched on an area that looked like my life: lifelong friendship between two women. Can it ever exist? Well, in certain doses, yes ... and this movie leaves a little further ... "how." <br /> <br /> Being a younger with not much life experience the first time I saw it focused more on the "rich" and "famous" part of the two. Then I had no idea. There was a difference and what would happen to two women who discovered that there was ... and how it would bring about their friendship. Through their husbands, their career, the decades they defined. And realize that one thing has remained stronger than anything else ... know their friendship and each other more than anyone else can have. <br /> <br /> When I got older, I looked a little ... and watched movie again with my best high school friend. We understand the 'rich' and 'famous' corner ... and we are still the best friends ... but this movie is not a masterpiece ... it can sometimes be considered a little campsite. A little on top of points (similar to a 'Dynasty' and 'Dallas level'). I can honestly identify with the teddy bear scene because we share a bear that means a lot more than a stuffed fun toy through our trials and tribulations with men / careers, and so on, and it's not as over as it looks ....! As many have said, Meg Ryan and Matt Latanzzi and Dack Rambo and David Selby are seeing big in this 1981 piece. it's a nice "chick" flick!
