When a stranger calls really a good movie. I have never seen the original and so when I looked at it, I thought it was unique. When a Stranger Calls was advertised on television, the trailer ended. Well, I never saw the trailer, so when I saw this movie, I was amazed at how good it was. One day I went there and decided that I would buy it and now I am happy because I thought it was a very nice movie that is a nice little movie to own. It becomes very unfair treatment, and if you are not interested in this movie at all, do not listen to all the negativity. Camille Belle is not that bad of an actress, because everyone is making her out and she has done a good job in this movie. All that you hate about yourself relieves, and actually tries to enjoy this movie for what it is; A fun, teenager, popcorn movie. If you haven't seen it, do it because it's much nicer than a lot of other slashers recently made.
