Valentine "Dogkiller" Dussaut and Joe "The Judge" core bundle forces to clear the average streets of Geneva! Excitement as the kibosh on international heroin smugglers, Polish refugees, crying toms, refugee friends, apostate dogs, and garbage bottles too lazy to get their recyclable pickups. Don't be fooled by the deceptive Miramax advertising campaign that paints it as a pretentious, art house movie. This movie is 100% action!
