I cheated on me by knowing the whole story. While there could be a twist, this twist was so significant that I betrayed myself. I believe it could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story together. The writer could have revealed more of the 'twist' throughout the movie rather than all at once at the end. In addition, I believe that the actors did very well with what they had, especially Matt Damon, who actually had a small character in his character, small traits that were not selfish or as a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing no. The other main characters were their own separate entities that only talked to each other. The cohesion of the group in Ocean's Eleven was gone.
