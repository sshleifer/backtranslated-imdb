-Factors (I): "Mar Adentro" is related to the well-known (at least in Spain) story of Ramón Sampedro, a Galician quadriplegia who killed himself (helped by some friends) after 28 years of his condition. Judges several times refused his petitions of active euthanasia. <br /> <br /> Factors (II): "Mar adentro" becomes the film of the year in Spain. Everyone talks about it: politicians, singers, ordinary people ... Everyone likes, even the opinions of the critics are unanimous. The film wins many awards (Golden Globe, Oscar, Goya ...) and disregards the Catholic community and life-lovers quadriplegics. A star was born. <br /> <br /> Factors (III): The intensity and quality of the actors in Mar Adentro is just amazing, and it makes me wonder how we should look the same bad looking young actors in most of the Spanish latest movies. I don't know if Javier Bardem is a good actor or a great mimic (there is quite a difference between one thing or another); Anyway, his work is just impressive, as well as Lola Dueñas, Belén Rueda, or the work of all guest capitals. This is (the actors selection) the strong point in Amenábar's movie. <br /> <br /> Factors (IV): Alejandro Amenábar learned his lesson there at the Cinema School. There is no doubt about it: he has a privileged brain. He takes good control of each of the technical aspects, he knows what the audience wants, he knows how to get the right deal even if it changes him into such a demagogue (just like Spielberg is - one of Amenábar's idols ). <br /> <br /> Factors (and V): If you criticize a movie like "Mar Adentro", you seem to have some difficulty with the moral issue the story goes on. There is a fall in these kinds of pictures: you have to distinguish between the film itself and the moral concepts. If you don't like "Schindler's List," it doesn't mean that you agree with Hitler's philosophy (or do you). So, for me, it's a good movie and an extraordinary story (since it's a real story that makes it much more extraordinary). Grandmother, self-sufficient and all but neutral (no matter what Amenábar or Bardem said about it: the characters who are not for euthanasia are not good at all!). 50% Hard / 50% too sentimental. <br /> <br /> -Epilogue: "Mar Adentro" won't be in my position of the best 50's Spanish movies of all time. No one has any special merit in the story, but Ramon Sampedro himself. He is the movie. Now Alejandro Amenábar is the more international Spanish director ever, maybe he will be living in Hollywood. but some of us want to see him filming a simple story, without some final twists, without living death or dying alive ... The other is still his best movie. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 10/07
