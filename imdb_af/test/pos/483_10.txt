I first saw it on Thames television and loved it. I then saw a terrible writing by someone who certainly didn't watch or listen to it. So, I bought a copy and then I bought another copy! The only sad thing is that it is not available on PAL VHS or Region 2 DVD. The Australian version is great, but this one is better! I might buy another .............
