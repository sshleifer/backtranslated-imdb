I probably watched this movie more than 20 times. The jokes are now 10-15 years old, but every time I see it, it removes me from my chair. Two of the best actor Salman Khan and Aamir Khan play the lead roles here. Even if Aamir Khan is a much better actor and plays the better role (clever man) in the movie Salman Khan games and sometimes even better than the stupid man. All the characters are memorable. This movie is filled with hilarious one-liners and funny situations (a little too stupid, probably). Don't try to find logic in this movie. Let your brain relax for some time. I promise it will be an experience to remember.
