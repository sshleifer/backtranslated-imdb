The man with the screaming brain is definitely not a perfect movie, but I'm pretty sure it was never a star vehicle for Bruce Campbell. This means that it is a summary of his entire career: slapstick, sarcasm, cheese, action and happy ending. Campbell is unequal as a writer. There are many things in the story that do not make much sense (why does the robot suddenly only have breasts, just because a female brain is implanted in it?), And some of the screens feel like a return of other, better incarnations ( the scene in the restaurant, where Yegor and William are in control of William's body, is straight from the Bose Death II). However, there are many small touches and non-successors who feel quite brilliant, such as when William is in a panic and shouts at a statue, "What are you looking at?" The movie looks like an original Sci-Fi channel, probably because it was. Actually, the acting is pretty good. I especially enjoyed Tamara Gorski and Tatoya; She was relentless and clever, yes, but in some moments it had a tragic air over her that never explored the story. Ted Raimi has handled the standard "bumbling assistant" roll enough, and Bruce is funny as the arrogant, sardonic, condescending American shave. (Now that he's writing his own films, you think he'll give himself a role he hasn't already introduced.) Man with the Scream brain is a bizarre, unbeatable B-movie that should be fun for anyone who can avoid To take a movie experience too seriously.
