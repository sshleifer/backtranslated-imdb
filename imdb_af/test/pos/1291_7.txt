"You were on your way and you dragged on a skirt!" Gilligan tells Jim Leonard. This is a summary of the story of Leonard (a young Humphrey Bogart), when his dream is hit by the dream lover Carol, played by Dorothy Mackaill. Leonard is busy with a new and improved car, but now his love life and car company both up and down in this 68 minute shortie. Bogart hasn't yet developed the quiet, breeding style. Good performances by most supporting characters - her butler, his co-workers, a sister, interrupters on the go. Some adult themes, as this was done just before they really applied the movie code, but it is still soft compared to what is on TV today. Directed by Thornton Freeland, a year before Freeland directed the incredible Flying Down to Rio.
