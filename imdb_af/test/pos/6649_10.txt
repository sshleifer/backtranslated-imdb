How is it possible to keep and keep the same movie? <br /> <br /> The plot is so much like the Jody Foster thing, Sommersby, just not so good. Nicole was wonderful. Jude was sufficient. They didn't give him many lines. Is there a reason for this? Overall, he is a pretty good actor. She is so elegant, his character is so buoyant. It makes one wonder what they see in each other. <br /> <br /> Romance between the two was only successful in Lady Chatterly's Lover. <br /> <br /> I think the dislike takes place because the movie is also long. They could tell the story in two hours. <br /> <br /> The story is good. Good places, good filming. The character actors were great.
