Well, first of all, I'm a big fanatic of horror movies, but I'm pretty sick of all the damn American horror movies. They are all about the same thing - blood and violence. It's not even creepy. Well, it's nothing wrong with the blood and all this - don't even bother me - but that's not what a movie creepy makes! That's why I find this movie entertaining - it is fun to see a satire that makes fun of the concept "headwind USA". American pleats / gore movies, they're not supposed to be creepy, just funny. That's right. But if they are supposed to be "creepy", it becomes mostly pathetic. However, there are some great American horror movies (Poltergeist, Psycho, Birds), but in the end it's all the same. That's why this movie came as a relief. Angry Ed is not just a cult movie - it's a classic movie! I can't wait for Mr. Anders Jacobsson, Mr. Until I have to see Evil Ed again - and again - and again! But I don't mind - it's such an excellent movie!
