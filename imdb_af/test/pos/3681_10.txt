I only saw this movie in a choir film festival. 10 minutes after the movie ended, a gay couple walked to me and asked if I needed help - I still sat crying like a maniac. The movie is cheesy, it's bizarre, it's on top, it's gay - but it's incredible. I think every character is probably. Everett's character is mean to a woman who is just trying to help, he throws out his (terrible) friends, he has a temper, he can double a fly, the "fly" that killed the love of his life damage. Assets are a miracle, she is perfect, just like a role. A woman whose love and admiration is so strong that she even loves the gay lover of her idol is the essence of true love. I even understand Max (the man), he's bored with his life, he has a midlife crisis. He moves out, tries to live an exciting life, just to realize that he is the boring part of the relationship and b) that he loves his wife. I love the fact that she finally comes back because I think it gives the film the right balance between dream and reality. Because in the end he is her husband and he may not be as exciting as Victor, but he is, in fact, the man she loves in a very downward direction. I watched it about 50 times and I like this movie, all unconditional. VAT, read only Rupert Everett's autobiography and UL is the only movie he speaks of as one of the best movies he ever made. For me, this is the best movie he ever made.
