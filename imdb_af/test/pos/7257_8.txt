I love historical (period) movies and get new ideas for my group's costumes, and a friend recommended this one to me. I love Johnny Lee Miller as an actor, so I thought it was worth it and I was definitely rewarded !! His depiction as a member of the English noble class was much more accurate than I have seen in the past. The comedy aspect has hurt my sides, the costumes were not terrible and historically I didn't crawl too much. I also noticed that England did not have a proper sewerage system until much later, but anyone who had a dose did not pass deep into England's past. It was absolutely worth seeing. I recommend this movie.
