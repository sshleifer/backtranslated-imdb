I saw this movie about 4 times and every time I was impressed with the work of the Second Chamber Assistant. Looks trivial, but there is something very professional, knowledgeable and talented there. The film as a whole suffers from other problems, as indicated by other comments. The significance of addressing the issues today is as relevant as it was 40 years ago. The acting is a bit tense, but the work of the Second Chamber Assistant is stars! This person must come back into business - maybe directing? What is this person waiting for? I'll look and wait and sorry from the sidelines! - Bob
