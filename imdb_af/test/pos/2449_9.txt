I feel privileged to see this movie by accident. I accidentally ran over this movie. One night I played another movie on Showtime and this movie came after that. So I sat watching and boy was I blown away. The acting is absolutely fantastic. Kathy Bates ... who was my favorite actress since Misery and Fried Green Tomatoes donated a wonderful show as a dominant mother who desperately tries to keep her old school values ​​(religion, family) desperate to alienate her family. Martin Sheen is wonderful as the "difficult" patriarch who really is not in control of anything in his life or family. The one thing I really loved about this movie is how it tells what happens when the heroes come home. It shows the real damage done to our soldiers after they fought for wars for political and financial gain. This movie just blew me and I feel blessed to accidentally paste this movie and watch it. It's a must-see for anyone who wants a real drama, it's not too melodramatic and pastor, but pulls on your heartfelt like no other
