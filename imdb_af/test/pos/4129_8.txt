The movie took a little flack to play quickly and apart from the facts. But it will be close to being in a time and place that no longer exists, if you get the feeling. <br /> <br /> Like Keith Richards comments in Paul McCartney's movie about Holly, there are a few Buddy Holly in almost all the rock that has been made since his day. The tragedy that has taken him down is treated gently, and the rest of the movie recreates the joy of a good music career and a joyous music. <br /> <br /> Gary Busey makes a remarkable energetic representation of Holly, and his performances indicate that he really touches the music. As a holly fan and rocker, I do too.
