Love today's show !!! It was a variety and didn't just cook (it would have been good). Very stimulating and engaging, and always keep the viewer around the corner to see what comes next. She is so kind to earth and just as personal as you get, like one of us who made the show more and more enjoyable. Special guests, who are also friends for a nice surprise. Love the 'first' theme and the audience is also invited to play together. I have to admit I was shocked to see that she entered a few things under her time limits, but she did so and by golfing I would write those recipes. Saving time in the kitchen means more time with family. Those who have not yet agreed, find out which channel and time, I assure you that you will not be disappointed.
