Working Girl Kitty (Sothern) is engaged to Bill (Kelly), neglecting her by working long hours at his garage to save money for their marriage. When she got up on her birthday, Kitty went on a double date / blind date, at the department store, Meet Bob Hartwell (Hamilton). She falls in love, but leaves him as his love representation seems to be a desire to be his mistress, rather than his wife. Faithful Bill rallies to comfort her, and eventually she makes repeated requests to restore their involvement, partly under pressure from Bill's support of her family after losing her job. But when Bob returns, convinced he wants marriage, Kitty will follow her heart or conscience? <br /> <br /> This movie was much better than I expected to be. The character of Bill only becomes the kind of runner-Irish man Jack Carson played so often. But Kelly (and the writing) fills the character with true compassion and love, and Bill seems to be the best person in the whole group. Viewers may root for him against the torchless Hartwell! However, the scene of the movie wagon is between light romance and a much darker side, especially in the portrayal of a dance marathon and a frightening accident at Bill's garage. <br /> <br /> The role is rounded off. by trusted Jane Darwell as Kitty's mother, a rude but not yet thorough, silly Mickey Rooney as Kitty's younger brother, and Spencer Charters as Kitty's ne'er-do-well father.
