This twisted comedy was well behaved and directed. Very funny and the production quality is excellent. It's easy to see why this short film has been adopted to so many festivals and won awards. <br /> <br /> Everyone can identify with Calvin with a bad day, bad week, bad life. Travis Davis plays the role excellently! Richard Moll as Tim's dark and forerunner brings this movie just the right twist. The old man adds to the humor of the story. And who wouldn't love the suicidal goldfish! <br /> <br /> This short will brings lots of laughs. And don't miss the credits they play at the end!
