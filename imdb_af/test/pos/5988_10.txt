This is one of the best movies I've seen long ago! The director did a wonderful job showing the contrast between social classes, a situation that is very important today in France. All the characters love, especially Juliette and her family. The development of the romance is, although not quite realistic, at least credible, and a wonderful work that shows how many people will change for love. I found it to be a heart-warming Cinderella story - but one in which Cinderella is a powerful woman in and of herself. I laughed through this whole movie and loved it absolutely. I recommend Romuald et Juliette to anyone who enjoys unique characters, comedy and non-traditional romance.
