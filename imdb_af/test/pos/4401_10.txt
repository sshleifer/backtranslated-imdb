I previously walked out of a Coen movie and not quite known how to feel. The two best examples of this are The Big Lebowski and Fargo. Lebowski was so ridiculously original and so filled with strange humor that I had to keep it. On the other hand, there were some unnecessary reveries with flying people and killer-bowling balls that just didn't fit the shape of the movie. Yet I like the movie and now own a copy of it. Fargo made me cry with hysteria, sometimes I wasn't sure why I was laughing so loud it made me cry, but I was. There were many seemingly strange characters in Fargo, but on further investigation they were just real people talking about real-life situations. That's why the guy with the spade (or was it a broom) was so spectacularly funny when he told the police officer the other night about some funny men. And that is also why the theater burst into laughter when he said that there were some funny clouds coming in. (I also own a copy of this movie.) The Coen's have a way to mask their film and their characters as somewhat eccentric and perhaps a bit off the wall. But if you look closely at some of the same characters that look very much, you will always find that in a strange way everyone is true. That's what is extraordinary about O Brother, where are you? It's a movie out there. I mean it's not even in the same ballpark as a traditional movie. I checked the movie Shaft this past summer and I said Shaft was a good movie I saw a thousand times before. But you can't say about a Coen Brother's movie and you can't say about this one. <br /> <br /> This movie has everything in jail, crooked southern politicians, muses, references to What I can only accept are historical figures, river baptism, bank robberies, violence against animals, song herds of religious fanatics, KKK , lynch gangs and so on. There are, of course, many references to Homer's Odyssey in this, but I won't know, because I never read or even knew about Homer's Odyssey. Every other newspaper reviewer seems to know everything about it and they think this cynicism and almost spoofy quality make the film so much better. Well, come from a guy who knows nothing about it, I can tell you it's still an entertaining movie. There were times again, as usual for a Coen movie, I wasn't sure why I was entertaining or laughing, but I was. <br /> <br /> This is a road photo where three men travel on the road To find a hidden treasure that Clooney says he hid from his two other companions. He had to take them with them because they were chained to him when they had a chance to escape. <br /> <br /> I like all the main players in the movie and many of them are Coen cronies. It was nice to see Goodman again. It was nice to see Hunter and especially Turturro who seems to be in every Coen movie. It's too bad they didn't find a place for Steve Buscemi, but it's a different story. But back to Clooney. The man only has charisma. He is also a player of an actor and here he is not as like the others, but even his own idiosyncrasies. His work here is very fantastic and I really hope it shows that he is able to play a variety of characters. <br /> <br /> After all this praise on the film, let me just say it. I didn't really enjoy the movie. I found it to be pretty boring and a bit boring. There were too many ideas here and not enough care was taken for everything they were worth. But then the movie started to grow on me. It took a while, but it grew on me. I don't think it's their best movie, but it's still a good one and I give it a 8.5. But the reason I recommend this movie is just one reason. <br /> <br /> Every day you can look at the paper and watch the movies that play and say to yourself, seen it, watch it, oh it saw last year, it's the same as this movie and It's the same as this movie. Most films have been recovered in one form or another. Not the Coen's movies. They are not recycled and if they know, I do not know. That's enough reason to see something that sticks out. Originality counts a lot in my books. The Coens are original and they are good. And it's not common in today's theater. Enjoy while allowing movies. Because you don't get so much vision in many movies, so when you enjoy it, enjoy it!
