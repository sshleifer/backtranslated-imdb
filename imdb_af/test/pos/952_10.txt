Ghilli is the best movie of Vijay and one of the biggest hits in his career .... As I did not see the Telegu movie, I could enjoy this movie even more. The story is about a girl tied to a local goon who wants to marry her. Being a goon, no body is ready to help the heroine. Vijay who came to play a Kabaddi game sees it and decides to help her. The rest of the movie is how Vijay helps her and how the girl finally escapes the goon's and the Goon's father's political armies. The movie has much of the edge of the chair thriller moments and keeps the viewer to the end. Vijay is, as usual, very good at the role of the kabaddi player. Trisha, Ashish Vidyarthi, the many friends of Vijay have all done their job well. A special mention should be made about the villain of the film Prakashraj. The villain's character is properly etched and prakashraj portrayed it very well. Surprisingly, for the first time I felt sympathy for the villain. The dialogue "Hi Chellam" really seized the masses. The music by vidyasagar is brilliant and the song 'apadi podu' is a rage all over. Harani must be credited with such a nice masala movie that will be enjoyed by not only dying the hard vijay fans but also heard by the general tamil movie around the world.
