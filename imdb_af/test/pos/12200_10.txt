Surface was one of the few truly unique broadcasts on TV last season. I can honestly say that I changed my schedule so that I could be at home to watch every episode. Tone action, tension, science fiction, etc. <br /> <br /> The story of a boy who found an egg that had hatched in a sea creature. The same sea creature that killed the main character's brother and the female character (oseograph), has seen. Most people think it is a deadly killing machine, but the one raised from the egg is very friendly. <br /> <br /> Only problem is that NBC has canceled it, so now we will never know what happens. Hopefully Sci-Fi or another channel will pick it up.
