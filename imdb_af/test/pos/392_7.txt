Dylan and Bobby are young friends and they are in love with the way young boys are sometimes. But Dylan met a girl and set aside the things of youth. Bobby knows he's not interested in girls and misses what he had with Dylan. <br /> <br /> Tell as part of the cheesy 80 movie, a part home movie, a part video reminder, this movie tells a confusing and sad, but all too often true, story that many people with hit the house. <br /> <br /> This movie brings back many memories and struck a very real chord with me, but I wish the movie maker went a little further and left it on a happier note. Yes, we all love and lose even when we are young, but there is always tomorrow, especially when we are young.
