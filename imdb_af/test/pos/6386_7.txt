An unusual movie that starts with the classic representation of a hooligan who marries a girl who loves to escape the country. But a turn soon turns the story upside down. Most of the movies hit the right buttons: the story develops smoothly, the play is solid (Sienna Miller's draw is priceless, she can really act!), Chemistry between both jobs and rolling American rural scales and peculiar silk characters really make a good time. The mood, which starts out as light and romantic, soon becomes darker and more straightforward. <br /> <br /> Sometimes the pace is slower, but just a little more than we want, but don't allow it. stop watching this unusual little movie. Alexandre Montin, Paris
