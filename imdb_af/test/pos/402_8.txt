Better than the second World War era "what-thin-it" with Warner Baxter as a former amateur gangster and born again as a psychiatrist now known as Robert Ordway, helping both police and criminals that wants to go straight. Crime Doctor's Courage is the fourth in the series of ten and also includes a victim who may have mental problems. The link to courage is not very clear. <br /> <br /> This entry revolves around the death of fortune hunter Gordon Carson, whose two former women are under mysterious circumstances and who again die in a closed room under conditions that seem like suicide, but dr. Ordway calls murder. Hillary Brooke plays part of the widow Kathleen Carson involved in Anthony Caruso - a mysterious Spanish dancer whose act includes his sister disappearing on stage. As a mystery writer, Jerome Cowan is a good supporting actor, as Lloyd Corrigan is an aficionado in crime. <br /> <br /> Ghostly houses with cracked doors, basement boxes and suspects never seen in daylight to the air of excitement. The set for the dance series has been fairly expanded and the ballet music is very good. Direction, production design and photography stand out. The outside and costumes represent more prosperity, rather than usually in the average "B" eyepiece. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
