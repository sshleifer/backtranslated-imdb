From all the Bat movies, Batman Returns, my favorite is. This beautiful, dark and funny movie is one of Tim Burton's best work. Although it is very violent and darker, it is the Batman that created creator Bob Kane many years ago. Michael Keaton reprinted his role as the vengeance of Gotham City. This time he is against two deadly enemies, Danny Devito's Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer's Catwoman. With a good movie score from Danny Elfman, the movie takes us on an adventure as Batman clashes with the evil forces trying to take Gotham City. Christopher Walken looks great as Max Shrek, a sharp businessman who has an evil scheme on his sleeve. But of course, Michelle Pfeiffer is the one who steals the show. With all these components you have a movie that will blow you away. That's why you're going to the movies. It has everything. It's really a pity that Tim Burton didn't get the other successors. If so, I think the franchise will be strong today. Batman Returns is a wonderful experience for fans of cool movies.
