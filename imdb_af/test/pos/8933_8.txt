I want to see this movie very long. I eventually bought it only on E-Bay, as it is so difficult to find the state side. But the wait was a bit worth it. <br /> <br /> I can't say the movie was great. And I can't say the movie was hilarious. But it was good and it has some funny points. That the shots in this movie are just beautiful. And the whole role, especially Brenda Blethyn (someone I didn't see before) was excellent. <br /> <br /> In the end, it's a good, romantic comedy and I recommend checking it out unless you've just had a death in the family. <br /> <br /> If anything, the last chapter is worth the money. >. <
