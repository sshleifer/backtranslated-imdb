Oz is by far the best performance ever to enjoy television. Better than the Sopranos, yes, ER, yes, CSI, absolutely. Uncompromising, vigilant, and totally disturbing, yet moving deeply. Oz took us past any image of the prison that someone had ever faced on television. Tom Fontana really did a brilliant job with the writing. No topic is taboo. Rape, drugs, murder. Oz is proof of how good TV can be. It follows characters from all different backgrounds and all different races, but always comes back to your allman Tobias Beecher, in jail for vehicle crime. We see what we don't want to see, pain, death, chaos. Oz will disturb you, cause you to shrink, make you look away, but mostly it will make you think. To see, Oz is a great television production
