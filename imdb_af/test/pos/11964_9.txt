Thinking of the Soviet theater, the propaganda masterpieces of Eisenstein or the gloomy meditations of Tarkovsky generally come into consideration. They are probably good movies, but usually not the most entertaining stuff out there. However, the Iron Curtain countries enjoyed their escape music as much as the states had. In fact, from the 1930s to the 70s, forty of this song-and-dance extravaganzas were released to greatly appreciate the public. However, they are completely unheard of in the West, so this documentary seeks to rectify that situation. It is a tremendous task to show both these movies and put them in the right cultural context. Despite the fact that I have never been a fan of musicals, I have found that this documentary is absolutely compelling from beginning to end. It's about proving that, no matter how many movies you see in your lifetime, you just look at the surface of what's out there. <br /> <br /> As far as the movie clip is concerned, it's very entertaining. While some of the musicians display blatant propaganda that workers sing about how much they like to work under the regime, some of the movies (especially the later ones) seem to be properly achieved from a production perspective. Plus, they are all extremely camped because they are so strange to my western eyes. There are a few similarities between them and the American musicals I am accustomed to, but the presence of strict governmental application of a message gives them a surreal edge. They certainly don't look like the musicals made in the West. This documentary is both one of the most bizarre and entertaining movies I've seen in recent memory, and it's an absolute must-see for any movie buff. (9/10)
