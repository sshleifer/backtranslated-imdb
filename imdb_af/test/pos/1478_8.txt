I rate this pretty high just because of Sam Elliott. I could have done without the female nudity, but I would almost put any nonsense to see Sam how he was. He gets wonderful cynical witticisms, many of which I agree with, and it is a joy to see him in a role he actually emotes, rather than just standing around looking virile as it may be. My boyfriend stated that this movie looks in some ways like a movie in which Ed Harris had a Spanish partner (in the police's sense of the term!) What was a bit of a leader to prove himself. You can draw your own conclusions at that point, but if you like Sam, you'll like it. You can say I'm biased, but what's not somehow? I'll buy it on DVD in a heartbeat!
