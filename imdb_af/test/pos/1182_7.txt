A competent comedy that delivers the laughs of fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. I suppose this movie was made for those who enjoyed the two GRUMPY OLD MEN movies, as there were a lot of these buddy team-ups who mock the comic duo in their twilight years. The idea is a fire-free one: Matthau, a clumsy gambler who has thousands of dollars in debt, welcomes his unsuspecting friend Lemmon to take a free trip with him to meet their rich old ladies. The catch is, they are reported as Dans Hosts and Matthau cannot dance. <br /> <br /> OUT TO SEA is a funny movie, and not all chuckles are thanks to Lemmon. Matthau. I found that Brent Spiner (known as Data of STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION) is very humorous than the snobble workshop competition. As the pricey boss of the two aging actors, he manages them in the laughing section. Although the movie doesn't really need anyone, there is also a love story or two that can also be found here, with Dyan Cannon (which looks good for her years).
