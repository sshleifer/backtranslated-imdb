Just watched her after 20 years. It hit home. For those of us who have tried to stand on the shoulders of the civil rights movement and fight the rule of privilege and power; which resists the fascism of the Johnson / Nixon administrations; who, as a veteran of civil wars, fought the war in Vietnam every day until the American animal finally died and fled; for anyone who said no no in many different ways - it is remarkable how unsuccessful we were. How big was the right table on which Danced danced. How the wizard drove behind the curtain. We were 20, 22, 24. We didn't know the nature of the enemy. The size of the sample would continue to eat for the next thirty years and counting. How can we? Even with smoke and the bat! In our hand, like Treat, we were too young, too middle class, investing, too much of the actions we hated. <br /> <br /> But there was a moment. As Andre Gregory observes in My Dinner With. . . , there was a moment or two somewhere in the late 60's and early 70's, when we could find something along the yellow brick path. Something not captured by Bechtel, prisons, Enron and Dick. Work together. Something innocent and critical at a time. Something about dancing. <br /> <br /> But we missed it. As the Kong bowed, the "revolution" was turned on itself. In sexism. Racism. Homophobia. And the class breaks politics. Until we got to "W". Treated would have hated "W". And Iraq and the pathological lies. If they were in that movie. Dan. But the moment passed and "W" was almost inevitable. Comprehensive incompetence drives the drunk, furious bull in estuaries, children's lives and China stores. <br /> <br /> We had to do something more. Something better. But we clearly didn't know what. <br /> <br /> Now what?
