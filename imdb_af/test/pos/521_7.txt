Witchery, or Witchcraft as it is commonly known in Europe, creatures with Jane Brooks (Linda Blair) wake up from a nightmare involving a witch. Jane's Mother and Father Rose (Annie Ross) and Freddie (Robert Champagne) are interested in buying an old, deserted hotel on an island, about 50 miles from Boston, to rebuild and reopen it. Rose and Freddie, along with Jane and their young son Tommy (Michael Manchester), plan to travel to the island with an architect named Linda Sullivan (Catherine Hickland) to look at the amount of work needed to do, they also meet estate agent Jerry Giordano (Rick Farnsworth) and hire a local fisherman named Sam (George Stevens) to take them to the island. As soon as they enter the hotel and start inspecting the property while they are back on the boat, Sam is murdered and the boat is released to sail in the distance. They discover two unexpected guests in the form of a photographer named Gary (David Hasselhoff) and his virgin Leslie (Leslie Cumming) who are investigating a book she writes about the gruesome legends and superstitions surrounding the infamous island and hotel . As the night falls on a furious storm, they are off the continent as a mysterious 'black woman' (Hildegard Knef), while the old evil living in the hotel is looking for new victims for demonic possession, human sacrifice and satanic rites ... <br /> <br /> The director of this American Italian co-produced movie is somewhat secretive because the IMDb calls Fabrizio Laurenti as Martin Newlin, but there are rumors that Joe D'Amato is Honors Have to be honest, despite the bad reputation, I found Witchery rather entertaining in a bad-it-good-cheesy kind of way. The writing credited to Harry Spalding and Daniele Stroppa on the IMDb is also confusing as the actual credit on the film itself is Daniel Davis. Anyway, whoever wrote this thing had a decent job, please stop with laughter. In the heart, it's a haunted horror, but add a few gory deaths and a surreal feeling to everything. The different sets of characters have reasonable motives and have not come as much to my nerves as I thought they might, it is not very well plotted, it does not make much sense and the dialogue is not exactly tops, but as A whole thing has made Witchery entertain me because it's a strange and minute minute clear and simple. It's pretty good, a little slow to maybe go, but there are many surreal, bizarre passing and horrible deaths to entertain one. One part of Witchery that destroys part of its credibility is this so-called storm, there is no storm in sight and the sea is probably calm enough to swim. Witchery's supposed "twist" end doesn't really work for me. Look at the stupid expression on Cummings's face on the final freezer. The hotel offers a good isolated location and adds a certain atmosphere to the film which has the distinctive indefinite horror feeling, cheap horror. Technically Witchery is not bad at all, it's apparently shot in place, so it looks good all the time, and not exactly the highlight of movie fitness. It's overall production values ​​that are slightly better than expected. The violence and gore of typical Euro explicitness, a woman closed her lips and hung in a fireplace so she could not shout as the others light it, someone is crucified and then burned alive, placed on a swordfish, some veins can spread & a woman is raped by a man without lips. Witchery was shot in English, so there is no dubbing, as far as David Hasselhoff and Linda Blair are in the same movie, the more I can say? Yes ladies Hasselhoff takes off his shirt and for the boys Cummings takes her off. Both Hasselhoff and Blair are a bitch to look at in this thing, but the little child is very annoying and can't really act. I'm sure most sensible filmmakers won't agree with my opinions, but I still stand by the fact that I wanted it and would love to see it again. Witchery is pretty good and is definitely worth making a watch if you're into 'bad' movies or a horror fan in general.
