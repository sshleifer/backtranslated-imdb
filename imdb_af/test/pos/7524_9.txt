This short, formative cartoon with Pepe Le Pew relates to a cat who thinks he will solve all his problems by pretending to be a skunk. Trouble is, he attracts the most unwelcome attention of an honest and a real skunk (our hero, Pepe, who was left at that stage) definitely more vigilant, we will say, than Mr Cat wants. Every major plan has its drawbacks, but this one is a cork! I wonder if Jack Warner received a call from the Hays office about the fact that Pepe and the object of his worship were both male. After all, Betty Boop was partly responsible for the production code that was coming. Subsequent "conquests" were clear and definitely feminine. Very good cartoon, but Pepe is a character that works better than the focal point, rather than supporting. Worth watching. Recommended.
