Jamie Foxx was the character of Ray Charles. After a few moments you stop watching a movie and see a biography played by the great man himself. Ray Charles was truly a genius of music and the film portrayed it perfectly. No one has ever ever ever written, played or recorded music like this music giant ever. When he passed the flesh, the world lost one of its greatest American heroes. Regarding the film, the fact that Jamie Foxx received a classical music study at college and Ray can play as a player is an asset to the director. What could be better than that? You don't have to have a "double" piano and then try splitting the screen of someone else's hands into Jamie's face. It worked beautifully. I loved the fact that it also picked up how difficult Ray was. He wasn't always a nice man. You also didn't root for him. He was a drug addict, a woman man, and sometimes it's just aloud. But I think that's what made him genius so I couldn't blame him for it. I choose Jamie for the best actor!
