Unfortunately, due to a slow start, I can't say it's one of Hitch's best movies. It's very good, but the less. The movie stars Jimmy Stewart and Doris Day are as parents caught in a political murder plot and should try to get their kidnapped son back. They offer both excellent performances, not surprising. In fact, I was very impressed with Hitchcock's incredible use of music. The climax at the Opera House was fantastic, and using a live band to create music and excitement was pure genius. Absolutely fantastic tension came from that scene. Also, the use of Doris Day singing "Que Sera, Sera" was excellent. Especially when it is transmitted to the scene at the end of the movie. So, this movie ends up as Hitchcock's best use of music I've seen so far. Unfortunately, it had a slow start, or I could recommend this movie a little more highly. Even then, it's still worth watching. 8 out of 10.
