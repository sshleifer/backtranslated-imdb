In a small, picturesque Sicilian village, somebody is brutally young, sexually curious. The local police corps is tracking the killer and listing up to five or so suspects, including the voyeuristic town reform Giuseppe (Vito Passeri), and an elusive, grungy, voodoo pop hurdle witch, Maciara (Florinda Bolkan) . There is also Don Alberto (Marc Popel), an attractive young priest who manages the local boy's school, Andrea (Tomas Milian), a journalist helping the police, and the beautiful Patrizia (Barbara Bouchet), a beautiful, but severely screwed up, drug addict looking for a thing for many (I mean, many) young boys. As is typical of the Giallo subgenre, the plot is not fully revealed until the last few frames, but if you can last long enough, pay this movie. The writing (written by Fulci, Gianfranco Clerici and Roberto Gianviti) keeps red reminders to a minimum and keeps you interested and the story is supported by excellent work, cinematography (by Sergio D'Offizi) and musical score (by Riz Ortolani). The acting, especially Bolkan, is also very good. Fulci fans weaned on his 80s big queries like THE BEYOND and ZOMBIE will find more artworks and less gore here than they would expect, but they will still enjoy a particularly nasty chain leg scene in a cemetery (bizarre, but effectively, set singer Ornella Vanoni's ballad "Quei giorni insi a to" and for a long time along a rocky shore that Fulci so much liked to have reused in his film THE PSYCHIC (1977). Areas of the children being killed are mostly kept out of the screen (except for a brief stranglehold), but the camera does not hesitate to hang on their bodies. The film was not released in America and presumably received some limited release in Europe due to some anti-Catholic elements in the storyline.
