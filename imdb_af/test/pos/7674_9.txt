I gave the solo "Summertime" in 5th grade for our spring choir concert. From that time on, a great appreciation of Gershwin's music developed in me. I love the ghostly melodies of this opera by Gershwin. Back when I was in the 5th grade (about 10 years old), I had the MP to practice and lots of soundtrack. I recommend watching this movie and if you can get the soundtrack, you get it - you can sometimes find it on eBay - an old, used LP. I searched and searched to find the soundtrack on CD. The songs on it have wonderful music arrangements and I really wish it would come on CD and wish they would restore the movie and put it on DVD. It really is a good job that I think would benefit and benefit from current and future generations. Some may think the movie slowly and dull, but I find it rather contrary. Although Poitier and Dandridge called musical voices, I think the voices fit the faces and personalities well. A person's voice and voice can be quite different. Porgy and Bess, and the songs in this opera, will always have a special meaning to me.
