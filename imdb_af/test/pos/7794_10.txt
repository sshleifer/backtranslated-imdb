AAA is my favorite movie ... I've seen it a couple of times (don't remember the score now) and every time I just like it .... This is the best movie by Raj Kumar Santoshi. The comedy, dialogues and performances are incredible. All the actors and actresses have done an excellent job ... You can't stop laughing while watching this movie. It's just hilaries ... Amir Khan and Salman Khan did a good job. . And action by Paresh Rawal was excellent as always ..... The music was inspired by the old Hindi movies (60s music) and is good ... the whole movie of the movie did good work ... <br / > <br /> Overall this is a great Indian comedy movie to watch ...
