I first saw IFC. What a great network to see underground movies. I watched this movie and thought it was purely drama and a story that didn't contain water. But it was really worth it. The main character is in such a rough form, and you hate to deny help, but no matter what you just can't hate him. His dedication to The Beatles and John Lennon is a great metaphor for his life and the helplessness he feels. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere of the movie is also good. Sometimes you feel that you can see what he sees, feel what he feels in some situations. This movie no longer wants you to know, or does not hold a gap in the plot. There are NO loopholes (in my opinion). I've always been a fan of foreign films, especially now with films that are so poor in America. I really enjoy the strange institutions because I feel it can take you on a journey and sometimes understand another culture. This movie did all the things to me and more. Please look at this movie and if you are new to foreign films, this is a good start.
