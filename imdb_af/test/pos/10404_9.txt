As a big fan of horror, especially Asian horror, I've seen tons of movies, but this one is outstanding. Why? It does have a plot (which, unfortunately, is scarcely under horror movies). The actors did a good job. It feels like a real documentary film (though not). It doesn't get boring for a moment. The director combines the plot with the actions of a certain Japanese magical cult (perhaps this cult never existed, but it is still credible). This reminded me of the similar movie "Forbidden Siren". <br /> <br /> For me, the only annoying thing about the movie was the character Hori, the psychic, but it is subjective. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to all fans of quality fright. <br /> <br /> 9 out of 10.
