I watched it last night and again this morning - that's how much I like it. There's something about this movie ... When the movie was almost over, I was about to cry. I would highly recommend for "Last Days" to my friends - it's definitely worth seeing! I agree with those who say some parts of the movie don't look very realistic. For example, both main characters are totally cute and in perfect physical shape (although round is also a kind of shape :)). I rarely meet people like singles and I have never met in couples. Other parts of the movie, including all the "coincidences", don't look so realistic either. BUT, it's a movie, not a life story.
