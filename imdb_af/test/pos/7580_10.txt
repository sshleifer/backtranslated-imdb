I'm not a filmmaker, but I know it's hard to tell a story and sign people in it within seven short minutes. I think a good movie is one that you don't want to end. Eric did a good job of developing the charm of the microbe and making him look "human". Loved the music and the voice used for the microbe. I'm looking forward to seeing what Eric is in store for us in the future. This is a movie I didn't want to see. Good work.
