Regarding movies, I do not easily endorse crap, pure crap and masterpiece. I believe this movie is an absolute masterpiece and it's hard to entertain for more than 90 minutes. This movie combined SLOWER as Mystic River and Harry Potter 3 and I still managed to sound my claws. For me it was the passion Eric Bogosian put in his performance. It is extremely difficult to pull off such a stunt and succeed in obtaining any positive effect. Bogosse has probably left one of the most difficult single-man shows in the modern cinema. I had no respect for Bogosians until the end of the film. The whole monologue minutes before the inexorable climax was the turning point, that was the key that turned me around. This man hit such a point that he knew he could never recover from it. The corporate boys congratulated him on the show. His blowing prose even made the slimmest one in the cavalcade to shake his head in awe. It made me realize that personal integrity and hypocrisy do not matter in the world of talk radio, even in the corporate world for that matter. Stone may have printed an uber-liberal agenda, but it was the real film and production that got my attention. Oliver Stone is a minor master of the moody. The last third of the movie probably has the best lighting and cinematography I've seen in any movie. Steen artificially makes the DJ stall feel like five to seven cells in a nineteenth-century prison. Visually, it seems that Bogosia's only friend is the black foam that absorbs its routine vitriol. He speaks and does not speak back. It is a sad metaphor in the way he deals with the people who have handled him successfully. Steen and Bogosse have carved a beautiful film from a man trapped in both a milestone and a self-contained prison. This man is limited to his own will and he can never escape it. The scene that made me realize was when he was unaware of his ex-wife. He chose his own prison instead of the outside world. Every story has a conflict and it has come to the simplest of all conflicts: man towards himself. Talk Radio presents this conflict in an intelligent, gripping and artful way. There are no hidden messages in this movie and the progress of events must be expected by any smart viewer. I just retreated and understood my thoughts through this movie and I loved it. It is irrevocable, invisible, and it will never receive its proper recognition. Let's hope it stays that way, because jewels deserve to be found and then hidden. This is a jewel because I found it in the discount DVD bin at my local Wal-Mart store. For $ 5.50, it was the half hour I spent trying to find it. I had and I had more than my money's worth. This is one of the best movies ever made and these are ten reasons alone. Ten reasons give a score of ten. <br /> <br /> Here's my ending!
