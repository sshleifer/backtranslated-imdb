It is unfortunately Carlin's last HBO concert, from a series that lasted more than 30 years. Although it may not be his "best" job, it is excellent, funny and thoughtful. This recording is also slightly different from most of his other concerts. It's a bit longer than most of his other concerts. <br /> <br /> In his long, productive and influential career, Carlin has moved from the more observational humor and fiery jokes to a more "humanitarian" society and culture standpoint. His focus on English language and euphemism has continued to grow, culminating in this performance. Although I would argue that his sound book "When Will Jesus The Pork Chops Bring?" best shows his great understanding of language, euphemism and the breaking down of our values. It's Bad For Ya is very indicative of his long transformation from a comedian to an author. <br /> <br /> If you're offended by a false language or church devotion, you probably won't like Carlin's uprising. material. However, if you are spiritually stimulated and can tolerate language and blasphemy, you will probably enjoy much of this concert.
