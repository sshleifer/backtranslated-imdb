... as valuable as King Tut's grave! (OK, maybe not THAT valuable, but worth hunting if you can). I see no-one has responded to this movie for a few years and I hope a new post will spark new comments. This is a movie I just remembered from childhood, and has just seen when I was tired of waiting for Fox to honor his own past and the Korean DVD (in English but with non-negotiable Korean captions). hunting. I will not go through another long plot description - enough to say that I saw it for the first time in its proper widescreen format, left me on the view and the magnitude of the movie. The carpet paintings are still stuck, and the palace sets are truly breathtaking. But these are the smaller scale details that this film lends its depth and wealth, and provides a look at the lifestyles of Egypt's poor as well as its elite. The bazaars, hovels, docks, embalming houses and taverns are as fascinating as Pharaoh's throne room. While large-scale errors (especially the dynastic succession) occur, the details are being scrutinized more than the vast majority of Hollywood movies. Visually, it is not without its flaws - the inside is often too exaggerated and colorful to mix seamlessly with foreigners. Nonetheless, this is a movie that needs to be credited because it is so diligent in its small size. Boring? In parts, absolutely. Overacted? Underacted? Yes, both - although 'underestimated' might be a more appropriate description. Too long? Absolutely not. I wish they had spent more time with Sinuhe's experiences in the House of Death, and among the Hittites, and less with his "romance" with Nefer. Historically Inaccurate? Yes, that too, but so was Shakespeare. Nobody chastises him for that. I appreciate historical accuracy as much as the next man, but ultimately remember that cinema theater is not a history lesson.
