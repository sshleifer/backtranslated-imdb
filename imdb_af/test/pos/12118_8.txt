I enjoyed it for a few reasons. The emotional confusion was sometimes confusing and imperfectly resolved, but the blend of the news rule material with the film's narrative was often compelling. The other element I appreciated was the portrayal of the Werewolves, the fanatic Nazis who continued the struggle after the formal surrender. I don't know about another movie that deals with them. For example, they murdered Aachen's Burgomaster Oppenhoff on Palm Sunday, 1945, and caused problems for the profession. The movie, then, challenges the purified version of victory and profession with some gritty realities. The "human issues" are not so much presented by the characters here, but by the historical reality that those who survived Hitler overcome and conquer.
