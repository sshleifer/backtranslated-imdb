"Unconditional Love" begins with great promise. As indicated by P. J. Hogan, the film works to the last third of the movie, when it falls flat on its face. The screenplay that Mr. Hogan and Jocelyn Moorehouse wrote, showing a host of possibilities at the end fascinating. It seems that the artistic team behind the movie had great hope of playing differently. The reality is that it is a film that looks in different directions to bring it to a resolution that eventually fails. Don't get me wrong, the movie is incredibly attractive and will resonate with a lot of its audience. <br /> <br /> Based on the strong cast, we decided to take a look. The incredibly talented Kathy Bates is the perfect choice to play Grace Beasley, the woman at the start of the film, is not good at her marriage. Mrs. Assets is an excellent actress who has earned much better, even when her character is not helped by what the authors do in the film. <br /> <br /> Rupert Everett is always reliable to deliver. His role, like the former Victor Fox's lover, was well written, that is, until Dirk was lured to come to Chicago to find Victor's killer. It is bizarre and it makes all the rules of logic. Dirk doesn't seem able to hurt, let alone a murderer with the help of Grace and her daughter-in-law, the incredibly funny, Maudey dead. <br /> <br /> As played by Meredith Eaton, this little woman, Maudey, is one of the best things in the movie. She is brash and tells it as she sees it. Peter Sarsgaard, one of the best role players currently working in movies, has nothing to do with the picture; he was completely wasted. Dan Aykroyd has nothing to do either. We see him at the beginning and at the end of the movie and she doesn't make sense. He wants to have changes in his life and his marriage, just to go back to Grace without any explanation, forgive everything. <br /> <br /> The English actors are good. Lynn Redgrave has a better opportunity than the hysterical Nola. Jonathan Pryce is seen throughout the film as a ghost singing mere songs. Julie Andrews makes a funny contribution in some precious scenes. <br /> <br /> Eventually, the television program presented by Sally Jesse Raphael turns off and doesn't add anything to the movie. The best part is the trial of Kathy Bates. What a beautiful voice she has! In fact, Mrs. Assets are the best excuse to stay until the end.
