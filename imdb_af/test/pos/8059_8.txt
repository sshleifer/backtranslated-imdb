After World War II, illegal crime in Phenix City, Alabama, encouraged by the money of an army base just across the river in Georgia, got even worse. Gambling, prostitution, loan shark and the like helped an organized crime apparatus in the city. Soon it was too bad and violent to tolerate even more. This movie is based on the actual story of the battle. <br /> <br /> According to the standards of the 1950s, it was shockingly explicit. Although low budget, the same small budget helped with the realism that took place. A very gritty movie. Richard Kiley was wonderful as always, and John McIntire stole. <br /> <br /> Why this good movie is not on video is a real puzzle!
