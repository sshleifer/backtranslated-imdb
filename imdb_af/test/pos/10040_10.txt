Although "they have killed with their shoes" is not quite historically accurate, it is a very entertaining western. Not only is Flynn the perfect Custer, the character players are wonderful. In addition to the action section of the film Flynn and DeHavilland's love scenes, it is very touching and credible. (Flynn and DeHavilland loved each other in real life). Flynn was always so painful because he wasn't taken seriously, just knowing there were very few actors playing the games he played and playing well!
