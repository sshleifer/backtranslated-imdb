"Thriller" remains the biggest pop music promotion to have a plot, great visual arts, and a top song to turn the film around. Michael Jackson was at the top of the tree (and not changed in his plastic surgery regime) at the moment. Here he is in good shape - the song is great, he leads the zombies into dance like no other. <br /> <br /> Ola Ray plays the girl who watches with unbelief as her sweet boyfriend (Jackson, natch) turns into a werewolf! Then he bumps into the cemetery of the opening strip "It's near midnight", with the other zombies and creatures of the night around the cemetery. <br /> <br /> The winding glory of all this is the fruitful voice of the big horror star Vincent Price speaking in the middle of the record. Great.
