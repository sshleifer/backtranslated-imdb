How do you describe perfection? In the mood for love! Maggie Cheung and Tony Leong dance virtually on the screen and give star performances that stay at your hours after you leave the theater. Each scene in the film resonates with the powerful combination of excellent cinematography and lap selection, top acting, and the sensual soundtrack. Nat King Cole singing in French definitely sets the tone for the whole movie. Maggie and Tony look great, with Maggie turning around in some really glorious cheongsams and Tony always looks brave. I've seen this movie several times, and every time I see it, I find something new about rave. Crazy about it!
