Universal Studios version of "Flipper" (1996) is a good heartwarming movie for the whole family with good values ​​and sentimentality. This is the story of Sandy Ricks, a teenager from Chicago who reluctantly spent his vacation with his uncle Porter Ricks in the Bahamas. It eventually changes the teenagers' lives and it grows in the process. He learns to appreciate nature and have respect for the environment. I grew up in the 1960s and the NBC television program "Flipper" was my favorite children's show. Elia Wood is perfectly cast as a 1990's Sandy Ricks and gives an excellent performance. As much as I did the NBC television program and MGM theater films with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s, I liked this feature the best! I feel Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks. Regarding Luke Halpin, I feel that Elijah Wood has more of a series of actors and emotions more than an actor that makes his performance excellent and more credible. I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor who works in movies today. Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the script and did an excellent job as a writer and director of this film. Paul Hogan gives a comic and favorable performance as Sandy's Uncle Porter Ricks. Mr. Hogan's performance compensates Elia's role as Sandy. I'm a big fan of underwater movies. This film was beautifully shot in the Bahamas like "Thunderball" (1965 UA). The director of photography was Bill Butler A.S.C. which has the film "Jaws" in 1975. Mr Butler is a very talented filmmaker. The underwater director of photography was Pete Romano. He did an excellent job with underwater cinematography. I enjoyed Joel McNeely's movie. This good movie score has Crosby, Stills and Nash among others talented artists. This movie was shot in Panavision as "Thunderball" in the ratio of 2.35: 1. If possible, try to see this movie in a massive version, as originally framed and face by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler. Another very good thing is that Mr. Shapiro's "original" Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) played a small role in this remake. He featured Bounty Fisherman # 3 in this movie. It was a very good gesture on Mr. Shapiro's part! As you can tell, I'm a real fan of this movie. Unfortunately, this beautiful film was met by hardcore film critics by the majority of film critics. I originally saw this movie in a cinema on my birthday, May 31, 1996. It meant a lot to me. I did it on several video versions. The VHS versions are in "pan and scan". The laser disk version is "letterboxed" 2.35: 1! I even have a VCD in 2.35: 1 from Hong Kong that is "letterboxed". But my most appreciated possession is an "original" 16mm play I will treasure for the rest of my life! Thank you Mr. Shapiro, Elijah Wood, Paul Hogan and everyone involved to make me a memorable movie! <br /> <br /> P.S. I must add that the quality of the universal DVD is excellent! This is the best DVD I've ever seen. The color and resolution are spectacular. The soundtrack is wonderful. I think Universal had used the same transfer for the DVD they did for the laser disc version. The 35mm size print is "mint" and Alan's movie really has a great look at it. A great tribute to a wonderful movie! The resolution of the DVD is even better than the laser disk quality! It's just spectacular! Thanks to Universal Home Video for the good quality control and transfer. Thank you for a great job on this great family movie. Thank you also to Alan for all your kindness to me !!! It is a real honor to know you !!! (Review revised / updated June 27, 2005)
