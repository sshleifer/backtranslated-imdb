The Four Seasons Dealer is not what I would call a happy movie, or even one that impressed me to praise it to heaven (there is another Fassbinder movie for that, like Veronika Voss and the underrated Satan brew). But it's definitely no less than a fascinating experiment to look at those in a society that you and I and others we know might know or don't really want to know. I think in the early 70s in Germany, a generation, who came from World War II, had a stigma to live with, but just trying their best to get there. It is a stigma floating across the movie and in many cases in Fassbinder's work in general, but especially because he watched Four Seasons in the middle class, and a particular married couple - the remote, depressed, angry Hans the fruit seller and his prolonged wife - it is nothing less than trying for realism in the cover of melodrama. If Cassavetes was a crazy German, he could make this movie, maybe even as a lion. <br /> <br /> The story sounds simple enough, where Hans's drink gets out of control, he strikes his wife (this scene is One of the most difficult to take, perhaps in just a movie, how Fassbinder's camera without a cut runs, because his wife is left helpless and their daughter tries to stop him in his madness and then she is ready to leave. Standing in the room, holding her family back, she called the divorce and he got a heart attack there. He recovers, his business suddenly starts with good help from some good (or not so good) employees - and yet it is just his desire, for another woman and his despair in general. <br /> <br /> And yet, in this simplicity, what Fassbinder is trying to do, and mostly succeeds in getting a state of mind, a tense atmosphere in a kitchen or in the bedroom or on the street you're having can cut and blow a knife. The worst part of all this may be acting ... at least it was my first impression. Hans, who is played by Hirschmuller, can be a stamped presence, with only the slightest movements in his face and eyes, and it does not seem like he is much of a good actor for a while. The actress who plays his wife, Irm Hermann, and her sister (Fassbinder Hanna Schygulla), costs better, but just because they are given more to do conventionally, like crying or watching. It takes time to adapt to what is essentially a void in his old Hans, something of his own psychological self-pity or self-pity that penetrates himself and those around him who just want to continue with some normality especially when Hans succeeds. is. <br /> <br /> Not everything clicks together in The Merchant or Four Seasons, but enough has made me recommend to those looking for a different cut from life than you can use. with more modern American films. Fassbinder's world here is a battle between the melodrama he loves in the movie and the hard, crushing sense of humanism he personally feels and puts in characters that somehow or better identifies us. Are the Epps a family you know of? Or can you even be it? Who's to say. This is a methodical study of tragic emptiness in the human spirit, and its goals are all attained.
