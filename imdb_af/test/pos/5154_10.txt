I have laughed a few times during this film, but give it a brief overview and you will think it's completely different. I adore the pace and the way it slowly burns in you, as you have offered this gobsmackingly beautiful tableaux. Andersson gives us something else here. Show us something I haven't seen since his last movie. He is composition exceptional and by his way of capturing the camera and for action to take place before us, he opens the door to humanity and we look at a place that reflects our own lives, our small lives. These are powerful things. This is the simplicity with which he causes events to create the opposite sense of complexity. Everything for the camera is nothing but simple. Andersson's attention to detail is exceptional. I believe most scenes, if not all, were built from scratch according to his designs. I can't recommend this movie highly enough. For me it took me to a place and I came out of a world that was weakened and beautiful, stiff and painful, barren and wonderful. At once weird and familiar. This film is brilliant and confirms life. I know, because I got out and felt smiling. It took him seven years to do this. If he just made this one movie, he would still be there with the greetings.
