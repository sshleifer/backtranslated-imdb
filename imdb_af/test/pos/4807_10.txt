Having seen just a few 200 Hong Kong movies in my time, I must say this movie is one of my top favorites. Not only is the plot appealing (and in some ways surprising, which is scarce for any movie today), but the chemistry between the two main players is wonderful. Top notch! And while even the most serious HK films often often put a little humor between all the drama and action, often spoiling the mood, jokes become subtle and woven into the plot, even enhancing character relationships. The music is also very well done, and the two main themes are very nice. With the release of the HK special edition they even cleared the picture (first edition was gritty) and the captions, even though the quality of the translation is still lacking (nothing new there). All in all, if you have to see a HK movie that is not directed by John Woo or has Chow Yun Fat in it, it should at least be on your shortlist! A truly fascinating and entertaining watch!
