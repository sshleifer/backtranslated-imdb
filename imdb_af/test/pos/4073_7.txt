I went to see this movie not expecting much, but was pleasantly surprised by the team of Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy. It was a fast movie and the hour and a half went fast. This one will definitely not win any Academy Awards, but it was a change for Mr De Niro. He's good in comedy. Overall I enjoyed it.
