It's more of the same thing that made this cartoon popular ... but who complains? It's always fun to see the poor coyote, try to get the Road Runner, and then you get all the inventions. The underground cave hunt is different from the normal price and was clever. This gave us an aerial photograph of the chase in a maze-like structure. I didn't say it was hilarious; just different from normal upper antiques. <br /> <br /> These, along with other Road Runner shorts, appear on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 and their transmissions are spectacular. The colors are wonderful.
