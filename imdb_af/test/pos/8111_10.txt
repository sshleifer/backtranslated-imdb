The Great Dictator is an extraordinary film. Charlie Chaplin succeeds in being both extremely funny and greasy, yet at the same time a strong statement in his satire against fascism. The end-of-day anti-Nazi speech by Chaplin, with its values, is one of cinema's great moments. During this film, I felt that there was a higher form of intelligence, above truly intelligent filming, at work.
