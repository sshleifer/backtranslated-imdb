I love this movie, not because Tom Selleck was in it, but because it was a good story about baseball and it also has a semi-over-dramatized view of some of the problems a BASEBALL player up to end their time in Major League sport face. I also really enjoyed the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the little facts about how the games are played differently. <br /> Overall, it's a great movie to watch on cable TV or on a cold winter rental night and watch the "Dog Day's" of summer and know that spring training is just a a few months away. A good movie for a baseball fan, as well as a good "DATE" movie ?? Trust me on that one! * Wink *
