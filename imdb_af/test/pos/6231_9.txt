I really liked this one. I know, it's clumsy with what is now clich√© plot lines, and very overworking, but it was fun. <br /> <br /> In our search for 70's and 80's horror cheeses, we find many flashes that are so bad, are good. We also have some that are so good that they suck, and then we have some that are so bad, it's just bad. It's definitely so bad, it's good. <br /> <br /> Some teenagers travel across an oasis in the middle of nowhere, a forgotten part of the road America, and they decide to check it out. They cross every line of inappropriate until it is absurd and they pay for it. They pay expensive. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't normally give a movie like this a 9, but the girls in this one are the type we missed from the 1970s: ditzy, scantily-clad and FIT. It is not the anorexic breadth of today's terrible horror; they look great in shoes. <br /> <br /> I give it a 9 out of 10 kids.
