I didn't expect much when I decided to watch this movie, so I was surprised to enjoy myself. A few scenes almost made me laugh. The characters were alluring (no pun intended); However, the story is predictable. The pleasure is to watch Crawl (Shore's character). A lovely California dude, a college girl, brings home for Thanksgiving. He tries in his uncomfortable (but engaging) way to fit in with their lifestyle. I was also surprised that there was a message. If you have a chance, see this movie!
