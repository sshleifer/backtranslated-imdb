A good film for perdentoists and most others. It's a horse racing movie, and it's a "little man who gets his chance", and it's a "how far will you go?" Movie. Walter Mattau proves his adaptability as an actor. He fits right in like a Louisiana Cajun horse-drawn Lloyd Bourdelle. This movie gives you a spectacular screen glimpse of Lousiana Cajun horse-drag racing. He has a young quarter horse that is a top racing prospect. "has nothing but a petrol station and a good horse." The Bourdelles grab the opportunity to raise it by getting the horse, Shadow, to Ruidoso, New Mexico, ready to run in the All-American Futurity. But how far will Lloyd win the fame and fortune? Also unforgettable from this movie are scenes from Lloyd that smear tobacco juice and wait for his truck to start.
