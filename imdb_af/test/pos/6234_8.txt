Slasher movies that are started can be 30 to 35 years ahead of this movie, but believe me this one under that pearl that stays longer after turning off the TV. Especially if you are easily scared, it is the movie for you for which you will not have the stomach to fill it. Even after so many years, the movie did not lose its charm and excitement. <br /> <br /> No blood, but excitement will pick your spine. the movie starts with the popping and it stays with the same pace until its end. BGM is nerve cracking and I remember it was the one that copied in many Indian movies that day. Kings favorite? No wonder why ... that's the only reason I wanted to see it and it didn't let me down. "Don't turn off the lights" ... Coz, you won't find Enrique, but can put a smiling doll right behind you! beware. not for the little heart ... <br /> <br /> Two bumps up and I go with 8 out of 10 which is pretty low but still keep my ratings for Dramas ...
