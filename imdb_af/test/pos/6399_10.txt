The biggest problem faced by the TV program Key West was that it was mis-advertised. If you've seen the ads you'd think, it was a jiggle how, and be very disappointed. It was a much more complex display than that. <br /> <br /> I was in Key West just before Hurricane Andrew hit, and I think I actually found myself having a drink or two with some of the movies in Rum Runners. Of course, it was before the show hit. I watched the sailboat that was in the opening a few times, and talk to the guy you see crocheting coconuts in the opening. He was a real local. Yes, I'd like to see it on DVD.
