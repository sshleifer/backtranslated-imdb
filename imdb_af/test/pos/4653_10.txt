I would like to sit down for the film and crew members and make a sound comment on this movie! All the different places they went to film this movie! Must provide some good anecdotes! Fans of this movie would like to know: <br /> <br /> What kind of permission did they have to place in some places on film? <br /> <br /> Was there an unforgettable excursion? <br /> <br /> Are there any scenes deleted? <br /> <br /> What challenges do the team and the crew face? <br /> <br /> Did any actors have stunt doubles? <br /> <br /> How did it work with other cast members? <br /> <br /> Were any of the screens ad libbed? <br /> <br /> What are members of the cast and crew so far? <br /> <br /> What places are there and which places are no longer there, or is it another business? <br /> <br /> It is one thing to read trivia about this movie this site and other sites. But there's just no comparison to get it straight from the horse's mouth! <br /> <br /> Come on, guys! Come along and comment! Never break away from a challenge! Go for the gusto!
