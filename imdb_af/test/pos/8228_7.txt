Do a title search on Randolph Scott and TRAIL STREET, one movie missing from the list you saw. One of the 4 films Scott made at RKO during his first (1947) is always easy to get. Liberal, Kansas is just south-west of Dodge City and is a powder jug ​​to explode between the trails that run the longhorns in Trail Street, the main street of the town, and the breast vehicles we feed. It will take a strong man like Bat Masterson to walk between the two groups and order the town. More I will not say, except that Scott films usually have only one pretty girl and one has three. RANDOLPH SCOTT has always played men that you could look out for their seriousness of honor, courage, level-headedness and willingness to do the right thing. Fifty years ago, parents could send their children to a Scott movie with confidence that they would learn positive values. ROBERT RYAN co-stars in this movie, playing a good guy for a change. In real life, RYAN was one of the many World War II Heros that stood in America's movies. How sad is what we get today. George Clooney teaches us young that we should sympathize with suicide bombers, while Steven Spielberg teaches that there is no moral difference between the Olympic athletes murdered in Munich in 1972 and the Palestinian terrorists who killed them. Hollywood 2005 brings their moral compass out of too much cocaine and too much dedication to the shaky left hand. I wonder how it all plays in Liberal, Kansas. Liberal was not a dirty word 150 years ago when the city was named.
