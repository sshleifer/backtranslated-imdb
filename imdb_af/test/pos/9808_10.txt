Even people who like the movie, usually because they get the end together, must appreciate the strong acting of Elia Wood and Joseph Mazello who played the two young leaders in this movie. <br /> <br /> Spoiler WARNING: At a literal level, the end doesn't make sense. People who think ends up at other levels are divided among those who think 1) The younger brother was killed by the stepfather, or the one time Mike (the older son) was away with the neighborhood gang or flew into the desired place his wagon to escape the situation by death and those who think 2) the younger brother is imaginary and she is flying in the wagon flying into a flying machine, indicates the overcoming of the abusive situation. <br /> <br /> I favor 2). It makes a lot of sense in terms of how many children deal with abusive situations. It is not uncommon for an abused child to divide his or her psyche and project the abuse itself into something else; a stuffed animal, even an imaginary friend. In this way it makes much more sense that it is always the younger son who is abused and never Mike. In fact, one of two brothers is unlikely to get the abuse, though. Also, this is Bobby, the younger brother who is also encouraging, the one who insists they can overcome the situation. Also, the death of a real brother or sister through abuse would be in vain for an adult with this in his history to end such a fantasy like this.
