Chucky's back ... and it's time! This time, with the help of Jennifer Tilly and a piece of Voodoo For Dummies. Well, at least with this installment, the camp is back. This was the more gruesome of this series so far. It has some good twists and some good action scenes. <br /> <br /> This one was by far the most fun of the series, and successful, as it inadvertently bridges the gap between pure horror and horror / comedy. <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to Seed or Chucky. It'll be a hoot! <br /> <br /> "Jesus, the music scene has gone to my life since I was dead!" Chucky <br /> <br /> We need the charge as the doll grows old. The added comedic element, and the better action scenes, bring this one back to evaluate the quality of the first, when the idea is fresh and new. <br /> <br /> 6.8 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> the enemy :.
