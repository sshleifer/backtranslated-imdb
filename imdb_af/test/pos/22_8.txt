What is worth mentioning in the other reviews I have read here is the subtext of how the law shaped the lives and behavior of gays in the era depicted in the film. While Courtenay's character is apparently gay, he's not the only one. He often talked about Mr. Davenport-Scott, the other. And why he's never seen, the reason he disappeared is that he <br /> <br /> we can read below the surface that this recent event disrupted Norman, Courtenay's character, and we may also be in a passing comment by Oxenby, the Edward Fox character, the rapid waiver of any connection with such a person when the law is involved: the fear of association affects many of the characters and forms part of the portrait that film paint of a time and the people who live in it. Leaving Courtenay at the end of the man is already expected, if this sub-text is included. It also makes both the inexplicable failure of his Dresser to make sense of the list of those he thanks. The flamboyance, combined with the fear of exposure, delivers the combination of desire and fear that Courtenay must "step down" as he does when he announces the impending air strikes, a scene that would otherwise be unnecessary, but that is both a symbolic and literal portrayal of the man's inner torment. <br /> <br /> So while Finney's drama's drama is falling, much of the drama of the movie and play comes from the fatal mistake of Courtenay's gayness, and makes it a movie about him as the title indicates. <br /> <br /> The art, pacing and film style of this movie seems to come from a different time, far beyond the eighties and, in some ways, even the second world war. The implicit portrait of a society still clinging to an older moral order, and the sympathy of the character trapped and destroyed by the atrocities of that order, trapped in the enclosed world of theater; and the knowledge we have of how much of it will be carried away after the war makes this movie more and more enjoyable for all its mistakes.
