Apparently, this movie was based on a true story. However, I'm not sure how accurate it is. But it reminded me how when I see someone being murdered on the news, it is wonderful how much it does not affect me. Certainly, I think it's terrible, but I honestly don't care. I continue. It seems that murder is now trivial. That's what River's Edge shows. No one really looks at this girl and her death, not even the killer. What's the point? <br /> <br /> The killer in this story is John, and for the huge amount of the movie he is hiding with another killer named Feck, played by Dennis Hopper. Feck is older, and you can see the generation gap. He says he loved the girl he killed. When he asked John if he loved the girl, he simply replied, "She was okay." The movie just seems to offer one solution: life is more important than death. A person's life is spared, people get second chances, and one hopeless thing is killed. <br /> <br /> The play is really good. After watching this movie, I just came to the conclusion that Crispin Glover is either a brilliant actor or a horrible actor. I have no idea yet. He was my main reason to see this movie. But the best performance is clearly given by Dennis Hopper. <br /> <br /> Although fashion is actually 80s and characters sometimes mention current issues, I still think River's Edge is so relevant today. <Br /> <br /> My rating: 10/10
