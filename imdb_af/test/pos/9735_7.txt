I don't understand all these bad reviews. I believe this movie was one of the best in the Puppet Master series. Based on a low budget, one can understand why the special effects and acting were not spectacular, but they weren't quite terrible. <br /> <br /> Greg Sestero brought much charisma to the role of Andre Toulon. He has a lot of potential, and I hope to see more of him soon. And while filmmaking was not excellent, and there was little violence and gore, this movie was fun. I am a great Puppet Master fan and have grown into blood and gore of the movies of this series, but I can say that I was never bored by the entire career of Retro Puppet Master. So, if you ever get the opportunity to see this movie, it doesn't automatically look unworthy of your time. Give it a chance. You might like it.
