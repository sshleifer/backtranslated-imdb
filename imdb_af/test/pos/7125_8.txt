There are a few movies waiting for me to wait for release more than this one. This is the latest film by The Dead Gentlemen Group responsible for the original Gamers movie and the Demon Hunters movies. This group has not been very active over the past few years, but this film is a definite reason to try and keep things going. <br /> <br /> This movie follows a group of gamers trying to end a GM-managed campaign frustrated by its group's negligence for its story. With the help of new blood, they try the campaign again with the hope of completing this time. <br /> <br /> This movie is a fresh air in the movie community and a great improvement over the original. The movie shows respect for the game, just as the original movie did, but this movie also shows a dramatic improvement on special effects that start it above the simplicity of college movies. The acting is pretty decent and the jokes are pretty funny. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, many jokes are jokes. If you are not a gamer, you will find the movie as funny as others. That's why I give the movie an 8 instead of the 9 I initially thought of. Anyway, if you're a gamer or know about games, watch this one, you'll enjoy it.
