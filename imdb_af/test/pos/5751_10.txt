I can't even start thinking why everyone hates this movie so much. I cried several times literally with laughter ("I trust you slept well?" "We actually had a little rough night." "Ah, the dangers of adultery."). <br /> <br /> The end is a bit flat, but still has its moments (the bow ball's obvious fake spalsh flew into the sea, beach house paradiso). <br /> <br /> Personally, I think it's the funniest movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> 10/10
