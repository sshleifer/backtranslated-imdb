* MINOR SPOILERS * <br /> Need further proof that Tsai Ming-liang ranks among the most original and challenging filmmakers today? See this movie. <br /> <br /> From the minor variations of a theme that runs most of its work, the HOLE represents a study of alienation and loneliness - in this case between a man and a woman who is above / below neighbors is. - and how varied structures (real or psychological) of modernity wall people apart. Here, the woman (the neighbor) tries to endure as her apartment is flooded with a huge leak from above. A plumber attempts to locate the source of the problem, then disappears after a large hole in the floor is created. Already isolated and desperate (both characters are one of the few residents of a housing project that did not flee from a mysterious, near-apocalyptic epidemic). The hole connecting the two apartments only functions in a long series of indignation, but soon begins a sense of close mythical relationships. <br /> <br /> Tsai's sense of humor, and the sense of film history is displayed with a little more openness than usual - as the woman's occasional daydreaming around her neighbor as musical numbers (op the music of Grace Chang) depicted in brief pieces of sensualistic, surrealistic romance and humor from the screen - remember the big screen PENNIES of the SKY. And for all the envy and alienation shown here, Tsai's shave of the 90-year-old pre-millennial tensions is funny, absurd, and gives this movie a very attractive strageness. The final scene is extraordinary. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, Tsai - typically - rejects most of the common expectations or prejudices. Westerners bring to the Asian cinema with a nonchalant, accidentally revealed directivity, focusing on both the absurd trends of human mind and the most absolute of humanity. There is an absolute, unashamed demystification of almost everything about his characters, deterioration or most cultural significance (which exacerbates the isolation of the characters). The HOLE - and its other films - are disoriented, but always fascinating and informative.
