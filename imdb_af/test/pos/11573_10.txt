This is probably the best film that has been filmed in at least the past five years. I always believed that making people cry, is much harder than letting them laugh. If you want to see 400 adults cry out loud in the same room, watch this movie. It's awesome. Javier Bardem fulfills the role of his life. You will cry, you will laugh, you will smile ... The most deserving fact is that in Spain everyone knows Ramon Sampedro. Personally, I knew the full story and even the end of it. So, the excellence of the movie is in the way the story is told. And in this field Amenabar is a MORE. <br /> <br /> This movie is a MUST.
