I can never see if this is the Art Sea Opera ever, or the Soapiest Art Movie. No matter, John Seale's cinematogaphy is quite surprising. Ondaatje's novel has not been reduced, but raised to film once. If there is a mistake, it's in the original novel, not in Anthony Minghella's beautiful movie. Anyone who has a problem with his length has almost certainly not read the book and probably cannot read. I do not like the repetition of adjectives, but surprisingly serve the purpose. <br /> <br /> Apart from the storyline, the players play out. But this is the Australian sense of light and shadow that eventually prevails. Like some antipodeous Dutch Master, Seale uses a little light, where Van Rijn would have used shade. One can visit this powerful spectacle.
