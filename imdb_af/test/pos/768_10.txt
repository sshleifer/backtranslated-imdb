pretty. I just love the movie. I want to see this movie because Rupert Grint is a fantastic actor. his expressions are wonderful, spectacular. the movie was excellent. Julie Walters was also perfect. I think Rupert is the only boy with red hair I love. Rupert has a beautiful smile, a beautiful voice. and a wonderful accent. I think the movie was great and it was great to see Rupert in another thing, but Harry Potter. And this is a very good actor, so it deserves it and more. He only has a golden world, but probably earns an Academy Academy Award. There are a few actors who do not perform very well, but at least an Oscar. it does not matter. but he is perfect, brilliant and beautiful
