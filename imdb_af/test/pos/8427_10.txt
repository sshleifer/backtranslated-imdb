I finally found a version of persuasion I want! Anne doesn't look like a girl in this version, just a very thin, aging, pretty woman, as she's described in the book. Captain Wentworth does not look like he is 50, and he does not look angry forever, but rather, as he is described in the book, he is not as old as Anne and is very attractive. And they play their parts with such beliefs and realism ... that's what it's all about. They were credible. They created real characters, and that was how the characters in the book came to life. If you haven't seen this version, I ask you to find it, order it or request it from a bookstore or library if you need to. It's worth the price and is worth the wait. <br /> <br /> I watched the 1995 version, and the 2007 version and this one over the other two. Why it's not rated is higher than my understanding. The book carries the tenderness of their relationship and this film makes the book life.
