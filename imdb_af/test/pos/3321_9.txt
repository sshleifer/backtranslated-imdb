A classic late 50's movie. The superannuated headliners (Joan Crawford and Louis Jordan) are not at their best, but the direction, cinematography, and acting of the younger role players are compelling. In a 50-year sentence (which I love). <br /> <br /> The look and art of the artificial (over-artsy?) contemporary film "far from heaven" reflects exactly this kind of movie (and I suspect this movie may be one of the models). A fool plot, of course (hey, that's 1959!), But as a movie - glorious! As a reflection of society, very interesting. And witnessing how Hollywood breaks away from the idealistic depiction of American sexual mores, captivating.
