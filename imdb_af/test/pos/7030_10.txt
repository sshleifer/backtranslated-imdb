This is the best movie ever, but this is my opinion. Some say it's cute, but I think it's really a beautiful movie. The chemistry between Jennifer Gray and Patrick Swayze is like no one else I've ever seen, making it so perfect. I always wonder what this movie would have been like if these two actors never existed, because not only did one do it for me, they both did. If you've never seen this movie, you'll understand what I mean. Dirty Dancing looks like it's been done from the heart and for some reason it feels as realistic as the magic and soundtrack. Besides the 2 main players, the soundtrack makes the beauty it is. As you can tell, I'm in love with this movie, and I know you will be.
