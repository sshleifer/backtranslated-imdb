It's a romantic, though stocking, movie that is one of my all-time favorites. This is one of the many Classics of the 80's such as "Pretty in Pink" or "Some kind of Wonderful". Nic plays the traditional punk man in love with the traditional valley, preppy girl Julie. It is a heart-warming love story that makes you root to finally win the girl. <br /> <br /> True, most of the plays suck but ... <br /> <br /> I fell in love with Nic as he saw it in the theaters and saw almost every movie he was been in since. He's really grown as an actor, but it's clear in his early film that he has a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> If you like 80's movies, you'll love these classics. <br /> <br /> Go rent it !!!!!
