Every American who thinks he or she understands World War II should see this movie. Few Hollywood films about the war doubted the stereotype of Japanese soldiers as emotional brutal without thinking. We like to think every Japanese man was ready and able to fight to death until the day we bombed Nagasaki. "Fires on the Plains" show another reality: troops are pathetically subservient, demoralized, and hungry for the point of cannibalism. They refer euphemistically to human flesh as "ape meat." The film and novel on which it was based also killed the myth that Japanese soldiers all chose to surrender death. They have good reason to believe their enemies were not in the mood to take prisoners. For me, this is a question most Americans would rather avoid: If the Japanese army were hit at this point in the war, why was it necessary to call Hiroshima?
