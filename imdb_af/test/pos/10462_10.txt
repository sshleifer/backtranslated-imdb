it's one of the best movies I've ever seen .... the crisp landscape ... the isolation ... the ignorant people who have hidden behind their religion ... a backdrop for some sense of word and sophistication ... the acting is quite natural ... but to me as a "foodie" is the best choice and preparation of the festival. I spent time in Paris knowing the kitchen well ... whether the cafe Anglais really exists or not I do not know, but I know of similar establishments and babette menus and the choice of wines is authentic ... and of course is the end where the perfect meal, in spite of themselves, exchanging themselves for friendship, the only end is there. It is a 10 out of 10 movie and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it
