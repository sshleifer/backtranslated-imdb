Andy McDermott (Tom Everett Scott) is a shy American teenage holiday in Paris with his friends Brad and Chris. Andy saves Serafine Pigot (the beautiful Julie Delpy) to commit suicide in the Eiffel tour and loved her. He doesn't know she's a werewolf. They go to an underground party and are attacked by werewolves. Andy is wounded and becomes a werewolf. He is advised that the only way to get back to normal is to kill the werewolf that attacked him and eats his heart. This movie is a violent black humor movie. The special effects and soundtrack are excellent, emphasizing the song of the band Bush. I don't know why some readers compare this movie to the masterpiece 'An American Werewolf in London'. The stories have nothing in common (just an American teen, werewolves and a city in Europe). Highly indicated for fans of werewolf and black humor films. My voice is seven. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Um Lobisomem Americano em Paris" ("An American Weapon in Paris")
