This film is one of those that cannot be seen by its appearance. Indeed, at first glance, it seems that the story simply focuses on the desire to have more money. But ...

And ... what is the "real thing"? Le's makes a deeper analysis ... - What does it mean for a small town in the border? - That means we can sometimes go too close to the border to do something we thought we could ... - What does the dry land shown in this picture mean? - That means the drought that sometimes takes possession of our sad hearts ... - What does it mean to the character of the character (CHRIST): "Now I belong to him"? - It means the loss of our free will, because of our unforeseen actions. In my opinion this is the author of the story and the director tried to "tell" us. By the way, remember what a different character (JACK BARNES) said: "Nothing's that simple ..."
