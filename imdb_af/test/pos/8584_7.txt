I suspect there is some revisionist history going on here, but one definitely comes away with the feeling that Patrice Lumumba was a problem maker who attacked his people from the moment Congo declared independence. His inability to control his people and his decision to bring in Soviet aid to get his army back was of course the United States involved and led to his murder. But by replacing the United States with Mobutu, they didn't solve anything. They made the situation just as bad. Well done with excellent cinematography and an exciting score. Definitely worth seeing.
