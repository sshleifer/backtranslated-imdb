This is the kind of movie you hire if you are incredibly tired or otherwise harmed. The acting in this movie is so bad, it seems deliberate and to let you know how bad the special effects are, there's one scene when the puppets come alive where you can see most of a hand with the puppet moving. The movie looks like it was filmed with a camcorder. When I saw this movie for the first time, a fist fight almost erupted when my friends and I called each other out of this movie, that's how terrible it was. If you like to be a movie movie, I recommend it to you, otherwise, flee as if your life depended on it.
