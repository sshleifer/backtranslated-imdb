The Beguiled is one of the subordinate films in the careers of a director and / or actor that ultimately plays better than expected. In the same year that Clint Eastwood and Don Siegel worked on Dirty Harry, they also worked together on this small psychological drama established in the Confederation country in the Civil War era. It's almost a 180 out of what "Harry" had for audiences. Here's a movie under the radar and with a low budget to almost no business compared to what Dirty Harry pulled into. It is also a story where Eastwood is not surrounded by a world of dangerous men, but women who have darker sides to them, despite their first appearance. And there is even romance in it between a rougher and more complex scene. But in this kind of frame making the movie, Siegel has just a little more freedom to do things with the style of the picture that goes into something more European. I am reminded here and there of Polanski's work in the 60's. It all works well, even with the initial doubt that these two figures of male filmmaking (Eastwood made the obvious and Siegel made his niche in B-noir and low-budget thrillers) can decrease material that can be made possible for " A lifetime movie. <br /> <br /> It was also fascinating and really dark comic here and there to see Eastwood's performance of these girls. He is doing something a little subversive in his performance by still having a kind of Eastwood machismo - if there is something like this near his click movie - by being a step ahead of this nursery school for young women, sometimes and not for others no. To watch Eastwood in a performance like this, such as Play Misty for Me (the other Eastwood work of 1971), shows how cool he can perform with very good actresses. Especially here are the four main female characters, each of different ages and each with different attractions to their "Yankee" man. While Siegel's work directs all the actors' moments in the first half, it really is when the story exceeds the halfway mark in the dream sequence (less successful than the director would be able to) picking up the right juicy scenes. Many of these are the best that Siegel has been aiming for, pushing the psychological and emotional edges of scenes where it is not expected. <br /> <br /> It's a tough movie, aside from all this, as it doesn't paint anyone To be respectful - just the character of Hallie, the slave employed by Mae Mercer, is separated from what the all too curious women and McBurney occur. In addition, Eastood plays in a role that is and is not what he is usually seen as during this time of his true formative years in the movies. He is an anti-hero here, who was his trademark of the Westerns and other thrillers he did at the time. But unlike those films, he is not really in a mode where he is "bigger than life", to put it in a way, because he is both devastating and feminine, deceptive and troublesome, even in his most beautiful and pleasant moments. If it's not one of his best acting jobs, it's really hard to put together in the light of his catalog, it's one that is a look for fans who might want to see another side of him. It's a credit for him, but also for what he clicked on with Siegel, as they both had chances in Hollywood.
