"Tales of Two Sisters" should be one of the creepiest movies I've seen recently. In the end there is no real supernatural element, despite what one is expected throughout the film. The story seems to be about two sisters who, after returning to their father's home after a kind of absence (later allegedly staying in a spiritual institution) are forced not only to a seemingly schizophrenic and possibly two-polar stepmother smearing at the younger of the girls when the mood strikes and tells her up, she has prepared a special meal at another time, but some presence is still inexplicable. It is later revealed that the younger sister is dead and only in the older sister's upset, who could not save her, and her stepmother, who was ridiculous enough to have her die. Many of the special features of the foreign family are not revealed in the film, but it certainly makes a viewer with a flu feeling and a creepy confusion. Certainly not light viewing; Look at this one if you really want to think about what you have seen. It's a hell of a puzzle.
