As far as I know, it was my first experience with Icelandic movies. It's such a relief to see something other than your regular Hollywood movie. Bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world. I can only hope people see it by accident, on recommendation or other. <br /> <br /> It's really worth it. I felt the theater left very sad. I couldn't get the tragic fate of the characters out of my head. And it impressed me even more when I thought about the complexity of the movie. Not only was it a tragic story, it has excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity, watch it! It is really thoughtful and made me think very much. <br /> <br />
