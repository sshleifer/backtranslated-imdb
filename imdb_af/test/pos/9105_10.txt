I was lucky to win free passes after the preview of POD. Just let me tell you, from just the previews I was excited to see it! The movie absolutely threw! What I really liked was the fact that JB was in his element. With other movies like "School of Rock," he does name-pamby music for kids and families, but this music is of course all his. <br /> <br /> I took my brother and sister with me to see it, and basically we laughed all the time. There are a few places where I wonder what the hell they thought, because some items are a little exaggerated, but mostly they were wonderful. Much of the time it didn't look like a low-budget movie, so it's a plus. <br /> <br /> What I was most surprised about was Dave Grohl as Satan. It's f-ing hilarious! You honestly won't know the movie sees it as it is. <br /> <br /> I say if you're a rock fan and in JB, KG and / or Tenacious D, watch the movie. Be prepared for quite a few drug references, a bunch of four letter words and a few skulls!
