I was amazed at the quality of this film, especially after seeing pictures of the rare adult director - already 140 (?) From him! Truly, a boy who directs a movie over a boy. I'm looking forward to seeing more Luke Eberl movies. <br /> <br /> I thought this one was a bit too long. There was too much time to show that Connor was unsuccessful (and unwilling) to move Owen. Caleb didn't try hard enough. Owen, who was so young, could easily have been closer to Caleb and later decided that it wasn't his preference. And Owen would still have learned the "valuable lesson" on corruption and politics. Instead, he didn't give him a fair chance to learn about his sexuality. And what about poor Caleb? Owen could have had a good influence. <br /> <br /> Although the film is about to show Owen as a hero overcoming distorted corruption, I became saddened by Owen. He had the opportunity to enjoy a son's eye with Caleb, who was exceptionally beautiful. Owen doesn't have to go along with the political perversion as offered. But he could have been very fun with Caleb and still walked away when he wanted to. It was clear that Owen was in control - no one forced him to do anything he didn't want to do. But he could have had more fun, and with a very hot boyfriend. <br /> <br /> I hope Luke makes more movies where attractive young characters have more fun.
