I saw this movie as one of the best for this time and era. The film was very exceptional and most entertaining for all who saw it. I want my younger generation to have seen this movie, but I couldn't find the movie in the past. My first look was back in the early sixties and I've been looking for it ever since. The film has shown me the potential of how far we get, to become a talented vessel, where we can only have meaningless roles to act as buffalo and servants. <br /> <br /> Porky and Bess showed some of the urban life of my area as I saw it at the time when I needed good solid male role models. The song and acting made me jump for days and played the role of different characters in this excellent movie.
