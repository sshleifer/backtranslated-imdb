I would like to submit the following. <br /> <br /> During the bridge tones, soldiers are seen in the river and asked to be taken away and escaped. Some of the soldiers approach Captain Willard's boat and try to carry their suitcases on board. Soldiers are not issued, they never carry suitcases in a combat area. They have duffle bags, suits and footlockers, but not suitcases. The use of a suitcase in this scene is absurd and out of the question. If you look now, you see the bag floating on the water. It is probably a good indication that it is empty, otherwise it will sink.
