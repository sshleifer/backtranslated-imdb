The Damian Chapa is always brilliant, she is as powerful as screen-saver as any Hollywood actor. The movie in this movie is perfect. Each character made the story more complete. The cinematography was fascinating and it raised the film. I was completely stuck on the screen and couldn't stop watching it, there was no popcorn or anything. This movie is one of the best all year, maybe even the best. Definitely rent this movie, I recommend this movie if you want to see a big movie or just for pure entertainment.
