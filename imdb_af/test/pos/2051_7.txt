Let me start by saying overall I enjoyed The Long Kiss Goodnight. I'll give it a 7/10. The Good: 1. Acting: Samuel L Jackson is entertained in almost any role. In this movie he does not play his usual character, the type that is in control, but Geena Davis is in control and Sam is together for the ride. His timing on his lines is wonderful and he is the highlight of the movie. Geena Davis also gives a good appearance as Samantha Caine / Charlie Baltimore. She is a credible action hero and I don't think too many other actresses can pull off Geena Does. 2. The Action: This is a very active movie. Things are pretty much always cracked or inflated or someone is looking for someone else. The special effects are pretty good, especially since it's almost 8 years old. I can see some green screen stuff, but it doesn't add too much to the acting. <br /> <br /> The Bad: 1. Why did it take half the movie to compile the plot? This film had to be edited in the turning stage so it didn't last as long. Maybe a drama or something can run, but people really have to be in the movie all the time to maintain it. I think if you can stick out the first half, you'll be gracious for the second half. 2. Geena Davis is cold weather and a tank, but she never looks cold. 3. Some things are unrealistic. Sam Jackson flies through a giant sign after throwing it out of a room and then landing in a tree and just getting up. If you see this section, you'll think it's a gag. overall fun movie 7/10
