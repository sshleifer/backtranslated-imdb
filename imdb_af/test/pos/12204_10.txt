It's the first sci fi series I've ever touched since Star Trek (and I didn't watch Trek in years). It takes the invasion theme in slightly different directions, but did so in a very exciting way. It also borrows from the soap opera format, where it runs throughout the year. The CGI certainly does not overcome the plot or characters, except for Nim, the superior creatures that are a pet with a particular attitude. (Anything that would show what he really thinks of the neighbor's puppy is A-1 in my book.) He was a stroke of genius. <br /> <br /> I'm finishing the final questions (intelligent people, I hope) and going over my fingers and toes that NBC or anyone else (Sci Fi, maybe) will continue to run the series and answer the questions. <br /> <br /> A very large, attractive display.
