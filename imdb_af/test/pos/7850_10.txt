This movie has some shocking scenes and subject matter since it was created in 1971. <br /> <br /> Clint Eastwood, Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman are doing great work in the movie, like all the role-players. /> During the Civil War, the film begins when a wounded Yankee soldier, Johnny, portrayed by Clint Eastwood, refuge and aid at a girls' academy in the south. <br /> <br /> The principal of the school, Mrs. Farnsworth (Geraldine Page), one teacher Edwina (Elizabeth Hartman) and a small group of half-grown girls, is without a man in the middle without a man. > <br /> While their loyalty to the Confederation lies, their emotions and physical needs have certainly led them in the opposite direction. Johnny immediately uses his male charm to try to win the women to his side - and keep them from persuading him of the patrols. <br /> <br /> But feelings made earlier by unwavering behavior, an adulterous father, a brutal rape and adolescent inexperience combined with jealousy - turn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both Johnny and the residents of the school. <br /> <br /> 10 stars
