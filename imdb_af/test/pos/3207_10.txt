I'm not the type of person to watch TV shows because the play usually sucks or it's unrealistic or too dramatic! But this show is perfect. Everyone can act, and you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has their own personality and Lorelai Gilmore is the best for her sarcastic comments that can make any bad situation, which seems a bit funny. Rory Gilmore is a good role model for all girls. She is proud to attend Harvard and boys / boyfriends always come second in her book. She is a loyal friend and always the peacemaker. There is subtle romance that I personally want. Not the juicy savory romance that doesn't have many people in their lives, but a realistic kind of romance. Every character eventually gets it, and they don't even get their princess at first glance and they don't just fall in love with every man coming their way. It's a realistic show, but when you see it, you better brush your movies, pop culture and random facts, because Lorelai Gilmore always makes references. I fell in love with this show and if you give it a chance, you want it too.
