I found the movie very interesting. I really enjoyed the movie, the actors were great. It was fun. Benny, the uncle, was wonderful. He was genuine to his character. The end made a wonderful turn. I would recommend seeing it. Eddie Mores's girlfriend reminded me of a little sandra bull, she was sharp like a nail. I also like the little girls who are in the movie. She was very convincing. Benny reminded me of a friend of mine who really grew up in Brooklyn. I loved the scene where he tasted the sauce in the pot, because that's how most people cook. I watched the movie 2 times and learned the second time more.
