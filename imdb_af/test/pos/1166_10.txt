One of the best 'old' movies I've ever seen should be the Wind and the Lion. Gad, the screens ... Raisouli's bandits swarm over the wall ... A quiet British gentleman comes out of tea calmly with Candice Bergen and drops three of them with a Webley turret in his dress. A whisper of the Spirit of the Empire ... Let us forget! Let us forget! <br /> <br /> US Marines come from the long, long way from the country. _Brooklyn_. They had powers, it had to be read, but, oh wow. And the Winchester 97 blows big holes in relentless natives and even more ridiculous and faithful Europeans ... <br /> <br /> Raisouli - Sean Connery, oh, Wow! - wonder "What kind of gun does Roosevelt use?" <br /> <br /> Teddy Roosevelt - Brian Keith, o, Wow! - Wonder: "What kind of gun does Raisouli use?" And writes another angry letter to Winchester about the stock at his Winchester 95. <br /> <br /> Raisouli, armed with a sword ... a Prussian Cavalry Officer, Hollowing his gun and pulling his sword ... Honor. It's been a long dead, of a far-away world, but Raisouli would never have flown a plane full of kids in a building. <br /> <br /> Milious at Milious's wonderful best, and now on DVD.
