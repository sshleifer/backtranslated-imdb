The silent film masterpiece Battleship Potemkin (1925) was commissioned by the Soviet government to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the 1905 uprising and to establish the event as a heroic advance of the October 1917 revolution. Ironically, director Sergei Eisenstein was one of the earliest and most influential advocates of a formalist approach to filmmaking. Next, Eisenstein's formalism and suspiciously politically innumerable conflicts with government agencies would insist on "socialist realism". The influence of Russian film theorist Lev Kuleshov, and by him by DW Griffith's Intolerance (smuggled into Russia in 1919), Eisenstein built up his films from a clash of fast-edited images, a fitting of shots in length, motion , content, lighting and camera angle. Without questioning the most memorable illustration of Eisenstein's stylistic approach - and probably the single most cited and studied sequence in world-world theater history - is the "Odessa Steps" series in Potemkin. <br /> <br /> In structure, Potemkin is a "five reel" divided into five narrative parts, an organization clearly derived from the five-action arrangement of Western drama. In "Men and Maggots", Eisenstein dramatizes the pre-revolutionary oppression and dissatisfaction of the battleship's working class sailors, as the situation inevitably builds into mutiny. Even before the sailors and their top class officers / masters are introduced visually, Eisenstein symbolizes revolutionary conditions through the collision of waves that break violently and ominously at sea. On board the ship we see crowded, unhygienic conditions. Eisenstein emphasizes the sailors of the sailors with shots of random lashings, hard labor, and - most memorably - the intestine meat intended for the evening's meal. The ship's cautious doctor is brought forward by the other officers to make the meat perfectly suited to serve with the dark soup, which cooks like the sailors' anger. In line with Marxist maxims, the church also fails the men, and we see that one of them damages a board with words from the Lord's Prayer from two different angles of the camera (perhaps the first deliberate jumping jump in cinema history). <<p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> p> <p> <p>, Vakulinchuk. United by Vakulinchuk's call on brotherhood, the initial murderers are joined to the entire crew in an attack on the officials. A chaotic scene occurs whose violent passion is well served by Eisenstein's editing techniques. The officials' departure was trampled and symbols of their privilege were destroyed. The ship's doctor is thrown overboard, accompanied by dramatic intersections on the chopped meat and his glasses that hang in a rigid manner. Tragically, Vakolinchuk's death is the price paid for the uprising (no omelette without breaking eggs) and he was laid out on a Odessa pier with dignity. Hundreds of ordinary Odessa citizens meet with the sailors to honor and promise him "Kill the oppressors." Shots of fists that restraint and denouement indicate the birth of the revolutionary consciousness. <br /> <br /> The complex and memorable Odessa Stage series is the film's fourth act. It starts with exciting music and a series of close-ups and medium shots on the elevated faces of diverse people on the beach and selected objects (parasol, glasses, baby). Suddenly (like a big-card title card) the music and lines of soldiers with drawn guns stop and fixed bayonets appear at the top of the stairs. Here, Eisenstein releases the full power of collision editing, as nearly a hundred shots are joined to contrast the panic chaos and victimization of citizenship with the relentless assault of the soldiers driving the burghers to the trampling horses and the sabers of the guard bags underneath . The mise-and-scene is by a statue of Caesar on top of the stairs and a church at the bottom, symbolic metonyms for Russia's oppressive institutions: Tsarist monarchy and the Orthodox Christian church. <br /> <br /> Puncturing The sequence is two scenes involving mothers and children. First and foremost, a mother and young boy who was introduced to the crowd in the joyful faces, is one of the victims' first victims. The boy was shot, but the mother continued until her neighbor's face trampled her terrible glance over the sun's fallen body, crushed by the crowd. With a very delayed editing tempo, the camera follows the mother as she carries the lifeless body of her child on the stairs to confront the soldiers (shown in a diagonal line only). They kill her death. After this silence, the massacre continues for a few dozen cuts until a second mother is shot by the stomach (mother's mother's womb?) If she tries to protect her baby in his car. In a scene beloved imitated in The Untouchables, the wagon slips down the stairs illegally. Frustrated faces of devastated civilians look to the slow progress to his punishment. When the wagon reaches the bottom, there is a cut to a Kossack carrying a sword, and proposing a classic Kuleshov effect that we do not actually see: the slaughter of this pure and symbolically innocent. The final series of shots in the Odessa series are of three stone lions, one in rest, one seat and one roar. The editing puts them in a visual metaphor of the rage of the people. <br /> <br /> Something anticlimactically, the fifth act returns us to the battleship when the common sailors flee to the open sea and wait for a meeting with other ships. the fleet. They and the viewer expect retribution, but when the meeting takes place, no shots are fired and all the sailors move and throw their hats in the air in a symbol of companionship. Eisenstein has rewritten this history since the revolution has not been successfully launched for twelve years. But this is an issue, Battleship Potemkin is one of the most important works of the silent film, and it retains extraordinary film power.
