I remember seeing this 1978 comedy with one of the buying experts I adopted when I was studying a break from my college courses. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson do an effective Tracy-Hepburn style set in this featherweight skirt by the trusted Howard Zieff (he has "Private Benjamin") over a new widow's aggressive re-entry into the dating game. It is fast becoming mainly thanks to the clever writing by writer Julius J. Epstein ("Casablanca"), along with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer. <br /> <br /> Dr. Charley Nichols just returned from Hawaii after his wife's death. Upon his return, he became aware that he was the only only woman in LA immediately. He works in a hospital managed by an increasingly senile head of staff, Amos Willoughby, who has to pacify Charley to keep his residence. An English-transplanted woman, Ann Atkinson, bakes cheesecakes for a living and has some concrete views on the medical profession, which she expresses freely on a PBS talk show. Of course, Charley is on the show's discussion board, and sparks, as they say, fly. This leads to the standard complications of how serious Charley is about becoming Ann. At the same time, the hospital is faced with a possible wrongdoing of the widow of a rich baseball team owner who died in Willoughby's careless hospital supervision. <br /> <br /> It is just refreshing to see such a full-grown, but love-story, two-character story by actors who line up with surgeon's scallop skills. Matthau is his usual 1970s cricket swinger and a beautiful face that staggered with his gang weapons, Akimbo kept in his power step. Away from her heavy, award-winning Elizabethan roles, Jackson is critically sardinian and beautifully vulnerable than Ann's festive, who thinks all doctors should be aspects of Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable bluster, while Richard Benjamin provides amiable support to Charley's colleague, dr. Solomon. It's very compact with some nice jabs at the greed in the medical profession. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.
