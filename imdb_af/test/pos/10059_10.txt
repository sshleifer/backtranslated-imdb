Why do everyone feel that they have to film this film all the time? It's cute and funny (exactly what it is meant for). Madonna was unable to prove herself as Oscar Calliber artist with this movie! She just did what the character called, and she did it well. I loved her in this movie; this is my second favorite Madonna movie after Evita. The soundtrack is also excellent. It's no better or no worse than any flash of a cheesy 80. For all the critics, don't take it so seriously and you might have fun watching it. Madonna is a goddess !!!
