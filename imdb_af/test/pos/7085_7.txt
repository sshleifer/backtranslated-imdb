"One True Thing" places Zellweger in the middle of a family crisis as an adult journalist returning home to go to her dying mother (Streep). Gloomy and plodding, the film studies the adult child who agrees with the older views of her parents, as they are slowly being revealed to be something less than the ideal she grew up to know as a child. An excellent character study and finding production with few errors, "OTT" offers three fine performances by a trio of top actors and some distinctive reflection on life and death.
