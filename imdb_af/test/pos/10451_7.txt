Yes, it's a Fast Times wannabe, but it's still decent entertainment. <br /> <br /> Some of the comedy parts are really funny. The scene when the three guys visit the Spanish lady is hilarious, with a small flamenco music in the background. The reaction when her sailor comes home is a riot. The guys' exploits in crab handling are also funny as they try to "drown" them and when they visit the pharmacist. <br /> <br /> The abortion scene is also a Fast Times ripoff, but it does do a good job of capturing the terror of the situation. You really feel what Karen is going through, and Gary in his bruised cash to pay the abortion and accommodate her recovery. <br /> <br /> The end is painful to look at, but refreshingly realistic. First-time viewers will not be prepared for it and it will be a shock. <br /> <br /> There is a decent eye for guys with young girls and the milf Spanish lady, but heterosexual guys will probably want to skip the penis measurement competition. <br /> <br /> Underlined soundtrack too. Watch early, early U2 (!), The Cars in their first and an appropriate tearjerker song by James Ingram for the surprise. <br /> <br /> Some people will hate it and it's somewhat dated, but those who like adolescents or grown up in the early 80's should love it.
