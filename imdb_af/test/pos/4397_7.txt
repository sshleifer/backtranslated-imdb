The Coen Brothers did it again. Three suspects of the depression era (George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson) escape from a Mississippi chain gang and go away looking for buried treasures that will fund their new lives. Along the way they sing on the radio and become very sought after stars as well as escape. Great laughter and a soundtrack that is a lesson / introduction to bluegrass music. <br /> <br /> Clooney is outstanding as the fast, fast, popular Ulysses Everett McGill. Holly Hunter plays his estranged wife. Turturro and Nelson are incessant stumbling blocks. Also in the movie are John Goodman and Charles Durning. <br /> <br /> Dan Tyminksi gives the singing voice to George Clooney on "I'm A Man of Constant Sorrow", the Soggy Bottom Boys song that serves as a template for the bluegrass loaded soundtrack, which also includes Alison Krauss. Ralph Stanley, The Whites, John Hartford, The Cox Family and Gillian Welch contain. Then tap, knee slap fun for the whole family. You will be amazed at how relaxed and funny this movie is.
