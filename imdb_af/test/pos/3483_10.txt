Michael (played by Steven Robertson) has cerebral palsy, and lives a quiet and dull life in Carrigmore Residential Home. When a newcomer at home, Rory (McAvoy), befriends him, he continues to show Michael how to live on the disability. Despite, or perhaps because of, Rory's crippling disability (can't just move his head and some figures on his hand), Rory is completely independent and extremely rebellious. His influence on the silence and reserve Michael is spectacular, and the two soon leave the care home to settle out in the outside world, recruiting the help of Siobhan (Romola Garai) as an assistant. <br /> <br /> This movie is one of the gems of the year! Just like last year's In America, the movie is going to be very funny, anxious, touching, disturbing, and really moving without once appearing to be saccharin sweet. To know exactly where to go to the heartbeat and where to simply make the story and characters do their thing, O'Donnell has made a wonderful movie telling us all to look and see what is inside. lies. /> <br /> The real strengths of the film come in the lead actors. So convincing are their characters that you truly believe they are disabled. Moving forward to convey humor and sadness to overall performances is wonderful. The couple really look closest friends, and as their story unfolds, they care for them. <br /> <br /> It's definitely one of the best examples of film this year, which simply tells a very relevant story. If this film does not touch your heart, you must contain pure ice in it.
