For the man who hatched the idea for Lifeforce, I have one thing to say: Thank you, sir! Life Force combines the big-budget sci-fi pump from Star Trek: The Motion Picture with the cheap horror excitement of Phantasm and throws it all off with t-ts - and some real meat cutters .. And best of all , it's actually a good movie! It surprised me that someone actually justified a mainstream movie, which is a hot chick vehicle that appears to producers one hour and a half for producers. God bless you, everyone involved. <br /> <br /> Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter) plays Col. Carlson, the US Commander of an International Space Mission, sent to investigate Halley's Comet. Carlson's crew finds an alien vessel in the comet and inside they find three naked people in suspended animation - two guys and a warm broad (Mathilda May). Well, to make a long story short, they are "space vampires" ... naked "space vampires." They throw the crew apart from coal. Blueballs who decided that he should leave the chick out of her lucite showcase because the part of his brain that controls his nutrient fluids told him it was the right thing to do. The Col. Wrap it back to our big blue ball in an escape farmer. Meanwhile, another spacecraft team has discovered its shipwreckage dead in space and brought back the three Spaceships of the Living Dead Martians back to London. And that's when people start turning in pork, and usually they just get out of hand quickly. <br /> <br /> Carlson teams with the infinite Col. Caine (Peter Firth) of British SAS To find our naked cutie - who has one hell of time to suck left and right parents. Carlson has discovered that he has a mental link with Vampira that allows them to track her, with the ultimate goal of blowing her ass and destroying her and her big space umbrella, which battles the energy of the people who vampire attack. Will they succeed in time? MINOR SPOILER: Yes. <br /> <br /> Wow. What can I say, but "Wow"? This damn film really works. I can't believe they have shown real British actors like Aubrey Morris (A Clockwork Orange) and Patrick Stewart (Sexiest Man Alive or some sort of such title) in this movie. All the actors are good. Direction is good and really shines in the last half where we see the fantastic destruction of London. Special effects are also not bad. For 1985, this movie should be the s - t as far as eg. All the effects are quite impressive and there is a wide variety of on-screen talent here in animotronics, makeup effects, light screens, and very nice space tones with some good old fashioned modeling and carpet painting - very well done. There are even a few gore and bloody shots for all the horror fanboys out there. <br /> <br /> Lifeforce is a great movie for anyone who has nostalgia for when popular movies on the bigsce are made with 100% love from start to finish. The creators of the movie really made sure all the bases are covered and the end result is a phenomenal fun relationship that won't let you go, because the proceedings are just too good. Real solid entertainment here: 8 1/2 out of 10.
