** Warning! Small plot spoilers for! ** <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job" is not the best movie you will see all year, or even this summer. But it's a good two hours because it knows colors within the lines, its boundaries and doesn't try to exceed them. <br /> <br /> What the film carries is the work of the cast. In a movie about a crew of thieves, individuals need to have a good report with each other. Without that cohesive feeling, the audience doesn't believe in the characters collectively or individually, and the movie never has a chance. But of the first scenes where the men are drinking and holding each other while infiltrating a venetian palace, the right chemistry is in place. The characters themselves are not something new; They are your basic gang of criminals, which contain about half a dozen players, each with a specific and definition skill. But every actor brings the right goods to the table for his or her share. Mark Wahlberg's underestimate play and humor fit well with his role as the master brain planner. Edward Norton gives attitude and turns his mustache well into his dark role. Donald Sutherland is the couple's crew, and he sees the part of the cute and old-fashioned thief, who is still spiritually staggering. Jason Statham, Seth Green, and Mos Def don't do much beyond their character's abilities, but each nails those parts. Statham as the smooth driver; Green as technology worm geek with a slide on its shoulder; and Def as the demolition man. Charlize Theron slips well into a part that doesn't ask too much from her. She is mainly asked to drive fast and look good. That she does. None of the characters are as deep or three-dimensional, but in this familiar type of film, two dimensions are all that is needed. <br /> <br /> As the title suggests, the film has a European feel to it, a low "The Bourne Identity", partly because it was shot at Venice, along with Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Also contributing to the Euro flair is the rhythmic, bouncy music, which adds to the exciting nature of the movie and complements the role-play report. The look of the movie is also a perfect match. The bright colors of all places increase the mood and add to the attitude. The Minis not only offers a fun variation on the car hunt, but also works as an essential plot device. <br /> <br /> The plot is more or less straight ahead. There are a few surprises, but they are more of the fast and smooth variety, as opposed to the drop-your-jaw hairpin curve. Even with that, the movie speeds up. As soon as the foundation is laid by the first law, everything is progressing constantly. Fortunately, there is no break in the action for a romance, something that the movie wisely avoided. There is not even a break for a real life. "The story has its purpose and runs that course without distraction. The lack of character depth prevents "The Italian Job" from being a good popcorn movie, but with all the complex details of the heist planning, such superfluits would reduce the quality and quality of the movie. <br /> <br /> There are a number of disabilities I thought of both during and after viewing. But the movie is so nice that I didn't do it and didn't care. In the real world, most of the movie may not be completely gone. But "The Italian Job" does not occur in the real world. It is found in an attractive and light criminal world that addresses the rebel in all of us. <br /> <br /> "The Italian Job" is a movie, in the true sense of the word. It has no Oscar's pretenses and does not contain a deep moral message. It provides pure escapism entertainment and does it very well. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Perhaps the best popcorn film of the year so far. 7 out of 10.
