Here's a movie that's pretty much going on, with good performances by everyone and three strong leading performances by Hanks, Seymour Hoffman, and a fine coming from Julia Roberts who tied me off the first few seconds. These are performances It lifts the production to the stars and lasts it for the duration. <br /> <br /> Apart from one or two very small factual problems with writing, the only thing this movie is dropping is the technical direction. There is too much fudged continuity and a number of camera cheats that simply don't work. It's surprising for a movie of this stature, and it's a bit annoying to watch, but it doesn't destroy an otherwise beautifully crafted movie.
