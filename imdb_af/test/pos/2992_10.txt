I loved this movie! O MY EARTH! This movie went so hard! I found it under old tapes and didn't know what it was and after reading the back of the cover to see what summer had to say about it (Which VAT mentioned the fact that Elton John covered the soundtrack for the movie had more than what it said about the movie.), I thought it sounded interesting, and I was even more interested in seeing it because it was an older movie. <br /> <br /> "What controversy?" I thought to myself while putting the tape in the player, I was curious what I got. And my expectations were surely met. I love it! I think it's a very girly kind of movie, but it was so nice and beautiful! It was a beautiful novels, although the director sometimes reminded me of the camera work in 'The Graduate', which I thought the director had been acidic with some of the close-ups they did. /> <br /> OK, so it was not quite conceivable that these two kids run off and live on their own ... but that can happen ... in a fantasy ... <br /> <br /> But the end just disapproved of me! I was so crazy about how they ended it. It lets you stop hanging out and I think they can address what actually happens to them in the future. But I am almost reluctant to see it, as persecutors are almost never as good as the first. <br /> <br /> I recommend this movie to everyone sixteen and older! It's an amazing movie ... Awesome!
