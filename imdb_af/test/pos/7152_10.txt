saw this movie and loved the characters altogether. It's definitely my kind of movie you don't get bored in this movie. I love independent movies. They are so much more rewarding. my husband and I really enjoyed Jay's style. If you are an open-minded person who loves love movies and loves love conversations after it is over, he will love this movie. It is definitely thought provocation. The movie will surely rise on some toes, but who cares for the people will probably not see this movie. It's great to see the characters develop. Jay Floyd really caught both sides of the table. Applause applause Jay I hope you are working on another movie.
