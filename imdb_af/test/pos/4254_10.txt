I saw this movie in its short run in an art house theater in '69. I found it so funny that I literally spent a part of the movie on the floor, I laughed so loudly that I fell from my seat. In retrospect, years later, I thought it was done by Melvin Van Peebles. When I mentioned this to a friend, he said a friend of Downey sr. Virtually every non-acting role in the movie filled: Director, Author Producer, etc. Of course he was right and my memory was wrong, except that it was one of the funnies movies ever made. The part of the "Arab" was particularly precious.
