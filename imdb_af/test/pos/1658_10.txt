For starters, I have done some more research on the film. Firslty, Jules Dassin director and acted in these highly imaginative and different film noir crime films. Secondly, it was a very low budget film, created in the Rennaissance of the first moment of film noir. Thirdly, the jewelers where the robbery was committed are real jewelers. The producers of Rififi asked them to film them surprisingly (I quote Jules Dassin in a recent interview on the subject, "Surprisingly, for some not very obvious reason, they were delighted with the idea that a crime movie put in their store). <br /> <br /> These are impeccable characters and intrigue that are so beautifully suited to their environment. To add it to my praise, I will say, some may say it's a typical Hollywood movie, on the contrary, it is Laslty, I would like to say that I support this new idea of ​​a movie where not only one side wins, and the side should not always be good. For once I can say that " a movie is not predictable! Ten stars!
