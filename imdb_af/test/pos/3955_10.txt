I recently saw Blind Spot in Coyoacan, where it attracted a lot of crowds and some very intense discussions. I really admired the story and the visual approach. The action is frightening and the mood of loneliness that the film projects are wonderful. There is a lot of beauty in the melancholy surrounding these three misfit heroes. Not only in the desert but also in the city. My best scene was after the boy discovered his friends in the apartment and then ran his skateboard through all the remarkable lights of the city. You really feel this man. I have never heard of the actors, but I liked a lot of all three. I think they did a tremendous job on their journey to self-discovery. All in all, it's an incredibly cool and exciting exciting movie. I still carry many of the images in my mind.
