It's hard to know which category to place this movie. Most films set in this period of American history are western, but instead of the wide open plains of the west, the action is almost entirely limited to a claustrophobic girls' school in Louisiana <br /> <br /> The film opens with Amy, a young girl, who runs all the bush mushrooms. As she does, she bumps into corporate John McBee McBurney, a wounded Union soldier, who takes her back to school. We know he's not a very nice person when he kisses her on the lips, distracting her from the warning of a passing Confederate patrol, even though she told him she was twelve. <br /> <br /> Once back at the school's views is divided on what needs to be done with their new guest, some think they should look after him until his wounds are healed, while others believe it is betraying him not transferring to the confederate forces at the first opportunity. The former group is ruling and it is gradually recovering. As he does, his presence has an impact on all the girls who have not had a man on the site long ago, including a young teacher and the chief whose previous relationship with her own brother seems to be. McBee encourages them to seduce them emotionally, if it is not physical, it leads to considerable jealousy among the girls. <br /> <br /> While this movie is fifteen, it's certainly not for younger viewers, both for the sexual content, of which little one is actually shown, but many are implied, and for a very disturbing scene that has been playing more than any other scene in a movie for some time. It is interesting to see how Clint Eastwood plays against type, rather than heroic, his character is unpleasant and for most of the time the grace of the women around him. The play is all over, not just from Eastwood, but also from all the actresses, including the young Pamelyn Ferdin who played Amy.
