There are very few films that can tell such a complicated story at so many levels, as well as Mishima: a life in four chapters. One of the most difficult aspects of storytelling is the ability to flash back and forth without losing the tempo of the movie. This movie does not just flash back and forth with the greatest ease, but also flows through some of Yukio Mishima's greatest stories. This movie exceeds in all respects and is a joy to watch. Not to mention the amazing Philip Glass Soundtrack.
