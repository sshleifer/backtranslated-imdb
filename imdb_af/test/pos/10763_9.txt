I really enjoyed Fierce People. I accidentally discovered the movie, looking for my On-Demand movie lists, to find something interesting to watch. The movie is mostly about the class in America, and it quickly gets your attention. The characters are clever and articulate and the story doesn't adhere to the usual Hollywood rules. <br /> <br /> The main character is Finn, a provisional but underprivileged 15-year-old who spends her summer with the Osbourne family. Donald Sutherland plays patriarch, Ogden C. Osborne, the seventh richest man in America. Diane Lane plays Finn's mother, a friend of Ogden, who is also an ordinary cocaine user and a slut. The Osbournes owns a large estate and looks according to their own rules. First, it looks like it's charming and sophisticated, but the super-rich are different. They are used to getting their own way. The movie is enjoyable because it has a sharp intelligent dialogue, wonderful play and a story that takes unexpected turns. It's also an R-rated movie, so it's not quite healthy. <br /> <br /> The cast is excellent. Anton Yelchin is credible and sympathetic in Finn's demanding role. Sutherland and Diane Lane have never been better. Chris Evans is impressive as Osbourne's apostate grandson. Kristen Stewart is good as the pretty big daughter. High quality film.
