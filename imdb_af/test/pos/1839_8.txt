This movie has no appearance to be good art, which is good. But it is a well-written script with well-developed characters and solid acting. I think if I wrote it, I could do without the drama around the woman, but it was not distracted to detract from the main story of Minnie Driver's character. I think Hollywood always leaves an attempt at real quality writing to try and inject more visual drama. With a mature theme movie like this, the emotional type of drama is all that is really needed - and probably more credible. Overall, this is a very well done offer and worth seeing.
