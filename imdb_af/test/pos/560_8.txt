It's an extraordinary movie. As a courtroom drama, it is compelling, as a charge on the US legal system, it's frightening. For Brenton Butler, the effects of this system can be devastating. This film highlights the fundamental errors of the legal process, that it is not about the discovery of guilt or innocence, but rather about who is better off in court. In fact, the implications of this matter reach beyond the possibility that an innocent man is found guilty or a guilty man is free. Every citizen has a right to justice, either an offender or a victim. But do they get it? The movie is well played, underestimated and one of the best courtroom documentaries I've seen.
