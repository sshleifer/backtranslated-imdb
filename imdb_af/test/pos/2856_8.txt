Betty Sizemore (Renee Zellweger) lives her life by soap Opera "A reason to love" as a way to escape her husband and dull life. After a shocking incident involving two hits (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), Betty goes into shock and travels to LA, and believes she is destined to marry the show's lead character (Greg Kinnear). <br /> <br /> Nurse Betty is that rare thing, a lesser-known movie with an all-star cast and a soft Rom-Com plot that surprises with its brilliant screenplay and mockery of acting. Indeed, such a plot raises one question the R score, but it is fair. The shocking incident that Betty sends over the edge is a bit too graphic compared to the light, amusing comedy that comes and feels like something from another movie, but at the same time it is necessary to show Betty's transformation credibly in the do eyes, sweet nut work she becomes. <br /> <br /> As we travel with Betty on her journey, director Neil LaBute works out of an extraordinary magic that makes the movie unique and high above your standard comedy of error. An example of this is Betty's first encounter with her loved one. She throws her heart towards him and he plays together and thinks his audition for a part on the show. Even if we are aware of the ridiculous nature of Betty's ramblings, the music swells as she speaks, giving us the audience, Betty's emotional perspective. We almost believe what she says, but we understand her mind is broken. About other filmmakers will try to emphasize the ludicrousness of the situation to eradicate every gram of possible comedy from the scene. LaBute is sensitive to his main character and treats her with the greatest sympathy and understanding. <br /> <br /> The Banter between the hits played by Freeman and Rock is priceless, the excellent writing that breaks the smart line apart. Freeman in particular is excellent as always, and adjusts herself as his character slowly and blindly in love with Betty's own ideal, not even knowing who she is or what has happened to her. Aaron Eckhart once again shows versatility in the ungrateful role of Betty's good man and he is almost unrecognizable. The other revelation here is Kinnear, whose portrayal of the soap's star is not too excessive. There is a tendency to lay as thick as possible on the celebrity bastard clich√©, and resist Kinnear, instead of wearing a pumping, yet self-sufficient restraint, in spite of just a soapstone. <br /> <br /> The soap operation is realized. as well, it can hardly exist. LaBute and also the nail on the head with this one and also a good thing. If the soap opera were too satirical, much of the movie wouldn't work. Doing a "Days of Our Life" is a spoof as seen in Friends, the wrong move for this movie. The dedication to detail pays, as the soap opera's style and feel of Betty's reality is increasingly being exposed, while remaining with the overall unintended comic aspect of the genre. The screens on the set really feel, unlike some movies in which the atmosphere is so produced, you wondered why people who do it for a living can't get it right. <br /> <br /> The neat resolution of The Final Act, while it is a bit predictable, is entirely satisfactory. It is a pity that after LaBute directed this wonderful movie, the mainstream asked him to lead the deadly remake of The Wicker Man, a good example of a man so completely above the material given to him. Unfortunately, no one can free himself from all responsibility. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen Nurse Betty, it's something to discover. If you have, it's worth visiting again. There is a charm for Nurse Betty who is contagious, even if it doesn't make you think much. A hidden gem.
