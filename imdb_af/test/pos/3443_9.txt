I definitely agree with my previous commentator in describing it as a sounding, fascinating and definitely beautiful movie. It is not necessary to see all the episodes as the first one is the best, while the last one is a bit tiring, but for anyone who loves Germans and their good manners, all episodes are worth it see. In typical German fashion, values ​​are constantly questioned, even the murderous Nazi past is confronted in the last episodes. The rich dialogue is particularly interesting. These episodes are recommended for anyone who wants to live or travel in Germany, preferably in the original language !! <br /> <br />
