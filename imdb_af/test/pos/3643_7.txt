Based on the manga (comic strip) of well-known artist Masamune Shirow, this animation feature was a slight disappointment to me. <br /> <br /> The story is good, but the animation is just "OK" while it could / should have thought. The movie is IMO adequate but somehow looks flat and uninspired, if you know what I mean. A waste of chance, if you think another work by Shirow, "Ghost In The Shell", is in many ways considered a classic. It set new standards for Japanese animation, including a brilliant series called "GiTS: Stand Alone Complex". <br /> <br /> I think it's worth a rent unless you're a fan of Shirow. and want it all. Check out the original manga, which is highly recommended.
