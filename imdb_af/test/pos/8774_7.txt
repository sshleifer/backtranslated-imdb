Overall, it's entertaining and strange movie. Don't try to make sense. There are more holes in the story than a computer can keep, but Robert Cummings and a throw of smaller characters are mostly fun to watch in this "Quick" story. <br /> <br /> Unlike the popular TV show and then 1993 movie, this refugee is not looking for an armed man, but a two-armed Nazi saboteur by the name "Frank Fry." Cummings ("Barry Kane") gets blamed when a defense in Los Angeles blows up and looks for the lamb for the man who did it. (Fry) to clean his name. <br /> <br /> The first 40 minutes or so are very tense and interesting. Then come Priscilla Lane ("Pat Martin") in the story, and it starts with a bit of juicy dialogue. Director Alfred Hitchcock often did this with his female characters, to the point that I wonder if he had an idea of ​​how the woman was talking. Lane's character here was a bit crippled. <br /> <br /> The villains that Otto Kruger ("Charles Tobin") and Norman Lloyd (Frank Fry) played were actually the best, in my opinion. ... not fascinating. Kruger's acting and dialogue were especially good. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this movie, but have seen Hitchcock's well-known "North By Northwest", you'll end up and really enjoy it. Instead of a climactic scene at Mount Rushmore, we have a memorable last 10 minutes at the State of Freedom. As usual, Hitchcock camera angles are great and fun to watch.
