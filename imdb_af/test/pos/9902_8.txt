"Check Out" is a very witty and honest representation of a bizarre Jewish family. Judaism plays virtually no role in the film, but American Jewish culture and behavior is being sent up ... it is a loving way. I wish the movie addressed the religious perspective on the topics it was investigating, because I think it would have been interesting. <br /> <br /> I've never been a Columbo fan, so I wasn't familiar with Peter Falk - he's fun to watch. It's great to see Judge Reinhold, Laura San Giacomo and David Paymer again - why aren't they working anymore? They are all hilarious. The writing is great with many unforgettable one-liners that I will certainly use to use with my own family. Look for Gavin McLeod (Captain Stubing!) As the doorman.
