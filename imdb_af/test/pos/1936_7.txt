This relic of the days of the Production Code and the Hays office is nice, not big, but entertaining. <br /> <br /> Based on a song by Rogers & Hart that was a huge hit at that time, the story revolved around dance hall girl Barbara Stanwyck, who was rich businessman Ricardo Cortez (carelessly handsome) is, but whose heart belongs to her neighbor neighbor Monroe Owsley. She and Owsley marry, but keep it a secret while she dismisses Cortez, who still stops hope. She helps my husband get a job at Cortez's company, but married bliss is quickly taken care of because Owsley develops a taste for the high life and steps with a college darling and gambles in a high-strike bridge (Yup! I know it's pretty funny .... Eventually he darkened $ 5,000 from Cortez and went to the lamb if his dedicated wife went to Cortez .... and I wouldn't reveal anything else, though the end was definitely a surprise. <br /> <br /> Stanwyck is the best thing about this movie; In one of her earliest roles, she is reasonably accomplished. Owsley is the weak point; He is unattractive and exciting, while Cortez is incredibly suave and sexy, while his performance is serious but unbeatable. <br /> <br /> While seemingly a drama, it is full of laughter, very inconsiderate, as some elements of this movie are very old. weak. But there are many good spiritual lines; At one point, Stanwyck says to Cortez: "My brain is in my feet, while yours is ...." That's pretty suggestive to 1931! There are many bawdy and suggestive things in this movie, in the last few days before the code clamped down and everything was limping. An amusing antique, a good reminder of how far we haven't reached 70 years. This story can easily be changed to fit in 2003, but can retain the basic plot with the original end.
