The definition of a vampire is an inhumane body that is supposed to leave its grave at night to drink the blood of the living. Bakjwiels this concept on the head minus the clich√© of pointy loops and neck bites. Being an R-rated movie, I knew it was going to be vampires that are actually vampires. That means the characters in the movie will do what vampires actually do without restraint and with legal loss no glamorous moments compared to Twilight. Having seen Chan-wook Park's former grandmother, I had very high expectations of Bakjwi. <br /> <br /> I was expecting some awkward plot sequence with our anti-hero, known as Priest Sang hyeon, and was very impressed by his performance as a holy man who was forced into this malicious human being. and obey his thirst as a vampire. (SPOILER) After surviving the defective blood transfusion, he began searching for blood and discovering his super strength and flying ability. The screenshots do its transitional phase without consulting. He begins to drink the blood of the dying and those who want to be euthanized for moral reasons. The often tragic and dysfunctional love affair that the priest has with the manipulative Tae-joo is much like they are played by The Host's Kanh-ho Song and actress OK-vin Kim. The special effects are properly placed in the background and while it does not offer anything new in the way of stunts and CGI, it has not set itself in the plot-driven and character-developed prospect. The story and turning point are very perverse and grotesque, yet very original in their own Korean style. <br /> <br /> There are not many negative things I can say about Bakjwi. Sometimes I ask myself if the transition phase of the priests showed more of the priest with an emotional crisis with his transformation, but then it would have made the movie again for 3 hours. The movie was long to start. Similarly, vampires do not have much to express emotions. As mentioned before, this movie is very tragic, so don't be hopeful to watch it. <br /> <br /> Overall, Bakjwi is wonderfully dark, morbid and original. I strongly recommend this movie for serious viewers who are beyond the teenage phase of Twilight. It is certainly the Korean response to the Swedish one that is the right one, which is also a good movie.
