I loved this movie so much. I'm a big fan of Amanda Bynes' recently ended show. I admire her (except her body) for her acting ability. She's a good actress. <br /> <br /> The movie was great. It's about a girl named Viola who wants to play football, but when her school cuts the girls' soccer team, she gets upset. Her brother goes to a sought after school and decides to leave for England. So Viola wants to make an impression by playing on the soccer team at the residence. She goes to school and tries out for the soccer team. She comes in. Meanwhile, she meets Duke who is a sensitive guy playing on the soccer team. He really likes Olivia (Laura Ramsey) who likes Sebastian. Who is really viola. Sebastian dates Monique and suspects that Sebastian is not himself. <br /> <br /> It's certainly not a chick flick and I really enjoyed it. It's so funny and sweet. I don't think I saw AManda better.
