Sometimes you are overturned by the stations late at night, bored with your mind, and want a light and gentle romantic comedy that doesn't make you feel bipolar. And this movie fits the exact bill. Sure, the plot was ripped right out of the 1930s. The writing as a skemaltzy as the Hallmark Greeting Card company's legendary poetry, and the one-dimensional characters were played by a role picked straight from Central Casting - but it was CUTE, and exactly what I needed last night. <br /> <br /> Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor have great chemistry together - I kept it at "Picket Fences" and I'm happy to say they have it more than 10 years later. Costas Mandylor, at 41, is still one of the handiest men to grab the screens since. Rudy Valentino kicked the bucket 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Bonus points to throw the funny man who was on the roller skates on the scene. I always thought he was something straight out of a Hepburn-Grant comedy. BRAVO! <br /> <br /> Some people will probably say it was the grainiest piece of cinema ever made, and I'll probably agree - but come on! It's on the Hallmark Channel. What did you expect? Just sit back, relax, eat six-ounce sticks and watch a lovely little movie with two cute people and a bottle of Zinfandel. Trust me, you will love the Schmaltz much more, and then you can go to sleep and dream about Costas Mandylor swimming in a sea of ​​temperate chocolate that gives you petit fours with minimal time fresh chocolate icing. Ylimino! I really think the evil girl was thrown with Rachel Ray, and maybe it was the nice food nerd Alton Brown like. announce instead of the creepy man with the Van Dyk beard. Shudder! <br /> <br /> That would have made me night. But hey, just watch "Just Desserts."
