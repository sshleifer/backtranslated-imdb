I don't know what exactly it is, but the movie happily sits on my shelf without thinking that I've ever left. Fulci has made one of the most ridiculous, bizzare, cheez-infected and well-unique films. I've ever seen. Not sure what to say about it, but I love this movie !!! The steak tartar scene is absolutely restless, and the whole Nazi torture orgy fiasco is strangely hilarious ... I'm not sure what Fulci is trying to do, but has heard that Fulci accuses Wes Craven of ripping him off with "Scream" ? "Cat in the Brain" is a must have for bad movie lovers everywhere ... Yes, I will definitely say this is not a "good" movie, but I assure some scenes will stay in your mind forever! It's an exercise in madness, people ... I think if I was a "serious" critic, I'd give it a 3, but on pure pleasure (again I can't really explain my love) 7 .. .. Really run out flick ...
