Chaplin goes into the trenches of World War II in this enthusiastic comedy that never obstructs the horrors of war. The rain, the mud, the explosions - all these things are present, but Chaplin seems unaware to all of them. He is in France for one thing: to fight the Germans, something he does with incredible success. <br /> <br /> It looks like Chaplin's extended ego journey - a very funny one, to the last minute when it rises to a new level of poignancy and makes sense. <br /> <br /> Perhaps that's what all the soldiers dream about before they go to war.
